0,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old started Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago and since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, covering a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When Burke was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died as the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaning off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into the driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. He was a mess and he got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.  ""Like 'How can I help? How can I move this forward? Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke — no relation to Matt — was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years, from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his life and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month ago and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing on the podcast was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example — that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died Matt was in shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said. ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does, is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at a time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person, ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recent guest on the podcast. McPhee said listening to Matt and his guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence to take his turn at the microphone. When McPhee was younger he struggled with his mental health, and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they can be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizing a traumatic story, to ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listeners walk away with is that mental health issues are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, Matt does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

1,Anonymous,2019-07-25T19:21:39.867Z,"Green Party, People's Alliance call for inquiry into firing of 2 forestry instructors","New Brunswick Green Party Leader David Coon and People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin are repeating calls for an independent inquiry into the Maritime College of Forestry Technology after it cut ties with two of its longest-serving instructors. In the beginning of July, wildlife biologist Rod Cumberland was fired for conduct the college said was damaging to its reputation. However, Cumberland and former colleague Gerry Redmond believed Cumberland's expression of his professional views on glyphosate was at the root of his dismissal. Days later, Redmond, a former director of the college who publicly defended Cumberland, was told his services teaching classes and workshops would no longer be needed. When Cumberland was fired, Coon called for the Department of Post Secondary Education, Training and Labour to make an internal inquiry into the matter, but he now says the dismissal of Redmond indicates a ""clear pattern."" ""The word purge started to come to mind simply because Mr. Redmond had come out in defence of Mr. Cumberland,"" Coon said in an interview. ""He talked about how, when he was the executive director, the kind of pressure he came under from the board of governors of the college to sanction Mr. Cumberland for speaking publicly about glyphosate."" Coon said a broader inquiry into the governance of the publicly funded college is needed. He referred to an incident in 2015, where the chief medical officer of health at the time, Dr. Eilish Cleary, was put on leave while working on a study of glyphosate and then later terminated. Coon said the fact that Redmond spoke publicly about pressures to sanction Cumberland while he was the executive director suggest it's more than an internal personnel issue. ""The message is that if those with professional expertise and that in any way are connected with government or our publicly funded institutions speak out based on their expertise and experience against the status quo around forestry practices in New Brunswick, they're at risk,"" Coon said. Coon called on Trevor Holder, the minister of post-secondary education, training and labour, to hire an independent investigator to interview staff and board members at the college and file a public government report. Austin, who has been calling on government for an independent review of the firing of Cumberland and cutting ties with Redmond for weeks, further accused the college's board Thursday of ""an apparent conflict of interest."" Austin alleges a board member who voted to fire Cumberland later applied for and was interviewed for the position. ""It seemed to go from bad to worse,"" he said. ""I don't know what they're doing over there but it sure doesn't smell right."" The college has declined to comment. The board member could not immediately be reached for comment. The Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour declined a request for an interview. ""Similar to the province's other public institutions, the Maritime College of Forest Technology is administratively independents,"" department spokesperson Sarah Bustard said in an email. ""Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the [department] to comment on a human resource matter."" If Cumberland's belief regarding glyphosate was indeed the reason for his removal, Austin contends that's ""counter-intuitive to higher learning. ""This type of dialogue should be encouraged, not abolished,"" he said in an earlier statement. He said he's concerned the college is ""being overrun by industry."" ""I understand industry has to play a part and has to have a seat at the table. That's obvious but when it's all becoming industry organized then then I think that's where we will lose the balance and we lose the accountability."" Austin said that New Brunswickers deserve answers about what's going on at the publicly funded college and that the results of any third-party investigation should be public. The college, originally called the Maritime Forest Ranger School, was established as a co-operative venture of the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia governments and forest industries, according to the college's website. Its Fredericton campus is on the grounds of the Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre, also a co-operative venture of government agencies, educational institutions and industry groups. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/david-coon-rod-cumberland-glyphosate-1.5224451,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rod-cumberland-fired-maritime-college-forest-technology-glyphosate-1.5199133 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rod-cumberland-gerald-redmond-fired-maritime-college-forest-technology-glyphosate-1.5200871 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-glyphosate-leave-1.3347020 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/eilish-cleary-fired-nb-1.3354380,N/A
2,Anonymous,2020-01-09T03:09:57.940Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan to 'step back' from royal roles, spend more time in North America","Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan say they plan ""to step back"" as senior members of the Royal Family, a stunning revelation that underscores the wish of the couple to forge a new path for the royals in the modern world. A statement issued Wednesday evening described as ""a personal message from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,"" said Harry and Meghan intend to become financially independent and to ""balance"" their time between the U.K. and North America, where the 38-year-old duchess grew up. It wasn't specific about where in North America they would go, though they recently holidayed in Canada.  ""After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,"" the couple wrote. ""We intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty the Queen."" Hours later, Buckingham Palace issued a statement in response, hinting that the first had caught some in the royal household by surprise. The statement said discussions with Harry and Meghan are still ""at an early stage."" ""We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through,"" it read. The royal pair described their new roles on their website. The site noted that the Sovereign Grant, which funds the monarchy, covers just five per cent of their official expenses, but they want to cut this financial tie.  The 35-year-old Harry is the Queen's grandson and sixth in line to the British throne. With his ginger hair and beard, he is one of the Royal Family's most recognizable and popular members and has spent his entire life in the glare of the public eye.  Before marrying Harry in 2018, the Duchess of Sussex worked as an actress. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she lived in Toronto for about seven years while shooting the dramatic TV series Suits. The royal couple has one son, Archie, who is eight months old. Although as an actress and human rights advocate the duchess was accustomed to media attention before her marriage, she has made no secret of the fact that the transition to the level of celebrity faced by the Royal Family was difficult. Last year, Harry lashed out at the British media for its treatment of his wife, accusing them of hounding her the way they did his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a 1997 car crash while trying to elude paparazzi.  ""My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother, and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,"" Harry said in the fall. The royal couple revealed their struggles with the media in an ITV documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, which followed them on their autumn tour of southern Africa. Both said they had struggled with the spotlight and that much of what was printed about them is untrue. The duchess told ITV that her British friends warned her not to marry the prince because of the intense media scrutiny that would follow in his country. But the U.S. television star said she ""naively"" dismissed the warnings, because as an American she didn't understand how the British press worked. ""I never thought this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. And that is the part that is hard to reconcile,"" Meghan said. The British media have also made much of an alleged rift between Harry and his older brother, Prince William, who is second in line to the throne. Harry and Meghan last year opted out of living at Kensington Palace in London, where William and his family live, and moved to a Frogmore Cottage at Windsor. In the ITV interview, Harry acknowledged there have been some differences between him and the 37-year-old William, although he said most of what has been printed about a rift between them has been ""created out of nothing."" ""Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it's under, inevitably stuff happens,"" he said. ""But, look, we're brothers. We'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, as I know he'll always be there for me."" Harry and Meghan did not spell out exactly what they were planning or where in North America they might live. Last year it was reported that Harry would be executive producer of a documentary on mental health with U.S. television mogul Oprah Winfrey for Apple's video streaming service. Royal biographer Penny Junor said it's possible Meghan might revive her acting career given the demand and fees she could command. ""Perhaps she'd have to be careful about what roles she'd do because she is a member of the royal family,"" Junor said. Last year was one of the hardest of Queen Elizabeth's record-breaking 67-year reign, culminating in her second son, Andrew, stepping down from royal duties over his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harry-meghan-step-back-1.5419450,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-romance-prince-harry-meghan-markle-photos-pictures-1.5117068 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-queen-elizabeth-princess-anne-1.5386675 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/royals-visit-canada-1.5405751,N/A
3,Mark Gollom,2019-07-12T08:00:00.542Z,Bombardier job cuts raise questions on impact of Buy America Act,"While Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the federal Liberal government were busy this week blaming each other for the financial woes of Bombardier, the company itself pointed its finger at another culprit. In a news release confirming it would be terminating 550 employees from its Thunder Bay, Ont., plant, the aerospace company claimed one of the challenging issues it faced was the U.S. Buy America Act. The U.S. Federal Transit Administration provides American cities with financial assistance for public transit systems, including buses, subways, and commuter rail. But in order to get that funding, 65 per cent of the steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the projects must be produced in the United States. And that will raise to 70 per cent in 2020. Because Bombardier has contracts with U.S. cities, and because of the Buy America requirement, the company said it had ""no choice"" but to move manufacturing to the U.S. and establish ""an American manufacturing footprint and supply chain."" The result, according to Bombardier, is having to cut jobs at its Canadian plant. ""The problem is, [Bombardier tries] to make it sound the reason behind the cuts is that the Americans have become more protectionist, and that's why they're losing money,"" said Ramy Elitzur, a financial analysis professor with the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. Elitzur said while U.S. protectionist measures may have had a marginal impact on Bombardier's bottom line, the more complete picture is that the company has not been very efficient, effective or agile in terms of strategy. Tyler Chamberlin, assistant professor at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management, also questioned how much Buy America was impacting business at Bombardier. ""It strikes me as a little bit convenient to have that sort of answer at this time, that it's about Buy American rules,"" he said. ""I'm certainly not aware of any deals that have been missed by Bombardier and handed to some American manufacturer.""  As for a larger impact on Canadian industry, Chamberlin said he just isn't seeing it. ""Our GDP and our export numbers aren't suffering in big ways. Can you find a case or two? Maybe you might be able to. But they're not so sizable that it's actually holding back the Canadian economy or holding back Canadian exports."" But other observers say the U.S. legislation is certainly having a significant impact on some industries in Canada. Buy America does not just apply to those in the business of selling buses or railway cars, but other U.S. government procurements including highway contracts and other infrastructure projects. ""Buy American had broader impacts than Bombardier. But its impact on Canadian exports of railway rolling stock is virtually prohibitive,"" said international trade expert Peter Clark. ""They tell us that effectively, they can't build up a good export base to the United States."" Clark agreed that companies like Bombardier that want to bid on some U.S. contracts will have to set up shop in the U.S., and that means fewer jobs in Canada. ""And the American states are pretty quick to offer incentives to move your plants to the U.S.,"" he said. Dennis Darby, CEO and president of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, of which Bombardier is a member, said Buy America is a real factor in public procurement. ""If they have a U.S. contract and the U.S. says you have to build a certain percentage in the U.S., the jobs have to go there."" Darby said it forces companies like Bombardier and New Flyer, a Winnipeg-based bus manufacturer, to do a large part of the assembly in the U.S.  ""Even though it's a Canadian company headquartered in Winnipeg almost all of the final assembly is done in the U.S,"" he said. ""So that is a problem."" Following Bombardier's announcement, Canada's premiers, gathered in Saskatoon for their annual conference, called on the federal government to take a more active role in negotiating an exemption from Buy America. Darby said part of the problem is that there are no real effective reciprocal measures that Canada can employ. ""We have no reciprocity on this with any teeth. Both Quebec and Ontario can ask for up to 20 per cent of the value of rolling stock to be Canadian-made. But that's all there is right now."" Darby said Canada should have its own reciprocal Buy Canada measures, or there should be a Buy North American agreement. ""This is one of those areas where there is not a level playing field for companies like a Bombardier or others that are in the transit business or anyone who is doing public procurement because the U.S. rules are much, much stronger.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bombardier-buy-america-job-cuts-canada-1.5206922,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/premiers-meeting-trade-climate-1.5206877 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/doug-ford-federal-government-bombardier-1.5206537,N/A
4,Anonymous,2019-06-21T08:00:00.613Z,Feeling helpless about climate change? There's lots you can do,"Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.) This week: According to a recent survey of 14,000 respondents in 14 countries, people basically fall into four groupings when it comes to tackling climate change: ""optimists,"" ""supporters,"" ""disempowered"" and ""skeptical."" The optimists and supporters generally feel they can have an impact and are doing their part to mitigate rising emissions and temperatures. The disempowered, however, think it's too late to stop the damage and feel, well, paralyzed. But Per Espen Stoknes, a psychologist who has also served as a member of Norway's parliament, has ideas about how to change that. Stoknes is the author of a 2015 book called What We Think About When We Try Not to Think About Global Warming, which focuses on the barriers that keep people from making change — and offers ideas to overcome them. Stoknes shared some of his insights with Stephanie Hogan via email. What is it about climate change that makes people feel helpless? The barrier of distance makes planetary-scale climate disruptions feel very far away. It is ... remote in terms of space, time, impacts and responsibility, except for the relatively few people who are directly hit by wildfire, floods or droughts at any time. The scale ... and the invisibility of CO2 all contribute to the feeling of helplessness and the lack of self-efficacy to contribute real change with an impact. It makes many voters give climate disruption a low priority relative to immigration, unemployment, health issues, et cetera. Does the way we talk about climate change make a difference? Language is hugely important. When communicating about climate, we should never accept the [negative] frames (doom, uncertainty, cost, sacrifice). There is no need to negate them, or repeat them or argue them in order to counter them. Rather, we can go on the offence with our own framing: that more commercial and political action is needed right away to ensure safety for society, secure our health, be prepared for what comes and realize the amazing opportunities for jobs and better lives that the shifts in clean energy will bring. What kind of action can help an individual feel more empowered? Doing something together with others is the basic remedy. Many think of psychology as individualistic and assume that a psychology of climate solutions would be about what each of us as individuals can do separately, that we only get better one by one. It is clear, however, that individual solutions are not sufficient to solving climate alone. But they do build stronger bottom-up support for policies and solutions that can. Our personal impact on others is much more valuable in giving momentum to the change of society than the number of [kilograms] of CO2 each action generates. It works like rings in water: If I see someone else that I respect taking action, then I want to as well. Enthusiasm is contagious. That is why engaging together with other people is so crucial. How do you take that action further? Organize, organize, organize. The key is to make climate disruption into a social issue by taking action together with others. Start a local chapter of Climate Citizens Lobby or 350.org and make it visible to let your neighbours, friends and colleagues see that you are taking action with solar panels on the roof, electric mobility and/or a more plant-based diet. The largest cuts in climate emissions — from solutions in agriculture to buildings to mobility — can be addressed when thousands of people start taking action together. The Drawdown.org project gives a wonderful and inspiring overview of all the solutions. This interview has been edited and condensed. This week, we launched our climate change series, In Our Backyard. If you didn't see these stories on CBCNews.ca or on social media, here's a roundup of some of our coverage: One of the complicating factors in humanity's attempts to save the environment  — by reducing carbon emissions and consumer waste, for example — is the fact that we are adding more people to the planet every year. But new figures released by the United Nations suggest that rather than grow continually, the number of humans on Earth will peak just short of 11 billion toward the end of this century. Let's highlight some good news, shall we? New York state just passed climate legislation that some observers are calling the most ambitious in the country. It includes carbon-free electricity by 2040 and net-zero emissions across the economy by 2050. In terms of influencers, they don't get much bigger than Pope Francis, the leader of more than 1.3 billion Catholics. In a meeting at the Vatican with the heads of multinational oil companies and banks last week, Francis declared a climate emergency and urged action to reduce emissions. ""Our children and grandchildren should not have to pay the cost of our generation's irresponsibility."" This is one of four personal stories featured in the CBC News interactive In Our Backyard, which looks at how climate change is affecting Canadians across the country. When Sandy Adam and his wife, Sarah, moved into their home in an area of Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T., known as ""the Point"" 25 years ago, the lot had a huge yard. It contained a large shed where Sandy stored his boats and sleds. Next door was a curling rink and, a little farther down, a warehouse. Since then, most of the yard has been eaten away by the Beaufort Sea. Sarah Adam estimated it has been moving an arm's length closer every year, and could soon claim the house itself. ""It's only about six feet from our house now,"" Sandy Adam said. The 64-year-old said it's ""getting pretty dangerous to live here anymore."" As for the curling rink and the warehouse — where they once stood, it's just water and ice. Tuktoyaktuk — or Tuk, as it's known locally — lies on a peninsula dotted with lakes. The sea has always gnawed at its coastline. But climate change, which has warmed Canada's Arctic by 2.3 C since 1948 — nearly three times the global average — has given the ocean more strength to erode the shore. Sea ice that used to restrain the ocean waves in winter no longer freezes like it used to, leaving the waves to wreak more havoc. During storms, they smash into the rocks right beside the Adams' house. To make matters worse, the sea level is rising. Meanwhile, the permafrost that once strengthened and stabilized the land is thawing and also weakening the coast. The Adams share their small prefab house on Beaufort Drive with one of their sons, his common-law wife and their six children, along with two of Sarah's brothers. Sandy not only laments his shrinking yard but also worries about the safety of his grandchildren, who like to scamper along the beach, below the boulders that were brought in to stabilize the collapsing shore. ""They're playing on the rocks and … huge boulders might fall on them,"" he said. Sarah Adam said the erosion began to speed up in 2011. ""Since then, it's been eroding two, three feet and more, some years,"" the 60-year-old said. She's been pleading and negotiating with local officials for the last two or three years to move their house. ""There's not going to be any time left soon enough,"" she said. ""We'll be in the water."" Sandy would prefer to find a way to stabilize the homes on his street so they don't have to be moved. He has lived on this side of Tuk all his life and loves the view. ""What I'm going to miss the most is the ocean,"" he said. ""Every morning I check to see if anything is going by my house, like whales or seals travelling. I can see boats coming in from out hunting and it's amazing."" Some other homes on Beaufort Drive have been relocated farther inland. But no one has confirmed when the Adams' home will be rescued from its seemingly inevitable drift into the ocean. The local authorities ""come and check [the house],"" said Sarah.

5,David Common,2019-05-29T09:07:54.601Z,'We are going to send this back': Malaysia returning unwanted Canadian plastic,"UPDATE: This story was updated on May 29, 2019, to include new information about what the Malaysian government plans to do with the Canadian container. Read on for details. Malaysia is denouncing Canada's ""irresponsible"" export of plastic waste, becoming the second Asian nation to make plans to ship Canadian trash back across the ocean. On Tuesday, Malaysian officials opened a shipping container filled with plastic bags from major Canadian chains, as well as product packaging stamped with ""Made in Canada"" labels from recognizable brands. ""I think you need to take back your rubbish,"" Malaysian Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin told a CBC News crew at Port Klang, a sprawling facility outside Kuala Lumpur. Authorities did not identify which company exported the plastic from Canada. But they said it will be returned to that exporter after it was deemed to be too contaminated and of insufficient value for legitimate recyclers in Malaysia to take it in. Watch the latest on the situation from CBC News in Malaysia: It's not known if the plastic in Malaysia came from a municipal recycling program, but shipping waste halfway around the world and back is not likely what Canadians think of when they drop plastic for recycling into their blue bin. ""I hope this will make Canadians angry as well,"" the environment minister said. ""This is the irresponsible export of plastic, of waste. It's household garbage, it smells bad."" Malaysian officials said Wednesday they will first try to have the importer in Malaysia pay the cost of shipping the container back to Canada. They're still not naming the exporter, citing an ongoing investigation. If that fails, officials said they would try to demand Ottawa pay to return the waste. Failing that, the next step would be to have Canada pay to have it sent to a landfill or incinerated in Malaysia.  Malaysia, which is cracking down on incoming waste from several countries, said it hopes to have the waste issue resolved within the next few weeks. Malaysia's move comes amid an outcry in the Philippines over containers of fetid waste that have been stuck there for years. Dozens of containers filled with contaminated plastic and other waste are set to leave the Philippines bound for Canada this week after a diplomatic brouhaha over the rubbish, which was sent abroad by a Canadian company in 2013 and 2014. The years-old issue came to light again recently when President Rodrigo Duterte lashed out over the garbage, saying in late April that the garbage was going back to Canada — with or without help from authorities in Ottawa. The Philippines issued bombastic complaints about Ottawa delaying the return of the container, and eventually moved to recall its envoys to Canada. With the departure of the containers now imminent, Filipino Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin Jr. had some choice words about the issue on Twitter. ALL CONTAINERS CONTAINING GARBAGE CLEANED AND READY TO GO. WAITING FOR A COUPLE OF DOCUMENTS AND ROUTINE PERMISSION FROM CHINA FOR TRANSSHIPMENT TO CANADA. DEPARTURE IS MAY 30. Anybody gets in the way one way or another, I will screw you dry. Don't provoke me. The story of Canada's plastic waste — first in the Philippines and now in Malaysia — has travelled across Asia. More than 100 journalists were present when Malaysian authorities opened the Canadian container, along with containers from the U.S., China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. ""We are going to send this back to Canada,"" Malaysia's environment minister told CBC News. ""We really hope the people of Canada will demand better tracking and monitoring of your waste recycling.""  CBC's team in Malaysia found plastic bags and packaging from several Canadian grocery giants, including Loblaws, No Frills, Walmart and Costco. The bin also held product packaging from bread and meat companies, like Dempster's and Schneiders. It's not known how these items ended up with the waste sent to Malaysia, which has just 50 licensed plastic recyclers. Those licensed operators are allowed to import containers full of plastic from countries like Canada, and are required to adhere to specific environmental regulations.  But the government estimates there are likely hundreds of other operators — some remote and illegal, others existing under the cover of a legitimate licence holder — that are potentially operating outside the rules.  While some plastic is broken down into pellets for re-use, local authorities have said those ""under the radar"" operators are known to dump, bury and burn less valuable plastics. Enormous piles of dust-like plastic residue is left to contaminate groundwater, and often leaves a haze over certain regions of the country. It's a long way from what many consumers in Canada likely expect when they take their blue box to the curb. Plastic recycling is a multi-billion dollar global business. Only certain higher-value plastics are in demand in North America for recycling, and the United States has much of the capacity. For years, China was the destination of choice for plastic waste, taking in virtually any consumer or industrial product for recycling. But contaminated imports, worsening air pollution and a shifting economy prompted Chinese authorities to abruptly ban imports of plastic for recycling in 2017. Brokers in the developed world, including in Canada, struggled to find new markets to send the plastic from millions of blue boxes. For many months, it was piled high in Canadian warehouses or incinerated. Then Chinese operators shifted their businesses to neighbouring countries, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. They joined existing recyclers in once again welcoming the developed world's plastic. Canadians recycle just 11 per cent of all the plastics we use — much of it sent far away to be recycled, or otherwise. That has prompted some groups in Canada to call for a reduction in the use of plastics, rather than a reliance on recycling. Especially as the nations where the developed world sends some of its plastic to be recycled are increasingly closing the door.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/we-are-going-to-send-this-back-malaysia-returning-unwanted-canadian-plastic-1.5152274,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/philippines-garbage-canada-1.5149645 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/plastic-waste-grocery-stores-recycling-1.4969379,N/A
6,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-15T01:31:33.697Z,RCMP set up checkpoint restricting access in Wet'suwet'en territory amid clash over pipeline,"The RCMP have blocked access to a First Nation's territory in northern B.C., heightening tensions as government officials and hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en continue to clash over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.  The Mounties have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.  Meanwhile, the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs continue to assert their own laws — saying they want Coastal GasLink and the RCMP off the territory.  ""Being restricted on your own territory is against our law. We've always had free access to our entire territory,"" hereditary chief Na'moks said. The pipeline by Calgary-based TC Energy is meant to move natural gas from northeastern B.C. to the coast, where a liquefied natural gas plant is scheduled for construction. On Monday, B.C. Premier John Horgan said the project will proceed, that Coastal GasLink has all the necessary permits to build its pipeline, and that ""the rule of law needs to prevail"" — citing a B.C. Supreme Court decision that in December granted the company an injunction for unimpeded access to work sites.  Work in the area has been temporarily suspended with the exception, under an agreement with the chiefs, of some winterizing.  On Tuesday, the company released a letter from president David Pfeiffer offering to meet Na'moks on Friday. But the chiefs have said they only want to talk government-to-government with Ottawa and the province. Among the outstanding issues for Coastal GasLink is that the Morice Forest Service Road, which is subject to the injunction, remains impassable.  The RCMP said in a news release on Monday that the checkpoint is ""to mitigate safety concerns [and] … allow emergency service access to the area.""  It said the hereditary chiefs, elected government officials, journalists and people delivering supplies to the area will be allowed to travel through the checkpoint with permission from the operations commander. It said other people not listed may be allowed to move through the checkpoint, with approval.  The chiefs say access is being restricted, and that the new checkpoint came as a surprise.  Communication continues between the province and the chiefs through a separate process that started last year and isn't specific to any particular project.  Speaking to reporters on Monday, Horgan said those discussions need to continue and described the Wet'suwet'en as ""leaders in issues around self government and self determination and rights and title in Canada.""  The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs were part of a landmark Indigenous rights and title case at the Supreme Court of Canada, along with their Gitxsan neighbours. The 1997 decision affirmed that the Wet'suwet'en never gave up title to their lands but the matter has never been fully resolved between governments.  Horgan didn't say where the Coastal GasLink project fits into ongoing discussions with the chiefs, except to say: ""This is a pipeline — it's an industrial project and there's so much more at stake for the people of northern British Columbia than just this project.""  That includes the 20 First Nations that have signed agreements with Coastal GasLink and stand to benefit from the project.  Na'moks said the hereditary chiefs listened to what Horgan said on Monday and saw a contradiction between his touting of the rule of law and the First Nation's leadership in the area of rights and title. Horgan's stance ""weakens"" the province's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, he said.  ""Here we are trying to build a stronger relationship. We are a government, we'll remain a government, we are on our lands, we'll remain on our lands, and we will govern it as we see fit."" But Na'moks agreed with the premier's statement that the relationship has improved over the last year ""It is better,"" he said. ""This time last year we had guns pointed at us. So that relationship is better. Any relationship where you're not looking down the barrel of a gun is a better relationship.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-first-nation-gives-natural-gas-company-one-time-access-to-winterize-site-1.5424502 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/wet-suwet-en-coastal-gaslink-jan7-1.5417641 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-company-posts-notice-to-clear-way-1.5419257,N/A
7,Hilary Bird,2020-01-17T09:00:00.581Z,'We're done': Foster parents share horror stories about broken N.W.T. system,"From a three-year battle to get one counselling session for a sexually-abused child, to children being dropped off in the middle of the night with scabies  — four foster parents are sharing their stories of negligence and unsafe practices within the N.W.T. government's division of Child and Family Services. These stories are coming out in the wake of a damning letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the Northwest Territories to the N.W.T. Department of Health and Social Services outlining dangerous gaps in the foster care system. CBC News has asked the Department of Health and Social Services for an interview, and provided them with a list of allegations from the letter. In an emailed response, the department said they would not be in a position to respond fully until after meeting with the Foster Family Coalition. ""The minister and the department take the safety of children and their well-being very seriously,"" the response sent Thursday reads. ""The minister has reached out to the [coalition] and we are working on a meeting date."" The department was unable to discuss specific incidents due to privacy concerns, but did provide answers to several questions on a broader level. Their responses can be read in this story. CBC News cannot legally identify children in care or their foster and biological families. Any identifying details like ages and some timelines have been withheld, and the names of the foster parents who spoke to CBC have been changed. CBC was not able to independently verify each of the parents' claims. All four parents said they no longer want to take in more foster children because of their experiences. Here are their stories. Warning: This story contains content that may be disturbing to some readers. For four years, Bryan and his wife opened their home to foster children. After an incident a few months ago, Bryan says they were so disappointed in Health and Social Services that they told the department they were finished. Bryan says it was around 8 p.m. one night when he got a call from a social worker. She had three young children who needed an emergency placement after being apprehended from their parents. He says he wasn't given any information, other than the children's ages. Bryan says he raced to Walmart to get supplies like diapers and clothes while his wife waited at home for the children to arrive. ""My wife called me and said the condition of the kids was unimaginable."" When he arrived home, Bryan says he was shocked to see the children's bodies covered with sores. ""We later found out it was scabies. The three kids were totally infested,"" he says, claiming that the kids didn't get medical attention. ""They were basically just dumped on our doorstep. We were completely blindsided."" The next day Bryan called Social Services and told them his family would no longer be accepting foster children. ""We're done. We can't do this,"" he says. ""They'd burned a bridge."" Bryan's issues with the system didn't start that night. Earlier that year, he and his wife took in two children, both under the age of seven. Bryan says the children saw a counsellor, though their sessions were sporadic. One day after a session, he says his wife got an email. ""The counsellor had emailed my wife to say, 'Something really weird, strange happened in counselling today.'"" One of the children had apparently made a sexual comment, Bryan says. ""In her email, the counsellor said she didn't think much of it until she saw the other child do the same thing. ""She thought it was something the department should follow up on and told my wife that she would be putting forward a recommendation for an investigation,"" Bryan says. He says weeks went by and Social Services didn't start an investigation. Bryan says he sent multiple emails to the department, MLAs and even met with the assistant deputy minister for Health and Social Services to demand an investigation be conducted.  He says he was told by the department that ""there's no evidence,"" and therefore the counsellor's recommendation didn't warrant an investigation. ""I was shocked, appalled, that the recommendation of a counsellor that there should be an investigation was flat out refused."" One weekend, Sarah was in Edmonton when she says she got a call from her husband that their teenage foster daughter had gone missing. Her husband called the Health and Social Services emergency line.  ""They said: 'Nope, don't call us. You need to call the RCMP,'"" Sarah says. When he called the RCMP, Sarah says her husband was told it has to be Health and Social Services who makes a missing persons report, because the government is the child's legal guardian. ""It literally was phone tag between the RCMP and Health and Social Services,"" Sarah says.  After several hours, Sarah says she made a plea to the police. ""We pretty much said to the RCMP you have to do something because Social Services is not helping us."" Her foster daughter went missing Thursday or Friday night, says Sarah. ""It wasn't until Sunday night that the RCMP said [to Social Services], 'We're gonna put a missing report out publicly.' That's when [Social Services] started looking for her, actively involving themselves in the case."" Sarah says she and her husband stayed up all of Sunday night worrying, waiting for the girl to come home. On Monday morning, Sarah says she called the RCMP for an update and to give them a piece of information to help with the search. ""[The RCMP] said, 'Oh we don't need that, she's been found.'"" Sarah says she later found out the girl had been found on Sunday and placed in another foster home by Social Services. She was outraged. ""We were her foster family for nine months and you couldn't call us to tell us she was found?"" Sarah says.  Sarah says during a meeting with herself and a social worker, the girl disclosed that she had spent the weekend at the home of a man in his 30's who supplied her and a friend with alcohol. The girl told them the man's name and address. Sarah says she later called the police to report the information but was told it had to come from Social Services because the government was the girl's legal guardian. Over the coming weeks, Sarah says she pleaded with the department to disclose the information to police.  Eleven months later, she says she finally got a meeting with a supervisor in the department. Sarah says she laid out what had happened and the supervisor said she would look into it and follow up with Sarah.  That meeting was four months ago. Sarah says she's heard nothing since. Sitting in her small two-bedroom Yellowknife apartment, Lisa tries to rock her infant foster daughter to sleep. It's 9 p.m. and she speaks in a hushed tone. Her other foster child is asleep in a room down the hall. Lisa is a single woman who has been fostering children for two years while working two jobs. She says two of the 10 foster children she's taken care of were placed back with their biological families without her knowledge.  The first child put in Lisa's care also became her longest placement. She began taking care of him when he was an infant. He returned to his biological family a few months ago when he was two years old. ""[He's] my baby boy. [He] will always be my baby boy,"" Lisa says. Throughout his short life, the young boy has had a host of health issues. Lisa averaged one night a week in the emergency room with him. She would often leave the hospital in the morning and head straight to work. But she says she truly lost faith in the system at one of the child's medical appointments.  Lisa says the medical professional told her he would no longer be treating the boy as he was returning to his biological family. The medical professional said a social worker told him this news. No one from Social Services had told Lisa.  The same thing, Lisa says, happened with her next foster child. She says she went to pick up the child, a toddler, from daycare and one of the workers mentioned the boy's apparent upcoming sleepover with his biological father — a sleepover Lisa says her social worker didn't tell her about.  When they did tell her, they said the child would be going for a one-night sleepover with his biological father on a Thursday night. On Friday morning, Lisa says she got a text from Social Services that the boy would be staying for the weekend.  Come Sunday night, Lisa says she had heard nothing from social workers about when the boy would be returning to her. ""Sunday evening, no kid. No information. Monday morning, nothing,"" Lisa says. Lisa says she contacted the same daycare worker to see if they'd heard anything. The daycare worker told her the biological father had been granted custody of his son — a fact that would be confirmed by Lisa's social worker days later. Pam has been a foster parent to dozens of kids over the last 20 years, some of whom she has ended up adopting. A few years ago, a severely traumatized girl was placed in her care. She was told the young girl had been sexually abused twice and had seen her biological father be violent toward her biological mother multiple times. The young girl showed extreme anxiety and obsessive behaviours while in Pam's home. Pam says shortly after the girl arrived, she made it her mission to get her counselling. She says she could never have imagined how hard she would have to fight. After three years of getting nowhere with calls and emails to Social Services, Pam took a different approach. ""I taped one of her nightmares and I showed it to a counsellor. The next thing you know, I got her in for counselling."" But the high demand for counselling in the territory means the girl's appointments aren't consistent. She is supposed to see a counsellor once a week. Pam says the girl has only had one session since June. ""I feel that If you've been pulled into care, you should see a counsellor. This is a kid who has high anxiety and high needs. These kids live horrific lives and they've seen horrible things."" Pam says it's not just access to counselling that isn't consistent. ""The social workers change so often that it's really hard to keep them up on the page, on what's what."" Since September, her foster daughter has had three different social workers.  ""I haven't even met the new one and she's been her social worker since December,"" she says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-care-nwt-family-stories-1.5429286,[],N/A
8,Anonymous,2019-11-08T20:41:22.692Z,Alphabet board investigates company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations,"The board of Google parent company Alphabet Inc. is investigating executives' handling of sexual harassment and other misconduct claims, and expects to complete its probe by early December, according to a recent court filing. CNBC first reported the investigation on Wednesday, citing unspecified materials that added that the board had retained an unnamed law firm to assist with the investigation. Alphabet's board formed a special litigation committee this spring after shareholders filed a lawsuit alleging that company directors played direct roles in covering up sexual misconduct by top executives, according to a filing in the lawsuit from last month. The committee is working with law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, the filing said. It is unclear whether Cravath or the special litigation committee have interviewed any alleged victims, witnesses or accused executives, some of whom are no longer at Alphabet. Alphabet spokeswoman Heather Dickinson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The board investigation includes looking into the behaviour of David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, who has been accused of having relationships with employees, CNBC said. Drummond has acknowledged some mistakes with a relationship he had with a colleague, but said he has not started a relationship with any co-workers since then. The shareholders who sued Alphabet leadership are awaiting the results of the internal investigation as they decide how to proceed with the case. They have called for various governance reforms at the company, including reducing executives' voting control and adding more independent directors. Adding more pressure to Alphabet, the tech giant's proposal to create a level playing field for price comparison shopping rivals to stave off fresh fines has not led to more traffic for its competitors, Europe's antitrust chief said on Thursday. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager two years ago slapped Google with a €2.4-billion ($3.5 billion Cdn) fine for favouring its own price comparison shopping service and told it to stop its anti-competitive business practices. The world's most popular internet search engine subsequently offered to allow competitors to bid for advertising space at the top of a search page, giving them the chance to compete on equal terms. The proposal does not seem to be doing the trick, Vestager said. ""We may see a show of rivals in the shopping box. We may see a pickup when it comes to clicks for merchants. But we still do not see much traffic for viable competitors when it comes to shopping comparison,"" she told a Web Summit conference. British price comparison service Foundem, whose original complaint triggered the EU case against Google, has said the company is not complying with the EU ruling and wants Vestager to launch a non-compliance case. Vestager also said she was closely monitoring Google's proposal in another case involving its Android mobile operating system for which the company was fined €4.34 billion for blocking rivals by pre-installing its Chrome browser and search app on Android smartphones and notebooks. ""So now Google will launch a choice screen where competitors can be chosen, and also as the default, with prices that are much more affordable than in the first version. It remains to be seen how this will work but we will follow it very very closely,"" she said. Google has previously said it would allow rivals to compete to be the default search engines on new Android devices in Europe, but they would have to pay for the privilege. Rivals have criticized the auction fees.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alphabet-board-investigates-sexual-misconduct-allegations-1.5353205,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-alphabet-sexual-misconduct-lawsuits-1.4974146 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-reforms-sexual-misconduct-rules-1.4897191,N/A
9,John Gushue,2020-01-11T15:04:09.363Z,Who other than John Crosbie would drop an F-bomb on Joey Smallwood while quitting his cabinet?,"When John Crosbie released his memoirs in 1997, there was a bit of a rush to read the juicy bits. My Life in Politics, which Crosbie wrote with former Globe & Mail managing editor Geoff Stevens, was stacked with them; I recall seeing a couple of people at a store when the book came out, scanning the index of names at the end with their fingers, and flicking quickly to specific pages. He did not disappoint. One of my favourite anecdotes in the book is about what went down when a young Crosbie and Clyde Wells decided they had made a devil's bargain by joining Joseph R. Smallwood's cabinet in 1966, and had had enough of what he called hare-brained industrial schemes. The final straw was the Come By Chance oil refinery, and their disgust with one John Shaheen. By May 1968, they had had enough. One Monday morning, armed with resignation letters, they marched into Smallwood's office. What did they find? Smallwood was prepared with documents of his own. ""He produced two letters and said, 'I'm dismissing you.' I said, 'Like f--k you are. Here's my letter of resignation."" Crosbie then flicked his letter at an irate Smallwood.  I believe I am safe in assuming that Clyde Wells — who would of course go on to be premier, a job that Crosbie once coveted but never attained — did not use the same kind of language. (Michael Harris, my former editor and the author of Rare Ambition, a must-read book about the history of the Crosbie family, noted that while Crosbie had the comfort of the family fortune to fall back on, it was Wells, a 30-year-old lawyer of humble origins and a young family at the time, who took the far biggest risk of standing up to Smallwood.) The anecdote always spoke to me about John Crosbie, and who he was as a person — not so much about the salty language, but about his principles. Crosbie, 88, died Friday morning. He leaves a rich, complicated legacy. Even though he never led a government, he succeeded  in multiple levels of government, and after leaving politics continued to serve in roles that included lieutenant-governor and chancellor of Memorial University.  Let's talk about his tongue, and his chin. With the first, he called it as he saw it, and was not afraid of offending people. That saucy tongue got him in trouble a lot, even in an era that was far more freewheeling than now … and much more tolerant of off-colour jokes and insulting language. That, it has to be said, was part of John Crosbie's legacy. However, I often was struck at what a walking batch of contradictions Crosbie was. He sometimes seemed to relish infuriating feminists, yet supported many of their causes (he was a pro-choice Red Tory, and there don't seem to be as many of them anymore). Cartoonists adored him. His chin was often a focus, and they loved to draw him — he was unconventional (as finance minister in 1979, he wore mukluks rather than the traditional superstition of a new pair of shoes) and provocative, and constant fodder for Canada's editorial pages. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/sealfie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#sealfie</a> boots from when John was finance minister and brought down the 1979 budget <a href=""https://twitter.com/SmilingLandFdn?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SmilingLandFdn</a> <a href=""http://t.co/DkgtYyddLo"">pic.twitter.com/DkgtYyddLo</a> Like comedians and impressionists (the key to sounding like Crosbie is the gravelly twang that comes from the back of the throat, and not  the Irish brogue that some mainlanders mistakenly adopted), cartoonists were drawn to him like nails to a magnet.  And he loved their abuse. Rather than be offended, Crosbie's staff would track down originals of cartoons. His house in Hogan's Pond, just outside St. John's, is lined with dozens of them.  I first encountered Crosbie professionally in the mid-1980s, when my first reporting job took me to Ottawa. Crosbie was one of Brian Mulroney's front bench ministers then, and a bit of a darling with the press corps; even on a dry day, Crosbie could be counted on to say something colourful, maybe even outrageous. I recall looking at the scrums around him; they always seemed to be wider than those of most of his peers. I also remember how the air in the public gallery in the House of Commons would become a little more electric when Liberal MP George Baker would rise from his seat. Baker would often be casting a barb at Crosbie, knowing full well Crosbie would fire right back at him. Even sourpuss colleagues would crack up as they enjoyed political theatre of the very best kind. Crosbie didn't back down from a fight often, but he wasn't careless with the battles he picked, either. He said it was ""fun to tangle"" with former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, whose arrogance and joie de vivre he actually admired. There was a famous exchange in February 1983, in which they not only jousted about an alleged conflict of interest, but did it with Latin — and Greek. ""There is a test which is well known and which I will not insist on but which has been used time out of mind: Quad semper, quad ubique, quad omnibus,"" said Trudeau, using the Latin phrase that essentially means something always was, was everywhere, and known by all. Crosbie didn't miss a beat. ""That's the Jesuit coming out,"" to which Trudeau could not resist an insult. ""I know that is beyond the honourable member for St. John's West."" Crosbie interrupted Trudeau with some Latin of his own: ""Res ipsa loquitor"" — a well-known legal phrase meaning ""the thing speaks for itself."" In fact, Crosbie translated it on the floor, to which Trudeau said, ""Oh, you don't have to translate it."" Trudeau then taunted Crosbie in Greek: ""Ta zoa etrekhe,"" which means ""the animals are running, before adding, in English, ""and that applies to him."" Crosbie closed the exchange — and evidently brought the house down — with the only Greek phrase he could remember. ""Andrezesthe krateousthe,"" which he translated in his memoir as ""Could ye like men be strong."" I talked with Crosbie many times over the years. My favourite interview, by far, took place in the fall of 1989, when I was a young reporter working with the Sunday Express in St. John's. I wanted to write about the fabled provincial Liberal leadership race of 1969, when Smallwood cancelled his planned retirement to run against Crosbie to replace himself. I had heard so much about it over the years, and was curious to know more. Smallwood was still alive at the time, but was unable to speak because of a stroke. (I did get to interview Smallwood once, as a Grade 8 student. Story for another time.) Crosbie was more than game to talk; the question was finding time. We found a Sunday afternoon. I was staying with relatives in Ontario; he was in New Brunswick, in a hotel room with family. As he was propping his feet up, he directed a young grandchild on how to pour Poppy a drink and bring it to him. We spoke for more than an hour, as he recalled details, spun stories and cracked jokes. The episode thwarted Crosbie's ambitions to be premier, but played a major role in pushing him to the Tory side of politics. Smallwood's was a pyrrhic victory; in less than three years, the PCs were not only a functional party, but running the government. Crosbie wanted to lead (""I wanted to premier that badly!"" he wrote of why he accepted Smallwood's poisoned-chalice invitation to join cabinet in 1966), at both the provincial and federal level. It's often said Crosbie was the best premier the province never had. Listen as comedian Rick Mercer explains to CBC's The Current why John Crosbie earned such a stature in Newfoundland and Labrador for so long:  Accessible, informed and a bit of a quote machine, Crosbie was a reliable interview. Over the years, especially after his retirement, he was also just fun to talk with. As the Latin and Greek exchange above suggests, he was well educated (he was top of his class as both an undergraduate and a law student), and remarkably well read. On a number of occasions, just chatting, he'd ask about what I was reading. He seemed to read voraciously, and widely. To cast him as an ideologue with a fixed view on the world would be to misunderstand him entirely. It's worth noting that Crosbie expressed regrets about being so quick with jokes and barbs. He worried sometimes that people would not take him seriously.  Another favourite moment with Crosbie was the time we found ourselves attending a dinner theatre in Gander. The audience consisted of my family of three. He was travelling with his wife, Jane Crosbie, and an aide de camp. Believe it or not, we were the only people in the audience. We all sat together at the same table. I felt bad for the performers, who nonetheless put on a show as if the house was full. The Crosbies were entertaining that night, too. In my view, Jane Crosbie can be at least as witty as her husband. I recall him saying he needed to work at keeping up with her. At the time, John was fully advocating for his passion project: the memorial to sealers that would be built in Elliston. (It was subsequently named for him.) Even though it was the height of summer, he was wearing a sealskin vest, a garment he wore so proudly and often that it's what often comes to mind when I think about Crosbie. Listen as CBC Radio's CrossTalk remembers the life and legacy of John Crosbie:  Crosbie was legendary for many things, and one of them was an inability to make eye contact. Some people I know found it unnerving; I guess I and other journalists were accustomed to it. (I remember once scouring through a lengthy interview he gave to Anthony Germain to find a frame of Crosbie looking up. I found exactly one moment where he did so.)  At a podium, though, or in a legislature, Crosbie could give operatic performances: arms waving, head brought back, no sense whatsoever that this man once went to Dale Carnegie courses so he could speak comfortably in public settings.  Despite the lack of eye contact in conversation, Crosbie could in other circumstances be at ease. He loved to chuckle — and to tease. A barb or two about the media was par for the course. (He would often, I should note, add that his scorn was for the national press, or as he put it ""the bosses,"" whoever they were.)  This is how I will remember John Crosbie: a fiercely smart, unapologetically opinionated, deeply patriotic (for his province, especially) and ultimately warm-hearted man. He was one of a kind.  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/weekend-briefing-john-crosbie-1.5422491,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/john-crosbie-obituary-1.5413882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/john-crosbie-death-reaction-condolences-1.5421908,N/A

The event includes indoor and outdoor activities for families, all of which are free to the public. CBC Saskatchewan is proud to sponsor Waskimo 2019 Outhouse races, anyone? Regina families take in Waskimo Winter Festival Some of the activities include a bird watching field trip, cross country skiing, a mini escape room, Crokicurl, and a chance to play the popular video game Fortnite inside the Conexus Arts Centre. ""We have put together an amazing show this year,"" Jim Aho, festival organizer, told CBC Radio's The Morning Edition. There will also be a public skating oval on Wascana Lake for the first time in 16 years. ""It gives me goose bumps when I think about the young kids, there's a whole young generation that have never skated on the lake in Regina,"" said Aho. ""That is such a thrill,"" he said. ""It's by the community, for the community"" Another highlight of the festival will be the polar plunge.  The 'Freezing for a Reason' plunge is a fundraiser for Special Olympics Saskatchewan. Cst. Frank Kovacs, a member of the Regina Police Service Police Plungers, is one of the participants. He said Special Olympics Saskatchewan is an organization he holds dear because he has spent time with many of the athletes. ""Once you're around them it just makes you understand how special they really are,"" he told CBC Radio's Saskatchewan Weekend. ""To raise support and awareness for them is the least we can do."" It's the first time Kovacs will be partaking in a polar plunge, but he remembers watching others do it on TV at Wascana Lake in the 1980s. ""I thought they were crazy, and here I am doing it tomorrow.""  But this year will be a bit different than past plunges. Instead of diving into the lake, Kovacs said participants will be dropped into a lined Loraas Disposal bin filled with about five feet of water from a fire hydrant. ""We're going to be diving into some pretty cool water still,"" he said. ""I'm a little nervous, not going to lie to you."" The Waskimo Winter Festival is scheduled to start at 11AM CT. Outdoor activities are being held on Wascana Lake, while indoor events will be at the Conexus Arts Centre.

She says they've rescued a few cats but have reached their limit.  ""Just this past weekend, there were a couple of probably eight- or 10-month-old female cats that had been dropped off,"" she said. ""They were obviously well socialized house cats. They were quite happy to come approach people for help. And, you know, when we petted them, they just purred. They were obviously looking to people for help."" And they're not alone. Friends and neighbours have also taken in dozens of abandoned cats, Seidle says.  ""They keep coming and it never seems to end,"" she said. It happens so frequently, the couple have a space with a few crates and some food in their garage specifically for found cats. Debbie Nelson, director of operations with the MEOW Foundation, says it's an issue they're well aware of. Nelson says that from May through November they get many calls about it. ""Sometimes they're from the property owners who say, 'this pregnant cat just appeared on my property. I've never seen it before, and can you guys help,'"" she said. ""Or we get a lot of Calgarians who say, 'I was just out visiting on this farm and there are these little kittens running around and they don't appear to belong to anybody. Can you help us please?"""" Nelson says she has a message for anyone who chooses to abandon their cat in the wild. ""It's cruel and it's inhumane,"" she said.  ""Cats are not born survivalists. Cats have been in a city or in a home all their life they don't know how to hunt. Often they're just absolutely terrified and run."" Nelson says that when someone buys a cat, they need to be aware that they're making a 15- to 20-year commitment.  ""They can live quite a long time. And it's really important to know that, before you take on a responsibility, which may become too much for you later,"" she said.  Nelson said she wants to remind people that there are plenty of organizations in Alberta that rescue cats, help with food and offer free spay and neutering. But if someone does find an abandoned cat, they can help, too.  ""I would be the first to say that the problem is so overwhelming that, in spite of all the great rescues in Calgary, that we can't always accommodate all these requests,"" she said.  ""One of the things people can do who find these cats is they can actually try to find homes on their own. That's really a big help and takes the stress off rescue groups.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/abandoned-cats-sundre-1.5405023,[],N/A
12,Pete Evans,2018-05-29T02:22:32.893Z,BMO and CIBC-owned Simplii Financial reveal hacks of customer data,"Two Canadian banks warned Monday they have been targeted by hackers, and that the personal information of tens of thousands of customers may have been stolen — something that appeared to be confirmed in a letter to the media from someone who said they were demanding a $1-million ransom from the banks.  CIBC-owned Simplii Financial was the first to warn on Monday morning that hackers had accessed the personal and account information of more than 40,000 of the bank's customers. The bank said it received a tip over the weekend that hackers had obtained the data, and after a preliminary investigation decided to go public on Monday. ""We're taking this claim seriously and have taken action to further enhance our monitoring and security procedures,"" the bank's senior vice-president Michael Martin said in a statement. Then later Monday morning, Bank of Montreal revealed that it, too, had received a tip that ""fraudsters"" had stolen data on up to 50,000 of the bank's customers, ""and a threat was made to make it public,"" BMO spokesperson Paul Gammal said. In BMO's case, at least, the tipsters were the hackers themselves. ""We took steps immediately when the incident occurred and we are confident that exposures identified related to customer data have been closed off,"" BMO said.  Someone claiming to have the stolen data sent a letter to media outlets across Canada later in the day, threatening to sell the information to ""criminals"" if the banks do not pay a $1-million ransom by 11:59 p.m.  ""Criminals will use Simplii and BMO client informations to apply for products credit using social insurance number, date of birth and all other personnal info,"" the letter said.  The email ended with a sample of the information in question: the names, dates of birth, SIN and account balances of an Ontario man and a woman living in B.C.  The woman, who asked not to be named, confirmed when contacted by CBC News that the information in the email, which also included the answers to her three security questions, was accurate.  ""Holy shit,"" she said. ""I'm very upset about this… How could this happen?""  ""We have notified and are working with relevant authorities as we continue to assess the situation. We are proactively contacting those customers that may have been impacted and we will support and stand by them,"" BMO said.   When asked whether the hackers themselves were the ones who tipped off the bank over the weekend, Simplii did not expand on its initial statement. Michael McCarthy of Edmonton told CBC News that a fraudulent transfer for $980 was sent from his Simplii Financial account on Saturday  ""The bank said they blocked it, but it still hasn't been reversed,"" he said, adding that the bank hasn't told him when it will be corrected.  ""My biggest concern is around my personal information in someone else's hands."" McCarthy said Simplii is issuing him a new bank card, but because the company is not a bricks-and-mortar institution, they're going to mail the new card, which is expected to take four to seven days to arrive. In the meantime, he can't access his money. Cybersecurity researcher Jérôme Segura with MalwareBytes Labs says it's very unusual for hackers themselves to tip off the company, because the moment they do, whatever information they have becomes effectively worthless. ""It's probably just that they were trying to blackmail them,"" he said in an interview with CBC News. ""They had access to a certain amount of data, probably showed proof that they had this data, and most likely were trying to blackmail the banks [by] saying, 'We're going to release this or else we can work something out,'"" he said. David Masson, the country manager for Canada at cyberdefence firm Darktrace, said it's reasonable to suspect that the fraudsters were the same group at both banks. Based on what he's seen, Masson said, he suspects the attack was likely what's known as a ""spear phishing"" attack. Unlike a so-called phishing attack, which targets people indiscriminately in the hope that someone will fall into the trap, a spear phishing attack is more closely targeted at individuals, using techniques to make them hand over crucial data. ""They'll even pick people inside banks and financial institutions and aim their attack at them,"" he said. ""Even if you get 99 per cent to be smart, it only takes one."" In its statement Monday, BMO said the fraudsters appear to have been operating outside Canada. It's unclear where Simplii came up with the 40,000 figure, as that number represents a tiny fraction of the roughly two million customers the bank inherited when CIBC took over Simplii — at the time known as President's Choice Financial — from Loblaws last fall. Simplii said its investigation is continuing, and it will continue to notify affected clients ""through all channels"" if it is determined they have been compromised. ""We feel that it is important to inform clients so that they can also take additional steps to safeguard their information,"" Martin said. ""If a client is a victim of fraud because of this issue, we will return 100 per cent of the money lost from the affected bank account,"" the release said. There is no indication that other CIBC customers are affected, Simplii said. Later in the day, other major Canadian banks told CBC News that they were not affected by whatever hit the two banks, with Royal Bank, TD and Scotiabank all saying there is no indication that any of their customers have been affected. Fraud and security intelligence expert Amanda Holden at software firm SAS said Canadian banks, on the whole, do a much better job than some other industries when it comes to preventing fraud, because they deal with it far more often. ""Banks are particularly cautious on this, because they have a financial risk,"" she said in an interview. ""They're a huge target, because the criminals want money."" Holden said that most often a bank's first warning of fraud often comes from consumers who notice suspicious activity and report it. Only then do the banks see any trends and identify common points of a breach, such as individual stores. The hacks revealed Monday are different, because, at least in BMO's case, it's the hackers themselves who tipped the bank off. Banks are caught in a tough spot on this issue, Holden said, because they are pulled between two competing forces: they want to make it easier to use technology to bank with them, but they don't want to open themselves up to more fraud. ""They're still doing work to figure out how to protect the front doors,"" she said.

13,Murray Brewster,2019-10-08T16:20:40.724Z,Canada's failure to repatriate former ISIS fighters and families leading to 'inevitable' crisis: experts,"Canada and other Western countries that have failed to repatriate citizens who fought for the Islamic State and now are detained in northern Syria, may soon face an even deeper conundrum about what to do about them, experts warned Monday. The Trump administration has signalled it is prepared to stand aside in the event of a Turkish invasion of the region, which would be aimed at dislodging the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), a U.S. ally in the war against ISIS. Stark criticism from Republicans in Congress forced U.S. President Donald Trump to temper earlier tweets by saying he would stop Turkey from going too far with an incursion, but the gyrations have created turmoil among policymakers and allies. Since the fall of ISIS, the Syrian Democratic Forces, led by the YPG, have been holding approximately 11,000 ISIS detainees, including 2,000 foreign fighters, in more than two dozen camps. There are as many as 32 Canadians (six men, nine women and 17 children)  in two camps in northeastern Syria, according to research by Amarnath Amarasingam, an assistant professor at Queen's University's school of religion, which was published in Policy Options magazine last summer. In the face of a Turkish military offensive, they could soon be free. ""Something like this was bound to happen,"" said Michael Nesbitt, a senior fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. ""There was always a risk something like this would happen and if we didn't take action [to repatriate them] national security could be put at risk...I'd be worried about the Canadians, where they end up."" Over the weekend, the Kurds indicated they will pull military forces away from detention facilities and refugee camps in order to fight Turkish forces, said John Dunford, a Syrian expert at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. Over the last year, there have been four documented cases of detained ISIS fighters organizing riots or small-scale escape attempts at camps in Syria and northern Iraq.  Dunford said these incidents were not co-ordinated or sophisticated, but that may be about to change, because ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has ordered his followers to step up efforts to free those who've been captured. ""There is concern given the vulnerability of some of these facilities,"" Dunford said. ""Some of them are literally schoolhouses that have been converted. Even just the threat of a Turkish offensive into northern Syria, we could see an abandonment of those facilities."" The consensus among defence and security experts is that the Kurds would let the prisoners go, leaving detainees and their families free to either return home, or rejoin the insurgency. Dunford said, in his estimation, getting back into the fight is the most likely scenario for prisoners who could be released. Some former Canadian ISIS fighters and their families have indicated they want to return home, but the Liberal government has said it's too difficult and northern Syria is too dangerous for Foreign Affairs staff. ""Canada has been unwilling,""said Nesbitt, who noted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointedly called on Canada at the end of August to take back its citizens detained in Syria. ""We don't have a political party that has said it would deal proactively with these fighters. Usually, it's leave them there — or some such policy. And now, we're seeing the repercussions of that."" The fate of former Canadian ISIS militants and their families has been the subject of heated debate on the floor of the House of Commons and Conservatives have been fundraising off the notion, accusing the Liberals of welcoming home jihadist fighters. Nesbitt wouldn't comment on the politics, but said the result of policy inaction has boiled down to this: ""Who knows where they are going to go? At the very least, we no longer have control over them."" Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said earlier this year as many 60 foreign fighters have returned to Canada, but only a small number of them had travelled to Syria, Iraq and Turkey.  Most, he said, had travelled elsewhere. It has been suggested that gathering evidence overseas to prosecute them — at least to a standard acceptable to Canadian courts — would be difficult. ""I simply do not know what our rationale has been in following this course,"" Nesbitt said. Much of the political narrative in Washington on Monday revolved around the notion that the withdrawal of U.S. forces was a betrayal of the Kurds, who were seen as being among the most capable fighters against ISIS. But Ben Friedman, the policy director of Defense Priorities, another Washington-based strategic institute, said the policy of extracting the U.S. from the Syrian civil war is not wrong, but the execution has been horrible. ""My view is that we have the right end in wanting to withdraw,"" Friedman said during a conference call with reporters, ""but we have completely bolloxed up the means of doing that."" The Trump White House signalled early last winter that it wanted out of Syria and Friedman said the time in between should have been used to prepare the Kurds for that eventuality. Canada restricted its operations against the Islamic State to Iraq and never ventured into Syria.

14,Stu Mills,2020-01-24T16:23:06.170Z,Convent's closure marks end of an era,"A nearly 100-year-old convent is set to close in Pembroke, Ont., at the end of this month. The Sisters of St. Joseph has been operating on the shore of the Ottawa River since 1921, when the congregation began farming a 5.4-hectare plot of sloping land on what was then Pembroke's outskirts. The acreage was once home to 80 nuns who trained, operated a Catholic mission and worked as teachers, nurses and caregivers for the elderly in several Ottawa Valley communities. They also welcomed in seniors who couldn't afford the cost of conventional homes or find housing elsewhere in Pembroke. Now, with the property expected to be sold by the end of this month, the eight remaining sisters, all in their mid-80s, say it truly is the end of an era. In 1953, the Sisters of St. Joseph opened a new convent on the original site. The congregation peaked in the 1970s when about 80 nuns dined, prayed, slept and operated a well-equipped infirmary there. Though Sister Lucy Germain wasn't raised in a particularly religious family, she surprised them all when she knocked on the convent doors one September morning. Sister Lucy was welcomed into the fold and began training, but only lasted until the following February. ""The honeymoon was over,"" she laughed, looking back. ""I guess it was lonesomeness."" Germain spent two years at teachers college where, she confesses, she danced, went to parties and dated boys, including one who was very disappointed when she dropped him and everything else to return to the convent. ""It's such a mystery, but it really is a call, and I believe if it's your place, that's what God wants. And, after that, I never hesitated,"" she said. ""Whether we lived here permanently or were living elsewhere, this was our home."" The 55,000-square-foot red brick building includes a pool, a cafeteria, dozens of apartments and of course a chapel. Colliers Real Estate is pitching the $2.2-million listing as an ideal site for a private school, a nursing home or a development opportunity. The sisters say they expect a deal to be reached with one of several prospective buyers by the end of the month. In the open sitting room where the nuns spent their evenings watching the Ottawa Senators and Netflix on a modern flat-screen TV, Sister Betty Berrigan, 85, discovered one of the convent's many upright pianos is sliding out of tune. ""Oh, I don't think you'd better put that on television!"" she laughed. Sister Betty entered the convent at 18. ""I had a wonderful boyfriend at one time and he didn't like the idea, but anyway I had to stay the course,"" she shrugged. ""It's been a very happy life for me. I've been in the right place and I know it."" In 1964, the Sisters of St. Joseph opened a mission in Peru that continues to operate today. The sale of the convent will allow the eight remaining sisters, who have ostensibly spent most of their lives living below the poverty line, to move to a comfortable retirement residence across town. They have already begun labelling furniture with pieces of tape so that what little property they own can follow them to their new home in mid-February. ""But we maintain, too, that this life will go on,"" said Sister Loretta Rice, who entered the convent at age 23 and will turn 85 in June. ""Not here in Pembroke, but in other places and in other countries.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/pembroke-convent-closure-nuns-1.5426518,[],N/A
15,Bob Keating,2019-08-22T20:28:03.978Z,"With no residents or roads, Jumbo doesn't deserve municipality status, says Rossland's council","One town in the Kootenays wants another to cease to exist and they've written the province to get it done. Jumbo resort municipality was created in 2013 by the Liberal government of B.C. to help get the year-round Jumbo Glacier Resort built west of Invermere.  But almost three decades after it was first proposed, Jumbo only exists on paper with no residents, infrastructure or planned start date.  ""On behalf of the City of Rossland's council, I am writing to you to express our support for dissolving the Jumbo Glacier Resort Municipality,"" wrote Rossland Mayor Kathy Moore in a letter to the NDP government. ""They had the court ruling that recently said no significant progress had been made so they had to start over again with their environmental assessment,"" Moore said. ""So it just seemed to me and our council here in Rossland this is a perfect opportunity to look at this project and see if it makes sense. From our perspective it doesn't.""   Jumbo has an appointed mayor and one councillor who used to hold regular meetings to help facilitate building the resort with the developers. But in 2015, former environment minister Mary Polak ruled that the developer had not substantially started the project by the time the environmental assessment was set to expire.  The developers appealed that decision, but the B.C. Court of Appeal recently ruled Pollack's ruling should stand.  Moore and the rest of Rossland's council say it's ridiculous that a stalled project high in the bush still has municipality status. ""Municipalities are there to serve their residents and serve their taxpayers, right? There are no residents in this, there is an appointed mayor and council and they get money from the government and, to me, that doesn't make any sense.""  Moore wants Environment Minister George Heyman to revoke Jumbo's municipal status. But Greg Deck, the appointed mayor of Jumbo, says that's not necessary. Deck says the developer is deciding whether to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. ""It was a two-to-one decision on the most recent B.C. Court of Appeal ruling and my understanding is the proponent is strongly considering asking leave to appear before the Supreme Court of Canada."" Deck says his two-person council is in limbo while the developer decides how to proceed.  He said they are returning most of the government grant money they receive as a municipality.  Deck says after almost three decades the province owes it to the developer to let the process play out.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/jumbo-kootenay-dissolve-rossland-moore-deck-1.5256158,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/controversial-jumbo-municipality-to-be-created-in-b-c-1.1332017 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/jumbo-valley-ski-resort-court-decision-1.5238273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/jumbo-s-back-developer-asks-court-to-resurrect-decades-old-ski-resort-project-1.4713016,N/A
16,Nancy Russell,2020-01-20T21:13:40.914Z,Admission rules could be changing for French schools on P.E.I.,"P.E.I.'s French Language School Board is considering changes to its admission policy after a significant growth in enrolments has put a strain on the Island's six French-language schools.  The French language student population on P.E.I. has surpassed 1,000, an increase of 22 per cent over the past five years, according to La Commission scolaire de langue française. That increase has brought some challenges, including financial ones, as schools try to provide resources for students who haven't acquired the language yet. In a news release following its monthly meeting, the board said it was revising its admission policy to ""better delineate access to non-rights holding parents."" Non-rights holding parents include immigrant parents, and others, who don't have a constitutional right to a French-language education under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Currently, those parents can apply for their children to attend a French-language school on P.E.I. ""Non-rights holders, if they they want to get in a French school, they have to go through an evaluation for that child,"" said Gilles Benoit, chair of the board. ""We are looking at that right now because we want to make sure if we open the door to more non-right holders, that we have the proper tools to evaluate those students to make sure they will have success in a French school."" The parents and students who are non-rights holders are supposed to be interviewed, to see if the parents can support the child and if the child can speak French, but the board said that wasn't always happening. ""We also have a situation where there's a lot more of immigrant students entering, that want to enter our school,"" Benoit said. ""Because they have the right to choose between French and English, so sometimes they don't have neither one of them and they want to choose French education. So we want to make sure that we will be able to accommodate them."" Benoit said some English students may qualify to attend a French-language school because they went through a daycare centre and can speak French, but he said that's not a very significant number.  The board estimated that non-rights holders make up two to three per cent of the current student population. ""If we are to open our schools to non-right holders, they will have to demonstrate that they are able to to communicate, to read and write in French,"" Benoit said. ""Because we want to make sure if we accept some students that they will succeed in their education. We don't want to have those students fail."" The board said there will also be changes for rights-holding families who are applying for a French-language school on P.E.I.  They will need to provide evidence of their French-language qualifications, proving that either their parents or grandparents are francophone or attended a French-language school. The revised policy will have its third reading during the board's March 10 meeting. The French Language School Board has set a goal of 1,500 students by 2026-27. The president of the Fédération des parents de l'Île-du-Prince-Édouard, Melissa MacDonald, said she was a ""bit surprised"" by the news from the board.  She said these are important decisions that need to be discussed with school administrators, and hopes that administrators from every school will be involved in a decision that will affect them all.

17,Jean Laroche,2020-01-17T10:00:00.622Z,"For every toll paid at the Cobequid Pass, private lenders have pocketed half","Two years ago today, senior officials from Nova Scotia's Department of Transportation faced questions from the legislature's public accounts committee about the province's only toll highway, the Cobequid Pass. They called it ""a very good success story,"" a model project for so-called private-public partnerships in Canada. They assured the committee the debt incurred by the $124-million project would be paid off by April 1, 2020. After that the tolls could be removed, the committee was told unequivocally. Last week, Transportation Minister Lloyd Hines upended that commitment when he said tolls will remain in place for at least another year in order to pay for new projects along the 45-kilometre stretch of Highway 104 through northern Nova Scotia. But what is arguably the province's smoothest and best-maintained section of highway has come at a steep price. Of the $348 million in tolls motorists have paid since it opened on Nov. 15, 1997, roughly half — $167 million — hasn't even gone to paying construction costs or maintenance. It has instead been gobbled up by interest payments to the private investors who bankrolled part of the project, according to a senior manager in the Department of Transportation who briefed the CBC this week on condition they not be identified. According to the contract signed between the province and investors in the 1990s, backers were guaranteed a roughly 10 percent per year return, and that interest was compounded every six months. The Liberal government of John Savage authorized the Cobequid Pass construction through a controversial public-private partnership as a way to get a twinned highway built quickly, without further adding to the province's debt. ""Adding to the provincial debt was not an option for this project,"" transportation officials noted in a 1996 report. At the time, the bypass was seen as a solution to dealing with a dangerous two-lane road through the Wentworth Valley, a section recognized by Reader's Digest as one of the worst highways in Canada and dubbed ""Death Valley"" by locals due to dozens of fatal accidents. The Nova Scotia and federal governments each contributed $27.5 million toward construction. A Crown agency, the Highway 104 Western Alignment Corporation, was created to come up with the remaining funds to design, build and administer the toll highway. Private investors contributed a total of $66.4 million to the project. Nova Scotia's then-auditor general, Roy Salmon, examined the project, still in its infancy, in his 1996 annual report. He concluded it would have been ""significantly"" cheaper for the province to simply borrow the money itself, rather than having private investors foot the bill. Financial projections that approximately $151 million from tolls would be returned to the province, over the life of the 30-year contract, also never materialized. Instead, all the money collected has gone to paying down the principal and interest, and to upkeep, improvements and running toll operations, including paying the roughly 60 full-time, part-time and contract employees who work for the Highway 104 Corporation. Taxpayers have also chipped in almost $30 million to compensate for toll increases that were outlined in the contract but never implemented, and for discounts offered to frequent users. So far, $35 million of the original debt has been repaid. Although, as predicted by officials two years ago, there is now more than enough money in reserve accounts to wipe out the Highway 104 Corporation's debt (and to pay a roughly $10-million penalty for doing so before the 2026 expiry of the province's obligation to pay back private lenders), the plan now is to instead use some of that money for highway improvements. This week, a senior staffer in the Transportation Department revealed there is no longer a definitive timeline for paying off the debt and eliminating the toll. Hines told reporters a week ago the province is planning to build a pull-off for motorists who need a break, and a ""satellite maintenance area"" to station road crews and plows about midway along the Cobequid Pass. He said he wanted those projects built before the province took over the highway and became responsible for its capital improvements and maintenance costs. For PC MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin, the decision is steeped in ""government greed"" rather than need. ""The legislation clearly states when the debt is paid the tolls are to be removed,"" she said. ""The debt could be paid today and the tolls should be removed. ""It's an unfair tax on the people that live north of the Cobequid Pass, including my residents and citizens in Cumberland North."" Despite warnings by the auditor general in 1996 that the province scrutinize more closely the ""costs and benefits"" of public-private partnerships, the Savage government defended the deal unequivocally. ""The government is confident that all facets of this public-private partnership are sound, supportable and conceived in the best interests of Nova Scotia,"" transportation officials wrote in their official response to the auditor general's observations. That optimistic view reigns today in the minister currently responsible for the department. In an email to CBC, Hines noted: ""Behind the cost of the Cobequid Pass are lives that have been saved by having a safer piece of infrastructure in place for motorists. ""A highway that has reduced highway fatalities in the area can be considered a success."" As for the price paid to borrow from private investors, the minister concludes: ""Any infrastructure that we build, whether built traditionally or as a P3 model, has interest and a cost of borrowing. ""Even as a traditional build, a highway would have significant interest costs because of the rate of borrowing at that time.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,N/A
18,Anonymous,2019-11-30T12:00:00.543Z,Evidence of mass Irish grave site unearthed during REM light-rail dig,"During work on a future light-rail station in Pointe-Saint-Charles, archeologists have discovered what could be the bones of Irish immigrants who died after fleeing the Great Famine more than a century-and-a-half ago. The dig site is a stone's throw from the Black Rock — a  three-metre-tall boulder that, erected in 1859, marks the site where some 6,000 people are buried. Workers on the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) are digging a hole to to install a concrete support pillar for its trains. As part of the survey, they sent in a team of archeologists who discovered the bones of 12 to 15 people. Archeologists were lowered by crane into the ground and have been working to excavate the remains by hand. In 1847 some 6,000 Irish famine refugees died of typhus in Pointe-Saint-Charles. It's believed they were buried in a mass grave. ""We made sure that the work here would be done with respect,"" said Elizabeth Boivin, the REM's deputy director of environment. Wood that may be from coffins has also been unearthed in the dig. Before crews began digging in June, a ceremony was held in collaboration with the Irish community. Because the dig affects less than one per cent of the site, the project will leave many other graves undisturbed, Boivin said. Still, finding evidence of as many as 15 bodies in such a small area demonstrates just how many people are buried there — giving credence to the claim that it is the largest Irish grave site outside of Ireland, said Fergus Keyes. He has been co-leading a push for a memorial park near the site for the last decade.  ""We always knew that, in that area, 6,000 Irish were buried,"" Keyes said. ""Nobody has ever dug into that earth since the mid-1800s, as far as we know."" The hope is that lab tests will provide more information about who they were, how they lived and how they died, Keyes said. Then they'll be put back close to where they where found. ""We will re-inter them in a very nice, proper ceremony at some point near the Black Rock,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/irish-grave-site-montreal-black-rock-1.5379413,[],N/A
19,Adam Miller,2020-01-11T09:00:00.114Z,Is Canada at risk from a mysterious Chinese virus related to SARS?,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here. For Canadians who remember the face masks, quarantines and airport screenings of the SARS epidemic, a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in China likely caused by the same family of viruses may be raising concern. Since Dec. 12, 59 people have been hospitalized with viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the central Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan health officials on Saturday reported that one person has died, and seven were in critical condition. Health officials in China have reportedly identified and genetically sequenced the previously unknown virus from an infected patient in Wuhan and found remnants of it in 15 others, state-run media agency Xinhua announced Thursday. The illness has been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can make the jump from animals to humans and range from the common cold to much more serious illnesses, such as SARS or MERS. Chinese officials have traced the outbreak back to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was shut down and disinfected on Jan. 1. But it's not yet known how it made a species jump from animals to humans, or if it is transmissible from person to person. Diseases such as SARS, MERS, influenza and avian influenza have also reportedly been ruled out in tests, World Health Organization representative to China Dr. Gauden Galea said in a statement. ""According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people,"" he said. ""In the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture."" Given the fact that both SARS and the Wuhan outbreak both originated in open-air markets that sold both live and dead animals, the similar origins of the viruses are hard to ignore. ""Certainly there are some parallels, if we're thinking back to SARS,"" said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""We know that in today's world, diseases spread incredibly quickly and we don't actually even know what this is just yet."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the 2002-2003 epidemic that killed 774 worldwide. So the current outbreak is something health officials who lived through it are watching closely. ""I think given when it presented, how it presented, it certainly did raise eyebrows and serious concerns,"" Dr. Marjorie Pollack, deputy editor of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), said of the current outbreak. ""People who want to be sensationalist and want to blame are throwing stones at China, saying they're not being transparent enough.… They are being transparent with what they know. They're not being transparent for speculations."" Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. ""This went on for months before, really, the world kind of knew what was happening. And it really started to build up quite a bit of momentum before it started to disperse in different parts of the world,"" Khan said. ""We're getting this information, certainly earlier [in this outbreak], … but I still take all of the information as being preliminary at this point."" For its part, WHO said in a statement that the identification of a new coronavirus in a short period of time is a ""notable achievement"" that ""demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks."" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who herself was diagnosed with SARS in 2003, said she's encouraged by the amount of information released by China so far. ""The fact that we know about it, that we're talking about it, this is a marker of just how much better things are,"" she said. ""A challenge with SARS was when it started, we didn't know anything about it."" The Public Health Agency of Canada recently updated its website, warning travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals and to report any symptoms to health-care workers. But assessing the level of risk in Canada for an outbreak like this is largely based on two key factors: whether the virus will spread from person to person and whether health-care workers will be affected on the front lines. ""In the last 15 years, the volume of people travelling through commercial flights has doubled. We've become vectors that are moving these diseases very, very rapidly around the world,"" said Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot, which uses various types of data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world. ""We are not there yet. We are still moving too slow. If we want to get in front of these threats, we are literally going to have to spread knowledge faster than the diseases themselves. And they move quick."" His data shows that of all the travellers projected to depart from Wuhan on commercial flights from January to March of this year, 4,000 of them are heading to Canada — and the majority to cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. ""Thirty years ago, when somebody turned up in the emergency department in hospital, you didn't have to worry about where they'd been because air travel was much less common,"" said McGeer. ""Now when somebody turns up in your emergency department, they could have been anywhere four days ago. And so SARS was us catching up with the globalization of humans."" McGeer says that while she can't guarantee there would be no risk of transmission of a virus like this in Canada if it were to spread overseas, she's confident health-care workers could do a better job of containing it than they did with SARS. It can be hard to recognize new viruses early on, she added, which is why airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and cities around Wuhan will likely be screening travellers in the meantime. But a comprehensive 234-page report into the outbreak of SARS in Canada released by Dr. David Naylor in October 2003 found WHO-ordered airport screening to be completely ineffective. More than 6.5 million travellers were screened at Canadian airports for SARS by August 2003, with 9,100 passengers isolated for further assessment by nurses or quarantine officers. None had SARS. A thermal scanner project was also piloted, with 2.4 million passengers screened and 832 requiring further assessment. None of them were found to have SARS either. So it's likely not a virus that will easily be detected until health-care workers can test for it based on its genetic sequencing. ""If somebody comes from Wuhan with pneumonia, and we don't know they came from Wuhan, we're not looking for it. And if it happens to be transmissible, we're not going to make the diagnosis,"" McGeer said. ""So until we have a test for it, it can be very difficult."" Khan thinks that even with the technological innovations in health care since SARS, the biggest risk related to an outbreak spreading to Canada is the fact that we're far too ""reactive."" ""We spring into action with incredible vigour during an emergency, but then forget about the emergency almost immediately after it is over,"" he said. ""The current events in Wuhan are a reminder about what happened in Toronto and around the world 17 years ago, and are foreshadowing what we will no doubt face again. Will we pay attention, and if so, for how long?""

20,Anonymous,2019-12-24T12:17:52.864Z,Nurse practitioner numbers at all-time high on P.E.I. ,"The number of nurse practitioners is at all-time high for P.E.I. — there are now about 50 working in the province.  Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced education and specialized training. They diagnose, treat, prescribe medications, order tests and can make referrals to other specialists.  ""In 2013 we had, I think, five nurse practitioners and now we've grown to 52 registered nurse practitioners and 1 nurse practitioner student,"" said the chair of the P.E.I. Nurse Practitioner Association, Chelsea Rogerson.  Nurse practitioners got off to a rough start on P.E.I. — a pilot project in O'Leary ended in 2005 after doctors refused to work with them. Almost 15 years later, the association says NPs are widely accepted and welcomed. ""We have been so welcomed by the community,"" she said. ""We have a lot to bring to the table."" Rogerson runs her own practice out of the Parkdale Medical Centre in Charlottetown, as well as in collaboration with two physicians, there are two other nurse practitioners in the same building as well as doctors and other health professionals.  ""We've seen great growth,"" she said. ""It's really improving access I think.""  Patient Gary Montgomery was on a patient registry list for a family doctor for 3 years, so when he heard about nurse practitioners he signed up. Montgomery is a cancer survivor and said he feels like he's well looked after now.  He was not familiar with nurse practitioners before he became a patient of Rogerson.  ""I found out on my own that the position was available and that [Rogerson] was taking patients,"" Montgomery said. ""There's more of a feeling of being calm, let's investigate what we're dealing with.""  The P.E.I. Nurse Practitioner Association would like to see NPs get some of the same funding doctors get to cover office costs.   Rogerson said so-called service packages are often offered to doctors to help pay for rent, staff and administration costs.  ""When nurse practitioners are hired we don't have money allocated for rent, support staff, or supplies,"" she said.  Rogerson said if NPs end up doing administration work it's not the best use of their time.  ""It just allows for the nurse practitioner to see more people,"" she said. ""So we can do the most we can with the time we have.""  She said service packages will help in efforts to recruit and retain nurse practitioners too.  She said the association is working with Health PEI on the issue.  Marion Dowling, chief nursing officer for P.E.I., said that's a union issue.  ""Their contract agreement is different, so that would be something that would have to be negotiated with the P.E.I. Nurses Union with respect to changing that,"" Dowling said.  Rogerson said when a nurse practitioner is brought into a community to replace a doctor who has left, it's not an ideal situation.  ""It leads to burn out, it leads to isolation, job dissatisfaction and then we can't retain nurse practitioners."" She said the ideal situation is to be part of a collaborative team.  Rogerson said in general things are going ""quite well,"" and P.E.I.'s nurse practitioners are providing a lot of care for Islanders.  ""As the population is aging, the need is there,"" she said.  Dr. Kris Saunders, who works with nurse practitioner Tammy Smith, said wait times have been greatly reduced for people calling for an appointment.  ""The wait time that I had was about two and a half weeks, and since Tammy's been here it's probably two and a half days or less,"" said Saunders.  Dowling said the province has received numerous requests from various communities and health centres who want nurse practitioners, and officials expect to hire more.  Dowling said NPs have really made a difference with offices that have a large number of patient files.  ""It's about adding to that team, that now there can be a nurse practitioner in that mix as well,"" Dowling said.   Dowling said they are trying to develop collaborative practices and improve. ""I do expect nurse practitioner numbers to grow, because we just continue to have more and more interest."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nurse-practitioners-health-pei-1.5407144,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lieutenant-governor-meat-pie-making-december-2019-1.5404759 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-free-christmas-dinners-dec-2019-1.5407182,N/A

22,Anonymous,2020-01-06T04:08:47.300Z,'The basic human conundrum': Why we have a love-hate relationship with technology,"When the Family Video store in Windsor, Ont., announced in December that it was shutting its doors forever, people turned up in tears, asking manager Machele Shearer where they would rent physical movies now. ""[The] last two weeks, all I've had is people coming in crying, giving us hugs, asking us like, 'What do I do now? Where do I go? I don't want to stream,'"" she said. ""And I'm like, very sad to tell them, you're not going to rent a video. Not unless you're moving to another city where there may still be a video store."" As the rise of smart technology continues in 2020 — where self-driving cars and AI assistants make even video streaming services seem old hat — things like brick-and-mortar video stores are quickly becoming obsolete. And while those changes excite some, experts say they can also make us anxious about what lies ahead, and what we're letting go of. ""I think that's the basic human conundrum: the love-hate relationship we have with all of our tools and technologies that we've developed, you know, forever,"" says Daniel H. Wilson, a robotics engineer and New York Times bestselling author. ""It's a leap of faith,"" he told Cross Country Checkup. ""Every time we get a new technology, we have to trust that we're going to do more good with it than we'll do harm."" Wilson compares today's era to the 1960s, when he says there was more optimism around technology than there is today. ""There was always … a technological solution to everything. Why eat food that comes out of the ground [and] is covered with dirt? We're going to eat pills from corporations,"" he said, giving an example. ""Now it's swung all the way back to, I'll just take my food with dirt on it, thanks. I prefer not to eat your chemicals. Maybe you don't have my best interest in mind actually."" Sanjay Khanna, director and futurist at Whitespace Legal Collab in Toronto, says that deepening anxiety about technology that we're feeling as a society could be rooted in the kinds of instability we're experiencing — from accelerating environment change to how our data and privacy is protected.  ""Constant novelty creates anxiety. If everything is new all the time, you don't know what you can count on to be stable,"" Khanna said.  ""While we talk about disruption and embracing change and all that kind of thing, what we're starting to see is that human beings and human psychology doesn't work well with this much change across as many dimensions of change as we're seeing."" Although we've designed amazing technologies like speech recognition, Wilson says we've also created addictive tools like social media, which encourage us to commodify and ""like"" things online, and turn our lives into ""bite-sized snippets"" people want to look at. That's why he calls our current era ""the age of candy."" ""Right now, [technology has] been used to give people sort of exactly what they want, which is like candy,"" he said. ""I think you just can't do that forever. That's just not what human interaction is. Even though it feels great in the moment, it doesn't pan out year after year."" As her Family Video store closes down, that's exactly what Shearer worries about.  ""It's that sense of community, it's the social aspect that is just dying out with sitting at home and flicking a button on your remote control and surfing through those [streaming] channels,"" she said. Besides renting physical movies at her store, people also came in for the staff movie recommendations, or just to talk to them about other things they'd seen, she said. As technology continues to evolve, Wilson says he hopes that the types of technology that have changed the way we interact with each other will change for the better. ""I'm really excited to see what the next generation of people will do with that,"" he said. ""I feel like the mindset of the new generation is much more in line with reality and with solving real problems …. that have been ignored for far too long.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/checkup/are-new-technologies-making-your-life-better-or-worse-1.5413309/the-basic-human-conundrum-why-we-have-a-love-hate-relationship-with-technology-1.5415828,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/data-centres-energy-consumption-1.5391269 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-s-self-driving-autopilot-system-under-scrutiny-1.5413931 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/family-video-rental-store-closing-door-1.5407620,N/A
23,Hilary Bird,2020-01-17T09:00:00.581Z,'We're done': Foster parents share horror stories about broken N.W.T. system,"From a three-year battle to get one counselling session for a sexually-abused child, to children being dropped off in the middle of the night with scabies  — four foster parents are sharing their stories of negligence and unsafe practices within the N.W.T. government's division of Child and Family Services. These stories are coming out in the wake of a damning letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the Northwest Territories to the N.W.T. Department of Health and Social Services outlining dangerous gaps in the foster care system. CBC News has asked the Department of Health and Social Services for an interview, and provided them with a list of allegations from the letter. In an emailed response, the department said they would not be in a position to respond fully until after meeting with the Foster Family Coalition. ""The minister and the department take the safety of children and their well-being very seriously,"" the response sent Thursday reads. ""The minister has reached out to the [coalition] and we are working on a meeting date."" The department was unable to discuss specific incidents due to privacy concerns, but did provide answers to several questions on a broader level. Their responses can be read in this story. CBC News cannot legally identify children in care or their foster and biological families. Any identifying details like ages and some timelines have been withheld, and the names of the foster parents who spoke to CBC have been changed. CBC was not able to independently verify each of the parents' claims. All four parents said they no longer want to take in more foster children because of their experiences. Here are their stories. Warning: This story contains content that may be disturbing to some readers. For four years, Bryan and his wife opened their home to foster children. After an incident a few months ago, Bryan says they were so disappointed in Health and Social Services that they told the department they were finished. Bryan says it was around 8 p.m. one night when he got a call from a social worker. She had three young children who needed an emergency placement after being apprehended from their parents. He says he wasn't given any information, other than the children's ages. Bryan says he raced to Walmart to get supplies like diapers and clothes while his wife waited at home for the children to arrive. ""My wife called me and said the condition of the kids was unimaginable."" When he arrived home, Bryan says he was shocked to see the children's bodies covered with sores. ""We later found out it was scabies. The three kids were totally infested,"" he says, claiming that the kids didn't get medical attention. ""They were basically just dumped on our doorstep. We were completely blindsided."" The next day Bryan called Social Services and told them his family would no longer be accepting foster children. ""We're done. We can't do this,"" he says. ""They'd burned a bridge."" Bryan's issues with the system didn't start that night. Earlier that year, he and his wife took in two children, both under the age of seven. Bryan says the children saw a counsellor, though their sessions were sporadic. One day after a session, he says his wife got an email. ""The counsellor had emailed my wife to say, 'Something really weird, strange happened in counselling today.'"" One of the children had apparently made a sexual comment, Bryan says. ""In her email, the counsellor said she didn't think much of it until she saw the other child do the same thing. ""She thought it was something the department should follow up on and told my wife that she would be putting forward a recommendation for an investigation,"" Bryan says. He says weeks went by and Social Services didn't start an investigation. Bryan says he sent multiple emails to the department, MLAs and even met with the assistant deputy minister for Health and Social Services to demand an investigation be conducted.  He says he was told by the department that ""there's no evidence,"" and therefore the counsellor's recommendation didn't warrant an investigation. ""I was shocked, appalled, that the recommendation of a counsellor that there should be an investigation was flat out refused."" One weekend, Sarah was in Edmonton when she says she got a call from her husband that their teenage foster daughter had gone missing. Her husband called the Health and Social Services emergency line.  ""They said: 'Nope, don't call us. You need to call the RCMP,'"" Sarah says. When he called the RCMP, Sarah says her husband was told it has to be Health and Social Services who makes a missing persons report, because the government is the child's legal guardian. ""It literally was phone tag between the RCMP and Health and Social Services,"" Sarah says.  After several hours, Sarah says she made a plea to the police. ""We pretty much said to the RCMP you have to do something because Social Services is not helping us."" Her foster daughter went missing Thursday or Friday night, says Sarah. ""It wasn't until Sunday night that the RCMP said [to Social Services], 'We're gonna put a missing report out publicly.' That's when [Social Services] started looking for her, actively involving themselves in the case."" Sarah says she and her husband stayed up all of Sunday night worrying, waiting for the girl to come home. On Monday morning, Sarah says she called the RCMP for an update and to give them a piece of information to help with the search. ""[The RCMP] said, 'Oh we don't need that, she's been found.'"" Sarah says she later found out the girl had been found on Sunday and placed in another foster home by Social Services. She was outraged. ""We were her foster family for nine months and you couldn't call us to tell us she was found?"" Sarah says.  Sarah says during a meeting with herself and a social worker, the girl disclosed that she had spent the weekend at the home of a man in his 30's who supplied her and a friend with alcohol. The girl told them the man's name and address. Sarah says she later called the police to report the information but was told it had to come from Social Services because the government was the girl's legal guardian. Over the coming weeks, Sarah says she pleaded with the department to disclose the information to police.  Eleven months later, she says she finally got a meeting with a supervisor in the department. Sarah says she laid out what had happened and the supervisor said she would look into it and follow up with Sarah.  That meeting was four months ago. Sarah says she's heard nothing since. Sitting in her small two-bedroom Yellowknife apartment, Lisa tries to rock her infant foster daughter to sleep. It's 9 p.m. and she speaks in a hushed tone. Her other foster child is asleep in a room down the hall. Lisa is a single woman who has been fostering children for two years while working two jobs. She says two of the 10 foster children she's taken care of were placed back with their biological families without her knowledge.  The first child put in Lisa's care also became her longest placement. She began taking care of him when he was an infant. He returned to his biological family a few months ago when he was two years old. ""[He's] my baby boy. [He] will always be my baby boy,"" Lisa says. Throughout his short life, the young boy has had a host of health issues. Lisa averaged one night a week in the emergency room with him. She would often leave the hospital in the morning and head straight to work. But she says she truly lost faith in the system at one of the child's medical appointments.  Lisa says the medical professional told her he would no longer be treating the boy as he was returning to his biological family. The medical professional said a social worker told him this news. No one from Social Services had told Lisa.  The same thing, Lisa says, happened with her next foster child. She says she went to pick up the child, a toddler, from daycare and one of the workers mentioned the boy's apparent upcoming sleepover with his biological father — a sleepover Lisa says her social worker didn't tell her about.  When they did tell her, they said the child would be going for a one-night sleepover with his biological father on a Thursday night. On Friday morning, Lisa says she got a text from Social Services that the boy would be staying for the weekend.  Come Sunday night, Lisa says she had heard nothing from social workers about when the boy would be returning to her. ""Sunday evening, no kid. No information. Monday morning, nothing,"" Lisa says. Lisa says she contacted the same daycare worker to see if they'd heard anything. The daycare worker told her the biological father had been granted custody of his son — a fact that would be confirmed by Lisa's social worker days later. Pam has been a foster parent to dozens of kids over the last 20 years, some of whom she has ended up adopting. A few years ago, a severely traumatized girl was placed in her care. She was told the young girl had been sexually abused twice and had seen her biological father be violent toward her biological mother multiple times. The young girl showed extreme anxiety and obsessive behaviours while in Pam's home. Pam says shortly after the girl arrived, she made it her mission to get her counselling. She says she could never have imagined how hard she would have to fight. After three years of getting nowhere with calls and emails to Social Services, Pam took a different approach. ""I taped one of her nightmares and I showed it to a counsellor. The next thing you know, I got her in for counselling."" But the high demand for counselling in the territory means the girl's appointments aren't consistent. She is supposed to see a counsellor once a week. Pam says the girl has only had one session since June. ""I feel that If you've been pulled into care, you should see a counsellor. This is a kid who has high anxiety and high needs. These kids live horrific lives and they've seen horrible things."" Pam says it's not just access to counselling that isn't consistent. ""The social workers change so often that it's really hard to keep them up on the page, on what's what."" Since September, her foster daughter has had three different social workers.  ""I haven't even met the new one and she's been her social worker since December,"" she says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-care-nwt-family-stories-1.5429286,[],N/A
24,Elizabeth Fraser,2019-12-20T20:33:23.258Z,Saint John hockey coach hoping to buy 4 city rinks  ,"A Saint John businessman and hockey coach has a proposal to take over some of the city's ice rinks.  The city has considered closing one of its arenas as it grapples with an expected $10-million budget shortfalls in 2021 and 2022.  ""Look at the state of our rinks,"" said Andy Bezeau, who had 22 seasons in minor hockey in both North America and Europe. ""We're at the bottom of it. Moncton rinks are very nice. Halifax. We need this for the city of Saint John, we need rinks."" He runs a hockey skills training camp and special hockey events for Bezeau Warriors Select, a hockey training school. Bezeau said he approached the city 19 months ago about buying four arenas: Charles Gorman, Hilton Belyea, Peter Murray and Stewart Hurley. He wants to set up hockey schools, men's leagues, women's leagues and children's leagues.  From there, he would get the arenas hosting more tournaments, which he said would bring in money to the city and improve the state of the local rinks.  Bezeau said Moncton and Fredericton host skating tournaments, which helps those cities pay for their arenas  ""We're way behind,"" he said. In an interview Friday, Bezeau didn't reveal a  dollar figure for his proposal. The city operates four rinks at an average cost of $199,000 a year.    In a Twitter message to CBC News, Mayor Don Darling said he is aware of Bezeau's interest in purchasing the arenas, but there has been no council decision to sell them. ""If council wanted to explore this option as part of our sustainability options, it needs to be done in an open, transparent  and disciplined way that would invite a range of options and interested parties,"" Darling said. Once data was provided and consultations happened with stakeholders, then the city could make a decision. Bezeau is remaining hopeful and said he would have enough time to takeover the rinks before 2021. A final decision on a rink closure — or the privatization of arena services — will be made early in the new year. A staff report that was released Monday that says either the Charles Gorman Arena in Millidgeville or the Hilton Belyea Arena on the lower west side could be sold — but with a condition it not be used as a rink by the new owner.  The report says the city only needs 3.5 rinks to serve its population of under 70,000 people. Right now, there are four city-owned rinks and costing the city an average of $199,000 a year to run.  The report also recommends Peter Murray Arena on Dever Road be protected because it is part of a regional recreation complex. The Stewart Hurley Arena would also be off-limits because the building is on land owned by the province. This means the city would not benefit from a real estate windfall with its sale.  Two other arenas, Lord Beaverbrook Rink and the TD Station, are larger venues operated at arm's-length.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-budget-arenas-1.5403885,[],N/A
25,Amy Smart,2019-11-19T03:14:45.662Z,Closing arguments begin in legal case over private health care in B.C.,"A lawyer arguing in favour of a two-tier health-care system in British Columbia says the government can't legally justify preventing patients from paying private doctors to alleviate their suffering sooner than the public system could provide treatment. Peter Gall began his closing arguments Monday in a decade-long constitutional challenge of the Medicare Protection Act of B.C. as lead plaintiff Dr. Brian Day, CEO of Cambie Surgical Corporation, looked on from the gallery. The case has drawn a fierce defence from those who warn a parallel public-private system would only benefit the wealthy and expanding private insurance would disproportionately impact patients who aren't considered ""profitable."" ""If you cannot provide timely service to everyone, you cannot prohibit anyone from going outside the system for private care,"" Gall told B.C. Supreme Court Justice John Steeves. It's entirely within the provincial government's constitutional purview to make policy decisions about how the public health-care system is delivered, Gall said, adding that has led to shortcomings where the government's own data shows it is failing to provide diagnostic and surgical services in a timely manner. That means patients should have the right to make their own choices, he said. ""Waiting for these services causes, at a minimum, ongoing pain, ongoing physical and mental suffering, ongoing disability and as well the possibility of additional and permanent harm, even death."" Gall dismissed fears that allowing private health services would result in a radical transformation of the public system as purely ""hypothetical,"" adding that the government could introduce strict regulations. Government lawyers aren't scheduled to begin closing arguments until next week but they say in court documents that Day's claims of four plaintiff patients having been deprived of life, liberty and security of the person under Section 7 of the charter are problematic because those protections apply to issues of justice, not health care. Rather than a constitutional challenge, the government alleges Day's case amounts to ""political theatre"" and an attempt to force change on the health-care system for the financial benefit of doctors who earn more money from wealthy patients going to private clinics. The province also says Day's lawyers have failed to establish that patients suffer harm by waiting for services. Public health care supporters, including interveners in the case, held a news conference outside the court before the final arguments kicked off Monday. ""We joined this court case because we believe in defending a public health-care system where everyone is covered, everyone is treated equally and no one goes broke paying for their care,"" Edith MacHattie, a representative for a coalition of interveners, said in a statement. The BC Health Coalition, Canadian Doctors for Medicare and the B.C. Nurses' Union are interveners in the case.  ""All this case has proven is that a private for-profit system would improve access for the healthiest and wealthiest while creating longer wait times for everybody else,"" MacHattie said. Day legally opened the Cambie Surgery Centre in 1996, saying he wanted to create more operating-room time for surgeons who couldn't get it in public hospitals and that profit was never a motive. However, the facility has been operating since 2003 in violation of provisions of the Medicare Protection Act that haven't been proclaimed into law. The case landed in B.C. Supreme Court in 2016 with support from four of Day's patients. In 2018, Health Minister Adrian Dix announced the government would begin to fine doctors $10,000 for a first offence and $20,000 for a second violation of the act if they charged patients for publicly available services. Dix said the ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach, which allowed private-clinic surgeries and diagnostic tests to continue because provisions of the law had not been enforced, would come to an end. However, Day successfully sought an injunction that prompted a B.C. Supreme Court judge to order the government not to enforce sections of the act until their validity could be established at trial, which is expected to conclude Dec. 6. Speaking outside the court Monday, Day said he's glad the case is wrapping up and is now in the hands of the judge rather than politicians. ""The system is broken. Otherwise I wouldn't be here,"" he said. ""Patients were just waiting and suffering and that's just wrong.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/closing-arguments-begin-in-legal-case-over-private-health-care-in-b-c-1.5364329,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ccpa-corporations-public-healthcare-1.5146627 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/false-creek-surgery-for-sale-bc-healthcare-1.5145540 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgery-centre-trial-1.5363013,N/A
26,Terry Pedwell,2017-02-22T23:18:49.283Z,Trudeau says beefed-up border pre-clearance bill gives Canadians extra protections,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended his government's proposed legislation to expand border preclearance at Canadian airports and other crossings Wednesday as the opposition New Democrats pushed to stop the bill in its tracks. The NDP argued the bill doesn't take into account what it called ""the climate of uncertainty at the border"" created by the Trump administration's recently adopted immigration policies. But Trudeau suggested it's better to be cleared for entry into the United States while in Canada, because travellers are protected under the Canadian charter of rights, as opposed to American laws. Bill C-23, the Preclearance Act, came up for second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Introduced by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale last June, it would replace and expand provisions of the Air Transport Preclearance Agreement signed between Canada and the United States in 2001. The two countries signed a new agreement in 2015 to expand border clearance and proponents say measures included in the bill will speed the flow of people and goods across the border. Under preclearance, travellers don't have to pass through customs in the U.S., because they've already done so before departing Canada. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers do not have peace officer status in Canada and cannot make arrests and that would not change under the proposed system. If an arrest were to be made, the U.S. officer would hold the person until a Canadian law-enforcement officer arrived. However, the bill would alter powers in at least one notable respect. Currently, someone could simply walk out of a preclearance area should they change their mind about crossing the border into the U.S. Under the new system, a U.S. border officer could ask the person to identify themselves and say why they were withdrawing. If the American officer suspected the person had violated Canadian law, the individual could be questioned further or even detained. Should the officer come to believe a Canadian law had been breached, the person would be handed over to Canadian authorities. Any U.S. preclearance activities in Canada would have to be carried out in a manner consistent with Canadian law, including the charter and the Canadian Human Rights Act. New measures would be reciprocal, meaning they would apply equally to any Canada Border Services Agency officers conducting preclearance in the U.S. Critics have concerns about the legislation, arguing that it would lead to the erosion of rights of people travelling both to the United States and Canada. The bill ""does not address Canadians' concerns about being interrogated, detained and turned back at the border based on race, religion, travel history or birthplace as a result of policies that may contravene the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,"" NDP public safety critic Matthew Dube said in putting forward a motion that could effectively kill the bill. ""What we're seeing right now is a reality where people are being discriminated against at the border,"" Dube told reporters. ""Given that reality, we have serious concerns about these new, extra powers being given to American agents."" Dube cited the example of a Vancouver man who said he was turned away from a B.C. border crossing after a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officer scoured his cellphone for recent messages. The officer suspected the man was a sex worker based on one email message, the man reportedly told Daily Xtra. On his way into a Liberal caucus meeting Wednesday, Trudeau suggested it's better to be cleared for travel while still on Canadian soil. ""If we didn't have preclearance in Canada, people would be passing customs in the United States,"" said Trudeau. ""And in the United States, American laws dominate and control the behaviour of people in border crossings. ""When you're doing preclearance in Canada, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Canadian laws are in place, so there is extra protection.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/border-preclearance-bill-trudeau-1.3994264,[],N/A
27,Anonymous,2020-01-15T18:55:53.262Z,Australian family describes the terror of dealing with bushfires ,"After saving their home from the ""terrifying infernos"" burning through parts of Australia, one family tells CBC's David Common they hope the bushfires ravaging the country serve as a wake-up call for their country — and the world. Annabel Dobson, who worked alongside her husband and son-in-law to save their hobby farm from fire, says an ""innate sense of self-protection"" kicked in as the fire approached their home on New Year's Eve in Bemboka, in a drought-stricken part of New South Wales. The family saved the home without help from fire crews, who are stretched thin as the country deals with this devastating fire season.  While her home is safe for now, Dobson says what the country is facing is ""a tragedy beyond the scale we hoped we'd ever see. ""I really hope that people wake up. We can't just pretend that someone else is going to fix this for us. We can't sit here thinking this will go away."" Tiffany Crowley Bacon, Annabel's daughter, lives with her parents, husband and young son at the farm. She said she's concerned politicians don't care enough about climate change and the increased risk it creates. Crowley Bacon and her infant son George left for Canberra right before fire hit the farm. It was too dangerous for George to be exposed to the smoke — let alone the risk the fire posed to the farm. ""I don't think that they quite care about the land, because they're not living on it,"" she said. ""I don't think it's politicians now. I think it's 40 years of inaction, 40 years of denying what's going on."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/australia-fires-family-terror-1.5427421,[],N/A
28,Gian-Paolo Mendoza,2019-10-10T16:07:28.720Z,"U.S. border guards detain Canadian woman for 5 hours, refuse entry without visa","A Vancouver woman is afraid to try to enter the United States after she was held for hours without reason and eventually denied entry at a border crossing — a situation immigration lawyers say is becoming more common. Software developer Jaklyn De Vos had planned to visit her godfather in Seattle, Wash., in April when she and her partner were brought in for questioning at the Sumas border crossing in Abbotsford, B.C. After nearly five hours, a border patrol officer told her she was denied entry and that she would need a visa — something not normally required for Canadians at land border crossings — to enter the U.S. again. With no criminal record or history of problems entering the U.S., De Vos said she can't understand why she has not been given an explanation. The denial didn't apply to her partner, but the two decided to turn around and return to Vancouver. ""I have friends and family in the states that I'd like to see, so it's definitely frustrating not to be able to do that or have any information about it,"" De Vos said. She also said nearly three hours into the ordeal, the border guards asked to see her and her partner's cellphones and wallets. ""It just seemed easier to comply,"" she said. ""It was kind of a scary situation, anyway, being detained for so long."" Lawyers say they have seen an uptick in the number of Canadians being denied entry, or even being banned from crossing into the U.S. ""There's definitely something in the water right now.… We are seeing unusual denials and unusual requests we haven't seen in years prior,"" said Mark Belanger with Border Solutions Law Group. Belanger said the easiest thing for people to do in situations similar to De Vos's is to refuse their own entry. ""That's technically a withdrawal of your request for admission, and they will release her back into Canada,"" he said, even if someone is held for questioning.  Belanger also said there are a number of options for recourse. ""You can apply for an actual visa at the U.S. consulate here in Vancouver, and at the interview for the visa, you can ask questions about your case and find out some information,"" he said. Belanger also recommended filing a complaint on TRIPS, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) traveller redress program. De Vos said that also led to a dead end. ""I just recently … noticed that my case said closed on it, but I still haven't received any letter,"" she said. A spokesperson for the CBP acknowledged the increase of ""expedited removals"" from the U.S. and said it was not due to policy changes or quotas within the department. De Vos goes to the U.S. regularly to visit friends and family and has never had trouble entering the country before, but April's ordeal has her reconsidering those plans. She has not attempted to visit the country since then. ""It's definitely hard especially being so close to the border. We like to go down to go skiing and enjoy the nature there,"" she said.

""[The response] will be needs driven on the ground,"" he said, adding that the military would not be seeking to recover costs for their services. Canada's military is arriving in Newfoundland to help the province dig out, following a monster blizzard. As many as 300 troops will be on the ground Monday to help with the clean up.<br>We <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@cbcnews</a> speak to Rear-Admiral Craig Baines on where troops will be deployed: <a href=""https://t.co/tXmBjXe945"">pic.twitter.com/tXmBjXe945</a> Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, speaking at the same news conference, said the federal government is working with the province on how to pay for other aspects of the cleanup. Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball said an emergency operations centre will open to centralize requests for help from residents. Soldiers will be available for residents who need assistance with snow clearing and other support.  He said a ""high volume of calls"" is expected. ""We just want to help people now clean up and clear out ... so emergency workers can get to them,"" Ball told CBC's radio special on the storm Sunday afternoon. Watch: For some, all that snow means fun Newfoundlanders are facing a full day of shovelling after Friday's record-setting blizzard, and there is more nasty weather to come. St. John's set a new one-day snowfall record on Friday of 76.2 cm, beating the previous record of 68.4 cm set back on April 5, 1999, according to Environment Canada. Meanwhile, 93 cm fell in Mount Pearl and 91 cm fell in Paradise.  Earlier Sunday the federal weather agency issued weather warnings and statements for much of the island, except for the west coast and northern peninsula. Central Newfoundland is under snowfall warnings and there are winter storm warnings on the south coast. Upwards of 20 to 25 cm of snow is possible, according to CBC Newfoundland meteorologist Ashley Brauweiler. For eastern Newfoundland, 10 to 15 cm is likely, with some areas seeing upwards of 20 cm. In the early morning hours Monday, that should change to drizzle for the metro area, but southern areas on the Avalon will see between 5 and 15 mm of rain, she said.  Winds could whip up to between 80 and 90 km/h overnight in eastern Newfoundland.  ""It's unbelievable when you think about it,"" Ball said of the coming second wave of snow. Municipalities throughout the area have declared states of emergency, which restrict residents' movements to allow snow-clearing operations to carry on unimpeded. Residents who are running low on supplies will have few options in St. John's, where a state of emergency will remain in effect on Monday. The city said pharmacies are not permitted to open Monday, revising its statement from earlier on Sunday regarding the state of emergency ""given the current weather conditions and the addition anticipated snowfall [Sunday] evening."" Snow-clearing contractors are permitted to carry out their work, and gas stations may open to provide emergency fuel needed for snow removal, the city said in a statement. Garbage and recycling collection will not proceed Monday, the city said.  A spokesperson for the city of St. John's said the city expects businesses to honour the state of emergency amid reports some businesses not covered under the exceptions have been opening.  She said the city can charge anyone in violation of the state of emergency order, with a penalty of up to $5,000 if convicted. Even with the easing of some restrictions, the city is still advising people to ""stay in and off city streets."" John Haggie, the province's health minister, advised residents needing prescriptions to call their local pharmacy to make sure it's open and that a refill is available. He noted, however, that any pharmacy in the province is able to dispense a prescription no matter which pharmacy it was first brought to.  Haggie also advised residents who may be concerned they are having a medical issue to call the 811 health line to get advice before calling 911 or trying to venture to a hospital.  ""The roads are not entirely safe,"" he cautioned. The Town of Paradise, 20 kilometres west of St. John's, announced Sunday that it will temporarily lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and midnight daily, effective Monday. Starting Monday, ""and until further notice,"" all businesses must close by midnight daily and no vehicles are allowed on roads between midnight and 6 a.m. to allow for snow-clearing operations, a statement from the town said. Only town snow-clearing equipment, emergency vehicles, essential workers getting to work and private snow-clearing contractors are allowed to be on the roads overnight. ""We ask all residents to stay home unless absolutely necessary,"" the statement goes on. The town of Conception Bay South, 36 kilometres west of St. John's, lifted its state of emergency at 4 p.m. Watch as neighbours in CBS stay connected through a snow maze Pharmacies in the town will be able to open immediately. A warming centre is also open at the Salvation Army church until 9 p.m. Residents were allowed to travel to pharmacies and to the warming centre before 4 p.m. The Town of Torbay also plans to lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. effective Monday. Before then, several exceptions are in place, including allowing private snow-clearing operations, the delivery of oil to homes and the movement of essential workers, among other accommodations.  Town buildings and facilities will remain closed Monday. Meanwhile, in Portugal Cove-St. Philips, a state of emergency will go back into effect at 9 p.m. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said while crews have had a lot of success and worked through the night, there's still a lot to be done.   ""There's a tremendous amount of snow on the ground,"" he told CBC News Network on Sunday morning. Watch: Snow piles up in N.L.'s record storm Breen said a series of storms has had snowplow operators working steadily since Christmas Eve and said they are getting help from Corner Brook as well as from other levels of government. Most major thoroughfares have been widened, he said, with many streets at least having ""one cut"" through them.  But the goal remains clearing roads for emergency vehicles and allowing private snow-removal contractors to service their clients so businesses can eventually reopen. ""Right now, the streets, we don't feel that they're in a condition that's suitable enough to open up the city tomorrow,"" he told the CBC radio special on Sunday afternoon. Asked about criticism that the city seemed under-prepared for the massive storm, Breen said there are three things to note: the high volume of snow, the rate at which the snow fell and the high winds, which at times reached up to 150 km/h. ""So this was a storm that would have been challenging for any operation,"" he said. The province announced that all government offices in the St. John's metro area will be closed Monday. The province's English school district has announced that all schools on the Avalon Peninsula will be closed Monday as well. Several schools on the Bonavista Peninsula will also be closed. Watch: Retired sports host reports on N.L. weather emergency Meanwhile, Memorial University has announced that its St. John's, Marine Institute and Signal Hill campuses will remain closed on Monday ""to facilitate cleanup from Friday's blizzard."" The closure includes all evening classes and activities, and the child-care centre.  The closure means access to university buildings is restricted, according to a statement from the university. ""Please do not come to campus,"" the statement said. Noreen Golfman, the university's vice president academic, has encouraged all instructors to be flexible with course work. ""This includes, but is not limited to, deadlines for submission of assignments, papers, etc., as well as attendance in classes and laboratories over the next couple of days,"" said a statement from the university. College of the North Atlantic's Ridge Road campus will also be closed Monday. Around 11:30 a.m., Newfoundland Power was reporting 2,499 customers without electricity. The utility later reported new power outages, mostly in Pleasantville to east end St. John's, Topsail, Kelligrews and Upper Gullies areas. On Saturday, Newfoundland Power reported it had reconnected about 75 per cent of customers impacted by the storm. The federal government has approved the province's request for assistance with the cleanup, including army mobilization. In a tweet, St. John's Airport said its airfield is only available for air ambulance and military aircraft and that commercial flights will not start up until at least Monday at 8 p.m. Update 3: Commercial flight ops will not resume until at least 8pm Monday, Jan. 20th.

RCMP Cpl. Jen Clarke said it appears his death was not suspicious. She said he was reported missing in the Saint John area late last summer. His body was found on Sandy Cove Beach on Sept. 8. Police are not releasing the man's name or his cause of death. Clarke said Nova Scotia RCMP would be assisting Saint John police to determine exactly what happened.  Last week, RCMP released a reconstructed image of the man's face after working with students in a forensic reconstruction workshop at the New York Academy of Art. Clarke said the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office had already been trying to identify the man with DNA analysis, and in the end the photo didn't factor into discovering who he was. However, she said investigators were impressed with the public's response to the image of the unidentified missing man and his clothing, of which police also released photos.  ""We're very appreciative of the amount of interaction we saw online — people trying to help and lending their ideas to the post, which is great,"" she said.   ""It was really overwhelming. A lot of people trying to track down the brand of pants, trying to track down boots — where they might have been purchased from, what they might have been used for, which might have helped identify the individual."" Sculptors spent a week in early January working to put faces on 3D-printed copies of skulls from the remains of 15 unidentified men found in Canada. It was is the first time the RCMP's National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains worked with artists in the program.

31,Anonymous,2020-01-15T18:02:57.714Z,"A fire, an SOS, a rescue: Man spends weeks in remote Alaska wilderness after cabin fire","Tyson Steele watched his remote cabin go up in flames, mourned the death of his dog and then spent weeks in the Alaska wilderness, bundling up in a makeshift shelter against the subzero temperatures and eating canned food — unable to reach the outside world. He knew his best chance for rescue would come from worried loved ones sending a plane to check on him. Help came about three weeks later. Steele, 30, was rescued last Thursday, apparently in good health, according to Alaska State Troopers. He was waving his arms, an SOS signal stamped in the snow that he hoped a passing plane would spot. Like other rugged areas of Alaska, a plane was his only way out, agency spokesman Ken Marsh said. Steele told troopers that on Dec. 17 or 18, flames tore through the cabin where he had been living since September. He had no snowmobile and was surrounded by deep, powdery snow. Forests, waterways and hills separated him from the road system, Marsh said.  Troopers said the fire had left Steele with no means of communication, and that the nearest community was 32 kilometres away, in tiny Skwentna. Steele said he had heard someone might be staying eight kilometres away and thought about heading in that direction if help did not come by Day 35. But he didn't have a map and had limited knowledge of the area, so he worried about falling through ice or getting disoriented and lost.  He said the fire destroyed his snowshoes, and it took him days to go about 400 metres to a frozen lake that a rescue plane could land on. ""I had a headlamp for maybe 10 or 11 days, but I only had the batteries that were in there. So, I ran out of light,"" Steele said.  The fire happened fast after a spark from his wood stove. He described his cabin as ""basically a plastic ... hut"" and said he woke to ""fiery drips of plastic coming through the roof above me."" When he went outside to get snow to stop it, he saw the roof on fire. Soon smoke was everywhere. ""There's this image that keeps coming back in my mind of a swirling flame coming sideways for my face, you know?"" he said. Steele said the worst part was losing his dog, Phil. As Steele grabbed blankets, sleeping bags and coats, he saw Phil jump off the bed and thought he escaped. But as Steele was rushing around outside, he heard the dog inside, howling, and said he became hysterical. ""I have no words for what sorrow; it was just, just a scream. Just a visceral, not angry, not sad, just, like, that's all I could express. Just scream. Felt like I tore my lung out,"" Steele said. To make things worse, he said the ammunition he'd stored inside the cabin was exploding: ""pow, pow, pow, pow, pow."" He had a two-year supply of food but had stored it next to flammable oils and greases and the bullets. A propane tank also was there. He said he couldn't extinguish the fire. Steele was able to salvage cans of food and figured he had enough for two cans a day for 30 days.  ""Last night's meal was probably one of the worst,"" he said after being rescued. ""I was leaving the burned-off stuff for the last. And last night's dinner was a can of plastic-smoked refried beans."" Steele initially slept in a snow cave but later built a tent-like shelter with tarps and scrap lumber around the burned cabin's wood stove, troopers said. Steele said at one point it was so cold he didn't want to go outside and urinated in a bucket. It froze quickly next to the stove, he said.  ""That gives you an idea. It's by no means a cozy cabin that I was able to put together,"" Steele said. ""It just took the edge off. I could still see my breath, but at least I wasn't suffering."" Troopers on Thursday conducted a welfare check after loved ones said they had not heard from Steele in weeks. He was brought to Anchorage and had food and coffee from McDonald's, Marsh wrote. Steele told troopers he planned to spend time with family in Utah.  ""They've got a dog,"" he said. ""And that would be some therapy.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-cabin-fire-helicopter-rescue-1.5377523,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/husky-rescues-hiker-anchorage-1.4732216 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-avalanche-rescue-1.5389386,N/A
32,Anonymous,2020-01-16T17:17:24.939Z,Canada calls for an independent criminal investigation into Flight PS752 crash,"Canada and its international partners are pushing for an independent criminal investigation into the destruction of the Ukrainian passenger flight in Iran last week that killed all 176 people aboard, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said this morning. The minister was in London, U.K. today to chair the first meeting of an international co-ordination and response group made up of representatives of nations that lost citizens in the crash: Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. After a day of closed-door meetings, ministers from the five nations emerged with a framework for co-operation with Iran. Watch: Champagne says the world is watching Iran Among other things, the framework calls for an ""independent criminal investigation, followed by transparent and impartial judicial proceedings,"" said Champagne. ""The world is watching,"" he added. ""There's a path for Iran to continue in the first step they've done, which is to admit full responsibility. And when you admit full responsibility, there are consequences that flow from them and full cooperation is part of that."" The international group's other demands include: The gathering at Canada House on London's Trafalgar Square began with a small ceremony of remembrance, with the five ministers each lighting a separate wick on a single candle and pausing for a moment of silence. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok attended the meeting to brief the ministers on lessons learned during his country's five-year probe of the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Investigators concluded the aircraft was shot down by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Under international law, Iran is leading the aviation investigation because the crash occurred within its borders, but there are precedents for handing that responsibility over to another country that suffered losses. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Iran is co-operating with the two Canadian Transportation Safety Board investigators on the scene, but Canada still wants official status in Iran's investigation — which would allow Canadian officials to take part in the analysis of the flight recorders' data. ""We are judging Iran every day, demand by demand. Yes, we have good first steps from Iran. But obviously, this is a long process,"" said Champagne. ""So our vision, our assessment is based on the state of facts today. We have proposed a number of things to the Iranian government."" Besides pushing Iran to compensate the victims' families, the prime minister's parliamentary secretary, Omar Alghabra, said the government also is considering offering family members of the victims a form of interim compensation while they wait for settlement of their compensation claims against Iran. ""We are actively exploring these options and we hope a decision will be made in short order,"" Alghabra said.  Watch: Champagne outlines demands from grieving nations",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-london-meeting-1.5428925,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649,N/A
33,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:59:09.204Z,China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,"Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, the head of a Chinese government expert team said Monday, as the total number of cases more than tripled and the virus spread to other cities in China. Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members, state media said. Human-to-human transmission — spread from close contact, some such as among family members — could make the virus spread more quickly and widely, if it spreads easily. The outbreak is believed to have started from people who picked it up at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China.  Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for identifying cases. Four have died. The official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported that as of 6 p.m. local time on Jan. 20, a total of 224 cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in China, including 217 confirmed cases: There are also seven suspected cases: two in Sichuan, one in Yunnan Province, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and one in Shandong Province. In a statement posted on its official Weibo social media account, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed, with pneumonia with one other suspected case. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added. If health-care workers were not exposed at the seafood market but from an encounter with a patient then that's a signal, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer.  It emphasizes the importance of standard infection prevention and control precautions, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. World Health Organization director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will convene an emergency committee on what it calls the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The committee will meet on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it. Declaring a global health emergency can bring more international attention and aid. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital, said Monday the key questions about the virus include: ""This may be more widespread in China than it was earlier believed,"" Bogoch said. Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Bogoch said informing travellers to Canada is important so if anyone coming from China comes down with a respiratory illness knows where to go and what to do to seek care.  Chinese authorities published the genetic sequence of the virus. At Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, scientists have developed a test for the virus, Tam said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035,N/A

Croweena, a female crow, came to AVC in 2016. ""She was really an exception and a very special crow,"" said AVC wildlife technician Fiep de Bie. ""You form a bond with an animal, but we always had the best for her in mind."" Croweena was a young bird when she arrived at AVC and they didn't know anything about her history. She had a big problem. She had become imprinted on humans, bonding with them rather than with her fellow crows. ""We tried to release her at some point but crow families are so intricate and intelligent,"" said de Bie. ""She was attacked in the process and, yeah, we could just barely save her."" And so Croweena became part of life at AVC. Students were introduced to Croweena and taught about habituation and imprinting and the problems associated with it for wildlife. But AVC's rehabilitation facilities are not designed for permanent residents. So de Bie began searching for a long-term home for her. It would have to be outside P.E.I., because provincial regulations prohibit the keeping of wildlife. They found a match at Hope for Wildlife in Nova Scotia, a wildlife rehabilitation and education centre in Nova Scotia. It not only had an appropriate habitat for her, but also had Tilly. Tilly was a male crow, also imprinted on humans. Discovered in 2015, there was also little known about his history. ""When we looked closely and examined Tilly he had pink toenails, so that was kind of a clue that someone had had him as a pet for quite some time,"" said Hope for Wildlife founder Hope Swinimer. ""We'd really hoped to be able to rehabilitate and release to the wild, and we actually tried, but he ended up getting injured also and now he's back with us."" Swinimer said Tilly and Croweena are learning to get along. They eat together and will share space in a warm, enclosed area of their habitat, but tend to keep to themselves so far when they are out in the more open area. But Swinimer hopes the two will work out any differences they have.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-crow-finds-home-1.5412709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mange-porcupines-hope-for-wildlife-rescue-recovery-unit-1.5410251 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/p-e-i-double-bald-eagle-release-dr-helene-van-doninck-1.4861996 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-mindful-psychology-1.5371995 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-polar-swim-charlottetown-1.5412421,N/A
35,Amy Smart,2020-01-18T21:34:10.574Z,Wet'suwet'en elder calls for dialogue as pipeline polarizes some in northern British Columbia,"A natural gas pipeline project has polarized many communities across northern British Columbia in a dispute a Wet'suwet'en elder says he hopes will be resolved through dialogue. Russell Tiljoe, 83, has long-established ties with the First Nation whose hereditary clan chiefs say the Coastal GasLink project has no authority to run through its 22,000 square kilometres of traditional territory without their consent. His own late father was one of the clan chiefs, but Tiljoe is not a hereditary chief because he said the governance system is traced through the female family line. ""I'm honestly sitting in the middle and not taking sides,"" Tiljoe said in an interview from Houston, B.C., the nearest town to a Coastal GasLink site at the centre of the dispute. Coastal GasLink is building the 670-kilometre pipeline from British Columbia's northeast to Kitimat on the coast. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but the hereditary clan chiefs who are leaders under the traditional form of governance say the project has no authority without their consent. Last year, the conflict inspired rallies across the country when RCMP enforced an injunction and arrested 14 supporters of the hereditary chiefs who blocked access to a logging road leading to the work site on Wet'suwet'en traditional territory. The B.C. Supreme Court expanded the injunction Dec. 31 and the hereditary clan chiefs responded with an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink, leading to a new standoff. Tiljoe said he hopes the dispute doesn't come down to a physical confrontation and that it can be resolved through dialogue between the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs and the provincial government, as well as between the hereditary chiefs and those who are elected to administer reserves. ""It may take a long time to be able to come to a consensus agreement, but it is there, we just have to find it,"" he said. Tiljoe said the project has created some tension in the community. Four years ago, he said he spoke in favour of considering the potential economic benefits of the project at a meeting in the feast hall, where Wet'suwet'en decisions are made under the traditional governance structure. ""Since then, there are a lot of people who will have nothing to do with me. If I'm not against it, then I'm for it, the way they see it,"" he said. The hereditary clan chiefs have made it clear they will never support the project. At the other end of the spectrum, Premier John Horgan declared this week that the provincially permitted project will be built, and the rule of law must prevail. Everyone, from the chiefs to the company and the RCMP talk about their commitment to dialogue, but so far dialogue hasn't solved the impasse. Na'moks, a spokesman for the hereditary clan chiefs who also goes by John Ridsdale, suggested that expecting full agreement within any community is unrealistic, just as it is at any other level of government. ""Why do you think there are three elected parties, do you think they all get along?"" Still, he said the number of Wet'suwet'en members who support the project is ""quite small and limited,"" compared with local opponents. Coastal GasLink says the hereditary clan chiefs have not responded to requests to meet, while Na'moks has said the chiefs will only meet with leaders in the provincial and federal governments. The project has also divided non-Indigenous neighbours of the Wet'suwet'en and local leaders are being cautious about how they talk about the project. Local MLA Doug Donaldson declined an interview request, deferring to Horgan's comments. New Democrat MP Taylor Bachrach, who represents the sprawling northwest corner of the province, including the area of dispute as well as several communities that support it, would not say if he supports the pipeline or opposes it. ""This is a really difficult and divisive issue for our communities and our region,"" he said, adding his focus is on safety and encouraging open communication. Bachrach said he's hopeful disagreements, like how RCMP operate in the area, can be resolved through negotiation. ""At the same time, there are big unanswered questions at the heart of this issue, and I don't think those larger questions are likely to be answered in the coming days."" Since Bachrach made those comments, RCMP set up a checkpoint with a stated intention to prevent the dispute on the road from escalating, but the checkpoint itself has become the subject of a complaint by the B.C. Civil Liberties Association after two people were denied entry. Gladys Atrill, the acting mayor of Smithers, a town about 45 minutes from the entrance to the logging road, said council is also not taking a position on the project, although it has a good working relationship with the hereditary chiefs whose office is their town. She said some members of the community are employed by Coastal GasLink or its contractors but couldn't say if the division of opinion lands for or against the pipeline. There are strong views on either side but also a ""milieu of people in the middle,"" and she believes the majority of people are most concerned about safety, Atrill added. ""Smithers is a diverse community. It's a huge strength in community but of course it means people see things differently."" Atrill said she hopes those directly involved in the conflict ""hold fast, be cautious,"" and remember that safety is primary. ""I would rather we take a little more time than do something we might regret,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wet-suwet-en-elder-calls-for-dialogue-as-pipeline-polarizes-some-in-northern-british-columbia-1.5432262,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-life-changing-jobs-first-nations-haisla-1.5427666 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-project-sitka-list-1.5422152 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-human-rights-commissioner-calls-on-canada-to-stop-eviction-of-wet-suwet-en-people-in-pipeline-standoff-1.5423639,N/A
36,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-20T22:45:14.158Z,Canada presses Iran to share black boxes from PS752 crash amid mixed signals from Tehran,"Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne is pressing Iran to share the black boxes from the downed Ukrainian airliner that killed 57 Canadians on Jan. 8. Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recorders for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, Champagne reached out to his counterpart today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes] be sent where [they] should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes contain the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and have information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attack that struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respected on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran.

37,Jillian S. Bell,2018-12-28T00:00:00.144Z,How my holiday home became a harrowing house of horrors,"I've inherited the blessed task of Head Cook for the holidays. This year I planned out my Christmas visit at Dad's in Prince Albert like professional coaches plan a big game.  It wasn't supposed to be difficult: get there, do the gift thing, cook a bird, eat. It turned out the patron saint of holiday karma had a few things up her sleeve for me. When we arrived at Dad's house, Dad apologised for not having washed the kitchen floor. We laughed because his kitchen was cleaner than ours.  Tradition says we do an easy supper the first night home. It ended up being a little late because the oven didn't quite heat up the way it ought to have. The sides of the lasagna got a bit dark and the middle was only warm, but we were all together. Little things like that don't ruin the festive spirit.  The day before Turkey Day, I turned on the dishwasher and went to start a load of laundry. In the basement laundry room, I heard running water. Not the running water that comes with doing laundry — the running water that comes from a garden hose.  I bolted into the other room. There was a waterfall in the middle of the basement. I flew up the stairs, the speed of my flight matched only by that of the curse words spilling from my lips.  Water was pouring out from under the dishwasher. There was a quarter inch on the kitchen floor.  I grew several extra arms. I shut off the water and ran for a mop. The mop was useless. I was still cussing.  We enlisted every towel, facecloth, handkerchief, dishrag and bath sheet in our quest to sop up Saskatchewan's newest inland lake. We considered using dogs. Of course, this was when the doorbell rang. Visiting begun. We all had our trousers rolled up and were wringing out towels somewhere in the house, but we're not monsters.  I yelled at our guest to come in and have a seat while we dealt with a small flood and would he like coffee? Visitor, bless his heart, surveyed what was happening, correctly assessed that more hands would likely cause further disaster, and sat in the living room informing the people at his next destination that there may be a ""short delay.""  In the kitchen, we were mighty engineers. We devised a dam system where the driest towels were put to work at the front of the flood while we wrung out the saturated ones into an old diaper pail. Eventually, the waters receded, we claimed victory and cleanup of towels on both floors began.  My husband, who was in the basement, summoned me. He had the look of a man who has seen things. Horrible things.  ""It's wet,"" he whispered, ""under the washing machine.""  I stared at the expanding dark spot on the concrete floor.  ""What if it's just condensation?"" I replied.  We asked Dad to take a look. He wasn't concerned. He thought he could fix it. Dad can fix anything! That's how Dads work.  I headed back upstairs to urge our Visitor that he and I should leave ""before something else happens.""  The Visit was lovely — we had cake — but eventually we had to go home. There were groceries in the car for Turkey Day and we needed to help put away clean towels.  Husband pulled me aside as soon as I took off my jacket.  ""The dryer isn't working,"" he said.  His teeth were clenched. We had ten million loads of towels to wash. He and Dad had rigged up clothes lines in the basement like a Hell's Kitchen laundry because the element in the dryer crapped out. I started to wonder if we had angered the gods. There are only so many appliances, they couldn't ALL break, right?  The next day was Turkey Day! I warmed up the oven and added an extra 25 degrees, since it hadn't heated well before. I slide the bird in to the prewarmed oven, turn the heat down and sit in the living room with a book.  About half an hour later, I looked up. Were my glasses dirty? No. Smoky haze was drifting out of the kitchen.  Uh oh.  I wish I were making this up. Smoke curled up out of the elements on the stove. I opened the oven door, releasing plumes of smoke. I threw open the back door and yanked the roaster out of the oven. After the smoke cleared, I put it back in on the second rack. A bit of smoke in the kitchen never hurt anyone, right? Dad tied the oven door closed with binder twine to ""keep the smoke in there."" Fifteen minutes later, I heard a soft ""fomp"" sound come from the kitchen. Then another. In the back of my head I knew I know this sound. As I open the oven door I remembered. It was the sound of flare-ups on the BBQ. I had made fireballs. In the oven. Out came the bird again. Open went the doors again. This time we opened the front door too for a cross-breeze. Dad brought fans up from the basement. Did I mention it was -20 C outside? At least there was a nice fire in the oven to keep us warm.  Somehow, I cooked that turkey, despite the oven having only two settings — not quite warm enough and immolate — and despite having to take it out every half hour not to baste, but to douse flames. Only the tips of its wings turned black. The options for stuffing were ""charred"" or ""gooey."" The ichor I poured out of the bottom of the roasting pan did not bode well. That we managed to have quite a lot of delicious gravy from that blackened mess speaks volumes about what my grandmother taught me about gravy. There could be something biblical happening in my hometown, but I can say this: holiday supper was actually pretty good, we laughed a lot and the kitchen floor is really, really, *really* clean.

38,Samantha Craggs,2019-12-18T21:05:33.207Z,Mulroney says she told Hamilton about LRT overruns in September 'in good faith',"Ontario's transportation minister says she told city reps in September ""in goodwill and good faith"" that Hamilton's light-rail transit system was more expensive than anticipated. Caroline Mulroney said she met twice with the mayor to make him aware LRT would be billions more than initially thought. She wanted to keep the city apprised. Hamilton mayor Fred Eisenberger defended his decision not to tell city council or the public about those meetings, because he thought the numbers were inflated and that doing so would have jeopardized the bidding process. ""The province reached out to the City of Hamilton in good faith, with goodwill and transparency,"" Mulroney told CBC News. ""We shared what we could at the time."" Mulroney came to Hamilton Monday to announce that she was cancelling the city's long-awaited LRT project. It would have run 14 kilometres from McMaster University to Eastgate Square starting in 2024. Metrolinx had already spent $165 million and bought 65 properties for it. Three consortiums were bidding to design, build, finance, operate and maintain it, and those bids were due in early 2020. Infrastructure Ontario cancelled the RFP Wednesday, and the three consortiums bidding will get ""a stipend according to their involvement."" The province says it will still give Hamilton $1 billion for ""transportation"" projects, determined by a task force. Mulroney shared a ""high-level"" document in September of what it would cost to build and operate LRT. The province won't say what third party did the estimate, but the cost then was $2.3 billion to build the system, more than double the previous $1 billion estimate. By Monday, the numbers had changed again. The new estimate for the capital cost was $2.8 billion. The province also lumped in operating and maintenance costs over 30 years to reach a total of $5.6 billion. For Eisenberger's part, he said Monday that the announcement was a shock, even though he had seen the new costs months earlier.  He didn't tell council about the September numbers because it ""would have compromised the request for proposal (RFP) process which was ongoing at that time,"" he said in a statement.  The estimates are inflated, he said Tuesday and the bidding process would have proven them wrong.  ""There's no question there are added numbers in there,"" he said. The province also asked him to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which he did not. Eisenberger also says the province provided some preliminary cost estimates late last Thursday, but didn't give the city a chance to respond before Mulroney came to Hamilton Monday to cancel LRT. Coun. Brad Clark of Ward 9 is one of several councillors who opposes LRT. Other councillors who have been conditional supporters, such as Tom Jackson from Ward 6, say they would have stopped supporting it if they'd heard the estimates. Clark says Eisenberger still should have told council about the numbers. ""There was, in my mind, an obligation to tell us."" If council had known, it could have found a strategy to save the project, he said, like asking the federal government for money. The project could have been saved in that time, he said. Chad Collins of Ward 5, one of the conditional supporters of LRT, doesn't think so. He always doubted that the Ontario PCs supported LRT. ""Most people anticipated the decision that was made on Monday last year,"" he said. ""It was in the cards."" Nrinder Nann, a Ward 3 councillor and staunch LRT supporter, says the projections Eisenberger saw weren't reliable anyway. ""We have no way of knowing how much the project was going to cost without the bid processing completing and being able to see actual numbers proposed by consortiums/companies bidding for it,"" she said. ""I do not trust the projections the province gave."" Eisenberger isn't ready to give up. The city asked the province for more information on the cost overruns, he said, and didn't get it. The project was merely cancelled. ""Hamilton is reeling from your decision to cancel Hamilton's massive LRT investment,"" he said in a Wednesday letter to Premier Doug Ford. ""This investment would have created hundreds of jobs, economic uplift, increased affordable housing, cut CO2 emissions and built a City of Hamilton ready for the future. ""Instead, millions of dollars have been wasted doing advance engineering work and preparations. Metrolinx is now one of the largest landlords in the city after acquiring dozens of properties needed for the route."" ""I thought you were a man of your word, but I was wrong. That is why I now call this a betrayal."" The mayor and Ontario NDP leader Andrea Horwath, who is also Hamilton Centre MPP, have demanded the province release the third-party report. They want to know the cost methodologies and other details.  Mulroney said the report is confidential because it contains ""proprietary information.""  As for why the province did a third-party review for Hamilton and not longer LRT projects with apparently lower construction costs, like Mississauga, Mulroney said ""proponents"" in ""the market"" sounded the alarm to her about the Hamilton project. Joseph Mancinelli, vice-president of LiUNA International, tweeted Wednesday afternoon that LiUNA ""has begun commissioning a number of studies together with our investment arm, contractors and engineering firms to investigate the $5.5 billion dollar number that the government used to cancel the @HamiltonLRT. ""We deserve answers,"" he wrote. ""We deserve the truth.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-numbers-1.5399262 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-transit-expansion-hamilton-lrt-1.5399221 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/end-of-hamilton-lrt-threatens-proposed-developments-says-business-group-1.5399192 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-mulroney-billion-1.5398363,N/A
39,Erica Johnson,2017-03-06T14:19:29.899Z,'I will do anything I can to make my goal': TD teller says customers pay price for 'unrealistic' sales targets,"Three TD Bank Group employees are speaking out about what they say is ""incredible pressure"" to squeeze profits from customers by signing them up for products and services they don't need. The longtime employees say their jobs have become similar to that of the stereotypical used car salesman, as they're pushed to upsell customers to reach rising sales revenue targets. They say there has always been a sales component to the job, but the demand to meet ""unrealistic"" quarterly goals has intensified in recent years as profits from low interest rates have dropped and banks became required — after the financial meltdown of 2008 — to keep more capital on hand to protect against a downturn in the market.  ""I'm in survival mode now,"" says a teller who has worked at TD for more than 15 years, ""because it's a choice between keeping my job and feeding my family … or doing what's right for the customer.""  Been wronged? Contact Erica and the Go Public team She and the two managers who contacted Go Public have worked more than 50 years combined at the bank. CBC has agreed to conceal their identities and location because they are worried about being fired. ""When I come into work, I have to put my ethics aside and not do what's right for the customer,"" says the teller. Documents provided to Go Public show the teller's sales revenue goals have more than tripled in the past three years. ""You don't know what it's like to go to bed at night knowing your job is now to set people up for financial failure,"" says the teller, her voice cracking. Go Public has heard from TD tellers in several Canadian cities who say they quit their jobs because the pressure to push products was so extreme. ""I was made to feel as if I was committing a huge wrong for looking out for the best interests of my customer over the interests of the bank,"" says Dalisha Dyal, who worked as a TD teller in Vancouver for four years. Another TD teller says the relentless pressure to meet sales numbers is so severe, the teller is currently on a medical leave. The three bank employees who initially contacted Go Public explained how tellers upsell customers: when a customer keys in a PIN at the teller counter, a gold star lights up on the teller's computer screen, indicating that ""Advice Opportunities Exist."" When a teller clicks on the star, products and services the customer hasn't purchased pop up, such as overdraft protection, credit card or line of credit. Each time a teller gets a customer to sign up for one of those options, it counts toward meeting their sales targets. ""Customers are prey to me,"" says the teller. ""I will do anything I can to make my [sales] goal."" TD Bank Group declined a request to be interviewed, but sent an email that disputes the allegations that products and services are sold to ill-informed customers who may not need them or realize how much they cost. ""Our expectations are that our employees should never sell a customer a product that doesn't fill a need,"" spokesperson Daria Hill wrote.   Hill said having ""metrics"" and ""goals"" is a good business strategy, but that ""we will only achieve our goals by doing the right thing for our customers.""  Hill says customers have said they want TD employees ""to know them, understand their needs, give them proactive advice and ask them about how we can best meet their financial needs.""  That explains why customer profiles are flagged for products, services and pre-approved offers, Hill says. The employees' allegations come amid reports last week of record profits for Canadian banks.  TD Bank Group reported fiscal first quarter earnings of $2.5 billion — up 14 per cent from a year ago. Revenue rose six per cent to $9.1 billion — making it the largest bank in Canada, based on assets, surpassing RBC. The TD employees say elderly customers are a common target because they've grown to trust their tellers over the years. ""There are elderly customers who have fought for us — they have an army pension,"" says the teller. ""And here I am, setting them up with all these service fees and they don't have a clue what's going on."" Both the managers sometimes work the front counter and say there's a big push by their branch manager to sign up people for overdraft protection, so sometimes clients with large balances get it, too. ""Customers pay enough in service charges,"" says one manager. ""They shouldn't have to worry ... 'What has my teller added to my profile today?'""   ""The higher-ups are also putting more pressure on us to get tellers to achieve these goals,"" says the other manager.   ""And if they don't … our job is to make sure that they understand that they're no longer right for this job.""  ""I feel bad for what they're making me do,"" she says.  When the managers expressed concerns to their branch manager and district vice-president, they say they were asked to consider whether they were still ""a good fit"" for the job.  Documents obtained by Go Public show tellers who fail to reach their sales goals are called ""underperformers"" and placed on a ""Performance Improvement Plan,"" which involves daily coaching and monitoring by managers. If sales performance doesn't improve, employees are warned ""employment could be terminated.""   In the statement from TD, Hill says ""Performance Improvement Plans are intended to support our leaders and people managers in helping employees improve their overall job performance and are intended to help employees be successful in their role.""     Pushing products on customers to maximize shareholder profits may produce short-term gains, but it's not in a bank's long-term interest, says Laurence Booth, a professor of finance at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.   ""If their [TD's] employees start looking at everybody that comes into the bank as … somebody to try to make as much money off as possible, then the result is they're going to be squeezing short-run profits,"" he says.  ""But sooner or later, these things come back to bite you.""    Booth says all banks want to be known as ""trustworthy,"" but that trust can erode quickly if a bank gets a poor reputation.   Go Public conducted a hidden camera test at five Vancouver TD branches to see what happens at the teller counter.  One teller offered to ""activate"" overdraft protection — not mentioning that there would be a fee.  She also suggested opening an account with monthly service fees of $29.95, when a ""basic chequing account"" — with fees of $3.95 — was requested.  Another TD teller put a Go Public tester in an account with fees of $14.95 — never mentioning the $3.95 account that would have met her stated needs. He also tried to sell a TD Aeroplan credit card, with annual fees of $120, and suggested the tester open two other accounts.  Tellers at three TD branches didn't try to upsell the testers.  One manager pointed out that tellers are no longer called ""customer service reps"" — an example, she says, of how far TD has shifted the focus from its customers. ""We're now called front-line advisers,"" says the teller. ""That would be funny, if it wasn't so sad.""  All three TD employees say they've considered looking for work elsewhere, but what they want most is for their employer to listen to their concerns — for the sake of its employees, and its customers.

40,Anonymous,2020-01-19T22:01:27.459Z,Extreme winter storm: Photos from eastern Newfoundland's monster blizzard,"An extreme blizzard left streets deserted across much of eastern Newfoundland, trapping some people in their homes and prompting officials to declare a state of emergency in St. John's. Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny Breen said businesses were to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow was piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday, even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to this basement apartment in the Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's a doorway that was previously blocked due to snow and high winds that hit 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carve pathways around homes in the city.  The door of this shed blew open in the Kibride neighbourhood of St. John's.  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking a single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed — with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300 Canadian Armed Forces members are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, some snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on Friday — an aptly named one too. Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],N/A
41,Mark Gollom,2020-01-10T23:51:02.134Z,How Flight PS752's black boxes may help piece together details of Iran plane crash,"While Iran continues to deny evidence cited by Canada and the U.S. that a surface-to-air missile downed Flight PS752, the Ukrainian aircraft's black boxes could provide some crucial clues around the cause of the crash. An aircraft's black boxes include two components: the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Iranian state television showed footage on Friday purportedly of the two black boxes recovered from the site outside Tehran where the Ukrainian International Airlines plane crashed shortly after takeoff, Reuters reported. The footage, posted online by state TV, showed two devices inside a wooden crate that the news report said were the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. Both black boxes are damaged, but their memory can be downloaded and examined, the report said. The wooden crate was reportedly opened at the Iran Civil Aviation Organization. WATCH: Iranian TV purportedly shows Ukraine airliner's black boxes The flight data recorder tracks measurements such as air speed, altitude, heading (bearing) and engine thrust while the cockpit voice recorder records all the communication between crew members, as well as between the crew and air traffic control, and the ambient sound in the cockpit. ""If it's an operational-type accident — operational meaning pilot issues and so on, nothing wrong with the aircraft — then the flight recorders are very, very good at telling you exactly what happened,"" said Mike Poole, a former investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada and an expert on flight recorders. ""If it's a technical problem with the aircraft, then the flight recorder is [also] very good at telling you there's a technical problem. But pinpointing it usually requires the physical wreckage."" And when it comes to figuring out whether a plane was downed by an outside force, such as a projectile, the recorders can offer some indirect evidence of that. ""If you're shot down, the signature is typically a perfectly functioning airplane and perfectly normal operations that all of a sudden stops,"" Poole said. ""That doesn't necessarily [mean] it was shot down, but it says whatever happened was instantaneous."" Of the 176 victims killed on board the Ukraine International Airlines flight, 57 were Canadian citizens and a total of 138 were ultimately bound for Canada. WATCH: 'It's a missile strike': Aviation expert on Iran plane crash On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that intelligence from multiple sources, including Canada, has indicated Flight PS752  was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air-missile, perhaps unintentionally. Iran has denied the allegations. If true, it would mean the plane met the same fate as Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, which was shot down over territory held by pro-Russia separatists in Eastern Ukraine in July 2014, killing 296 people, including one Canadian.  In its report into that crash, the Dutch Safety Board concluded the plane was downed by the detonation of a warhead launched by a surface-to-air missile system. While forensic chemical analysis on the wreckage helped make that determination, investigators also used some of the evidence gathered from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. One piece of evidence that came from the cockpit voice recorder was a 2.3 millisecond sound peak — a noise, it was concluded, that originated from outside the airplane. ""Normally, when an aircraft is hit by a projectile like that … it can even be heard, because there's a sudden decompression, and most of that is captured in the cockpit voice recorder,"" said Daniel Adjekum, an assistant professor of aviation at the University of North Dakota. Investigators also found the MH17 data recorders had stopped abruptly — and they confirmed the normal functioning of the airplane's engines and systems before the crash; no warning failures or discrepancies were recorded. Nor were there any alerts or warnings of system malfunction heard in MH17's cockpit voice recorders; communication between flight crew members gave no indication of any malfunction or emergency prior to the crash. ""This will be clues to the investigators that whatever happened was sudden — it was instantaneous in a way that their recordings were abruptly stopped,"" Adjekum said. ""Those are clues that, most likely, it was hit by a projectile."" Questions have already been raised over potential access to the black boxes of Flight PS752. Based on international aviation regulations, Iran has authority over the crash probe since it occurred in their territory. While representatives of the plane's manufacturer are often involved in the investigation of the crash and analysis of the flight recorders, in this case, the plane was manufactured by U.S.-based Boeing. But with the ongoing standoff between the U.S. and Iran, the country's aviation authority has said it would not send the black boxes to the American company.  WATCH: Flight PS752 likely hit by Iranian anti-aircraft missile (Iran has said that Ukranian officials can be present, however, as well as Canadians, albeit in a limited capacity.) Iranian state media reported on Friday that U.S., Canadian and French representatives are to travel to Tehran to attend meetings for the Iran-led investigation into the crash. ""As soon as they will arrive they will attend the meetings to investigate reasons for the crash,"" IRNA reported. It is unlikely that Iran has the technology needed to access the information from the black boxes, with officials already saying they may need to outsource the recorders to outside experts. Adjekum believes the best way forward is to get a third-party country involved — one that has relations with Iran and the U.S., as well as the technical capability to retrieve the data. ""France might be my best bet,"" he said. ""Send it out to France. [American] NTSB investigators can also travel to France, a third-party country, and they can all be there when the data … is read out. ""And it will satisfy everybody in terms of transparency and openness."" WATCH: Ukraine mourns, sends investigators to Iran In 2018, the U.S. re-imposed economic and arms-trade sanctions on Iran following the Trump administration's exit from the Iran nuclear deal. These target critical sectors of Iran's economy, such as the nation's ability to export oil, energy, shipping and shipbuilding, and financial sectors. Iran is also one of the seven mostly Muslim countries subject to a travel ban by the U.S. On Friday, the U.S. imposed more sanctions on Iran following this week's missile strikes by the Islamic Republic on U.S. bases in Iraq. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday the department will grant sanction waivers to allow Americans or anyone else to participate in the investigation of Wednesday's crash. Under U.S. sanctions law, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) must grant approval for U.S. investigators and Boeing to participate and potentially travel to Iran. WATCH: Pompeo liaising with Canadian counterpart on plane crash Boeing said Friday it was working with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ""on the necessary applications and approvals from OFAC for the appropriate export licenses."" The NTSB said late Thursday it had agreed to be an accredited representative to the investigation of the crash at Iran's invitation. ""The Treasury will issue waivers for anybody, whether its Americans or others, to help facilitate the investigation,"" Mnuchin said at a White House press conference. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also said Friday in the joint press announcement that it was ""likely that plane was shot down by an Iranian missile."" Reuters and other media reported Thursday that U.S. officials had reached that assessment based on a review of satellite data. Information provided by the U.S. will help in the investigation of the crash, Zelensky said on Friday, after a phone call with Pompeo.  Ukraine earlier said it had received data from the U.S. that would be processed by experts, without elaborating on the nature of the data or what it signified. Spoke with Ukrainian President <a href=""https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@ZelenskyyUa</a> to express my deepest condolences for the lives lost in the tragic crash of Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752. We stand with <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ukraine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Ukraine</a> and are ready to offer our support and assistance in the ongoing investigation. ""Grateful for the condolences of the American people & valuable support of the U.S. in investigating the causes of the plane crash,"" Zelensky wrote on Twitter. ""Information obtained from the U.S. will assist in the investigation."" In a separate statement, Zelensky's office said Pompeo would visit Ukraine later in January. On Friday, a Russian deputy foreign minister said that Moscow currently sees no grounds to blame Iran for the crash of the airliner near Tehran, contradicting statements by Canada and the U.S., according to local media. Sergei Ryabkov, who is one of several Russian deputy foreign ministers, called on senior world officials to refrain from public statements until more details are known, TASS media agency reported. While Russia denies the claims, Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said on Friday that it ""was very likely"" that an Iranian missile shot down Flight PS752. The EU's next steps would depend on how Tehran reacts to the results of an investigation, Blok said. Asked whether Iran should be sanctioned, Blok said that ""it depends on the Iranian reaction [to the outcome of independent analysis] on what should be the next steps.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-airliner-investigation-working-group-1.5423202 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-plane-crash-canada-access-investigation-1.5421352 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-plane-crash-1.5420398 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ukraine-missile-iran-1.5420736 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265,N/A
42,Ryan Patrick Jones,2020-01-13T22:50:04.371Z,Families of PS752 victims could go after Ukraine airline or Iran in bid for compensation ,"The family members of those killed on Flight PS752 are likely entitled to monetary compensation under international aviation law, lawyers say, but could also achieve it through a comprehensive settlement with the government of Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 using surface-to-air missiles, Iranian leaders conceded on Saturday, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Fifty-seven of those who died were Canadian citizens, while dozens of others were travelling to Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday that he expects Iran to take full responsibility for the downing of the jetliner and indicated that he would press Iran to provide compensation on behalf of the people who lost their lives. ""A full and complete investigation must be conducted,"" Trudeau said. ""Families are seeking justice and accountability and they deserve closure."" Lawyers say there are three main avenues for family members to achieve financial compensation: through civil action, through the International Court of Justice, or through international diplomacy. Vincent Genova, a Toronto lawyer who practices personal injury and aviation law, said the families of Canadian citizens and those with ties to Canada could most likely launch a civil action in a Canadian court against Ukraine International Airlines, the operator of Flight PS752. Genova said family members can make the case that the airliner was negligent and should have cancelled the flight due to the security situation in the region. ""I think most people are quite shocked that the plane was allowed to take off in what could have been a war zone and certainly a dangerous time given the the political climate in that region,"" said Genova. Just hours before the flight took off, Iran had launched a missile attack against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. and Canadian soldiers, in retaliation for the U.S. assassination of Gen. Qassem Solemeini, who was head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. On Saturday, the Iranian military said it mistook the plane for a ""hostile target"" and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed ""human error."" Watch: Trudeau's statement Saturday following Tehran's admission it shot down Flight PS752 Whether or not a Canadian court has jurisdiction over a case like this depends on the passenger's ticket and flight itinerary, according to Joe Fiorante, a Vancouver lawyer who specializes in aviation law. Fiorante said people travelling to Canada on a one-way ticket or returning to Canada on a round-trip ticket would be covered by the Montreal Convention, an international treaty to which Canada and Ukraine are signatories, but Iran is not. Under the Convention, airlines are responsible for compensating victims' families in the case of an ""accident,"" which is defined broadly and would include a missile strike, Fiorante said.  Families are entitled to provable damages up to an initial threshold of $232,000, without having to prove fault. Compensation covers, at a minimum, things like funeral expenses and lost belongings, but can be expanded to include loss of future income and other damages related to the loss of a loved one. Any final amount would be determined in the court where the complaint is filed, Fiorante said. ""Unfortunately, like all other civil litigation that these cases can take years to resolve,"" Fiorante said. ""There'll be some very complicated questions in this case as to whether Ukraine Airlines has a defence to the claim based on the events leading to the to the crash,"" he said. A second possible avenue of compensation for victims' families is through the International Court of Justice.  The government of Canada could bring a claim in that court against the government of Iran for reparations, Fiorante said. In 1989, the Iranian government made such a claim against the United States for shooting down Iran Air Flight 655. That flight was on its way from Tehran to Dubai when two surface-to-air missiles launched from the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Vincennes brought it down over Iranian territorial waters.  All 290 people on board were killed. The international court case dragged on for years, but eventually the U.S. government eventually agreed to pay $131 million in compensation to Iran and the families of the victims. ""The lawyers will want much more information about all of the circumstances pertaining to this crash but that is an avenue that is certainly open to the government of Canada,"" FIorante said. Ultimately, the solution to the issue may be worked out through international diplomacy. The Iranian government could come to an agreement with other governments involved, including Canada's, that would include compensation for the families of victims.  Genova, the Toronto lawyer, used the example of the Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people. The investigation into that crash found a Libyan intelligence agent guilty of planning the attack and the U.N. imposed a series of sanctions on Libya. Years later, the Libyan government accepted responsibility as part of a broader deal that saw international sanctions lifted. ""A lot of that came about because of geopolitical pressure,"" said Genova. ""I think there will be similar actions against the Iranian government until they make good on their admission of fault."" There are already signs that things are moving in this way. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne has set up an international working group of countries whose citizens perished on the plane. Members include representatives from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and Afghanistan. The purpose of the group is to coordinate a response and to share information about the investigation. Members of the working group held a phone call yesterday where they all discussed the need for justice, including compensation for victims, according to a readout provided by Champagne's office.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/compensation-victims-ps752-1.5424415,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ps752-flight-iran-missile-1.5422912 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-iran-ps752-ukrainian-crash-1.5421172 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-airliner-investigation-working-group-1.5423202,N/A
43,Alex Brockman,2019-05-06T15:18:30.436Z,'It's amazing to me': Meet the Inuk elder in this photo shared around the world,"Helen Konek enters her igloo, walking down the steps carved from ice. The 17-year-old stares ahead into the camera. She's framed by the entrance, the Arctic sun shines through the opening in the door. That moment — frozen in time in February 1949 near Arviat, Nunavut — is spreading across the internet after her grandson, CBC's Jordan Konek, posted it on Twitter. It took just a few days for it to be shared thousands of times by people around the world. Helen is 87 now and lives in the elders' care home in Arviat. But she still remembers the photographer and his project two generations ago. ""I remember it very clearly,"" said Helen Konek in Inuktitut. ""He followed me everywhere I went … everywhere I went he was right there. We would wander around and just take many photos all the time."" Richard Harrington, a freelance photographer who had an interest in the North, took the photos of Helen while travelling in the Arctic in 1949. He made six trips to the North in the middle of the 20th century as many Inuit transitioned from life on the land to life in permanent communities. The Canadian Encyclopedia describes his Arctic series in the 1940s as ""probably his best known and most moving photo essay."" His work was purchased by Canada's National Archives, the Smithsonian and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Helen says she's happy her photo continues to resonate with people, 70 years later. It's the second time Jordan's shared her photo on social media and it's gone viral, though he made a mistake with her age, saying she was 27 when in fact, she was 17 at the time of the photo.  Correction she was 17 ""Oh my! I am so happy. That is amazing!"" she said. ""There were so many others [Harrington] took photos of during our very hard times. But this ... photo of me is being noticed. It's amazing to me."" Helen has a deep connection with Jordan, who spent a lot of time with her growing up in Arviat.  ""She's one of those people who likes to get the work done, but she also cares so much about her grandchildren and her family,"" said Jordan, who is a journalist for CBC North in Iqaluit. ""I always looked up to [my grandparents] and how they raised us and told us a lot of different things,"" he said. ""To be hard working, being nice to people, all the things grandparents do. They were always the people we look up to. ""In the Inuit culture we are always told to respect our elders and that's partly why I spent a lot of time with them."" When Jordan looks at that photo today, he sees traditional Inuit life before his eyes. ""They've told me so many stories about being out on the land and trying to survive,"" he said. ""I've always wanted to see what it's like out there … it's something I'd really love to see."" That photo, of a strong, confident Inuk woman, shows people outside the North a positive image of people in Nunavut, Jordan explained, and it's why he wanted to tweet it in the first place. ""I'm glad the image went viral, because even up to today, Canadians don't know where Nunavut is. They don't know who Inuit are,"" he said. ""It's important for Canadians to know that Inuit are here, that we are part of Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/archival-photos-nunavut-inuit-1.4821192 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457,N/A
44,Vassy Kapelos,2020-01-19T12:00:00.340Z,"As cabinet meets in Winnipeg, Trudeau government's agenda remains unclear","This article is part of CBC News' Minority Report newsletter, which is your weekly tip-sheet to help you navigate the parliamentary waters of a minority government. Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. It's been three months since the election. Can you believe that? I can't. It feels like just yesterday we were talking about increasing regional tensions and whether Andrew Scheer should resign as Conservative leader.  Events, as I wrote last week, change a lot. The devastating shooting down of a passenger jet carrying 57 Canadians - and, as we learned Friday, 29 permanent residents of Canada - has rightly consumed the government.  And yet, there hasn't been a lot of criticism of the Liberal government's response to this file. There is, more largely, a critique from the Conservatives on the Liberal government's general foreign policy towards Iran, which the Tories say is too tender, but on the handling of the crash itself, all of our Power Panelists, of all party stripes - even the few Conservatives who still talk to the CBC, lol - were united this week; the prime minister has struck the right tone.  But Justin Trudeau's attention will now have to turn elsewhere, to a degree. Cabinet is, as you read this, meeting in Winnipeg for the first time this year, and of course, for the first time since the downing of that jet. And beyond responding to this awful tragedy, there will be questions from reporters, that are aimed at trying to figure out what this government will be about. There have been only a few clues so far. The government's throne speech (which happened just six weeks ago - but doesn't it feel like at least year?) echoed much of what we heard during the election: a focus on climate, on reconciliation and a tax cut. We know what the tax cut looks like, but not a whole lot about the rest. The one piece of legislation we can be sure is on the way, is the amendment to Canada's medically assisted dying law. The law was found to be, in part, unconstitutional by a Quebec judge last year. The courts in that province gave the federal government six months to fix the law. The six months will be up in early March and the government has telegraphed that it will likely meet that deadline with a change to the law that will ease the requirement that a person's death must be ""reasonably foreseeable"" in order for them to qualify for an assisted death. But I've been racking my brain (I mean granted it's full of other things too; like, should I buy a snowblower, but still...) because aside from the assisted dying, and the the CUSMA implementation bill, I can't think of another specific piece of legislation we know is coming. And when I talk to people in government, and I ask them what might be coming, I don't get a lot of detail  -- which wouldn't have been the case, say, in 2015. Will the government, for example, introduce legislation to hold itself accountable on its climate targets? Speaking of emission reduction targets, when will the government release its full plan for reaching them, and when or how will it fulfil its promise to be more aggressive on those targets?  On regional tensions, which consumed us after the election and appear to dominate Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's time these days, what will come of her listening tour and multiple meetings with political leaders in Alberta and Saskatchewan? Alberta wants $2 billion in back payments for its struggling economy. Will they get a decision on that big ask before the budget, or will the answer come with the budget? It remains unclear.  Speaking of the budget, when's that coming? My contacts say it won't be an early one, possibly even as late as April. That's important because the budget will likely provide a specific indication, and measure, of the government's priorities.  It's not surprising that it might not happen until spring, there is a lot of frustration among even political staffers about the pace of change in government right now. The prime minister's chief of staff only announced the senior leadership team last week. Communication teams are just now falling into place, but I've had multiple people in those offices tell me it was a painful process; decisions were slow and many loyal staffers felt left in limbo for longer than usual. You can feel that hesitancy in the way some ministers communicate on their files, hedging specifics on plans with the caveat they will need support from, and to consult with, the opposition.  Now, It's a fact to be sure - that in a minority Parliament, the government does need the opposition's support. But will that fact create an overly cautious government agenda? It seems that way right now, but we should have a better idea with this cabinet retreat -- and then most definitely when Parliament resumes in a week. This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter. In this week's issue, Éric Grenier looks at the last time Peter MacKay was leader of a conservative party and what that means for his pitch to replace Andrew Scheer.

45,Jacques Poitras,2019-12-02T20:46:43.321Z,Maritime Iron retreats after suggesting carbon-tax break for Belledune site,"The company proposing a new iron processing plant in northern New Brunswick now says it's not looking for a break on federal carbon taxes through credits for potential emission reductions outside Canada. Maritime Iron wants to build a $1.5 billion plant in Belledune that it says will increase emissions in New Brunswick but could lower them elsewhere.  The company will soon file its application to the provincial government for an environmental impact assessment. In an interview last month, Maritime Iron vice-president Elena Mantagaris said the company was aware of the ""implications"" of the federal carbon levy on large industrial emitters, but she argued the Belledune plant would also lower emissions globally. Iron ore from Quebec and Labrador will travel a much shorter distance to Belledune than it does now to processors in China, reducing emission from ocean freighters hauling the metal, she said. Asked if those global reductions could help reduce the company's carbon-tax bill, Mantagaris called it ""a discussion we've been exploring.""  But in a followup email, Mantagaris now says she had something ""completely different in mind."" ""I was thinking of the intersection between the national and ​global efforts to reduce emissions, which is evolving,"" she said, adding that ""the full value proposition of our project"" looks at the impact overseas. ""This may include, for example, the contribution our products may make to third parties' ability to lower their own emissions or could someday include an international credit system."" Mantagaris didn't respond to a request for a followup interview to explain how that might work. There are no agreed-upon rules for the transfer of emissions-reductions credits between countries. In fact, talks this week at COP 24 in Madrid, the latest global climate change conference, will focus on how countries that signed the 2015 Paris agreement may someday count reductions outside their borders toward emissions-reductions targets. The Paris deal committed signatories to their own legally binding targets but only within their own borders. It also leaves the door open to future talks on how to trade reduction credits internationally. Jason Dion of Canada's Ecofiscal Commission, a pro-carbon-price think tank, says that's not likely to be easily sorted out in Madrid.  ""All of this is still being defined at the international level,"" he said. ""It's likely to remain unresolved for some time to come because it's really complex and tricky.""  Maritime Iron says putting its plant in Belledune will reduce global emissions because iron ore from Quebec and Labrador is now shipped mainly to China for processing. Sending it to Belledune instead would reduce emissions from ocean-going freighters by 98 per cent, Mantagaris said last month. The finished product, called pig iron, would be sold primarily in U.S. markets, displacing pig iron from suppliers in places such as Russia and Ukraine and cutting those shipping emissions by 60 per cent, she added. Last month, Premier Blaine Higgs said that federal cabinet minister Dominic LeBlanc told him last year that Ottawa could treat the project ""as a global initiative and, as such, the environmental impact is reduced globally,"" despite higher emissions provincially.  But Dion said it could take years before countries agree on rules governing how that would affect national reduction targets.  Another way for Maritime Iron to avoid a steep federal carbon price is with its processing technology, which Mantagaris said produces emissions 40 per cent below conventional iron processing.  The federal levy on industrial emissions is based on whether a plant emits more than a standard set by measuring the average emissions of all plants in the same sector. So if Maritime Iron's emissions are lower, it could benefit, Dion said.  The New Brunswick government has proposed its own industrial levy to Ottawa for approval under the national climate plan. If the provincial system is accepted, emitters would pay a levy on a smaller share of their emissions.  Maritime Iron says it will create 1,300 direct jobs during construction and 200 permanent jobs during the plant's operations. Community leaders in the Belledune area have cited the plant as an urgent project in the wake of the announcement that the Glencore lead smelter is closing, putting 420 people out of work.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/iron-processing-plant-carbon-tax-1.5379039,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-belledune-1.5372684 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/belledune-brunswick-smelter-companies-jobs-mayor-1.5367671,N/A
46,Stephanie Taylor,2019-05-02T18:27:37.141Z,Groups question impact new Clare's Law will have on domestic violence rates in Sask.,"As she was being hit with an aluminum baseball bat, Lani Elliott saw flashes of her little boy's future she feared she wouldn't live to see, such as his graduation and wedding day. ""I remember saying a prayer,"" she recalls about the 1993 beating that she says happened at the hands of her husband. The couple had been travelling from their home on a First Nation into nearby Regina. He grew agitated, parked their vehicle, chased her down and began swinging the bat. ""The weird part was that as we started to drive again, he started to talk about what we were going to buy at the grocery store."" Elliott has since left the relationship and advocates for domestic violence victims. She's also one of many people questioning the legislation in Saskatchewan that will allow police to verbally warn people about a partner's abusive history. The legislation, dubbed Clare's Law, would not have helped her, says Elliott. Her husband had no prior criminal record. What she needed as a woman living in a rural area were resources to get out, she says. Clare's Law started in the United Kingdom in 2014 after a woman named Clare Wood was murdered by a partner who police knew had a violent record, but the information was not disclosed to her. Saskatchewan, which struggles with high rates of domestic violence, is the first province in Canada to adopt Clare's Law. It passed third reading in the legislature Thursday and is to be in place later this year. Alberta has indicated it could be next. Premier Jason Kenney promised before he was elected last month that he would table similar legislation. While advocates believe Clare's Law is another tool to protect victims, others cast doubt on its potential to reduce overall domestic violence rates and are concerned about the role police will play. ""I don't think it's going to be the answer that we need,"" says Hillary Aitken, senior director of housing and domestic violence shelters with YWCA Regina. ""I don't think what the majority of people are missing is information."" She says victims lack proper resources to safely leave dangerous relationships and must overcome barriers such as finding housing and what to do if they have children. In more complex scenarios, there can be addictions and mental-health issues. Saskatchewan Minister of Justice Don Morgan says Clare's Law is meant to be preventative and to apply to those who are early on in their relationships before violence escalates. Jo-Anne Dusel, executive director of the Provincial Association of Transition Houses, an umbrella organization of women's shelters and support services, has been consulting with Saskatchewan on the legislation. She says Clare's Law is likely to help only a small number of victims. A small portion of the U.K. population has so far used the law, she says, and police there disclosed information in about half the cases. Dusel expects the numbers will translate in Saskatchewan to about 82 cases each year, with less than half receiving information from police. The Saskatchewan Coroners Service says 71 people were victims of domestic homicide between 2005 and 2019. Dusel's group wants the province to ensure workers are present when disclosures are made to help victims navigate next steps instead of just receiving a referral. Front-line officers dealing with victims also need training, Dusel says. As it is written, the law requires a person to make a request directly to a police officer. Dusel worries that could lead to a request being denied if the officer isn't knowledgeable about domestic violence. ""Maybe they're not actually looking concerned. Maybe they're coming across as a little bit angry or aggressive,"" she says. Aitken adds that Indigenous women, who data suggests are three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence, may be even more unwilling to turn to police for help. But Darlene Okemaysim-Sicotte, a Saskatoon activist for missing and murdered Indigenous women, says Clare's Law could give police an opportunity to build trust with Indigenous women. ""This is a time for them not to turn their eyes away,"" she says. ""There might become a point where the police say, you know, if the abused is not going to do something, they're in a position where they can.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-clares-law-groups-question-effectiveness-1.5120353,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/saskatchewan-clare-s-law-1.4898272 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/domestic-violence-sask-budget-2019-20-1.5072155,N/A
47,Duncan McCue,2019-01-29T16:34:24.107Z,Lack of sleep is 'epidemic' among Canadian teens. Here's why it has doctors worried," Every morning the bell rings at 8:10 a.m. at Smiths Falls District Collegiate Institute, and herds of weary high-school students stumble into class like zombies.      ""We're always tired,"" Grade 10 student Michelle Norlock says. ""It's hard, because you're not focusing and you can't really understand what the teacher is saying.""  ""My first class, I just want to fall asleep and not really pay attention, because I'm exhausted from the night before,"" echoes Grade 9 student Angelina Holmes.   Parents of any era know it's often a struggle to coax a groggy teenager out of bed. But two Grade 10 students at SFDCI in Smiths Falls, Ont., wondered if their peers are, in fact, chronically sleep deprived. Elizabeth Horsey and Quin Atkinson asked more than 300 students about their sleeping habits for a recent science fair project. Their questions included a survey known as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale that's commonly used to detect sleep disorders.   The duo found that students slept 7.67 hours on school nights, on average.   What surprised them was that more than a third of students would be classified by the Epworth test as having ""excessive"" daytime sleepiness, which, in some cases, warrants medical attention.  ""Everybody is so stressed with all the work and they're not getting enough sleep,"" Atkinson says.  ""They just have so much on their plate and they're not getting enough time to restore their bodies.""  Indeed, national statistics show millions of Canadian adolescents don't get enough shut-eye, which has experts warning of long-term health consequences — unless we start appreciating the importance of a good night's sleep.   The recommended amount of sleep for 13- to 18-year-olds is eight to 10 hours per night, according to the Canadian Paediatric Society.  Studies suggest more than half of Canadian teens get much less, about 6.5 to 7.5 hours per night, says Indra Narang, director of sleep medicine at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.  ""We are in an epidemic of sleep deprivation,"" said Narang, who foresees cumulative effects that can have an impact on everything from health to work performance.   ""In 20 years time, we're going to see a whole generation of adults who are functioning sub-optimally.""  Teenagers naturally function differently than adults when it comes to bedtimes: they don't run on the same inner clocks.  In early adolescence and puberty, teens experience a shift in their 24-hour biological cycles, known as circadian rhythms. This means peak production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin happens later in the evening for teenagers, from roughly 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Those hormonal changes have long turned many teens into ""night owls,"" but studies over the past few decades show the pervasiveness of sleeplessness is on the rise. Reasons vary, from late-night use of electronics and hectic after-school schedules, to increased consumption of high-energy caffeine drinks. Some teens also have sleep disorders from being overweight.    ""It's not uncommon for me to see teenagers in my clinic who are telling me that on school nights they go to bed at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m. — and get up at 7 a.m. to go to school,"" Narang says.   ""They're struggling to get in to school for the allocated time. They are sleeping in school. They find it hard to do the homework.""  When teens don't get enough ZZZZs, the health dangers range from obesity and diabetes, to depression and substance abuse. Narang says public health officials need to better understand the long-term consequences of sleep deprivation.  ""What we don't want to do is miss the opportunity to intervene now, rather than have to intervene [later in life] when they have cardiovascular disease or metabolic disease or strokes or, indeed, dementia.""   One of the questions raised by Horsey and Atkinson's science project is whether a later school start time would benefit students.  Some teens worry that delaying start times could have an impact on part-time jobs or after-school sports programs, but many interviewed for this story were enthusiastic about any opportunity to sleep in. ""If school was a bit later, I could get maybe five or six hours [of sleep] ... which would greatly help in, like, getting better grades,"" says Grade 12 student Haze Ketcheson, who sleeps on average four hours per night.  He might be onto something, and it's about more than getting enough sleep to avoid dozing off in class and missing an important lesson.    Stuart Fogel, a professor at the University of Ottawa's Sleep Research Laboratory, has been looking at what the brain does while we sleep. He's interested in how each day's experiences are moved from the hippocampus, a limited space where we store recent short-term memories, to the prefrontal cortex, the brain's ""hard drive"" where we store important memories for long-term reference.   Fogel's research indicates that sleep basically cleans up the hippocampus, leaving us ready to take in fresh data — and simultaneously helps convert short-term memories into long-term ones so we can recall them later.   ""What's intriguing is that sleep loss will have an impact on your ability to retain anything that you learn that's new,"" Fogel says.  Narang says studies of American high schools with delayed start times suggest it can lead not only to significantly increased attendance, but also better grades.  However, there can be a host of logistical challenges to changing school start times. In Smiths Falls, for example, where the student population is largely rural, budget restrictions on school bus services resulted in staggered start times at elementary and secondary schools that allow for buses to make two runs. High schools get the earlier start.  ""We think they should push it to nine o'clock ... all they have to do is switch our bus times with the elementary school kids,"" Atkinson says. In the meantime, Horsey and Atkinson's school project on sleep nabbed a gold medal at the science fair, and it has been attracting plenty of interest from students and teachers.   It also caught the attention of Horsey's mother Veronica, who happens to be chair of the school council. ""Unfortunately, most adults don't even understand how sleep deprived we are,"" says Veronica Horsey. ""Can we just look at the bigger picture on how to help our teenagers get more rest?""

48,Anonymous,2019-11-07T14:45:18.269Z,Regulators want revised Boeing 737 Max software documentation,"U.S. and European regulators have asked Boeing to revise documentation on its proposed 737 Max software fix, the planemaker confirmed Wednesday, a development that further complicates its efforts to return the jet to service by the end of the year. The world's largest planemaker submitted documentation in a key part of an approval process, already delayed by months, for a 737 Max software upgrade in the wake of two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people, but has been asked to submit revised documentation. U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA​​) officials flagged a number of issues over the weekend at an FAA facility in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, during a documentation audit of how the new software was developed, sources told Reuters. ""We think there is still some work to be done,"" EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said Monday. A person with knowledge of his thinking said he was partly referring to the documentation audit that is not yet complete. Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Wednesday the company ""provided technical documentation to the regulators as part of the software validation process. The documentation was complete, and it was provided in a format consistent with past submissions. Regulators have requested that the information be conveyed in a different form, and the documentation is being revised accordingly."" One person briefed on the matter characterized the issue differently and said Boeing's paperwork had gaps, was substandard and meant regulators could not complete the audit, a crucial step before the plane can be certified to return to service. The person said it could take ""weeks"" to satisfy regulators in a worst-case scenario, though Boeing believes it can address the omissions in a matter of days. The extent of the delays caused by the documentation requirements was not immediately clear. There was no indication of any need to revise the software package based on the audit, sources said. Boeing is ramping up the number of people assigned to address the software documentation officials, a source said. Boeing shares closed down about 1 per cent. The FAA declined to comment on the audit but said it was ""following a thorough process, not a prescribed timeline, for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service."" In September, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the agency had conversations with Boeing ""about the importance of making sure that we are looking at complete documentation and not piecemeal documentation."" He added the FAA told Boeing ""it's really better to be very methodical and very detailed rather than try to rush a partially completed product and then say, 'We'll get back to you with the rest of it.'"" Dickson said the FAA will need 30 days from the time of the as-yet unscheduled certification test flight before it can unground the plane. A third person, familiar with FAA documentation audits but who did not participate in the 737 Max review over the weekend, said such audits frequently uncover inconsistencies or omissions in documentation but rarely lead to changes to the underlying software or system. Boeing's fastest-selling jetliner has been grounded worldwide since March, cutting off a key source of cash for Boeing while forcing airlines to cancel thousands of flights. Many carriers have taken the Max off schedules into 2020. American Airlines Group CEO Doug Parker told a conference on Wednesday that the U.S.'s plan to put some of its 737 Max jets back in the air in mid-January would require FAA approval in ""the earlier part of December."" Boeing has repeatedly delayed its timeline for returning the plane to flight by the end of 2019, as regulators have scrutinized proposed fixes. Documentation requirements are central to certification for increasingly complex aircraft software, and can become a source of delays. In 2008, EASA nearly derailed Europe's Airbus A400M military transporter over software documentation following a failed audit.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/regulators-revised-boeing-737-max-software-documentation-1.5351212,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-ceo-u-s-congress-testimony-fatal-crashes-1.5338848 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737ng-qantas-cracks-1.5342489 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-calhoun-737max-muilenburg-1.5348083,N/A
49,Anonymous,2020-01-17T23:38:47.467Z,U.S. to screen passengers for new China coronavirus at 3 airports,"The United States will begin screening at three major airports people coming from central Chinese city of Wuhan for the newly-identified coronavirus that has killed two people and infected at least 40 more in China, public health officials said on Friday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening for direct arrivals at New York City's JFK International Airport is expected later Friday followed by screenings on Saturday at San Francisco International Airport. The third airport is Los Angeles International Airport. The risk from the coronavirus to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. While the U.S. State Department has issued a health alert update about travel to the Wuhan region, the CDC has urged citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Friday it will not implement extra screening measures, but is ""monitoring the situation closely with our partners on both sides of the border."" The CBSA did say there are plans in progress ""to implement signage"" in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal airports to raise awareness of the virus to travellers. Elsewhere, Thailand has found a second case of a new Chinese coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as they ramped up checks on Chinese visitors, nearly a million of whom are expected for Lunar New Year holidays next week. The latest patient is from China's central city of Wuhan, which has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, with two deaths, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread. The 74-year-old woman, quarantined since arriving in Thailand on Monday, was found to be infected, health officials said. ""We're very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of diseases,"" Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, adding that the situation was under control and there was no outbreak in Thailand. ""We're fully alert."" The two Chinese patients were now safe but needed to go through a few more procedures before Thai authorities could let them return home, he added. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thailand, which is on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, said on Monday it had found a 61-year-old Chinese woman carrying a strain of the coronavirus, the first time it was detected outside China. Japan reported its first case of the infection on Thursday, after a Japanese man returned from visiting Wuhan, known for picturesque lakes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the virus could spread and warned hospitals against it. Thai health officials have stepped up monitoring at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan — Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai and Phuket — and others that receive charter flights from the Chinese city. Since Jan. 3, Thailand has screened 13,624 passengers. Health officials also asked Thai AirAsia and China Southern Airlines, which run direct daily flights from Wuhan, to halt boarding by those suffering from high fever and respiratory symptoms, and reschedule their flights. The CBSA says there are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A
50,Adam Miller,2020-01-11T09:00:00.114Z,Is Canada at risk from a mysterious Chinese virus related to SARS?,"This is an excerpt from Second Opinion, a weekly roundup of eclectic and under-the-radar health and medical science news emailed to subscribers every Saturday morning. If you haven't subscribed yet, you can do that by clicking here. For Canadians who remember the face masks, quarantines and airport screenings of the SARS epidemic, a mysterious outbreak of pneumonia in China likely caused by the same family of viruses may be raising concern. Since Dec. 12, 59 people have been hospitalized with viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the central Chinese province of Hubei. Wuhan health officials on Saturday reported that one person has died, and seven were in critical condition. Health officials in China have reportedly identified and genetically sequenced the previously unknown virus from an infected patient in Wuhan and found remnants of it in 15 others, state-run media agency Xinhua announced Thursday. The illness has been identified as a new coronavirus, a large family of viruses that can make the jump from animals to humans and range from the common cold to much more serious illnesses, such as SARS or MERS. Chinese officials have traced the outbreak back to a seafood market in Wuhan, which was shut down and disinfected on Jan. 1. But it's not yet known how it made a species jump from animals to humans, or if it is transmissible from person to person. Diseases such as SARS, MERS, influenza and avian influenza have also reportedly been ruled out in tests, World Health Organization representative to China Dr. Gauden Galea said in a statement. ""According to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients and does not transmit readily between people,"" he said. ""In the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture."" Given the fact that both SARS and the Wuhan outbreak both originated in open-air markets that sold both live and dead animals, the similar origins of the viruses are hard to ignore. ""Certainly there are some parallels, if we're thinking back to SARS,"" said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. ""We know that in today's world, diseases spread incredibly quickly and we don't actually even know what this is just yet."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the 2002-2003 epidemic that killed 774 worldwide. So the current outbreak is something health officials who lived through it are watching closely. ""I think given when it presented, how it presented, it certainly did raise eyebrows and serious concerns,"" Dr. Marjorie Pollack, deputy editor of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), said of the current outbreak. ""People who want to be sensationalist and want to blame are throwing stones at China, saying they're not being transparent enough.… They are being transparent with what they know. They're not being transparent for speculations."" Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. ""This went on for months before, really, the world kind of knew what was happening. And it really started to build up quite a bit of momentum before it started to disperse in different parts of the world,"" Khan said. ""We're getting this information, certainly earlier [in this outbreak], … but I still take all of the information as being preliminary at this point."" For its part, WHO said in a statement that the identification of a new coronavirus in a short period of time is a ""notable achievement"" that ""demonstrates China's increased capacity to manage new outbreaks."" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who herself was diagnosed with SARS in 2003, said she's encouraged by the amount of information released by China so far. ""The fact that we know about it, that we're talking about it, this is a marker of just how much better things are,"" she said. ""A challenge with SARS was when it started, we didn't know anything about it."" The Public Health Agency of Canada recently updated its website, warning travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals and to report any symptoms to health-care workers. But assessing the level of risk in Canada for an outbreak like this is largely based on two key factors: whether the virus will spread from person to person and whether health-care workers will be affected on the front lines. ""In the last 15 years, the volume of people travelling through commercial flights has doubled. We've become vectors that are moving these diseases very, very rapidly around the world,"" said Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot, which uses various types of data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world. ""We are not there yet. We are still moving too slow. If we want to get in front of these threats, we are literally going to have to spread knowledge faster than the diseases themselves. And they move quick."" His data shows that of all the travellers projected to depart from Wuhan on commercial flights from January to March of this year, 4,000 of them are heading to Canada — and the majority to cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. ""Thirty years ago, when somebody turned up in the emergency department in hospital, you didn't have to worry about where they'd been because air travel was much less common,"" said McGeer. ""Now when somebody turns up in your emergency department, they could have been anywhere four days ago. And so SARS was us catching up with the globalization of humans."" McGeer says that while she can't guarantee there would be no risk of transmission of a virus like this in Canada if it were to spread overseas, she's confident health-care workers could do a better job of containing it than they did with SARS. It can be hard to recognize new viruses early on, she added, which is why airports in Hong Kong, Singapore and cities around Wuhan will likely be screening travellers in the meantime. But a comprehensive 234-page report into the outbreak of SARS in Canada released by Dr. David Naylor in October 2003 found WHO-ordered airport screening to be completely ineffective. More than 6.5 million travellers were screened at Canadian airports for SARS by August 2003, with 9,100 passengers isolated for further assessment by nurses or quarantine officers. None had SARS. A thermal scanner project was also piloted, with 2.4 million passengers screened and 832 requiring further assessment. None of them were found to have SARS either. So it's likely not a virus that will easily be detected until health-care workers can test for it based on its genetic sequencing. ""If somebody comes from Wuhan with pneumonia, and we don't know they came from Wuhan, we're not looking for it. And if it happens to be transmissible, we're not going to make the diagnosis,"" McGeer said. ""So until we have a test for it, it can be very difficult."" Khan thinks that even with the technological innovations in health care since SARS, the biggest risk related to an outbreak spreading to Canada is the fact that we're far too ""reactive."" ""We spring into action with incredible vigour during an emergency, but then forget about the emergency almost immediately after it is over,"" he said. ""The current events in Wuhan are a reminder about what happened in Toronto and around the world 17 years ago, and are foreshadowing what we will no doubt face again. Will we pay attention, and if so, for how long?""

51,Laura Fraser,2020-01-17T14:09:20.541Z,N.S. woman persuades Air Canada to send supplies to help injured Australian wildlife,"As the charred remains of bushland from Melbourne to Sydney flashed outside the train window, Brianna MacDonald became determined to help the injured wildlife she could barely see in the smoke. It's been less than two weeks since that journey. But the Nova Scotia woman has successfully lobbied Air Canada to send six cargo shipments to Australia that will include medical supplies and handcrafted goods made across Canada. While the story of the 10,000-strong Canadian Animal Rescue Craft Guild has made headlines this week, their efforts were hampered by shipping costs. ""A lot of people knew someone who was travelling to Australia and they were planning to put their donations in that person's luggage,"" MacDonald said. ""But that wasn't fast enough to meet the demand and it was also hard to get the incoming supplies to where they were most needed."" That's where MacDonald's mother, Cathy, came in. Her garage in Bedford is filled with boxes of veterinary supplies, crocheted nests and sewn slings for injured and displaced bats.  Her daughter, meanwhile, has met with wildlife groups and humanitarian agencies near where she now lives in Cronulla, Australia, to co-ordinate the distribution on the ground. Although MacDonald had initially just requested that Air Canada fly out a shipment from Halifax, the airline agreed to send out five other shipments, according to an Air Canada spokesperson. The first cargo plane will leave Halifax today. It will be filled with goods sent from all over the Maritimes and Newfoundland. Cargo planes will also leave from Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver in the next few days. Lauren McCann helped collect knitted goods and donations in the Amherst area, putting down her thrummed mittens to crochet nests instead. Her colleagues at Oxford Frozen Foods donated funds so she could buy wool and material after seeing her work in the lunchroom. She knows that other people will continue to drop off other handcrafted goods after the plane flies out so she's planning to use the last of those donations to send a shipment to Australia later in the month.  ""If you've already started making that pouch and it's not done, don't worry about it,"" McCann said. ""This is just the beginning of the burn season."" MacDonald said the level of generosity from fellow Canadians like McCann has overwhelmed her.  ""Not everyone is capable of financially donating, which is 100 per cent fine, so they're finding what skills they can offer — and that is incredibly moving,"" she said. ""A lot of them have never been here and they may never be here and they're just like, 'I will do whatever I can.'""

52,Nicole Mortillaro,2019-10-31T17:14:48.353Z,Is population control the answer to fixing climate change?,"Climate change has taken global centre stage in recent months following three reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that paint a dire picture of the future should governments fail to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But when the discussion turns to modifying our behaviours in order to reduce CO2 emissions in order to keep the planet from warming 1.5 C or 2 C above pre-industrial levels, the threshold that would result in widespread damage, one word creeps up more often than not: overpopulation. The argument is that if there were fewer people on Earth, greenhouse gases would be reduced and climate change could be averted. But experts say population control isn't the panacea some think it might be. ""It is a very complicated, multifaceted relationship. Population issues certainly are an important dimension of how society will unfold, how society will be able to cope with this crisis over the course of this century,"" said Kathleen Mogelgaard, a consultant on population dynamics and climate change and an adjunct professor at the University of Maryland. ""But it's not a silver bullet, and it's certainly not the main cause of climate change. And fully addressing population growth is not, on its own, going to be able to solve the climate crisis. But it is an important piece of the puzzle."" Robert Engelman, a senior fellow at The Population Institute in Washington, D.C., agrees that battling climate change isn't just about slowing population growth. ""Is population an issue in climate change? Absolutely. Is it underreported, underrated, under-talked-about as an issue in climate change? Absolutely,"" Engelman said. ""If it were just Adam and Eve on the planet, they could fly a 747 around the world 24/7 and heat Mar-a-Lago and 25 other homes with coal, and it wouldn't make a difference."" But he notes slowing population growth alone ""won't solve"" climate change. ""It's one of a number of things that needs to be considered as we try to address or respond to this incredibly difficult problem that the world is facing. There's no one thing that's going to do it."" The reality is global birth rates are declining. The United Nations had previously projected that the global population would reach 11.2 billion by 2100. However, the UN updated that forecast in June — dropping it to 10.9 billion. That's because fertility rates are dropping for most of the world.  Darrell Bricker, a fellow at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, who co-wrote Empty Planet: The Shock of Global Population Decline, says he's not surprised by the UN dropping its numbers.  ""What's happening in most countries around the world is that the fertility rates are collapsing more quickly than the UN is estimating in countries that have above replacement rate fertility,"" said Bricker. The replacement rate, or total fertility rate, is the number of births it takes to keep a population from either increasing or decreasing. It's roughly 2.1. But that number isn't being reached in many parts of the world. So instead of the population continuously increasing, Bricker believes it will peak around the middle of the century — at around eight or nine billion people — and then begin to decline. Another big driver for the decline in population is urbanization, Bricker says. In the 1960s, roughly 33 per cent of the population lived in a city; now it's 54 per cent. The UN projects that by 2050, that number will climb to 68 per cent. ""We're going through the biggest migration in human history right now, and that's people moving from the country to the city,"" Bricker said. And when people move to the city, they tend to have fewer children. The apocalyptic vision of overpopulation has been ""imprinted in our brains"" for so long, Bricker says, that it's often a knee-jerk reaction to call for population control. Concern about overpopulation has been rather long-standing. One of the most familiar arguments, by Thomas Robert Malthus, dates back to 1798. In An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus wrote that population growth would eventually surpass our ability to provide sustenance for the masses — a belief now known as Malthusianism.  The fear of overpopulation has even seeped into our pop culture: In the recent Marvel movies Avengers: Infinity War, the villain, Thanos, wants to eliminate half of the universe's population in order to end suffering, such as starvation. But Bricker believes it's gone too far. He's particularly irked by recent stories about youth pledging not to have children; while many talk of fears over what the world will look like in the generations to come, still others point to population concerns. The birth rate in Canada is 1.5, he notes, below the replacement rate. ""So why are you taking this pledge? If you decide you want to have a kid, great. If you decide you want to have two kids, great,"" he said. ""There are a lot of reasons why we should be concerned about global warming and climate change. And, yes, we need to do whatever we need to do to control it. But if you think you need to enforce some sort of Draconian pledge on people to say that they shouldn't have a family or whatever, you're just missing the point."" China's one-child policy was introduced in 1979, but lifted in 2015. Interestingly, their birth rate didn't climb after the end of that policy; it has remained steady at roughly 1.7. The other thing to take into consideration about our growing population is that the issue isn't so much about births, but rather about dying. Or more accurately not dying. Today, people are living longer. In China, for example, the average person lived to age 40 in 1950, Bricker said. According to the World Bank, the country's average life expectancy is now 76.5, and by the mid-2030s, the average person should live to 80. One of the universal calls to prevent the global population from ballooning is to better educate women, particularly in developing countries. ""The key to achieving slower population growth is best done through a rights-based approach that includes educating girls and providing universal access to family planning and reproductive health services,"" said Mogelgaard. ""That is the best and most sustainable way to achieve reductions in fertility that leads to slower population growth."" But she says it's important that family-planning choices are left up to the woman — and that's not the norm in many countries of the world, though global access to contraception has improved in recent decades. ""We are still seeing that there are hundreds of millions of women around the world who would like to be able to have greater control of their fertility, but don't have real meaningful access to the information and services that will allow them to do that,"" Mogelgaard said. What's more, a larger population doesn't necessarily produce more CO2 emissions, at least, not on a per capita basis. Michael Barnard, chief strategist with TFIE Strategy Inc. who specializes in energy and low-carbon solutions, points back to China as an example: While the country of 1.4 billion people is the No. 1 emitter of CO2 in the world, on a per capita basis, it produces far fewer emissions than either the U.S. (the world's second-top emitter) and Canada (the 10th). According to a recently updated explainer by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the U.S.'s CO2 emissions from fuel combustion per capita is 15 tonnes, and Canada sits at 14.9 tonnes. China? They're at just 6.4 tonnes per capita — a trend that is starting to drop. That's also the case for India, Barnard said. ""Per capita is important,"" he said. ""One-third of the population already have lower per capita CO2 emissions than we do, and they're dropping faster."" Instead of looking at population control as the biggest factor in the battle against climate change, experts say it's about looking at better education for women, adopting cleaner energy and changing our overall consumption patterns, especially in developed countries. There is no single solution. ""Just because we slow population growth, if we continue to use coal-fired power plants to generate electricity, or if we continue to cut down forests at the rate that we're cutting down forests, those are going to be challenges regardless what the population is,"" said Mogelgaard.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/population-climate-change-1.5331133,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-change-cooling-1.5244077 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-carbon-budget-saving-birds-1.5289861 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-thanksgiving-food-waste-app-1.5316720 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/canadian-teens-lawsuit-federal-government-over-climate-change-1.5331773,N/A
53,Catherine Cullen,2020-01-13T18:19:11.269Z,Who should get a medically assisted death? Canadians get 2 weeks to weigh in on new limits,"Hurrying to meet a looming court deadline, the federal government has given Canadians two weeks to weigh in on how far to extend access to medical aid in dying. Online consultations, which begin today, take on potentially contentious questions such as whether to change the standard 10 day ""reflection period"" patients are supposed to wait, whether to make psychiatric evaluations mandatory for all patients and whether the doctor or nurse practitioner should be obligated to consult the patient's family or loved ones. Along with the online questionnaire, federal cabinet ministers will be holding in-person discussions with experts across the country. Justice Minister David Lametti is kicking off the process with a meeting in Halifax Monday afternoon. ""Medical assistance in dying is a profoundly complex and personal issue for many Canadians,"" Lametti said in a statement. ""The consultations we are launching today will allow us to hear directly from Canadians and guide the path forward."" The government has limited time to tackle the complex questions around expanding the right to die, with less than two months to go before a deadline set by a Quebec Superior Court judge. In September, Justice Christine Baudouin ruled that the federal government's medically assisted dying law was too restrictive. Under the 2016 legislation passed by the Liberals, for a person to be eligible for a medically assisted death, the patient's death must be ""reasonably foreseeable."" Baudouin ruled that it was unconstitutional to limit access to medically assisted death to people who are nearing the end of their life. The decision, which only applies to Quebec, came during the federal election campaign and gave the government six months to address the issue. If no new legislation is passed by March 11, the ""reasonably foreseeable"" provision in the law will be suspended in the province. Even without the court ruling, the law was facing a review in the summer of 2020. The legislation itself requires that at least one parliamentary committee review medical aid in dying and the state of palliative care in Canada, beginning in the fifth year after the law came into force. Lametti said the government is using the opportunity to update the legislation across the country. ""Our government has committed to updating Canada's legislation on medical assistance in dying in response to the Superior Court of Quebec's decision,"" Lametti said. The consultations will also ask Canadians whether assisted death should be expanded to give people in specific situations access to a doctor or nurse practitioner's help to die: During the fall election campaign, Justin Trudeau committed to changing the law.

54,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-15T01:31:33.697Z,RCMP set up checkpoint restricting access in Wet'suwet'en territory amid clash over pipeline,"The RCMP have blocked access to a First Nation's territory in northern B.C., heightening tensions as government officials and hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en continue to clash over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.  The Mounties have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.  Meanwhile, the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs continue to assert their own laws — saying they want Coastal GasLink and the RCMP off the territory.  ""Being restricted on your own territory is against our law. We've always had free access to our entire territory,"" hereditary chief Na'moks said. The pipeline by Calgary-based TC Energy is meant to move natural gas from northeastern B.C. to the coast, where a liquefied natural gas plant is scheduled for construction. On Monday, B.C. Premier John Horgan said the project will proceed, that Coastal GasLink has all the necessary permits to build its pipeline, and that ""the rule of law needs to prevail"" — citing a B.C. Supreme Court decision that in December granted the company an injunction for unimpeded access to work sites.  Work in the area has been temporarily suspended with the exception, under an agreement with the chiefs, of some winterizing.  On Tuesday, the company released a letter from president David Pfeiffer offering to meet Na'moks on Friday. But the chiefs have said they only want to talk government-to-government with Ottawa and the province. Among the outstanding issues for Coastal GasLink is that the Morice Forest Service Road, which is subject to the injunction, remains impassable.  The RCMP said in a news release on Monday that the checkpoint is ""to mitigate safety concerns [and] … allow emergency service access to the area.""  It said the hereditary chiefs, elected government officials, journalists and people delivering supplies to the area will be allowed to travel through the checkpoint with permission from the operations commander. It said other people not listed may be allowed to move through the checkpoint, with approval.  The chiefs say access is being restricted, and that the new checkpoint came as a surprise.  Communication continues between the province and the chiefs through a separate process that started last year and isn't specific to any particular project.  Speaking to reporters on Monday, Horgan said those discussions need to continue and described the Wet'suwet'en as ""leaders in issues around self government and self determination and rights and title in Canada.""  The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs were part of a landmark Indigenous rights and title case at the Supreme Court of Canada, along with their Gitxsan neighbours. The 1997 decision affirmed that the Wet'suwet'en never gave up title to their lands but the matter has never been fully resolved between governments.  Horgan didn't say where the Coastal GasLink project fits into ongoing discussions with the chiefs, except to say: ""This is a pipeline — it's an industrial project and there's so much more at stake for the people of northern British Columbia than just this project.""  That includes the 20 First Nations that have signed agreements with Coastal GasLink and stand to benefit from the project.  Na'moks said the hereditary chiefs listened to what Horgan said on Monday and saw a contradiction between his touting of the rule of law and the First Nation's leadership in the area of rights and title. Horgan's stance ""weakens"" the province's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, he said.  ""Here we are trying to build a stronger relationship. We are a government, we'll remain a government, we are on our lands, we'll remain on our lands, and we will govern it as we see fit."" But Na'moks agreed with the premier's statement that the relationship has improved over the last year ""It is better,"" he said. ""This time last year we had guns pointed at us. So that relationship is better. Any relationship where you're not looking down the barrel of a gun is a better relationship.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-first-nation-gives-natural-gas-company-one-time-access-to-winterize-site-1.5424502 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/wet-suwet-en-coastal-gaslink-jan7-1.5417641 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-company-posts-notice-to-clear-way-1.5419257,N/A

56,Éric Grenier,2020-01-16T09:00:00.232Z,Conservative leadership fee makes this the most expensive race ever — but is it worth the price?,"The race to lead the Conservative Party is now the most expensive piece of political real estate this country has ever seen — with an entrance fee higher than any other in the history of Canadian party leadership contests. But is the job being overvalued? The Conservatives have set the entrance fee for the race to replace Andrew Scheer at $200,000, along with a refundable compliance deposit of $100,000. That non-refundable portion is substantially higher than the $50,000 required in the last leadership race in 2017. It's also much higher than the fees for every other leadership race held by other parties at both the federal and provincial levels. The only other leadership race to feature a six-figure entrance fee was the Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership contest won by Doug Ford in 2018. That fee was $100,000 — and it was quite a prize. The PCs were considered a shoo-in to win the provincial election scheduled for only a few months later, which did end in defeat for Kathleen Wynne's unpopular Liberal government. The 2009 federal Liberal leadership race — which ended up with Michael Ignatieff as leader — set the entry fee at $90,000. A slew of other races have had entrance fees of $75,000, including the ongoing contest to choose the next leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. The 2003 and 2013 federal Liberal leadership races also set the entry fee at $75,000, as did the 2015 Ontario PC leadership race and the contest that chose Jason Kenney as the leader of the United Conservative Party in 2017. Kenney was elected premier of Alberta in 2019. Choosing to drop that kind of money on a run for the leadership of the Liberal Party when it was mired in opposition was a leap of faith. It paid off for Justin Trudeau, though; two years after winning the leadership, he led the Liberals from third party status to a majority government in 2015. But the 2003 contest was to replace Jean Chrétien, the sitting prime minister. In 1993, it cost just $10,000 (refundable) to get into the PC leadership race. The winner of that one got to move into Brian Mulroney's office. There is no similar guarantee that the next leader of the Conservative Party will be the next prime minister. In fact, the history suggests the odds might be against whoever replaces Andrew Scheer. The French saying ""jamais deux sans trois"" seems to apply to Canadian federal politics: parties or prime ministers with two consecutive election victories on the scoreboard have, more often than not, won a third as well. Of twelve attempts by parties or prime ministers to win a third consecutive election, eight have been successful. That includes cases like Pierre Trudeau's string of three election wins between 1968 and 1974, which came after two wins by the Liberals under his predecessor Lester Pearson. Those who tried and failed include Kim Campbell, who attempted to win a third consecutive PC victory in 1993 after Mulroney's departure. The record is even better for party leaders who both brought their party to power and sought a third consecutive win. It's been tried seven times and ended in failure just once. Those are good historical odds for Justin Trudeau, less so for his future opponent. None of this takes into account the context of individual elections, of course. But even that can be misleading. Pierre Trudeau looked hobbled and vulnerable after being reduced to a minority government in 1972 — but his party won a majority government again two years later. By 1976, after 13 years of Liberal government under two prime ministers, the PCs might have thought their next leader would have a decent shot of winning — and he did, as Joe Clark showed (briefly) in 1979. But the cost of entry for the 1976 PC leadership race that chose Clark was just $500 — a ""good-faith deposit"" that would be returned to the candidate after it was over. Post-election polls suggest that the Conservatives still have some work to do to defeat the Liberals. The latest survey from Léger put the Conservatives three points back of the Liberals in national voting intentions (the polling firm had the two parties tied going into election day). The poll suggests that a change of leader might have a minimal impact on the party's fortunes. Léger asked Canadians who they would vote for with a few different hypothetical leaders at the helm of the Conservative Party. Rona Ambrose and Peter MacKay (who confirmed Wednesday that he's running) both turned that three-point deficit into a one-point advantage — no better than Scheer's losing performance in October. Jean Charest had no impact at the national level, keeping the Conservatives three points back of the Liberals (though he did boost the party's support in Quebec). It all points to a longer-term problem for the Conservatives, who haven't won an election since 2011. The party captured 32 per cent of the vote in the 2015 election and 34 per cent in 2019. With the exception of a few short-lived ups and downs in the polls, the party has been stuck somewhere around 33 per cent support for nearly eight years. The Conservatives have a big caucus in the House of Commons and a formidable fundraising machine. They have a dedicated and deep-pocketed base. That makes the leadership a prize worth winning. But whoever wins the Conservative leadership on June 27 takes over a party in a nearly decade-old rut — a high-priced fixer-upper that might need more than a new coat of paint.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mackay-tweets-leadership-1.5427544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A
57,Dan Ralph,2019-11-05T21:10:04.633Z,"From backups to starters, QBs Fajardo, Evans, Adams Jr. have emerged as CFL stars","Cody Fajardo, Dane Evans and Vernon Adams Jr. have made 2019 the year of the backup CFL quarterback. All three began the season as backups but when opportunity knocked, they answered the call and have become emerging CFL stars heading into the 2019 playoffs. ""That's the beauty of sports, you don't really know what you have until these guys get an opportunity to show what they can do,"" said Khari Jones, the Montreal Alouettes' rookie head coach and a former CFL quarterback. ""I know how hard it is, how much you have to do to even be halfway successful. ""I root for quarterbacks even when they're on other teams, which is weird. But I know how tough it is so I appreciate it when guys play at a high level."" Fajardo, Evans and Adams all got their chance to play due to injury. They've led their teams — Saskatchewan, Hamilton and Montreal, respectively — to a combined 38-16 record with the Tiger-Cats (CFL-best 15-3 mark) and Roughriders (13-5) finishing first in the East and West. Montreal (10-8) is in the post-season for the first time in five years and will host Edmonton in the East semifinal on Sunday. Quarterback injuries were a dominant CFL storyline as all nine opening-day starters went down. That forced every club to play backups, with some going three or four deep under centre. WATCH | Roughriders clinch West Divsion:  ""You'd like to keep the league's best players healthiest because they're the most exciting,"" said Winnipeg offensive co-ordinator Paul LaPolice. ""But I think it's good to see people play because when an older guy retires or moves on, people wonder, 'Who's the next guy?' ""This is actually good to see guys get opportunities to play so you can evaluate them."" Sophomore Nick Arbuckle was thrust into the spotlight June 29 when he rallied Calgary past B.C. 36-32 after starter Bo Levi Mitchell (pectoral muscle), the CFL's top most outstanding player last year, was injured. Arbuckle went 3-3 under centre and so when Mitchell returned, the Stampeders (12-6) were still contenders in the West before finishing behind Saskatchewan. Winnipeg wasn't as lucky. The Bombers were 7-2 and atop the West Division when veteran Matt Nichols suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. Winnipeg went 3-6 with backup Chris Streveler. But veteran Zach Collaros rallied the Bombers past Calgary 29-28 at IG Field in their regular-season finale Oct. 25 and is expected to start in the West Division semifinal at McMahon Stadium on Sunday. Collaros contributed to Fajardo becoming the CFL's feel-good story this year. Collaros was Saskatchewan's starter but suffered a concussion early in its season-opening 23-17 road loss in Hamilton. Fajardo came in and was 12-4 as the starter, resulting in Saskatchewan trading Collaros to Toronto in July before the Argos dispatched him to Winnipeg last month. With Fajardo ailing (oblique), rookie Isaac Harker led the Riders (13-5) past Edmonton 23-13 on Saturday to clinch first in the West for the first time since '09. Fajardo, 27, who'd been a backup previously with Toronto (2016-17) and B.C. (2018), threw for a CFL-high 4,302 yards with a stellar 71.5 per cent completion average. The Riders rewarded him in October with a two-year contract extension and last week Fajardo was named the team's outstanding player nominee. ""He's a pretty humble guy but he's got some swagger to him and some confidence,"" Riders rookie head coach Craig Dickenson said of Fajardo. ""You just don't see it displayed on the outside so much. ""He comes from blue-collar roots and I think that shows through when he talks to people."" Fajardo admits this season has been a whirlwind. But he's intent on finishing it the right way — hoisting the Grey Cup. ""I don't think I'll realize what kind of happened until after the season,"" he said. ""But honestly, I'll trade all of those things for a Grey Cup. ""There's nothing better than hoisting a cup over your head, which I've had the privilege to do ('17 with Toronto). The bond you build in that locker room when you win a Grey Cup with guys, it's different, it's special."" Hamilton's historic season — the 15 wins are a single-season club record — appeared in jeopardy July 26. Starter Jeremiah Masoli, the East Division's top player last year, suffered a season-ending knee injury in a 23-15 home win over Winnipeg. That forced Hamilton to look to Evans, a second-year player with one CFL start under his belt. The Ticats were 5-1 with Masoli, their undisputed offensive leader who'd thrown for 1,576 yards and nine TDs while scoring four himself. Evans, 25, lost his first start of '19, a 24-19 road decision to Fajardo and Saskatchewan on Aug. 1. But he led Hamilton to five straight wins and nine of 10 overall before backups Hayden Moore and David Watford guided the Ticats past Toronto 21-18 on Saturday night to finish the regular season 9-0 at Tim Hortons Field. The six-foot-one, 218-pound Evans threw for 3,754 yards with 21 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He added 161 yards rushing (4.7-yard average) with three TDs. Hamilton's Orlondo Steinauer, who tied the CFL record for most regular-season wins by a first-year head coach, said the Ticats were quick to support Evans when he became the starter. ""Quarterback is by far the hardest position to play,"" Steinauer said. ""You have to please everybody and we have some guys who want the ball, which is great. ""But they've supported him, they've given him grace. Tommy (offensive co-ordinator Tommy Condell) has given him grace. He's not going to play perfect (but) I haven't seen repeated mistakes. I'm proud of him but not surprised."" Adams' path to success is much more compelling. Twice he contemplated retirement after stints with Montreal (2016), Saskatchewan (2017) and Hamilton (2018), which tried converting the five-foot-11, 200-pound quarterback to receiver. ""I'm a Vernon Adams Jr. fan,"" Steinauer said. ""I was fortunate to watch him in training camp last year . . . what I saw was just a positive teammate who'd do anything. ""I remember him running routes, punting the ball. Just a fun person to be around. He's an easy person to follow and I see that in Montreal."" Adams Jr. re-signed with Montreal in '18 after leaving Hamilton. He began the year as the Alouettes' backup but replaced injured starter Pipkin in the club's season-opening 32-25 road loss to Edmonton, completing seven-of-10 passes for 134 yards with a TD and interception. Adams was 10-5 as the starter, guiding Montreal to second in the East Division and double-digit victories for the first time since 2012. He was named the Alouettes' outstanding player nominee (3,942 yards passing, 24 TDs, 394 rushing yards, 12 touchdowns). ""He's just a winner,"" Jones said. ""That's one thing you want to be known as a quarterback, a guy who finds ways to win games. ""He never gives up, he fights, he makes plays with his feet and throwing the ball."" Jones isn't surprised to see Fajardo, Evans and Adams Jr., all emerge as bona-fide CFL stars. ""You almost have to see it because guys get older and guys change,"" he said. ""Once you get that opportunity and show you can play, then the league kind of changes over. ""It's a fun time to see a new crop of guys develop but it takes time. They were backups for a while and now they're getting their opportunity and making the most of it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-cody-fajardo-dane-evans-vernon-adams-jr-backups-1.5348772,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/japan-cfl-partnership-ambrosie-1.5347157 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/defending-champion-stampeders-face-longer-road-to-grey-cup-1.5346351 https://stats.cbc.ca/football/cfl/player/46920 https://stats.cbc.ca/football/cfl/player/58980 https://stats.cbc.ca/football/cfl/player/64970,N/A

59,Anonymous,2019-10-22T18:47:21.662Z,"Warring Libyan factions committing possible war crimes, Amnesty International alleges","A leading human rights group said Tuesday it has evidence of potential war crimes by Libyan factions fighting a months-long battle for Tripoli, the capital. London-based Amnesty International said its investigation showed that the warring parties have killed and maimed scores of civilians, with both sides having launched indiscriminate attacks and using inaccurate explosive weapons in populated urban areas. Forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar, a veteran army officer based in the country's east, began an offensive to capture Tripoli in early April, clashing with an array of militias loosely allied with a UN-supported but weak government based in the capital. The fighting has stalled in recent weeks, with both sides dug in and shelling one another along the city's southern reaches. Amnesty said Tripoli-based authorities and the Libyan National Army (LNA) didn't responded to its questions about the strikes. Underscoring the report's message, at least two children were killed in Tripoli when a shell hit their home Tuesday, said Malek Merset, a spokesperson for the Tripoli-based Health Ministry. The government blamed the shelling on the LNA, which didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment. At least seven children have been killed by fighting in the past two weeks, according UNICEF, the UN children's agency. Amnesty International's report said airstrikes, artillery barrages and other shelling have struck civilian homes and key infrastructure, including several field hospitals, a school and a migrant detention centre, and have forced the closure of Mitiga airport, Tripoli's sole international air link. Mitiga, for months Tripoli's only functioning airport, was repeatedly targeted by LNA airstrikes. The LNA has said the militias use parts of the airport as a military facility. ""Our on-the-ground investigation on both sides of the front line revealed a systematic disregard for international law fuelled by the continued supply of weapons to both sides in violation of a UN arms embargo,"" said Donatella Rovera, senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty International. The Amnesty report said the presence of fighters at or near civilian homes and medical facilities endangered civilians there. ""What kind of war is this, killing civilians, families, in their homes? What can we do? May God help us,"" one woman was quoted by Amnesty as saying. The group said the woman's husband, a 56-year-old father of six, was killed when a rocket struck his bedroom, where he was resting after returning home from playing football on April 16. Amnesty blamed the LNA for that attack in the Abu Salim neighbourhood, located a few kilometres from the city centre. It also said an artillery attack on the densely populated civilian neighbourhood of Qasr bin Ghashir by militia allied with the UN-supported government on May 14 hit a three-storey building, killing at least five civilians and injuring more than a dozen. ""The strike was massive; it sent a vehicle flying on top of another vehicle and for a moment everything was black.… It was a shocking sight,"" the brother of 19-year-old Ahmad Fathi al-Muzughi, who died in the strike, was quoted as saying. Months of combat in and around Tripoli have killed hundreds of people, mostly combatants, and displaced more than 100,000 others. ""Both sides use everything from ... unguided rockets to modern drone-launched guided missiles in attacks that could amount to war crimes,"" said Brian Castner, Amnesty's senior crisis adviser on arms and military operations. The fighting threatens to plunge Libya into another bout of violence on the scale of the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Since the 2011 uprising, Libya has seen armed groups proliferate and has emerged as a major transit point for migrants fleeing to Europe. The LNA is the largest and best organized of the country's many militias, and has the support of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Russia. But it has faced stiff resistance from fighters aligned with the UN-recognized government, which is aided by Turkey and Qatar. ""The international community must uphold the UN arms embargo, which Turkey, the U.A.E., Jordan and other countries have flagrantly violated,"" Castner said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/libya-fighting-tripoli-possible-war-crimes-amnesty-international-1.5330787,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/libya-conflict-cbc-explains-1.5090873 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rescued-slaves-coming-to-canada-1.5008268,N/A
60,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-25T19:22:58.757Z,'We would have been dead': Father outraged after engine fire puts family at risk,"Chris Dietrich, his wife and three young children were asleep when they woke up to a neighbour pounding on the door to tell them flames were shooting out of their garage and closing in on the house. The engine in the family's 2015 Hyundai Tucson had spontaneously burst into flames while parked in the garage. ""If it weren't for our neighbours, we would have likely been dead,"" Dietrich, from Ayr, Ont., told Go Public. ""If it were 10 to 15 minutes later it would have hit our gas line to our gas barbecue."" The fire broke out in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, after the vehicle had been parked for hours.  The company Dietrich hired to investigate found the fire started in the engine, but couldn't definitively determine why it started.  Dietrich is not the only one with an engine fire horror story. Since Go Public first broke the story about delayed recalls on Hyundai and Kia vehicles for possible engine problems, CBC News has been bombarded with stories of spontaneous vehicle fires and catastrophic engine failures.     George Iny from the Automobile Protection Association credits that CBC News investigation with pressuring the South Korean carmakers into action. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to determine if the carmakers were too slow to fix faulty vehicles. ""We dragged some of [our belongings] out and then we watched it burn until the fire trucks got there,"" Michielsen told Go Public from his home in Coaldale, Alta. ""I got away lucky because we weren't injured.""  Michielsen's vehicle has been subject to two engine recalls for different reasons. The first was in January 2018. He says his local Kia dealer inspected his engine and told him it was fine.  A few months later, the engine stalled and had to be replaced — only to catch fire earlier this month.  When he got home, he found a second recall notice in the mail. The latest recall brings the total number of recalled Hyundai and Kia vehicles to almost three million in North America since 2015.  The recalls have been for different defects that could lead to engine failures and fires, which is a problem, according to Gretchen Freeman Cappio, a U.S. lawyer who is leading one of several lawsuits south of the border over engine fires.  ""There are numerous problems with these vehicles [in which] the companies admit they have a recall but they don't have a fix … which is astounding when you say it out loud,"" Freeman Cappio said from her office in Seattle. Hyundai has the second highest number of engine fire reports among carmakers in the country — 21 over the past three years, according to Transport Canada. The company was seventh in car sales last year, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. Hyundai says it only has five confirmed cases of engine fires resulting from engine failures — saying that is a tiny fraction of the estimated number of its vehicles on the road.  Transport Canada has had three fire reports related to Kia engines, but the automaker wouldn't say how many it has recorded. Following Go Public's investigation into the 2.0L and 2.4L Theta II engines, Hyundai and Kia Canada did more in a couple of weeks than they have done since the recalls started four years ago. Kia added 79,301 vehicles to its recall list and Hyundai added 255,370 — more than double since the recalls started. Hyundai is also extending warranties for those vehicles.

61,Anonymous,2020-01-16T17:17:24.939Z,Canada calls for an independent criminal investigation into Flight PS752 crash,"Canada and its international partners are pushing for an independent criminal investigation into the destruction of the Ukrainian passenger flight in Iran last week that killed all 176 people aboard, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said this morning. The minister was in London, U.K. today to chair the first meeting of an international co-ordination and response group made up of representatives of nations that lost citizens in the crash: Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. After a day of closed-door meetings, ministers from the five nations emerged with a framework for co-operation with Iran. Watch: Champagne says the world is watching Iran Among other things, the framework calls for an ""independent criminal investigation, followed by transparent and impartial judicial proceedings,"" said Champagne. ""The world is watching,"" he added. ""There's a path for Iran to continue in the first step they've done, which is to admit full responsibility. And when you admit full responsibility, there are consequences that flow from them and full cooperation is part of that."" The international group's other demands include: The gathering at Canada House on London's Trafalgar Square began with a small ceremony of remembrance, with the five ministers each lighting a separate wick on a single candle and pausing for a moment of silence. Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok attended the meeting to brief the ministers on lessons learned during his country's five-year probe of the crash of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. Investigators concluded the aircraft was shot down by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Under international law, Iran is leading the aviation investigation because the crash occurred within its borders, but there are precedents for handing that responsibility over to another country that suffered losses. On Wednesday, Transport Minister Marc Garneau said Iran is co-operating with the two Canadian Transportation Safety Board investigators on the scene, but Canada still wants official status in Iran's investigation — which would allow Canadian officials to take part in the analysis of the flight recorders' data. ""We are judging Iran every day, demand by demand. Yes, we have good first steps from Iran. But obviously, this is a long process,"" said Champagne. ""So our vision, our assessment is based on the state of facts today. We have proposed a number of things to the Iranian government."" Besides pushing Iran to compensate the victims' families, the prime minister's parliamentary secretary, Omar Alghabra, said the government also is considering offering family members of the victims a form of interim compensation while they wait for settlement of their compensation claims against Iran. ""We are actively exploring these options and we hope a decision will be made in short order,"" Alghabra said.  Watch: Champagne outlines demands from grieving nations",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-london-meeting-1.5428925,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/carleton-university-mourns-plane-crash-victims-1.5428623 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649,N/A
62,Anonymous,2019-05-24T21:52:48.816Z,Alberta leaders cheer court ruling against B.C. bid to regulate bitumen shipments,"Alberta political leaders from both sides of the aisle are applauding a court ruling in British Columbia saying the government of that province doesn't have the right to impose laws that could kill the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. In a unanimous decision released on Friday, B.C.'s Court of Appeal ruled the province cannot restrict oil shipments through its borders. The ruling marks a win for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and Alberta's efforts to get its resources to overseas markets. The province filed a constitutional reference question to the B.C. Court of Appeal that asked whether it had the authority to create a permitting regime for companies that wished to increase their flow of diluted bitumen. A five-judge panel agreed unanimously that the amendments to B.C.'s Environmental Management Act were not constitutional because they would interfere with the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over interprovincial pipelines. B.C. can't impose environmental laws that could kill the Trans Mountain pipeline, court rules Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, speaking in Toronto, said he was ""delighted"" by the ruling. ""We're delighted with the unanimous decision of the B.C. appeal court striking down the B.C. New Democrats' outrageous effort to block Alberta energy. This is an affirmation that Canada is an economic union, and that one province cannot block another province's resources and assets,"" Kenney said. Kenney was in Toronto to meet with Mayor John Tory, promote Alberta as a place to do business, and cultivate economic partnerships with Ontario. ""This is a critical, strategic victory for Alberta, and it gives us renewed hope that we're going to get coastal access and a fair price for Canadian energy,"" Kenney said. Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage called it a ""great day"" at a news conference in Calgary. ""It added to the momentum we've been seeing lately,"" Savage said. ""We've only been in for less than four weeks, and we've seen momentum on Bill C-69 and Bill C-48, and this adds to it. And I think it's just a great day for Alberta."" It's official: Courts have unanimously ruled that B.C. has no authority to ban Alberta oil in a pipeline.<a href=""https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@JustinTrudeau</a>, it's time for you to do the right thing. Stand up for Alberta and all of Canada and build <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TMX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TMX</a>, now. <a href=""https://t.co/uhePPNx0qd"">pic.twitter.com/uhePPNx0qd</a> Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley also cheered the result of the court reference, saying it helps make the case for the pipeline stronger. ""Turns out B.C.'s toolbox was more Fisher Price than DeWalt. Alberta's oilsands have helped build this country, and today is a good day for people with toolboxes all across Canada,"" she said in a statement. Premier Horgan's minority NDP government took power in 2017 on a promise to use ""every tool in the toolbox"" to stop the pipeline expansion. The federally-owned company building the project also welcomed the court's decision, saying it agreed with Ottawa's stance that B.C. was overstepping its bounds with its amended legislation. ""Trans Mountain shares the value Canadians and British Columbian's place on our environment and our coast and will continue to build on the knowledge and understanding we have gained over our 65 years of operations and transporting petroleum products to the West Coast,"" the company said in a statement provided to CBC News. B.C. Court of Appeal Justice Mary Newbury wrote on behalf of the panel that the substance of the proposed amendments were to place conditions on and, if necessary, prohibit the movement of heavy oil through a federal undertaking. Newbury also wrote that the legislation is not just an environmental law of ""general application,"" but is targeted at one substance, heavy oil, in one interprovincial pipeline: the Trans Mountain expansion project. The B.C. government says it plans to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which must automatically hear reference cases. The province announced the legislative amendments in January 2018, sparking a trade war with Notley, then the Alberta premier, who retaliated with a ban on B.C. wines in her province. Premier John Horgan eased the tension by promising to file a reference case asking the Appeal Court whether the amendments were constitutional, prompting Notley to suspend the wine ban in February 2018. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline and expansion project for $4.5 billion. Construction was paused last August after the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the federal permits. The project would triple the pipeline's capacity to carry diluted bitumen from the Edmonton area to Metro Vancouver, and increase the number of tankers in Burrard Inlet seven-fold. Tim McMillan, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), says the whole episode has been frustrating. ""The court came back very quickly, it came back unanimous and it reaffirmed what everyone felt was the case before it started,"" he said. ""The cost of blocking pipelines, the utilization of our court systems as a tool to stop investment in Canada's resource development, is inappropriate. And it costs all Canadians when this happens."" The Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA) praised the court decision for making it clear that pipelines that cross provincial boundaries must be federally regulated.  ""This decision provides critical clarity for Trans Mountain and future interprovincial pipeline projects,"" said CEPA president Chris Bloomer in a release.  ""This kind of clarity is now needed around Canada's environmental and regulatory processes to ensure Canada can attract new projects and investors.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trans-mountain-bc-ruling-reaction-kenney-notley-court-restrict-shipments-1.5148866,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trans-mountain-bc-appeal-court-government-response-1.5148568,N/A
63,Anonymous,2016-05-04T16:04:20.061Z,Medical errors may be 3rd leading cause of death in U.S.,"Medical errors are underestimated and could be the third leading cause of death in the U.S., say doctors calling for more transparency internationally.  Death certificates in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. rely on a mortality coding system — the International Classification of Disease code, or ICD — that doesn't capture fatal consequences due to failures in health care. The ICD is used in medical record-keeping in 117 countries, including Canada.  Estimates of how often people die not from a disease but from the care they received is based on limited and outdated methods, Prof. Martin Makary and research fellow Michael Daniel, of Baltimore-based Johns Hopkins University, say in Wednesday's issue of The BMJ (formerly the British Medical Journal). ""People tend to think about an individual doctor's mistake, but we're really talking much more broadly about system failures, about wrong diagnosis, about medication errors and communication breakdowns,"" Makary said in an interview. Makary looked at four U.S. studies from 1999 onwards. He compared the death rates to hospital admissions in 2013 and extrapolated an estimate of how many people died due to medical error that year: 251,454. If confirmed, and if deaths from medical errors were considered a disease, then medical errors would rank as the third leading cause of death in the U.S. after heart disease and cancer, based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list, the researchers say. Some hospitals in Canada and the U.S. only collect patient safety information on a voluntary basis. This includes diagnostic errors, errors in planning and anything else that affects safety. He proposes ways to estimate medical errors more accurately, make health-care systems more reliable and share findings in the U.S. and internationally:  A landmark Canadian report in 2004 found 7.5 per cent of patients admitted to acute care hospitals in Canada in 2000 experienced one or more adverse events — which refers to things like wrongly administered medications, bed sores, falls, infections and surgical errors. More recent international studies showed rates of adverse events in hospital of between 10 and 14 per cent.        ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736,[],N/A
64,Dela McDonald,2019-04-01T10:00:00.801Z,"As an autistic parent to an autistic child, I implore you: accept us","As an autistic parent to a child with classic, non-verbal autism, I'm here to tell you: it's OK. We're OK. We are not a damaged version of a ""normal"" brain. We are conceived autistic, born autistic, and we will live our entire lives autistic. There is no non-autistic child hiding beneath the autistic one. You see, the line between her autism and my autism is non-existent. There are certain things I cannot do, and the ability to pass as non-autistic can even be a detriment to me, because it masks my struggles. I am a valuable — even productive — member of society, and I also have support needs. We grow and learn to adapt, but the way we are wired and the way that we think will remain a constant. We represent one facet of the human condition, one neurological type in a beautifully neurodiverse world. You may be surprised to know that we are a fairly large minority. In Canada, an estimated one in 66 children ages five to 17 have been diagnosed. And many of us are proud of the way our brains work! Without this uniquely autistic ability to focus and systemize, it's unlikely that Alan Turing, BBC's Person of the Year, would have invented the predecessor to the computer and cracked the enigma code that helped end the Second World War. It's unlikely that many other innovations in art, science and technology would have come about. We're over-represented in creative and research fields. And as a parent to a child who will likely need some degree of support her whole life, I can say with absolute certainty that I don't wish for a cure. Something does desperately need to change, but it's not her. It's the way we think about autism, and disability as a whole. The world is not arranged with us in mind. Herein lies the problem of autism being an invisible disability. The very things that make a community often don't consider accessibility beyond the wheelchair ramp. Our needs aren't complicated, either. Often it comes down to noise, lighting, clear communication, and the ability to move about freely without judgement. The therapies that we're handed upon diagnosis, typically based on the principles of Ivar Lovaas's Applied Behaviour Analysis, or ABA, are often intended to teach autistic children to mask the behaviours that they use to regulate their thoughts, bodies and emotions.  Much of the information that is common knowledge about autism doesn't come from autistic people. It is created by people employed in a field that seeks to make us seem ""indistinguishable from our peers."" This same field does little to address a person's needs once they reach adulthood, including rampant underemployment and mental health challenges. There are autistic people working tirelessly to create better lives for all autistic people. They were once the children being told to sit still, be quiet, and put the square peg in the square hole to earn a fraction of a candy. They're the adults who weren't diagnosed as children and struggled without supports. They are advocates, and not surprisingly, often parents to autistic children themselves. The voices of a community should be considered the foremost experts on the needs of the individuals within it. That is why, during this month of ""autism awareness,"" I urge you to go a step further. Accept us. Accept that we exist, accept that we can speak for ourselves, and accept that we will always be here. See our strengths and lean into our interests. Connect us with our community and other people who think like we do. Open your mind to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of others who may not think like you. That is, after all, the very basis of empathy. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

65,Tony Davis,2020-01-05T19:59:38.024Z,Tyne Valley hoping Kraft Hockeyville might help with arena reconstruction,"Members of the Tyne Valley hockey community are rallying to get a rink destroyed by fire nominated for the Kraft Hockeyville contest. The contest has a top prize of $250,000 to be put toward arena upgrades. The Tyne Valley Community Sports Centre was destroyed by fire early last Sunday. ""We don't have an arena now, and you know, we feel with everyone's support we have a great chance to be successful in this bid,"" said Adam MacLennan, the rink's manager now chairing the fundraising committee. MacLennan said before the arena burned down there were no plans for a ""large bid"" for the contest because the province had already approved a major project. ""Before the fire went through the area, you know, we were already approved for a $1-million project to replace the floor,"" he said. Jarod Colwill, president of the Tyne Valley Minor Hockey Association, said he thinks the area would have had a good shot at earning a nomination even if the fire hadn't happened. He said he thinks Tyne Valley has an even better shot now. ""We are going to support the rink board in every way to get this done because our Tyne Valley minor hockey is booming right now,"" he said. ""We have the most kids we have ever had playing hockey in the area,"" he said. Even if the rink could be nominated and could go on to win the contest, $250,000 is not enough to build a new area. But MacLennan said it would certainly help. ""The rink doesn't have a lot of money to begin with,"" he said. ""It is important for us, it is important for the rink, it is important for the community and P.E.I. come together and to be successful in helping us in the bid,"" he said. MacLennan said when O'Leary was able to win the contest in 2017 the entire Island showed support, and Tyne Valley will need support at the same level. MacLennan said the hope would be to combine money from the contest, if successful, with money raised through other community fundraising. ""We're all a bunch of younger people,"" he said. ""We are ambitious. We are go-getters. That's what we are. ""You know, you don't know what you can do. Obviously, if we could raise a million dollars for a new rink that would be astronomical."" The contest requires a story to be submitted about the rink and what hockey means to the community. MacLennan said he thinks Tyne Valley will have no problem showing how much hockey and the rink means to the community. The arena has a storied history. MacLennan said Gerard Gallant, who coaches the Las Vegas Golden Knights, skated at the rink when he was younger, as well as former NHL player Morgan Ellis. ""I don't think we are going have any issue demonstrating a good emotional powerful story to help us with our nomination,"" he said. Nominations for the contest close on Feb. 9 and MacLennan said Islanders can help by going to the Kraft Hockeyville website or the Tyne Valley Kraft Hockeyville Facebook page. The official kick off for Tyne Valley's bid for their rink is 9:30 a.m on Jan. 11 at the arena parking lot. ""We're hoping hundreds and hundreds of people come out to this for a large group picture showing our passion and community pride around our arena,"" he said. The situation in Tyne Valley has gained a lot of attention. On Saturday night, Hockey Night In Canada gave a shout out to minor hockey players in Tyne Valley and to surrounding rinks who opened up ice times to help.

66,Anonymous,2014-10-30T02:36:31.758Z,TDSB votes to end Confucius Institute partnership,"The Toronto District School Board ended a planned partnership with China's government-funded Confucius Institute, a move likely to irritate Beijing just days before Prime Minister Stephen Harper is expected to visit. Trustees at TDSB, which oversees public schools with 232,000 students, severed ties to the language and cultural program in a 20 to 2 vote on Wednesday after parents, teachers and students protested against any involvement of the Chinese government in Canadian schools. ""It is clear to me that this partnership is not aligned with TDSB and community values, and its continuation is not appropriate,"" Trustee Pamela Gough said in an email. ""My concern is that the Confucius Institute is directly controlled by the Communist Party of China, and there is irrefutable evidence that the party exerts its influence through (the institute), for example in restricting freedom of speech on the part of (its) teachers hired in China,"" said Gough. The move follows similar cancellations of Confucius Institute programs at universities in Canada and the United States amid concerns they restrict academic freedom, conduct surveillance of Chinese students abroad and promote the political aims of China's ruling Communist Party. The cancellation could further strain bilateral relations between Ottawa and Beijing. Harper is set visit China next week ahead of a multilateral summit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday, as the two countries seek to resolve disputes over cybersecurity and spying. The Prime Minister's Office was not immediately available for comment, and representatives of the Confucius Institute also could not be reached. China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has rejected criticism of the Institute, saying after previous cancellations that it was ""impossible"" that the programs would threaten academic freedom or integrity. Relations between the two countries were damaged when China detained a Canadian couple living near its sensitive border with North Korea on suspicion of espionage in August. No formal charges have been brought against the couple, Kevin and Julia Garratt, who are being held separately in near isolation, according to their son. Charles Burton, a professor at Brock University, said Beijing is certain to take note of the high-profile cancellation of the Confucius Institute in Toronto schools. ""It will be taken very badly in China for sure,"" said Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who served two tours in China. ""Canada's reputation in China as being hostile to Chinese foreign policy  goals will be enhanced by the fact of Canada's largest school board causing the Chinese side to lose face by openly and publicly denouncing the idea of a Confucius Institute,"" he said. The full board of Toronto school trustees is expected to vote to end the nascent partnership at about 7 p.m. ET/2300 GMT, endorsing a recommendation earlier in October by a small committee of trustees to terminate the programme before it had even been rolled out. Toronto had initially hoped to use the Confucius Institute, a non-profit whose purpose is to promote Chinese culture and connections around the world, to offer mostly after-school programming to teach Mandarin, Chinese art and culture to elementary students. But a groundswell of opposition from those opposed to giving the Chinese government any access to Canadian school children stopped the partnership before it got started, even though some trustees and teachers argued the program was a good way to offer enrichment opportunities sought by students. Mandarin classes are popular in some parts of Canada among students and parents who see the language as a path to an international career. Chinese is the third most spoken language in Canada, after English and French, and about 10.5 per cent of newcomers to Canada between 2006 and 2011 were from China, according to Statistics Canada. Earlier in October, Pennsylvania State University ended its five-year relationship with the institute, citing differences with the Chinese government agency that controls and funds it, and the University of Chicago severed its ties in September. While some Canadian universities have partnered with the Confucius Institute to offer courses in Chinese language and culture for credit, Brock's professor Burton said the high profile rejection of the institute in recent months means future partnerships are increasingly unlikely. ""I think any new Confucius Institutes that will be opened will be subject to more scrutiny and lead to the same kind of popular response,"" said Burton. ""The discourse is that they are a negative, and aren't of benefit to the recipient."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805,[],N/A
67,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2018-12-14T13:26:45.128Z,'It's creepy': Security cameras spotted in plastic surgeon's consult room,"A Toronto plastic surgeon who may be filming patients in states of undress without their consent is being investigated by both the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario and the province's privacy commissioner following a Marketplace investigation. During a hidden camera investigation into the marketing practices associated with breast augmentation, a security camera was seen on the ceiling of a closed-door consultation room at the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, owned by Dr. Martin Jugenburg. Two CBC producers went undercover, one posing as a potential patient and the other as a supportive friend to document the consultation process for the surgery.  At Jugenburg's clinic, the producer was asked by staff to remove her top in order to have photos taken of her breasts for her medical file, which is standard for most breast implant consultations.  But the security camera spotted in the corner of the room was unusual.  When the Marketplace producer asked about the camera, a staff member responded that it was ""for the doctor's record,"" saying the office had to document everything for ""legal purposes."" Later, when the nurse entered the room, she said the camera was ""just a security camera, basically."" ""It's to protect you, too"" she said. ""And him. Like if someone ever said something happened and it didn't. Or stuff like that."" When asked if that has happened before, the nurse replied: ""No, never."" Brian Beamish, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, called the situation ""unacceptable"" and ""intrusive,"" saying it was the first he had heard of a camera being used for surveillance in an examination room.   Physicians using cameras for surveillance rather than strictly clinical purposes is ""unjustified and would likely be a breach of our privacy law,"" he said. WATCH: Brian Beamish explains why the presence of cameras for surveillance is a concern Beamish also noted that cameras for surveillance could impact the relationship between patients and health-care providers, suggesting patients may avoid seeking health care if they're uncomfortable being filmed. During the consultation, the Marketplace producer asked if she could have photos of her breasts taken in a different room, away from the security cameras; staff said there were cameras ""all around"" the clinic. ""I think that's wrong,"" said Beamish. ""[The patient] has not provided their informed, voluntary consent to have their images captured."" It's not unheard of to have cameras in doctors' offices under certain circumstances. At the South East Toronto Family Health Team (SETFHT), a clinic in the city's east end that is associated with the University of Toronto, cameras are used as a teaching tool for medical residents. Their closed-circuit system allows new doctors to interact with patients one-on-one while their supervisors watch from another room.  Prior to the appointment, the SETFHT asks patients if they are willing to be on camera. Patients are given consent forms and signs are posted underneath the cameras to remind people they're being filmed. If patients prefer, they can choose not to be filmed at all.  This was not an option during Marketplace's visit to Jugenburg's clinic. The surgeon — known online as Dr. 6ix — is well-known for posting videos of his operations on social media. He has more than 100,000 followers on his Instagram account, which notes that the content of his account is for educational purposes.  On any given day, his fans can follow along as he performs breast augmentations, tummy tucks or Brazilian butt lifts, among other surgeries. Those videos are filmed with a hand-held device, likely a smartphone or tablet.  Even though Jugenburg's staff told the Marketplace producer that ""nothing gets posted to our social media unless you consent,"" Beamish said any recording could be problematic if a patient isn't asked for his or her explicit consent. ""First of all, [the patient] should have been notified immediately about the presence of a security camera, [she] should have been told whether that camera was on or off, and should have been asked for her explicit consent to have the camera on,"" he said. Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist with the University of Toronto, agreed that patients need to know when they're being filmed and called the experience captured by Marketplace ""creepy"" and ""very problematic."" He questioned whether staff would've even mentioned the presence of the security camera had the producer not pointed it out. According to SETFHT staff, the clinic's cameras only offer a live feed of a consult room — the footage is not recorded and stored.  That also appears to be in contrast to the situation at Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute. When responding to Marketplace's initial investigation into his marketing practices, Jugenburg mentioned he ""reviewed the entire consultation,"" which suggests the footage from the clinic's cameras is being saved. Beamish said he has concerns about how those images are being stored. ""How long are they going to be stored for? Who's going to have access to them? How are they going to be used? How is that doctor's office ensuring that they're secure? That people aren't looking at those images who have no right to look at them?"" he asked.  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record'  Jugenburg did not respond when Marketplace posed similar questions to him by email. Instead, he said that ""security cameras are present in the office for security purposes, with notice provided in our clinic, and appropriate protections put in place to preserve patient privacy and confidentiality."" The Marketplace producers did not see any notices indicating the presence of security cameras during their visit. Marketplace was not able to confirm how long the cameras at Jugenburg's clinic have been in operation. But based on videos from his YouTube account, cameras appear to have been in his some of his waiting rooms, hallways and operation rooms since at least 2014. Marketplace also spoke with a patient who had her breast implants explanted by Jugenburg last year. She said she doesn't recall seeing security cameras in the clinic and wasn't informed of any security cameras by clinic staff. Beamish said he plans to follow up on what was captured by Marketplace's hidden camera with his own investigation.

68,Rohit Joseph,2019-09-21T16:00:13.040Z,Rackets & Runners still serving Vancouver after 41 years,"Still Standing is a series about the small businesses in the Lower Mainland that have managed to stay open despite the challenges. Listen every second Tuesday on CBC Radio The Early Edition. When Vanda Borean stepped into Rackets & Runners as a 14-year-old customer in 1980, she was in awe of the sheer number of running shoes on offer.  Borean was a latchkey kid who enjoyed her trips to the specialty store because of the interesting products on the shelves and the infectious enthusiasm of the staff. She knew she wanted to work at the store someday. ""It's a store that always offered exceptional service, a great experience, but also great products,"" she said.  Borean maintained her interest in fitness and running while studying psychology at the University of British Columbia. During her studies, she switched her focus to business because she wanted to apply her knowledge in a practical way. After admiring the store as a customer and working 20 years at FedEx as a manager, Borean eventually achieved her dream of working at Rackets & Runners. She bought the store from one of the original owners, Lex Hoos, in 1998 after he decided to help athletic shoe company New Balance open its first retail stores in the city.  Rackets & Runners has served Vancouver's tennis and fitness enthusiasts on Oak Street for more than 40 years. Despite soaring land values and online shopping services like Amazon squeezing small independent retailers, Rackets & Runners has not only stayed afloat, but has managed to thrive.  Kevin Christensen knows this first-hand. Like Borean (his sister-in-law), Christensen was a customer before becoming a staff member at Rackets & Runners. Now, as general manager, he helps train the staff. ""I think why we've had success over the years is because we have great employees who really care about what they are doing,"" said Christensen. ""We have lots of great athletes in the store who play the sports we carry, so they walk the walk and talk the talk."" The local tennis community is especially appreciative of Rackets & Runners. Rik de Voest is a former professional tennis player and the tournament director of the Odlum Brown VanOpen, a local tennis tournament. He remembers a time when he had to go to Rackets & Runners for a specific piece of equipment. ""Lead tape is a special material that players use to add weight to the frame of their rackets,"" de Voest said. ""Nobody even knows what that is except for a specialty store [like Rackets & Runners]."" It also doesn't hurt that 19-year-old tennis star Bianca Andreescu recently became the first Canadian to win a Grand Slam title. Of course Rackets & Runners is not just for serious athletes. You will find people of all ages visiting the store and looking for shoes to run, jog or casually walk in. Borean says Lex Hoos, one of the original owners, drops by unannounced and is impressed that the store is still going strong. ""It's absolutely a beautiful time when he comes into the store, it's like a rock star coming in,"" said Borean. ""Even though he sold the business 20 years ago, to see the business still standing, still thriving, it makes him very proud.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/rackets-runners-vancouver-41-years-still-standing-1.5283406,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/caf%C3%A9-tucked-above-south-vancouver-lumber-yard-still-popular-after-60-years-1.5262482 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sewing-shop-on-fraser-highway-still-standing-after-more-than-five-decades-1.5193396 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/programs/theearlyedition/ross-miniature-treasure-house-is-still-standing-1.5122340,N/A
69,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2020-01-15T15:23:29.917Z,Hit-and-run trial adjourns abruptly over error involving accused's video statement to police ,"The trial of Maurice Johnson in the 2018 hit-and-run death of Brady Francis came to an abrupt halt Wednesday because the accused's videotaped statement to police had not been edited in accordance with the judge's decision. The Moncton Court of Queen's Bench also heard that the blood found on Johnson's damaged pickup truck the morning after Francis was killed was human blood, but did not match the victim's DNA profile. The trial will resume Thursday at 9:30 a.m. with testimony from an accident reconstructionist and the video of Johnson's statement will now be shown on Monday. Francis, 22, of Elsipogtog First Nation was found dead on Saint-Charles South Road in Saint-Charles, about 100 kilometres north of Moncton, on Feb. 24, 2018, around 9:40 p.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles, has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. RCMP announced the charge against him in June of 2018. Last summer, there was a voir dire on the admissibility of Johnson's five-hour interview with police and Justice Denise LeBlanc ruled certain portions were inadmissible. The trial was expected to watch the edited four-hour version of the video Wednesday morning, but Crown prosecutor Pierre Gionet informed the court he watched it on Tuesday night and noticed it did not match what had been decided. Gionet said he had difficulty sleeping when he realized the video couldn't be shown as scheduled, but said he required an adjournment to correct the mistake. The judge said she understood and was not looking to lay blame for the delay, but noted she had asked at least five times whether the video would be ready for viewing. She said she is disappointed for Johnson and for the family of Brady Francis. Outside court, defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux said Johnson understands the reason for the postponement. ""Mr. Johnson has been under the gun here for two years and he's hopeful that we can get a result here in the near future. But you know, as I said to him, we can do it quickly, or we can do it right,"" he said. ""This is not going to be fatal to the process. We'll be able to take a little bit of time and then we'll move on. So it should not be a problem. We have lots of time available to finish the trial."" Three weeks have been set aside, until Jan. 31. Earlier Wednesday, Lemieux asked the judge to declare part of an officer's testimony regarding blood found on Johnson's truck irrelevant. On Tuesday, RCMP Const. Ricky LeBlond testified he responded to a 911 call the morning after Francis's body was found from someone who wanted to report an accident. LeBlond said he didn't know who had called, but the address was the home of the accused and the front of Johnson's pickup truck was damaged. The grill was broken, the GMC logo was missing and he saw blood on the vehicle, he said. But Lemieux told the court samples tested by the RCMP lab and broader independent testing he subsequently requested showed the blood was not Francis's blood, he said. The judge agreed to disregard the blood-related portion of the officer's testimony. On Tuesday, the trial saw a security video of the victim walking on the road on the night he was killed and a tan vehicle passing by shortly afterward. RCMP Const. Caroline Thibodeau testified the video showed Francis walking eastbound on Saint-Charles South Road at about 9:34 p.m. The vehicle that passed around 9:40 p.m. was of interest, she said, because that was about the same time police received a 911 call about a possible hit and run. The accused had asked to be tried in French, but so far witnesses have been testifying in both French and English. The victim's family had asked that translation services be provided by the court. None were provided, but family members were told they could provide their own translation and there would be a courtroom available for them to use. On Tuesday afternoon, the family moved to the other room where Cheryl Haynes is volunteering to provide translation. ""I think that, you know, they are obviously in a time of need and they should be supported,"" Haynes told CBC News. ""It's not a time to be really separating whether or not it's an English or a French thing, but at this point it's really come down to that. And as a member of the Mi'kmaq family, we are all one … We are supposed to be there for everyone and I felt that was extremely important.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brady-francis-maurice-johnson-hit-and-run-trial-1.5427245,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brady-francis-maurice-johnson-trial-hit-and-run-1.5425595 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maurice-johnson-brady-francis-trial-1.5420604,N/A

The House passed legislation to implement the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) on trade 385-41, with 38 Democrats, two Republicans and one independent member voting no. The bipartisan vote contrasted sharply with Wednesday night's Democrat-only vote to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump. The House vote sends the measure to the Senate, but it is unclear when the Republican-controlled chamber will take it up. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said that consideration of the measure would likely follow an impeachment trial in the Senate, expected in January. The CUSMA trade pact, first agreed upon in September 2018, will replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump vowed for years to quit or renegotiate NAFTA, which he blames for the loss of millions of U.S. factory jobs to low-wage Mexico. The U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/USMCA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#USMCA</a> is a historic milestone in <a href=""https://twitter.com/RealDonalTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@realDonalTrump</a>’s effort to modernize our trade relations. This agreement with <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mexico?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Mexico</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Canada?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Canada</a> will allow us to work more effectively to achieve economic prosperity for our nations. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave CUSMA a green light last week after striking a deal with the Trump administration, Canada and Mexico to strengthen labour enforcement provisions and eliminate some drug patent protections. Pelosi said she was not concerned about Democrats handing Trump a political victory on CUSMA as they are trying to remove him from office. ""It would be a collateral benefit if we can come together to support America's working families, and if the president wants to take credit, so be it,"" Pelosi said during House floor debate before the vote. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter that the CUSMA was a ""historic milestone"" in Trump's effort to modernize trade relations. The changes negotiated by Democrats, which include tighter environmental rules, will also set up a mechanism to quickly investigate labour rights abuses at Mexican factories. They have earned the support of several U.S. labour unions that have opposed NAFTA for decades. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer made a concession by dropping a requirement for 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic drugs, a provision that Democrats feared would keep drug prices high and that they called a ""giveaway"" to big drugmakers. Some of the most ardent trade skeptics in Congress have voiced support of the deal, including Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents an autoworker-heavy district in southeastern Michigan. Dingell said in television interviews that she backed the bill, even though she was skeptical it would bring auto jobs back to Michigan. Rep. Ron Kind, a pro-trade Democrat from Wisconsin, one of the top dairy-producing states, praised new access to Canada's closed dairy market under CUSMA. ""A no vote is a return to the failed policy of the old NAFTA, the status quo, rather than this more modernized version,"" Kind said in floor debate. The agreement modernizes NAFTA, adding language that preserves the U.S. model for internet, digital services and e-commerce development, industries that did not exist when NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s. It eliminates some food safety barriers to U.S. farm products and contains language prohibiting currency manipulation for the first time in a trade agreement. But the biggest changes require increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region, to 75 from 62.5 per cent in NAFTA, with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum. In addition, 40 to 45 per cent of vehicle content must come from high-wage areas paying more than $16 an hour — namely the United States and Canada. Some vehicles assembled in Mexico mainly with components from Mexico and outside the region may not qualify for U.S. tariff-free access. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this week that automakers will pay nearly $3 billion more in tariffs over the next decade for cars and parts that will not meet the higher regional content rules.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/house-passes-new-nafta-1.5403272,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/what-nafta-changes-mean-for-canada-1.5391803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-cusma-usmca-trade-freeland-pelosi-trump-1.5390452,N/A

The K'asho Got'ine Housing Society has secured two housing units from the Northwest Territories Housing Corporation, including a four-bedroom house, and a three-bedroom house with a basement suite. ""A safe house for women is needed, and the other one is either going to be an emergency sobering shelter or a transitional house,"" said Arthur Tobac, who works for the housing society. The community of about 515 is in a housing crisis. In December, it hosted a three-day forum to try to address the need. The chief pointed to unemployment, alcohol addiction, and family dysfunction as factors, but ultimately there aren't enough places for people to live. There are about a dozen boarded-up buildings in the community. Fort Good Hope seeks local answers to housing crisis, hosts 3-day housing forum There's now a request for proposals for a safe house, the sobering centre and women's shelter. The housing society is looking for contractors to determine if the two existing houses are suitable for renovations. Tobac says the community is on a deadline for the projects. ""Time-wise it's very tight. We're trying to spend some money this year, and hoping to carry some of that into next year to get some of the construction of it started."" Tobac says the winter road season, and barge schedule are two other factors at play. A transportable sawmill has also been ordered. It's making its way up the Mackenzie Valley winter road, passing through Wrigley this week. ""The log homes of the late '70s and early '80s are still standing, and in better shape than some of the newer units. Maybe that will be our next move,"" Tobac said.

72,Barry Wilner,2020-01-20T02:18:27.404Z,Chiefs return to Super Bowl for 1st time in 50 years as Mahomes leads the way past Titans,"Arrowhead Stadium rocked to Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody."" Kansas City fans' half-century wait to boogie in the Super Bowl is over — in great part due to their quarterback's magical feet, not to mention his majestic arm. With his best imitation of a tightrope walker, Patrick Mahomes high-wired the Chiefs into their first Super Bowl since 1970. At last, for the third time overall, the Chiefs (14-4) are Super Bowl bound. WOW! 👀 This is why <a href=""https://twitter.com/PatrickMahomes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@PatrickMahomes</a> is such a special player! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChiefsKingdom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ChiefsKingdom</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFLPlayoffs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NFLPlayoffs</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/AFCChampionshipGame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#AFCChampionshipGame</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Chiefs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Chiefs</a> <a href=""https://t.co/defBq3OA7Q"">pic.twitter.com/defBq3OA7Q</a> In two weeks in Miami, they will play the winner of the NFC title game between Green Bay and San Francisco. ""I mean, it's amazing. It really is,"" Mahomes said. ""To be here, to be a part of Chiefs Kingdom and to be able to do it here at Arrowhead, these people deserve it. And, we're not done yet."" Adding to the joy of the achievement, coach Andy Reid and owner Clark Hunt accepted the Lamar Hunt Trophy — named after his father — emblematic of the AFC title. It was handed over to them by Chiefs Hall of Famer Bobby Bell, with Mahomes and safety Tyrann Mathieu jumping for joy on the makeshift stage. ""Chiefs Kingdom, we are going to the Super Bowl,"" Hunt said. The Chiefs lost in 1967 in the first AFL-NFL Championship Game — nope, it wasn't called the Super Bowl yet — to the Lombardi Packers 35-10. Three years later, one year after the New York Jets shocked Baltimore to lay claim to the AFL being equal to the long-established NFL, Kansas City was back. This time, it was known as the Super Bowl — indeed, Lamar Hunt is credited with coming up with the name — and his Chiefs hammered Minnesota 23-7 with the typical Wild West offensive flair and a staunch defence. Those are characteristics that helped carry KC this season. Reid isn't as animated as Hall of Famer Hank Stram, who famously urged the Chiefs team to ""keep matriculating the ball down the field, boys."" Caught up in the moment Sunday, Reid said, ""It's awesome,"" before asking the crowd to chant ""How about those Chiefs?"" Moments later, standout tight end Travis Kelce proclaimed, ""You gotta fight for your right to party."" There will be plenty of partying on South Beach for Chiefs Kingdom heading into the championship matchup. ""Fired up to go to Miami, got to get on a diet so I can fit into my clothes,"" Reid said. ""Very proud."" As they had done in their past three ""elimination"" games, the sixth-seeded Titans (11-8) got started quickly. The difference at Arrowhead as opposed to Houston, New England and Baltimore was that the Chiefs had Mahomes, Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins and Damien Williams on offence, and a vastly upgraded defence from when they lost in last year's AFC title game. Henry was held to 7 yards rushing in the second half. ""They were doubling all these guys,"" Mahomes said of his spectacular TD run on which he barely stayed in bounds. ""I just ran it and got some good blocking at the end and found a way to get in the end zone."" A week after they overcame a 24-0 deficit against Houston, the Chiefs had to rally again. Down 10-0 and 17-7, Kansas City didn't flinch, building a 35-17 lead while controlling the clock with a strong ground game. Naturally, Mahomes complemented that with sharp passing, spreading the ball on short and deep throws. The dagger came with a 60-yard completion to Watkins for the Chiefs' 28th straight point midway in the final period. Mahomes thrust both arms in the air as the crowd sang ""I Want To Dance With Somebody."" That somebody will be either the 49ers or Packers in two weeks. They were deciding the NFC crown later Sunday in California. After taking a 3-0 lead on Greg Joseph's first field goal — with Tennessee's penchant for scoring in the red zone, he hadn't been called upon in his previous four games with the team — the Titans got a huge break. Bashaud Breeland appeared to make a diving interception, but replay review showed the ball hitting the ground. Helped by consecutive offside penalties and a a fourth-down pass to Adam Humphries for his first career playoff reception, the Titans converted on, what else, Henry's 4-yard run. Then the Chiefs got rolling, scoring on three successive series. Hill took it in on a shovel pass, later beat top Titans cornerback Logan Ryan for a 20-yard reception, and Mahomes finished the half with his brilliant jaunt down the left sideline with half the Tennessee defence seemingly expecting him to step out of bounds. That gave the Chiefs a 21-17 lead. It went to 28-17 on Williams' 3-yard run to cap a seven-minute drive. Then Watkins toasted Logan for the clinching long pass. Henry was held to 69 yards on 19 carries after rushing for 588 yards in the past three games as an unstoppable force. ""That's what we were able to do coming in,"" Titans coach Mike Vrabel said of his team's running game entering the AFC title game. ""We weren't [able to do that against KC]. I felt we competed all the way there until the end. ... You don't prepare these types of speeches to talk to the team about at the end of the season or to talk to you guys (reporters) about the end of the season. That's where we're at."" The Chiefs easily outrushed the Titans on Sunday. Mahomes led the way with 53 of those yards and also was 23 for 35 for 294 yards passing.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/nfl/chiefs-titans-nfl-playoffs-conference-afc-finals-jan-19-1.5432731,https://stats.cbc.ca/football/nfl/boxscore/80736,N/A

These arts stand to be lost in the age of mass production and planned obsolescence. Robin Canham's fingers deftly weave a needle and thread into a stack of folded papers to stitch them together. She's a bookworm who's building her own book.   Canham learned bookbinding 15 years ago after attending a ""Friday night without a date"" event at a bookbindery in Toronto.  ""I just got hooked at that bookshop,"" she said.  Engaging in a craft that's more than a thousand years old is ""mind-blowing"" for Canham. ""I've always had a love of arts and crafts; I'm a librarian by day, so I think that probably says something about me.""  In her digital resources librarian role, she values and understands the need for information to be available and accessible online, but she still has a penchant for paper.  She's currently working on a rounded spine book, as well as trying to complete books from Keith Smith's Non-Adhesive Binding, which features different designs for creating books without using any glues. Many of the books she's made document her personal travels, things she wants to remember for a long time, or other information she values. Canham said the art of bookmaking has started making a bit of a resurgence of sorts over the last five to 10 years in Saskatchewan.  She thinks that's due to people's desire to create something original, particularly in terms of books or journals, which are typically mass-produced.  ""It's nice to take pride in something that you've done and you've created, some type of beautiful thing that you've brought into the world,"" Canham said. She said bookbinding and book artistry are areas that capture the interest of people from a wide variety of backgrounds, from photographers looking to create custom albums, to calligraphers looking for a medium to showcase their work. She said members of Saskatchewan's chapter of the Canadian Bookbinders and Book Artists Guild have had success in referring photographers, textile workers, artists and other creative people to their peers for guidance. She identified Lumsden as one area of the province where a number of skilled bookbinders and book artists can be found. She said the bookbinding community is ready and willing to share their knowledge with anyone who comes calling. Guild members attend workshops to share their knowledge with their peers.  ""When I first started you'd have to actually leave, or you'd have to bring in somebody from elsewhere in order to get that new knowledge or get those new skills transferred,"" she said.  ""We've got a very strong knowledge base here. We're very, very lucky to have a lot of the bookbinders and book artists here in Saskatchewan and be able to share their knowledge with everyone.""  Read other pieces from the Made to Last series:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-bookbinding-1.5403310,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-photo-film-recovery-digitization-1.5429355 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-luthier-1.5423298 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-venice-tailors-1.5402224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-franks-shoe-repair-1.5403245,N/A

Since the Taal volcano started spewing lava, steam and ash into the sky south of the Philippine capital of Manila on the weekend, at least 38,000 people in the area have been evacuated to more than 200 evacuation centres, as officials warn of a bigger, more dangerous eruption. Darren Sangalang, who lives in Winnipeg, was visiting relatives when the nearby volcano erupted Sunday afternoon. ""It was cool at first seeing the volcano erupt, and then when it started getting serious, I started getting panicky,"" Sangalang said. ""When the ashes started to fall, I thought it was serious,"" he said. ""But when it started raining mud and ash, I thought I should leave."" The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has set the volcano alert level to four, meaning a hazardous eruption is possible in days. Level five indicates a hazardous eruption is underway. The region can expect to experience intense unrest, continuing seismic swarms including tremors and ""low frequency earthquakes"" and profuse steaming along vents and fissures, according to the government's volcano monitoring report. Government work has been suspended and schools shut down in a number of towns and cities due to the health risks from the ash. Hundreds of flights in and out of the country have been delayed or cancelled. In an online statement, the United Nations expressed concern over warnings issued by Philippines' authorities that volcanic eruptions on the country's most populous island could last days, months or even years. Winnipeg resident Donna Cantiveros ​​​​​​said she felt more at ease when she finally reached Sangalang, her cousin, through Facetime, after seeing him post unnerving photos and videos of the eruption on his Facebook page. ""I'm happy to know that he's safe. Relieved that he's safe, and that he was able to evacuate, and he's with relatives now, [who are] taking care of him,"" she said. Cantiveros has an uncle, aunt and three cousins who were forced to flee their homes on Sunday. Since then, they have been sending pictures of them all lining up for emergency assistance. ""It just breaks my heart seeing my relatives line up for relief,"" she said. ""This is something I never imagined they will have to do one day."" Her uncle runs a plant nursery in the affected region, growing and selling fruit-bearing trees. Cantiveros worries he could lose his livelihood because all the plants have been covered by ashes. Now Manitoba's large Filipino community is fundraising to support victims of the volcano. With the help of Cantiveros, the Talisay Association of Manitoba has organized a fundraiser for family, friends and community members in the Philippines who have been displaced by the disaster. Only cash donations are being accepted given the urgency and logistical challenges, according to a Facebook post by the non-profit organization. Funds can be dropped off at the Philippine Canadian Centre of Manitoba at 737 Keewatin St., Wednesday-Friday from noon to 5 p.m., and on the weekend between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Cantiveros said they will provide a daily report online about how much money is collected and where it's going.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/local-filipinos-fundraising-for-taal-volcano-victims-1.5428444,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippine-volcano-1.5424088 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippine-volcano-manila-shut-1.5424576 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippine-volcano-trembles-more-spews-lava-1.5425940,N/A

Dr. Ajiri Ikede, a Dalhousie University graduate who works in Ottawa, maintains a licence in Nova Scotia to keep his options open. It's common for physicians to have licences in multiple provinces. Licences for Nova Scotia doctors expire each year on Dec. 31 and the annual fee is $1,950. Ikede incurred a late fee of $487 for paying his fee after Nov. 30, but before the end of the year. ""I said, 'How can I be late on something that hasn't expired yet?' And they said, 'Well, that's our policy as long as you don't meet our renewal window,'"" he said. Ikede compared it to home or auto insurance, and said it would be unacceptable to charge late fees early. It's up to each province's medical college to set rates and renewal rules. In New Brunswick, a licence is $600, but the late fee is $200. Ontario also charges a 25 per cent late fee, but that kicks in after the licence expires. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only other jurisdiction that charges a late fee before a licence expires. Ikede admits he was repeatedly warned by email that his fees were due. He's been licensed in the province since 2010 and never missed the deadline before. ""Imagine if you got an email the first week of November knowing that your licence is good till the end of the year,"" he said. ""That's not going to be on the top of your priority list of the other 150 emails you get that day."" Ikede isn't alone. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia said about 100 other physicians were issued a late fee this year. It said the late fees add a layer of protection for patients. ""Our legislation requires that a physician's licence is suspended if not renewed by year end,"" it said in a statement. ""When this happens, the first week of January may have cancelled surgeries or closed clinics or emergency departments."" Last year, more than 500 physicians renewed on the last day before the late fee took effect, the college said, while the remaining 100 were charged the $487 fee. ""These 100 physicians would have had their licences suspended by force of law, and patient care would have been interrupted dramatically,"" the statement read. Ikede said he understands the necessity for deadlines, but said the 25 per cent fine is extreme. He said it took five minutes to renew his licence online. ""The college is getting almost $50,000 every year just from late fees collected in the month of December,"" he said. ""That seems like a lot of money to me to be collecting and when you consider that the removal process is pretty much automated."" Ikede said he's so frustrated that he plans to stop renewing his licence in Nova Scotia. The college said it will waive Ikede's late fee and review the ways it communicates with physicians in the future.

76,Laura Kane,2016-12-01T15:36:15.834Z,Teen's therapy dog taken back by breeder,"Since Devon Wagner's dog was taken away, he says he feels like there's a ""hole"" inside of him. The 18-year-old suffered a life-changing concussion playing hockey six years ago. It caused blinding headaches and sensitivity to light and sound, forcing him to drop out of sports and delay school. His mother, Carolyn Hopkinson, got him a Labradoodle as a therapy dog in 2013 under an arrangement with a breeder known as a ""guardian home."" But this February, the breeder abruptly took the dog back, citing breach of contract. ""She completely changed my life,"" Wagner said of his dog, Savana, his voice breaking. ""When I'm really down, she's no longer there for me because she was taken away. I really just want her back."" The gentle black dog is now at the centre of an anguished legal dispute between Wagner's mother and the breeder. The British Columbia family's case, observers say, reveals the pitfalls of becoming a so-called guardian home. Hopkinson had never heard of guardian homes before she saw an ad for $600 Labradoodles three years ago. The single mom was thrilled to see the crossbreed, known for its sweet nature and low-shedding coat, advertised for a fraction of its typical $2,500 price. As she learned, the practice involves paying a breeder a deposit. The dog moves into one's home, but is returned to the breeder periodically to breed. After the dog provides a certain number of litters, the breeder refunds half the deposit and it becomes one's family pet. Hopkinson said she told Karen Firus of Dreamland Doodles she was concerned about the ""one-sided"" contract. The guardian home takes responsibility for a long list of care requirements, but the dog remains the breeder's property until the contract is fulfilled. ""She told me she would never take a dog out of a happy home,"" Hopkinson said. Instead, Hopkinson alleges in a small-claims lawsuit filed in B.C. provincial court that Firus seized Savana without notice in February. Hopkinson alleges Firus was motivated by the prospect of a ""breeding windfall,"" as the dog had sought-after light-coloured puppies. Firus alleges in a counter-suit that Hopkinson breached the contract by not advising when Savana was in heat, not following the schedule for vaccinations, flea prevention and deworming, not following medical care for an ear infection that turned chronic and not keeping her properly groomed. The breeder from Surrey, B.C., said in an email there is no factual basis to support the allegation that she was motivated by future profit. The contract requirements are not extraordinary and are in line with veterinary recommendations, she said. ""If the guardian home follows the contract and the dog is well cared for, then there is no reason to remove the dog,"" said Firus. Hopkinson said there were periodic shortcomings in her ability to uphold the contract due to her son's health, including on one occasion when she forgot to tell Firus that Savana was in heat. Her veterinarian wrote in a letter provided by Hopkinson to the Canadian Press that vaccinations slipped through the cracks when she moved from Richmond to Salt Spring Island and changed veterinarians. There was a plan in place to cure Savana's ear issues, and one time she had a matted coat, but this was common for dogs on the island, she wrote. Firus said Savana was now with a different breeder. Rebeka Breder, an animal-rights lawyer, said she does not support buying dogs from breeders, but it's not necessarily a bad thing for breeders to be able to seize the dog if it's not being cared for according to their standards. But she said often people don't read contracts carefully and don't understand the dog can be taken away. Canadian Kennel Club members have similar arrangements called ""foster homes"" for breeding dogs, but the club has oversight powers that allow it to mediate disputes and discipline breeders, said board member Richard Paquette. The club does not represent Labradoodle breeders as the dogs are not purebred. ""It's a real buyer beware of getting involved in any of these designer breeds,"" said Paquette.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/therapy-dog-taken-1.3876116,[],N/A
77,Richard Gleeson,2019-11-21T13:00:00.810Z,Giant Mine cleanup team says no to compensation claims,"After considering dozens of claims for compensation totalling millions of dollars, the team overseeing the cleanup of Giant Mine just outside of Yellowknife has arrived at a total amount it feels should be paid out for damages caused by the cleanup — zero. The claimants include the City of Yellowknife, boaters and the Yellowknife Historical Society. They want to be compensated for damages they say they are going to suffer when access is closed off to areas around the Giant Mine townsite including a city boat launch, the historical society's museum, and the Great Slave Sailing Club's boat yard. In filings with the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board, the cleanup team says it needs to close off the area to remove contaminated soil and sediment, put a covering over contaminated lake bottom and build a water pipe out into the lake for a new water treatment plant it is constructing. No one from the federal cleanup team or the City of Yellowknife was available for an interview for this story. In an email response, the city said it is ""eager to work with the Project and the Government of the Northwest Territories to avoid, or mitigate, any impact the Project might have on residents by exploring any and all options."" In filings with the land and water board, the city says that, until recently, the federal team overseeing the cleanup estimated the closure would continue for years. The team now says it will be far shorter. It says it is planning to build a new boat launch at the sailing club in an effort to avoid any interruption of people's access to Great Slave Lake while the existing boat launch is shut down. The biggest claim for compensation is being made by the City of Yellowknife. It wants to be paid $1.3 million for each year public access to the boat launch and sailing club areas is interrupted. The city is also claiming the full $34.5 million cost of replacing an aging underwater pipeline it uses to draw the city's drinking water from the Yellowknife River. In its response, the federal Giant Mine team says the city is asking to be compensated for work it wants done. The team said it initially planned to clean up the site to an industrial standard but, at the city's insistence and an additional cost of $35 million, the team is now cleaning it up to a residential standard. In its response, the team points out that the federal government has agreed to pay three quarters of the cost of replacing the drinking water pipe. It says the pipe has to be replaced because it's 50 years old, not because of the cleanup project. Members of the sailing club and boaters who use the city launch at Giant also filed claims. The sailors said the sailing club is the only place they can crane their boats in and out of the water, and if it's shut down for years it would render their boats worthless. ""Boaters, sailors and others navigating on water do not fit any of the categories, and are not eligible to make compensation claims,"" wrote the project team, referring to categories defined in the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act. ""They cannot make a claim on the sole basis of their boating and sailing activities."" The sailing club sued for lost revenue, including fees for membership, boat storage and sailing lessons. The cleanup team noted the lease agreement the club has with the city allows for the lease to be terminated with six months notice to allow for remediation work. The same provision is in the lease between the city and the Yellowknife Historical Society for the museum site. ""The recreational boaters who have submitted claims for compensation stand to benefit directly from the Project,"" said the cleanup team in its response to the claims. ""They currently make use of a contaminated site."" The land and water board has given the claimants until Dec. 5 to counter the federal cleanup team's arguments.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-cleanup-compensation-claims-1.5367353,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-claiming-compensation-for-cleanup-of-giant-mine-1.5332835 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/more-optimism-about-impact-giant-cleanup-will-have-on-boaters-1.5303605,N/A

RCMP Cpl. Jen Clarke said it appears his death was not suspicious. She said he was reported missing in the Saint John area late last summer. His body was found on Sandy Cove Beach on Sept. 8. Police are not releasing the man's name or his cause of death. Clarke said Nova Scotia RCMP would be assisting Saint John police to determine exactly what happened.  Last week, RCMP released a reconstructed image of the man's face after working with students in a forensic reconstruction workshop at the New York Academy of Art. Clarke said the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office had already been trying to identify the man with DNA analysis, and in the end the photo didn't factor into discovering who he was. However, she said investigators were impressed with the public's response to the image of the unidentified missing man and his clothing, of which police also released photos.  ""We're very appreciative of the amount of interaction we saw online — people trying to help and lending their ideas to the post, which is great,"" she said.   ""It was really overwhelming. A lot of people trying to track down the brand of pants, trying to track down boots — where they might have been purchased from, what they might have been used for, which might have helped identify the individual."" Sculptors spent a week in early January working to put faces on 3D-printed copies of skulls from the remains of 15 unidentified men found in Canada. It was is the first time the RCMP's National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains worked with artists in the program.

79,Aly Thomson,2020-01-19T10:00:00.835Z,These feral cats once roamed a remote N.L. island. Now they live in Maritime barns ,"It's quite a step up from roaming the rocky shores of a remote Newfoundland island in sub-zero temperatures, scrounging for food and shelter. After travelling 1,000 kilometres by land and sea, 40 feral cats from Little Bay Islands, N.L., are settling into their new homes in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  Most of the cats ⁠— 29 of them — have been sent to warm barns, some sharing space with horses and chickens. ""They're very cute,"" said Shannon Doane, who took in two of the cats to help with rodent control at her barn in Elmsdale, N.S. ""They're very skittish because they are feral, but they're not completely wild."" The cats were rescued by volunteers at the Halifax-based charity Spay Day HRM Society, who heard about the plight of the animals and their imminent doom due to the permanent departure of the island's 54 residents. Citizens of Little Bay Islands voted in favour of accepting government financial relocation assistance last year, meaning services like power and water were cut off on Dec. 31. Although the cats were feral, many were fed by and interacted with the island's residents, which raised concerns about whether they would survive once everyone was gone. After arriving at a makeshift shelter in Dartmouth, N.S., the cats were checked by vets and spayed or neutered. They were then assessed to determine where they should be placed. One of the cats ⁠— likely an abandoned pet ⁠— was friendly enough to be put up for adoption through the SPCA. Another 10 have been placed in foster homes in the hopes they will become socialized for eventual adoption. The cats considered too feral to be socialized were found homes through the charity's barn cat program. Cats live inside hobby or commercial barns and have access to food, water and warm shelter. Three of those felines have hit the jackpot. They're living in Wendy Stewart's guesthouse in the coastal community of Halls Harbour, N.S. Stewart said she originally intended to keep the critters in a drafty barn on her property, used mostly to store firewood. But she also had an empty guesthouse and so she decided to move the cats in there. ""These cats were just rescued from a cold place. I wanted them to be warm,"" said Stewart, who has only named one of the cats so far — Clifford — since she's waiting for the other two to show more personality. Stewart said the cats ⁠— two black and white and one all black ⁠— spend most of their time in a loft and occasionally leap onto a stack of rolled-up rugs to peer out of windows, surveying their new environment from high above. Once they become acclimated, Stewart will open up an already-installed cat door on the guesthouse so they can come and go as they please. She said the felines are already warming up to their new digs. ""I just gather from their posture, their body language, that they're more relaxed than they were a week ago when they arrived,"" said Stewart. Doane's cats are currently being confined to a horse stall in her barn while they become familiar with life in Elmsdale, which includes having chickens as roommates. They have a heated bed inside a large dog crate. There is a heated water bowl, cat tree, cat toys and bales of hay for climbing. She, too, has yet to name the cats, as she's waiting for them to show their individuality. She hopes they will eventually become socialized enough that she'll be able to approach and pet them. ""They've gotten comfortable enough with me that when I go in and feed them, if I sit quietly in the stall with them and read, they will eventually come out and eat,"" she said. ""The little black one is a little more adventurous than the black and white one and he'll come out and walk around the stall, around the perimeter, and doesn't seem to mind too much that I'm there."" Linda Felix, president of Spay Day HRM, said the cats have been sent to barns all across Nova Scotia and one in P.E.I. She said they were sent in groups of two or three and one group of five. ""They always have buddy,"" said Felix, adding there were three colonies on the N.L. island. ""We match them with cats from the same colony where they were trapped, so they went with a cat they would know and wouldn't be alone and afraid."" Felix said the cats currently in foster care are younger — between five and six months old — and so there is more of a chance they can be socialized. If not, they will find homes for them through the barn cat program.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/rocky-johnson-curtis-bowles-johnson-1.5429494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/border-collies-seized-new-homes-1.5428233 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/total-loss-fire-insurance-policy-recovery-guide-1.5429182,N/A
80,Janet Davison,2020-01-13T16:04:17.818Z,"Harry and Meghan: An unprecedented family summit, questions about Canada's role and a rift with Prince William","Hello, royal watchers. This is your biweekly dose of royal news and analysis. Reading this online? Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every other Friday. The most senior members of the Royal Family are set to meet Monday at the Queen's rural Sandringham estate in England in an unprecedented gathering to deal with an unprecedented situation — with tentacles that may reach into the halls of power in Ottawa. British media have described the gathering as ""crisis talks,"" involving the Queen and the next in line to the throne — Prince Charles and his son Prince William — along with Prince Harry, in an effort to find a way for Harry and his wife, Meghan, to step back as senior members of the family. Meghan, it's been reported, will phone in from Canada, where she returned to be reunited with their infant son, Archie, who had stayed here even as his parents returned to the U.K. after a six-week visit to British Columbia over Christmas. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their seismic revelation last week: that they want to retreat from their current royal life, seek financial independence and split their time between the United Kingdom and North America. There's been no official word to confirm that would, indeed, mean some period of their time would be spent in Canada, but everything points to that being on the table. British media outlets, including the Guardian, have reported Monday's meeting will be a chance to go over proposals drafted after palace officials consulted with representatives of the U.K. and Canadian governments. Items that could be discussed, according to the Telegraph, include tax issues and security for the couple. Both of those issues could have significant Canadian implications, such as what would the tax responsibilities be for Harry and Meghan if they were living, and maybe working, in Canada for some period of time each year, and who would pay for their security? Would some or all of that fall ultimately on Canadian taxpayers? While the ""crisis talks"" will deal with formal matters, there is also the sense Harry and Meghan's shocking announcement is causing more personal strife within the Royal Family itself. The Sunday Times reported Sunday that William told a friend: ""'I've put my arm around my brother all our lives, and I can't do that any more; we're separate entities.'"" William, the Times reported, went on: ""'I'm sad about all that. All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we're all singing from the same page. I want everyone to play on the same team.'"" On Monday, ahead of the meeting with the Queen, William and Harry issued a joint statement criticizing reporting about the family. A report on the Times of London's front page cited a source that alleged WIlliam had a ""bullying attitude"" toward Harry and Meghan that pushed them away.   ""Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a U.K. newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge,"" the statement said. ""For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful."" Author Penny Junor, who has written a biography of Harry, said she thinks the relationship between the two brothers ""has sadly broken down."" ""Harry has isolated himself from all those closest to him, and I think they are all very worried about him,"" Junor said via email Sunday — before the brothers released their statement and as media clamour around the family heightened. Reports have suggested that a froideur developed between the brothers after William cautioned Harry about the speed with which his relationship was developing with Meghan. Junor says that is a ""very significant factor"" in the breakdown of the brothers' relationship but suspects they had started to grow apart even before Meghan arrived on the scene. ""There was conflict over their areas of interest,"" she said. And then came last week's announcement. The way in which it unfolded didn't help matters. ""William was furious over the way the announcement was made,"" said Junor. ""Harry and Meghan had been specifically asked to wait before making the announcement, and they failed to do so."" The announcement itself last week caused anger and disappointment at Buckingham Palace, Katie Nicholl, author of Harry and Meghan: Life Loss and Love, said in an interview over email with CBC News. ""There's a sense of betrayal at the palace over how the Sussexes went ahead and made this public when they were asked not to by the Queen. ""How they come back from this remains to be seen."" There aren't many examples to turn to for how Harry and Meghan may try to carve out a role more to their liking. Certainly, there is nothing in the current family to offer any guide. But go back a few generations, and there is at least a bit of precedent for the decision to step away. ""There have been cases in the past of people who have been born princes and princesses deciding that they want a big change in terms of how their lives will unfold,"" said Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal author and historian. Take, for example, one of Queen Victoria's granddaughters, Princess Patricia of Connaught. When she married in 1919, she became Lady Ramsay. ""She wanted to have the same title as her husband, so she stopped using the title of princess and stepped away from royal duties and devoted her time to her husband and her son and her watercolours,"" said Harris. But that was a different time, and there's no suggestion there were issues wound up in that decision to rival Harry and Meghan's, which includes their stated desire to achieve financial independence and launch their ""new charitable entity."" Of course, there are examples of royals who have lost their royal duties in significantly different circumstances. The Duke of Windsor, for example, abdicated as King Edward VIII in 1936. For him, there was an interest in trying to find a role after the abdication. He was governor of the Bahamas during the Second World War, ""but afterwards, he was never able to have a successful public role,"" Harris said. He and his wife, the Duchess of Windsor, ""became public curiosities as they grew older,"" she said. In more recent years, there have been attempts by some members of the Royal Family to forge a career, but they haven't ended well, either. Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, ran into trouble when they tried. Edward's failed television production company was left with assets of only £40 when it was liquidated in 2009. And Sophie quit as head of a public relations company in 2001 after embarrassing comments she made were secretly recorded by a tabloid reporter posing as an Arab sheik and published in the News of the World. Amid the many questions that loom over how Harry and Meghan might carve out a new role, a major one is how their desire to achieve ""financial independence"" might work out. On a website built to promote their new initiative, a long section is devoted to trying ""to provide clarity on existing and future funding arrangements."" And part of that includes plans to cut their tie with the Sovereign Grant, the money the U.K. government uses to help finance the royal household. Harry and Meghan say the grant, funded by revenue from the Crown Estate real estate portfolio, covers just five per cent of their expense ""and is specifically used for their official office expense."" Craig Prescott, director of the Centre for Parliament and Public Law at the University of Winchester in southern England, said on Twitter that it appears Harry and Meghan ""are forgoing that five per cent to obtain greater freedom to operate as they please and to control more tightly how they work with the media, probably to use social media more."" It seems, however, that they will keep receiving income from the Duchy of Cornwall, which is held by Harry's father, Prince Charles. ""The accounts for 2019 state that it is worth around £930 million (around $1.6 billion Cdn) and the surplus from the estate given to Prince Charles was £21.6 million ($36.8 million Cdn),"" Prescott said via email. ""Some of this has been used to fund Harry and Meghan."" What's ""uneasy"" about all this, Prescott wrote on Twitter, ""is how they appear to be taking advantage of the complex and messy division between the public and the private when it comes to royal property. It's worked out very well for them."" Harry and Meghan also plan to continue to live at Frogmore Cottage (where renovations were also funded by the Sovereign Grant). ""So once again, to simply say that by no longer taking money from the Sovereign Grant means that they are financially independent from the monarchy is skating over a much more ambiguous situation, and the position is nowhere near as stark as the phrase 'financial independence' indicates,"" Prescott said. ""They will continue to benefit from the substantial expenditure covered by the Sovereign Grant for their refurbished property.""  The danger for Harry and Meghan, Prescott said, ""is that instead of increasing their independence, their proposed arrangements rely on the continuing consent of Prince Charles and the Queen."" If they thought Harry and Meghan's new activities would distract attention from or embarrass the monarchy, they could pull the plug, he said. ""As shown with Prince Andrew, both [the Queen and Prince Charles] are not afraid of acting decisively if required in the broader interests of the monarchy. Harry and Meghan will no longer have the defence of being full time 'senior royals' to justify the benefits they have received so far."" For example, Prescott suggests, what if those who are managing the Duchy of Cornwall on behalf of Charles decide to hike the rents of its tenant farmers ""while Harry and Meghan are photographed in Toronto with their celebrity friends and Instagraming a glamorous life in Canada?  ""The headlines in the British newspapers would be terrible."" All of this, Prescott said, makes him think ""that the details have not been properly considered."" The website that includes the section on Harry and Meghan's financial plans has a Canadian connection — it was created by Article, a Toronto-based company that describes itself as a ""digital creative agency."" Article founder Ryan Sax said it's been a pleasure to work with Harry and Meghan on the website. ""To know that they chose our boutique Canadian agency means so much to us, and I'm happy we could create something special for them,"" Sax said via email on Friday afternoon. According to the company's website, Article creates ""tailored online experiences,"" and its clients ""range from national brands to lifestyle influencers."" The website says Article doesn't choose projects based on size but works with brands it believes in and is ""particular about fit."" Along with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, it lists the Toronto Maple Leafs, Tim Hortons, the NBA, cannabis company Canopy Growth and Joe Fresh among its clients. Multigenerational photos of the Royal Family are not a dime a dozen, but there have been two within the past few weeks. First came the charming pre-Christmas shot of the Queen looking on as her son Charles, his son William, and William's son George stirred some Christmas puddings. And then to mark the beginning of the new decade, there was a more formal photo released of the royal foursome. Some speculation has focused on that photo in particular as perhaps being at least a partial trigger for Harry and Meghan moving forward with their plans to chart their own course.

Nova Scotia's live lobster exports to China have totalled $227 million in the first six months of 2019, up 144 per cent over the same period in 2018, according to the province. Nova Scotia's lobster industry provides the lion's share of the Canadian supply of live lobster. Meanwhile, U.S lobster exports to China have fallen off a cliff: the value of exports through June was about 75 per cent what they were through June 2018. Geoff Irvine, executive director of the Lobster Council of Canada, said the boost in Canadian exports to China — a massive and growing customer for lobster — are a result of the heavy tariffs imposed on U.S. lobster and other food products in July 2018. But Irvine said the American and Canadian markets are integrated, and so his group ""takes no pleasure in the fact that they're struggling."" ""Trade in lobster between the U.S. and Canada is very much back and forth. It's very much linked,"" he said. ""We would like to see it go back to normal, where we share the markets."" Irvine said Canada's lobster production seasons are generally different from those in the U.S., and so both countries buy a significant amount of lobster from each other throughout the year. He added that many companies have operations in both countries to ensure a year-round supply.  ""That means there's cross-border share holdings and cross-border ownership of companies,"" said Irvine. Leo Muise, executive director of the Nova Scotia Seafood Alliance, said the strained relationship between the U.S. and China has created uncertainty. He said it's also unclear what Brexit could mean for Canadian lobster exports. ""These geopolitical issues cause uncertainty, and uncertainty can cause a bit of concern,"" said Muise, whose organization represents roughly 120 small and medium-size seafood companies. Muise noted that despite the increase in exports, the price exporters are getting for lobster has not gone up. ""It's not like we can charge whatever price we feel like for our product. We still have to be competitive with other forms of seafood and other forms of protein,"" he said. More than 9,300 tonnes of lobster were exported out of Halifax Stanfield International Airport between January and June of this year, an increase of 115 per cent over the same period last year. Irvine said although exports to China from Canada have increased, that is consistent with the trend over the last decade. ""It's important to keep in perspective that almost every year in the last six to seven years we've seen double, 100 per cent increases in sales to China,"" he said. ""Nine years ago, we sold no lobster to China."" This fall, Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil will go on his second trip to China this year. Irvine said the Canadian seafood industry has been focused on diversifying its markets, noting the council led a trade mission earlier this year to Singapore, South Korea and Japan. ""We have to remember that the international trade environment is complicated and that we play a small part in it and that we have to be nimble and we have to be ready to shift,"" he said. ""Our goal is to increase the value, and we will need to go in the world where we can get the best prices for our product.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lobster-exports-canada-united-states-china-1.5259825,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/new-cargo-logistics-park-halifax-airport-1.4906860 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-lobster-exports-nafta-1.4448315 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/maine-lobster-china-canada-tariffs-yarmouth-1.4750224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/u-s-trade-war-drives-soaring-canadian-live-lobster-exports-to-china-1.4838547 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/stephen-mcneil-canada-china-trade-guangdong-1.5138735 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/catherine-tully-name-halifax-employees-getting-bonuses-1.5261610 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/international-students-driving-lessons-cape-breton-1.5260496 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/kentville-party-new-doctors-1.5261552,N/A
82,Erin Brohman,2019-07-04T10:00:00.278Z,Province looks for air transport staff as Lifeflight doctors refuse to fly,"The province is searching for nurses and doctors to help out with the air transport of critically ill patients, as Lifeflight doctors refuse to board the private planes Manitoba now relies on for its air ambulance service. On Tuesday morning, Gordon Jebb, a 53-year-old man from The Pas, suffered a massive heart attack. He was in a coma on life support all day at St. Anthony's General Hospital in The Pas while a doctor made repeated calls to try to get him transported to the waiting ICU bed in Winnipeg. ""I could just feel the frustration in his voice, I could see that he was frustrated that he couldn't do nothing to send my brother to Winnipeg, because they were told there's no medevac,"" said Patrick Young, Jebb's 59-year-old brother.  At 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 hours after his admission to hospital, a plane staffed with three medical personnel that Young said were paramedics arrived to transport Jebb out. ""I'm relieved that my brother's getting the help that he needs, but I was also feeling angry and frustrated, the process we had to go to get him there."" Citing safety concerns, the 17 doctors that staff Lifeflight have not been boarding air ambulance planes for the past two weeks, since the province grounded Lifeflight's two Cessna Citation jets. It laid off nine pilots and a maintenance crew last week in the final moves to privatize the service, ending the provincially run program's 34-year term. The province has used private air ambulance companies half of the time in the past year, which often use smaller King Air 200s. On June 28, Babcock Canada, in partnership with Vanguard Air Care, which is a Division of Fast Air, took over Lifeflight operations on an interim basis. Over the past year, Lifeflight physicians repeatedly warned the province they would stop flying if their concerns over the private carriers were not met. In a June 15 memo circulated to Manitoba's health authorities and clinical leaders, Shared Health chief executive officer Brock Wright issued a call-out, writing:  ""For patients with more critical needs, we may need staff from your areas to assist transport staff. Neonatal and pediatric transports are covered … but it is possible that some adult transports may need assistance. ""We are supporting government in working with private air carriers to match available staff to the needs of patients needing transport."" A rural physician whose clinic received the memo says lives are now at risk. ""People are going to die for unnecessary reasons,"" said Ashley Blais, a family medicine and ER doctor in Ste. Rose du Lac, Man. ""It affects absolutely everybody and everybody needs to know."" She said Shared Health's call-out for doctors and nurses across the province to backfill the medevacs puts unrealistic and unsafe expectations on staff. ""Most docs outside of the large centres do not know how to operate a ventilator. They're asking us to get on these planes and manage critical care patients outside of our facility and outside of our scope of practice and outside of our level of skill or training,"" she said.  ""Lifeflight is an ICU on wheels in the air. And there's special doctors and special nurses that run ICUs in any hospital."" She added remote physicians are not trained on the physiological changes that happen when a person's body is in the air, let alone on life support, and the situation draws northern physicians away from their patients.  ""Your local surgeon or anesthesiologist may not be available because they are having to step in for Lifeflight.""  Manitoba's health minister did not acknowledge the absence of Lifeflight physicians from the air ambulance program, but responded to Jebb's situation. ""While this patient was taken to hospital in Winnipeg without incident, it took too long to provide clinical transport. We have instructed departmental staff and clinical leadership to review this case in order to speed up that process,"" said Cameron Friesen, in a statement. He added a triage team decides from a combination of doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and paramedics on who staffs the planes, based on the patient's needs. He said patients receive continuous care between the Lifeflight teams and medical experts in their community. ""We continue to work to provide better service as the transition of the air ambulance program continues,"" he said.  ""This is completely unfair and almost completing colonization with northern Manitoba communities,"" countered Blais. She said those living beyond the 200-km radius outside of Winnipeg, which is the limit for where STARS air ambulance flies, are at risk. She wants the Lifeflight program, including its planes and pilots, reinstated. ""Most people that live in the north are native and Indigenous of some degree. I do feel that if there was a bunch of politicians that lived outside of the 200-km radius, we would be having a very different discussion,"" she said. Details on the request for proposals for a private company to take over the entire contract have not been released. In past correspondence to the health minister, Lifeflight doctors cited concerns about the private planes' smaller size, accessibility of heart rate monitors, issues with lifts and noise when compared to the Citations, as well as concern over a lack of meaningful consultation with government about the transition.  Amanda Lathlin, NDP MLA for The Pas, helped advocate for Jebb's family while they waited for a plane. She said she expected private planes, but not a gap in service for the north.  ""This is a crucial example that there's no plan in place,"" she said.  ""It just seems like this government is more concerned about saving money rather than saving lives."" Gordon Jebb made it to the Health Sciences in Winnipeg but is still unresponsive, according to family. His brother is calling on government and doctors to sort out their dispute. ""They need to do something, work together to resolve the situation before … people die. Plain and simple,"" said Young. ""People need that medical attention right away when they need it. And they can't wait at the hospital all day like my brother did today. That's ridiculous.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-air-ambulance-doctors-refuse-1.5199326,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-grounded-pilots-distressed-privatization-1.5166758 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/air-ambulance-doctors-lifeflight-quit-privatization-1.4896596 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-manitoba-air-ambulance-privatization-government-1.5190928 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-privatize-lifeflight-air-ambulance-1.5165554,N/A
83,Emily Chung,2019-12-03T13:51:45.998Z,Canadian communities are tapping into greener ways to heat and cool buildings,"During the cold, snowy winters in much of Canada, many of us rely on furnaces, boilers and baseboard heaters to keep our homes and offices comfortable — and hope they don't suddenly quit during a cold snap. But what if you didn't need any heating equipment in your home? What if your community provided a greener, more efficient, more reliable source of heat using locally sourced energy? What if it didn't take up space in your home or office building, you didn't have to maintain it, and it was just about guaranteed to keep running and keep you warm through big storms and power outages? That's the promise of district energy systems — along with climate benefits that have earned them an endorsement from the United Nations Environment Program. World leaders meet Dec. 2-13 for the COP 25 UN climate conference in Madrid to discuss next steps in implementing the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming, and district energy is one potential tool. The idea is that instead of having an individual heating and cooling system for each building, multiple buildings are hooked up to a single, central system — similar to the idea of hooking into a municipal water service instead of each building relying on individual wells. The heating and cooling is distributed to individual buildings through pipes that typically contain heated or chilled water. It's not new — some district energy systems in Canada are more than 100 years old. But thanks to environmental concerns and the desire in communities to use greener energy technologies for heating and cooling, new projects are popping up across the country. ""Yes, there's a real renaissance,"" says Bruce Ander, president and CEO of Markham District Energy in the Great Toronto Area. A past chair of the International District Energy Association, Ander has been working in the field for 40 years. More than half of district energy facilities inventoried in Canada in 2014 had been commissioned since 2000, and more than half of them planned expansions in the near future. They range from a project in Vancouver that recovers heat from sewer water to provide heat and hot water to more than 30 condo buildings to one that cools Toronto office towers in summer with water from the depths of Lake Ontario. And even smaller communities are jumping on board, including the village of Teslin, Yukon, which has installed a biomass system, and the rural municipality of Ritchot, Man., which has a district geothermal system. Many new projects are underway such as: Why? A major factor is climate change and climate change resilience. In Canada, buildings are the third largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after oil and gas and transportation, Environment and Climate Change Canada reports. And nearly two-thirds of energy use in buildings is for heating and cooling. Much of that comes from burning fossil fuels, either directly in furnaces or indirectly through power generation. In 2011, for example, natural gas was used to heat half of Canadian homes and electric baseboards were used to heat most of the rest, Statistics Canada reports. When buildings are individually heated, there aren't many green options. But Ander says, once a community has installed a district energy system, ""Now you can unlock a bunch of technologies.""  Many energy sources used in district energy systems, such as biomass, sewage, lake water or seawater aren't very feasible or economically viable on a small scale. The choice of energy source for a district heating system is what is available locally and can generate co-benefits for the local community. For example, Vancouver captures the heat from families' hot showers, dishwasher and laundry loads in its high-density False Creek neighbourhood. The waste heat literally is heading down the drain, but can be extracted at the nearby sewage pumping plant. ""It's a great opportunity,"" says Alex Charpentier, acting manager of the False Creek Neighourhood Utility that runs the system. ""In a dense urban environment, there's not many sources of local energy."" Charlottetown has little land for landfills and no equipment installed to prevent methane generated by rotting garbage from escaping into the atmosphere, so it burns garbage in its district energy system, says Carlyle Coutinho, president and chief operating officer for the Canadian region at Enwave Energy Corp., which runs the system. The heat is distributed through underground pipes carrying heated water. Meanwhile, Teslin, Yukon, is surrounded by boreal forest. Installing district energy means it can now heat buildings with locally sourced wood chips, generating jobs and keeping $300,000 a year that would have been spent on imported diesel in the local community, said project manager Blair Hogan, president and CEO of Gunta Business Consulting. The wood comes from trees cleared for development, and more will be cleared in the future to create fire breaks to protect the community from wildfires, a risk that grows with climate change. ""In every community, there's a unique technology for their unique situation,"" Hogan said. In addition to accessing different heating and cooling sources, district energy systems make it easy to feed in new energy sources or switch altogether. For example, a system in St. Paul, Minn., switched from fossil fuels to biomass ""almost overnight"" without affecting customers, Ander said: ""How it's fuelled doesn't really matter to them."" But it can have a huge impact on their greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the United Nations Environment Program calls district energy a ""key measure for cities/countries that aim to achieve 100 per cent renewable energy or carbon neutral targets."" Its District Energy in Cities Initiative notes that district energy can: It adds that such systems are increasingly low-carbon and climate resilient — that is, they can often keep running through storms and extreme weather disasters that are becoming more frequent with climate change and that often knock out the electricity needed to run many traditional heating systems. That's why they're often hooked up to places like hospitals that can't afford to lose power. Ander says Markham's system has had more than 99.99 per cent reliability since it launched in 2000 — in 165,000 hours of continuous operation in 20 years, it's been down just 2.5 hours. ""The buildings are much easier to operate,"" he said. ""You don't need to worry about this critical equipment failing."" He notes there are other benefits for customers: Markham District Energy's Markham Centre system serves every new building that has been built in the city's ""new"" downtown since 2000. It expects to ultimately heat and cool 30 million square feet of homes for 41,000 residents and 39,000 employees in commercial and institutional buildings.  For now, the system burns natural gas and uses electrically powered chillers for cooling, but its use of fossil fuels remains more efficient than if the buildings had individual heating systems. It also has started to incorporate waste heat from data centres. Despite the benefits of district energy, most buildings in Canada are still heated and cooled individually. As of 2013, district energy heated and cooled about 2,600 buildings across the country, representing less than one per cent of total energy used for heating and cooling in Canada, reported the Canadian Energy and Emissions Data Centre at Simon Fraser University. Partly, that's because building an economically viable district energy system typically requires two things that aren't often found together: But the biggest challenge is the upfront cost to install the infrastructure, especially since it must be done before there are any buildings with paying customers attached, Ander says, adding that it takes decades of customers paying their utility bills to recover the cost. ""So there has to be some sort of some assistance in some manner from higher levels of government,"" he suggests. Another challenge is the low price of natural gas that is the dominant heating fuel in Canada, says Lucio Mesquita, senior engineer with the Solar Thermal Renewable Heat and Power Group at Natural Resource's Canada CanmetENERGY Research Centre. ""To compete with natural gas — it's a tough one."" Mesquita was part of the team that built and continues to monitor the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Alta., which collects heat using solar panels in the summer and stores it for home heating use in the winter. In the past 13 years, more than 90 per cent of home heat — 100 per cent some years — has come from the solar collectors. He says not enough of the discussion on reducing emissions has been about ways to decarbonize heating in Canada. ""We have the solutions. We have the technology to do the deep decarbonization,"" he said. ""It's a matter of resources and the right market conditions.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/district-energy-1.5378650,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/district-energy-examples-1.5379125 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cop25-airline-travel-carbon-emissions-offsets-electric-planes-1.5367158 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-condo-boom-fuels-new-district-energy-projects-1.4918943 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/solar-thermal-energy-community-alberta-drake-landing-1.3436178 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-change-mitigation-co-benefits-1.5205552 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-blatchford-1.5345452 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154,N/A

""Our partners in both P.E.I.and Alberta are excited with the opportunity this service represents as both have a new opportunity to market their world-class tourism assets,"" said Charles Duncan, chief strategy officer for WestJet, in a written news release Friday. ""This direct flight between P.E.I and Alberta will further strengthen our relationship with Western Canada,"" said P.E.I. Premier Dennis King in the release. The flights from Calgary to Charlottetown will depart at 10:45 p.m. and arrive at 6:23 a.m. four times weekly. Flights from Charlottetown to Calgary will leave at 7:15 a.m. and arrive at 9:33 a.m. four times weekly. ""I think it opens up opportunities for Tourism PEI and others to start to market P.E.I. right across the country and especially obviously in the Alberta area,"" said Doug Newson, CEO of the Charlottetown Airport Authority. ""Open up new possibilities for tourists to come here and make it easier maybe for those people that want to travel west."" ""Altogether it'll be a 35 per cent increase in the number of seats that WestJet will fly into Charlottetown,"" Duncan said. WestJet said the flights are timed to connect with destinations in Western Canada including Vancouver, Edmonton, Kelowna and Victoria. Duncan said that will give Islanders easier access to a number of other destinations as well. ""We have almost 200 flights a day to dozens of destinations in Calgary,"" said Duncan. ""If people are going to Edmonton … or any of dozens of other places. This will be the fastest way to get there and I think people will be impressed with the pricing they see as well."" It's been something that WestJet and the Charlottetown Airport have been working on for at least three years, said Duncan.  ""We have been seeing gradually, over the past several years, the number … of our guests on the airplane from Calgary and Alberta coming to Charlottetown increasing,"" he said. ""This is the year that we actually see enough demand that we can actually maintain our service from Toronto and the non-stop flights from Calgary.""  Newson said he thinks tourism will be the main driver of seat sales for the new flight.  ""I don't think we do a lot of marketing in the Alberta market right now and one of those reasons probably is because it is so far and we don't have that non-stop direct air access,"" he said. ""Now that we have that, I think you'll probably see a bit more focus on the Alberta market especially in the Calgary area because it's more convenient to get here.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-westjet-charlottetown-calgary-jan-2020-1.5430670,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-swoop-charlottetown-airport-1.5420416 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-airport-therapy-dogs-1.5385440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-addictions-services-more-jan-2020-1.5429783 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lands-protection-act-committee-presentation-horace-carver-1.5429611,N/A
85,Anonymous,2019-11-22T16:53:03.317Z,"Tesla launches new electric truck, taking aim at lucrative pickup market","Tesla's highly anticipated unveiling of its futuristic pickup truck suffered a setback after its ""armoured glass"" windows shattered during a demonstration. During the tightly choreographed unveiling of the Cybertruck to cheering fans on Thursday, Tesla boss Elon Musk had taken a stab at the design, power and durability of mainstream trucks, only to be shaken when his boast about his new truck's windows backfired. With a starting price of $39,900 US, the Cybertruck's futuristic, angular body in gun-metal grey resembles an armoured vehicle and takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers' profits. Musk singled out the Ford F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States, to highlight the capabilities of the Cybertruck, showing an edited video of the two trucks in a back-to-back ""tug-of-war"" in which the Cybertruck takes off, dragging the F-150 behind it shortly after both trucks accelerate from starting position. To show off the robust design of the new pickup, Musk enlisted his head of design, Franz von Holzhausen, to take a sledgehammer to the side of the vehicle, whose exterior will be made from the same stainless steel used in the Starship rocket developed by Musk's SpaceX aerospace company. The crowd cheered when it bounced off the surface without leaving a mark. But the truck's windows were not as fortunate, cracking like spiderwebs when von Holzhausen threw metal balls at them. The blunder overshadowed the launch, which was live-streamed from Los Angeles and made #cybertruck a trending word on Twitter. ""Oh my … well, maybe that was a little too hard,"" Musk said, looking with surprise at the cracked driver's side window. Still, he allowed von Holzhausen another throw to the rear passenger window, only to see that crack as well. ""It didn't go through, so that's a plus side"" he said, adding: ""Room for improvement."" Reactions on Twitter varied including some advice on product launch and planning. ""Never demonstrate something in a live audience, that you haven't tried repeatedly backstage,"" wrote @DrBenH, while @JustinParayno wrote ""I see it as a positive because @elonmusk's decision to test it live hopefully will cause @Tesla to be more cautious and make sure the sold Trucks will not crack."" Others were more optimistic. ""I personally don't care that the glass shattered any other vehicle's glass would have broken down completely,"" wrote @Kev112301, while @erikwray posted ""There will be hiccups and they'll get worked out. The #Tesla cars are amazing and only get better over time."" Ahead of the launch, analysts speculated on the profitability of the Tesla offering. ""Making an electric pickup truck that sells in the same price range as an F-150 and making it profitable will be tough,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at Auto Forecast Solutions. Ford and larger rival General Motors Co. are gearing up to challenge Tesla more directly with new offerings like the Ford Mustang Mach E electric SUV as well as electric pickups. Electric pickups and SUVs could help Ford and GM generate the significant EV sales they will need to meet tougher emission standards and EV mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails. Pricier trucks also offer carmakers a better chance to generate profit from their electric battery investments, Fiorani said. General Motors also announced that its electric truck will go on sale in the fall of 2021. ""General Motors understands truck buyers and ... people who are new coming into the truck market,"" Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said at an investor conference in New York on Thursday. ""It will be a very capable truck, I'm pretty excited about it."" The No. 1 U.S. automaker has so far given few details on its planned line of electric pickup trucks. Reuters reported last month that GM plans to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021, possibly reviving the imposing Hummer brand on some of them. Until now, the automaker had not given a date for when its first electric pickup truck would hit the market. Pickup trucks are one of the most profitable vehicle segments in the world. The U.S. market is dominated by GM, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Ford also intends to sell an electric F-series pickup truck in late 2021, sources familiar with the plans have said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-electric-truck-1.5369304,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-berlin-factory-1.5357616 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-posts-surprise-quarterly-profit-1.5332815,N/A
86,Dan Taekema,2020-01-18T12:00:00.079Z,Rocky Johnson remembered by son as a wrestler who shattered racial barriers,"Curtis Bowles Johnson grew up among giants. As a child he watched his father, Rocky (Soul Man) Johnson, take on racism and smash through plenty of opponents during his decorated wrestling career. ""He shattered a lot of barriers, racial barriers,"" explained Bowles Johnson, adding he believes his father's legacy will echo for years to come even though the sound of the ring bell from his final match has long since faded. Johnson died on Wednesday. He was 75. The Nova Scotia-born wrestler, and father of movie star Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, started his journey to the ring here in Ontario. In the early 1960s Bowles Johnson says his father was driving a fish truck in Toronto and heading to Jack Wentworth's training school in Hamilton three or four times a week to learn to wrestle. ""He told me how much he enjoyed the training with the guys and how much he learned and how much he loved the city of Hamilton,"" said Bowles Johnson, who currently lives in the city. CBC spoke to him in October about plans to turn his father's life story into a movie. ""[Rocky] knew that he wanted to do something with his life, knew he wanted to box, or some kind of athletics,"" he explained. Hamilton was where his dad met a Canadian professional wrestler named ""Whipper"" Billy Watson and discovered a way he could embrace his full athletic potential beyond simply throwing punches. ""In wrestling you can do drop kicks, backflips … he liked that idea of being able to be more flexible, more athletic and move more,"" explained Bowles Johnson. Rocky Johnson was a natural, but the wins didn't come easy. On his way to becoming the first black champion in places like Georgia and Texas, Bowles Johnson said his father sometimes had to work with wrestlers who were racist. ""Wrestling is choreographed but some of the guys would stiff him — that means hit him for real with harder shots than should have been — just because of his race,"" he explained. But that wasn't enough to keep the Soul Man down. ""Once he realized who these guys were and what it was about then he'd hit back twice as hard ... just to let him know that's not going to happen,"" said Bowles Johnson. The men his father faced in the ring weren't his only opponents, he added. ""There were times when promoters wanted you to do the jive or the 'black thing' and my dad would tell them 'No, I'm an athlete. I'm not going to act a certain way to please you.'"" Bowles Johnson said his dad always handled himself with grace and wanted to leave a legacy as not just a good black wrestler, but a great athlete period. Eventually, he teamed with Tony Atlas as The Soul Patrol and the two men became the first black World Tag Team Champions in WWE history when they defeated The Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983. Johnson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008. He was ""proud of shattering barriers and making it easier for the other black wrestlers to come behind him,"" said his son. Today Bowles Johnson stands six foot five inches tall and weighs about 250 pounds, but growing up he was surrounded by titans of the wrestling world, from Abdullah the Butcher to André the Giant. ""Being a little guy, these guys were giants … heroes, idols to me growing up,"" he recalled, adding to this day he's tough to impress when it comes to commenting on the physique of other guys working out at the gym. ""Huge to me was André the Giant … or my dad. That was huge,"" said Bowles Johnson. ""You see things in a different perspective when you … grow up with larger than life figures."" He thinks of his father as someone who was incredibly determined, grounded and always found a way to do the right thing. ""I've seen him work hard all his life,"" said Bowles Johnson. ""I've seen him held down at certain times until he had to work twice as hard because of racial barriers."" When he looks at wrestling today, Johnson said he sees evidence his father's fight wasn't in vain. ""Like any sport it evolves. Guys of yesterday paved the road so it can be like today.,"" he explained. ""They endured the hardships and went through all that … so it could be what it is today."" To Bowles Johnson, his father was more than a wrestling icon. ""It's funny because through all the fame and all the titles ... he was always just dad to me.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/rocky-johnson-curtis-bowles-johnson-1.5429494,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/wwe-reports-n-s-born-wrestler-rocky-johnson-has-died-1.5428604 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5429469/rocky-johnson-was-a-champion-for-black-equality-says-tag-team-partner-tony-atlas-1.5429480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rocky-johnson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-memoir-wrestler-amherst-1.5326842,N/A
87,Ryan Patrick Jones,2020-01-13T22:50:04.371Z,Families of PS752 victims could go after Ukraine airline or Iran in bid for compensation ,"The family members of those killed on Flight PS752 are likely entitled to monetary compensation under international aviation law, lawyers say, but could also achieve it through a comprehensive settlement with the government of Iran. Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 using surface-to-air missiles, Iranian leaders conceded on Saturday, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Fifty-seven of those who died were Canadian citizens, while dozens of others were travelling to Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday that he expects Iran to take full responsibility for the downing of the jetliner and indicated that he would press Iran to provide compensation on behalf of the people who lost their lives. ""A full and complete investigation must be conducted,"" Trudeau said. ""Families are seeking justice and accountability and they deserve closure."" Lawyers say there are three main avenues for family members to achieve financial compensation: through civil action, through the International Court of Justice, or through international diplomacy. Vincent Genova, a Toronto lawyer who practices personal injury and aviation law, said the families of Canadian citizens and those with ties to Canada could most likely launch a civil action in a Canadian court against Ukraine International Airlines, the operator of Flight PS752. Genova said family members can make the case that the airliner was negligent and should have cancelled the flight due to the security situation in the region. ""I think most people are quite shocked that the plane was allowed to take off in what could have been a war zone and certainly a dangerous time given the the political climate in that region,"" said Genova. Just hours before the flight took off, Iran had launched a missile attack against two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. and Canadian soldiers, in retaliation for the U.S. assassination of Gen. Qassem Solemeini, who was head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. On Saturday, the Iranian military said it mistook the plane for a ""hostile target"" and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed ""human error."" Watch: Trudeau's statement Saturday following Tehran's admission it shot down Flight PS752 Whether or not a Canadian court has jurisdiction over a case like this depends on the passenger's ticket and flight itinerary, according to Joe Fiorante, a Vancouver lawyer who specializes in aviation law. Fiorante said people travelling to Canada on a one-way ticket or returning to Canada on a round-trip ticket would be covered by the Montreal Convention, an international treaty to which Canada and Ukraine are signatories, but Iran is not. Under the Convention, airlines are responsible for compensating victims' families in the case of an ""accident,"" which is defined broadly and would include a missile strike, Fiorante said.  Families are entitled to provable damages up to an initial threshold of $232,000, without having to prove fault. Compensation covers, at a minimum, things like funeral expenses and lost belongings, but can be expanded to include loss of future income and other damages related to the loss of a loved one. Any final amount would be determined in the court where the complaint is filed, Fiorante said. ""Unfortunately, like all other civil litigation that these cases can take years to resolve,"" Fiorante said. ""There'll be some very complicated questions in this case as to whether Ukraine Airlines has a defence to the claim based on the events leading to the to the crash,"" he said. A second possible avenue of compensation for victims' families is through the International Court of Justice.  The government of Canada could bring a claim in that court against the government of Iran for reparations, Fiorante said. In 1989, the Iranian government made such a claim against the United States for shooting down Iran Air Flight 655. That flight was on its way from Tehran to Dubai when two surface-to-air missiles launched from the U.S. Navy cruiser USS Vincennes brought it down over Iranian territorial waters.  All 290 people on board were killed. The international court case dragged on for years, but eventually the U.S. government eventually agreed to pay $131 million in compensation to Iran and the families of the victims. ""The lawyers will want much more information about all of the circumstances pertaining to this crash but that is an avenue that is certainly open to the government of Canada,"" FIorante said. Ultimately, the solution to the issue may be worked out through international diplomacy. The Iranian government could come to an agreement with other governments involved, including Canada's, that would include compensation for the families of victims.  Genova, the Toronto lawyer, used the example of the Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people. The investigation into that crash found a Libyan intelligence agent guilty of planning the attack and the U.N. imposed a series of sanctions on Libya. Years later, the Libyan government accepted responsibility as part of a broader deal that saw international sanctions lifted. ""A lot of that came about because of geopolitical pressure,"" said Genova. ""I think there will be similar actions against the Iranian government until they make good on their admission of fault."" There are already signs that things are moving in this way. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne has set up an international working group of countries whose citizens perished on the plane. Members include representatives from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada and Afghanistan. The purpose of the group is to coordinate a response and to share information about the investigation. Members of the working group held a phone call yesterday where they all discussed the need for justice, including compensation for victims, according to a readout provided by Champagne's office.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/compensation-victims-ps752-1.5424415,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ps752-flight-iran-missile-1.5422912 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-iran-ps752-ukrainian-crash-1.5421172 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-airliner-investigation-working-group-1.5423202,N/A
88,Kate Rutherford,2019-05-09T14:10:35.071Z,Parliament passes Charlie Angus's motion to establish national suicide prevention action plan,"As parliamentarians voted unanimously Wednesday evening in favour of a national suicide prevention action plan, NDP MP Charlie Angus, who proposed the private member's motion, says he was reciting in his head the names of all the young people lost to suicide on northern Ontario First Nations. ""It was a very emotional moment,"" said Angus, who represents Timmins-James Bay. ""But, out of the darkness can come determination and hope."" M-174 establishes a ""national suicide prevention action plan, including among its provisions (i) commitment to the actions and resources required to establish culturally appropriate community-based suicide prevention programs as articulated by representative organizations of the Inuit, First Nations, and Métis peoples."" As a tribute to those who have lost their lives, Angus says he carries an eagle feather given to him following his visits to Attawapiskat First Nation on the western coast of James Bay. He says it was given to him following the state of emergency called in that community in April 2016, when 11 people attempted suicide in one day. It was while responding to repeated crises in northern Ontario First Nations, and what he calls the government's piecemeal approach to them, that Angus became motivated to do something. ""It was particularly the deaths of young girls in Wapekeka (an Oji-Cree First Nation near the Ontario-Manitoba border), when we held that press conference in January of 2017, and the leadership of the community begged the prime minister, begged him, to sit down and say we've got to find a way forward,"" Angus said. ""That, to me, was really the moment I thought we've got to stop being reactive, we have to be pro-active here."" The motion also calls for the creation of a national public health monitoring program for the prevention of suicide and the identification of groups at elevated risk. As well, it mandates the ""creation of a national online hub providing essential information and guides to accessing services, in English, French, selected Indigenous languages, and other languages spoken widely in Canada for suicidal individuals, their families and friends, people bereaved by a loved one's suicide, workplaces and other stakeholders concerned with suicide prevention."" Jonathan Solomon, the Grand Chief of Mushkegowuk Council, representing Cree communities in northeastern Ontario, says he hopes the strategy will save lives. It's an issue that Mushkegowuk Council has explored and attempted to address itself. On Jan. 20, 2016, Mushkegowuk Council released a report titled, ""The People's Inquiry Into Our Suicide Pandemic."" The report followed two years of public hearings and the documentation of personal stories. It identified possible solutions to address the suicide pandemic that was crippling the region. Solomon says the toll on families continues. ""We were losing so many young people, even babies as young as 10 years old. We begged there should be a national strategy. So I would say it's about time,"" he said. Solomon cautions that for the plan to work, it needs to be culturally appropriate. ""I think it has to be specific, very unique, because our communities are unique and isolated,"" he said. ""It has to be appropriate in the culture of the community by utilizing the land-based healing that is so important in our communities."" As for next steps, Angus says he'll be pushing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to set aside financing for the goals set out in the motion. He cautions the plan isn't real yet, and the grassroots will need to keep pressuring the government to make it a reality.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/national-suicide-prevention-action-plan-motion-parliament-1.5128836,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/mamakwa-bearskin-lake-suicide-1.4831913 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/parliamentary-report-indigenous-suicide-1.4167861 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/shadows-and-promises-in-attawapiskat-1.4582905 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/suicide-depression-music-attawapiskat-1.4879074 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/pangnirtung-crisis-crime-suicide-prevention-1.4666470 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-inuit-suicide-mental-health-youth-1.4869397 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/suicide-intervention-training-rainbow-board-signs-1.4989793,N/A
89,Anonymous,2019-11-05T12:52:11.090Z,It's official: U.S. is pulling out of Paris climate deal,"The United States has begun the process of pulling out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday he has submitted a formal notice to the United Nations. That starts a withdrawal process that does not become official for a year. His statement touted U.S. carbon pollution cuts, and called the Paris deal an ""unfair economic burden"" to the U.S. economy. Nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal, in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change. ""In international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model — backed by a record of real world results — showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy,"" Pompeo said in a statement. Today we begin the formal process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. The U.S. is proud of our record as a world leader in reducing all emissions, fostering resilience, growing our economy, and ensuring energy for our citizens. Ours is a realistic and pragmatic model. The U.S. started the process with a hand-delivered letter, becoming the only country to withdraw. The United Nations will soon set out procedural details for what happens next, UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said. Agreement rules prevented any country from pulling out in the first three years after the Nov. 4, 2016, ratification. The U.S. withdrawal doesn't become complete until the day after the 2020 election. U.S. President Donald Trump has been promising withdrawal for two years, but Monday was the first time he could actually do it. Trump's decision was condemned as a reckless failure of leadership by environmental experts, activists and critics such as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Abandoning the Paris Agreement is an abdication of leadership that the vast majority of Americans oppose. Americans want action on climate change, and it's up to the public to deliver what Washington won't – and we are. <a href=""https://t.co/mKBXLlhX1W"">https://t.co/mKBXLlhX1W</a> ""Donald Trump is the worst president in history for our climate and our clean air and water,"" said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. ""Long after Trump is out of office his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement will be seen as a historic error."" The agreement set goals of preventing another 0.5 degrees Celsius to 1 degree Celsius of warming from current levels. Even the pledges made in 2015 weren't enough to prevent those levels of warming. The deal calls for nations to come up with more ambitious pollution cuts every five years, starting in November 2020 at a meeting in Scotland. Because of the expected withdrawal, the U.S. role in 2020 negotiations will be reduced, experts said. Climate change, caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas, has already warmed the world by 1 degree Celsius since the late 1800s, caused massive melting of ice globally, triggered weather extremes and changed ocean chemistry. And scientists say that depending on how much carbon dioxide is emitted, it will only get worse by the end of the century with temperatures jumping by several degrees and oceans rising by close to a metre. Trump has been promising to pull out of the Paris deal since 2017, often mischaracterizing the terms of the agreement, which are voluntary. In October, he called it a massive wealth transfer from America to other nations and said it was one-sided. That's not the case, experts said. For example, the U.S. goal — set by Barack Obama's administration — had been to reduce carbon dioxide emission in 2025 by 26 per cent to 28 per cent compared to 2005 levels. This translates to about 15 per cent compared to 1990 levels. The European Union's goal was to cut carbon pollution in 2030 by 40 per cent compared to 1990 levels, which is greater than the U.S. pledge, said Stanford University's Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who track carbon emissions worldwide. The United Kingdom has already exceeded that goal, Jackson said. Many critics of the Paris agreement say the U.S. is the leader in cutting carbon emissions, but that's not true. Since 2005, the United States hasn't been in the top 10 in percentage of greenhouse gas emission reductions. The United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Greece, the Czech Republic and other nations have done better, said Jackson, who tracks emissions. ""The U.S. agreement is not a tax on the American people. There is no massive wealth transfer,"" said Climate Advisers CEO Nigel Purvis, who was a lead State Department climate negotiator in the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. ""In fact, the agreement obligates no country to make any financial payments."" Pompeo said U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 per cent from 2005 to 2017 ""even as our economy grew over 19 per cent."" In 2018, carbon dioxide emissions increased 2.7 per cent, according to the Energy Information Administration, mostly due to extreme weather and the economy. The reason for the long-term emissions drop is because the U.S. is using less coal and has tightened air quality standards, while Trump is pushing for more coal and loosening those standards, said Michael Gerrard, who heads Columbia Law School's climate change legal centre. For the U.S. — the second biggest carbon polluter — to be in line with Paris goals greenhouse gas emissions have to drop 80 per cent, not 13 per cent, Gerrard said. ""The Trump administration's abandonment of action on climate change gives other countries an excuse not to act either. They ask — if the richest country, the one that has contributed the most to the load of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, isn't willing to act, why should we?"" Gerrard said. ""If someone other than Donald Trump is elected, he or she will almost certainly rejoin Paris, and the rest of the world will welcome us back with open arms."" Former vice-president Al Gore, who made climate change his signature issue, characterized the decision as a mistake but said there was still reason for hope. ""No one person or party can stop our momentum to solve the climate crisis,"" Gore said. ""But those who try will be remembered for their complacency, complicity, and mendacity in attempting to sacrifice the planet for their greed."" No one person or party can stop our momentum to solve the climate crisis, but those who try will be remembered for their attempts to sacrifice the planet for their greed.

91,Thomas Daigle,2020-01-02T15:10:36.976Z,'Completely unsustainable': How streaming and other data demands take a toll on the environment,"For those of us binge-watching TV shows, installing new smartphone apps or sharing family photos on social media over the holidays, it may seem like an abstract predicament. The gigabytes of data we're using — although invisible — come at a significant cost to the environment. Some experts say it rivals that of the airline industry.  And as more smart devices rely on data to operate (think internet-connected refrigerators or self-driving cars), their electricity demands are set to skyrocket. ""We are using an immense amount of energy to drive this data revolution,"" said Jane Kearns, an environment and technology expert at MaRS Discovery District, an innovation hub in Toronto. ""It has real implications for our climate."" Tech companies in Canada and abroad, however, are coming up with innovative solutions to curb the growing problem. It's not the gadgets themselves that are drawing so much power, it's the far-flung servers that act as their electronic brains. Although often described as the ""cloud,"" the servers exist in real-world data centres, which Kearns calls ""massive energy hogs."" The data centres, often bigger than a football field, house endless stacks of servers handling many terabytes (thousands of gigabytes) of digital traffic. Just as laptops tend to warm during heavy usage, servers must be cooled to avoid overheating. And cooling so many machines requires plenty of power. Anders Andrae, a researcher at Huawei Technologies Sweden whose estimates are often cited, told CBC News in an email he expects the world's data centres alone will devour up to 651 terawatt-hours of electricity in the next year. That's nearly as much electricity as Canada's entire energy sector produces.  And it's just the beginning. Andrae's calculations, published in the International Journal of Green Technology, suggest data centres could more than double their power demands over the next decade. He projects computing will gobble up 11 per cent of global energy by 2030 and cloud-based services will represent a sizeable proportion of that. ""This will become completely unsustainable by 2040,"" Andrae wrote. So, what's driving the increased demand for data? Streaming video is currently the biggest culprit, with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video eating up 60.6 per cent of all internet traffic, according to network analytics firm Sandvine, headquartered in Waterloo, Ont. And streaming video usage is only growing. But higher-speed 5G cellular networks, more widespread artificial intelligence and the nascent Internet of Things, such as smart home devices, are guaranteed to send data demands through the roof. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, require a constant flow of information to stay on the road. The information and communications technology sector as a whole is thought to be responsible for two to three per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions — roughly on par with the often-criticized airline sector. However, data-voracious tech giants are pledging to clean up their act. Amazon Web Services is the market leader in providing cloud computing to other companies. AWS, as it's known, says it exceeded 50 per cent renewable energy usage in 2018 and has committed in the ""long term"" to exclusively use clean power sources, such as wind. Finding green solutions ""is not just something that's nice to do,"" said Marc Musgrove, a spokesperson for Digital Realty, a California-based company that operates data centres around the world. ""It's an imperative"" demanded by the company's clients, including Facebook. Digital Realty's 675,000-square-foot Toronto-area data centre formerly housed the Toronto Star's printing press. In a bid to go green, the facility cools its machines for much of the year with fresh air-based systems. Heat exchange wheels installed on the building's roof take outdoor air and push it down, to cool the warmer air in the server rooms.  It's part of the reason Digital Realty set up shop in Canada. Environmental considerations ""work well in this kind of climate,"" Musgrove said. Indeed, countries with cooler weather, such as Iceland and Ireland, have been investing in the sector to attract data centres. Canada is eager to get a slice of the growing pie as well. The Department of Natural Resources says data centres already consume about one per cent of all electricity used in Canada, and the demand keeps growing. But there are also homegrown energy solutions in the works. Kearns, a vice-president at MaRS in Toronto, said the country's tech firms are ""absolutely on the cutting edge"" in developing greener solutions to data management. She pointed to Waterloo, Ont.-based Smarter Alloys, which is developing technology that recovers the kind of low-level heat emitted from large server facilities, a possible source of renewable energy. The process ""has the potential to make real positive impact on reducing carbon emissions with a cost-effective solution,"" CEO Ibraheem Khan said in 2018, when Smarter Alloys was named as a finalist for an Ontario clean energy prize. In Ottawa, Ranovus is taking a different approach, focusing on expanding the information transmission capacity within data centres to cut down on energy demands. ""We're facing a tsunami of data,"" Ranovus CEO Hamid Arabzadeh said in an interview. At the company's headquarters in the Kanata North innovation district, more than 40 staff are fine-tuning cutting-edge solutions, including what Ranovus calls the ""quantum dot multi-wavelength laser,"" which relies on microscopic technology to multiply the speed and capacity of data transfers. The approach could reduce the amount of energy required for mass data transfers by 80 per cent, cutting costs dramatically. Arabzadeh said the firm's clients, who are mainly on the U.S. West Coast, are aiming for ""undisrupted access to unlimited data with no latency."" As the demand for bandwidth — and the pressure on data centres — grows, users should see no reduction in the quality of their experience, he said.

Emma Fenton was flying solo from Kelowna, B.C., to visit family in Fort St. John, B.C., on March 23, but she got stuck late at night in the Calgary airport after an Air Canada flight delay, a route change and a complex ticketing error. ""I felt very helpless, knowing she was there by herself at the airport,"" said Emma's stepmother, Christy Fenton, who had been awaiting Emma's flight in Fort St. John. Emma spent the night on the airport floor as her parents attempted to reach Air Canada and WestJet. ""I was just so tired and so ready to go home,"" said the teen. The problems began that morning in Kelowna, where Emma's initial flight was delayed by a combination of spring break travel volumes and the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, said her family. When it appeared Emma would miss her connecting flight, Air Canada offered to reroute her to Calgary, where she could catch a WestJet flight to Fort St John. But WestJet agents in Kelowna weren't able to ""complete"" her new ticket or give her a boarding pass, the family said.  She was told the matter would be resolved at the departure gate in Calgary. But once in Calgary, Emma said, WestJet staff directed her to leave the airport's secure area and visit the WestJet ticket counter. But by then, the WestJet and Air Canada counters were not staffed, and the flight left without her.  Emma has flown many times between her parents' homes. But she said nothing quite prepared her for the runaround that left her stranded. ""They didn't even try to be helpful at all,"" she said of airline staff. ""They [were] just kinda like — not our problem, go away. That's kinda what it felt like."" Her stepmother said the airlines should have done more to help the young traveller. ""They didn't do the right thing. They left a 15-year-old without a confirmed flight and then sent her out through security when there was no one there to help her,"" said Christy Fenton. ""Not one, but two airlines dropped the ball.""  The next morning, Emma was able to fly out of Calgary — but only as far as Grande Prairie, Alta., more than two hours from her destination of Fort St John. ""She was a mess actually,"" said Christy Fenton, who drove to the Alberta airport to pick her up. ""She hadn't slept in over 24 hours ... she was pretty drained."" Air Canada said Emma should have had adequate time to sort out any problems with her ticket during her Calgary layover, and ""can't explain"" WestJet's actions or the agents' direction to leave the secure area. The airline said three other passengers were able to make the connection. On Thursday, Air Canada said, "" We have been in contact with the family and apologized."" When CBC News first inquired about the incident, WestJet deferred questions about Emma's trip to Air Canada, the original booking agent. The airline also said guests over age 12 who travel alone are subject to adult travel policies. WestJet apologized on Wednesday.  ""Following a fulsome investigation by our teams, it appears that this guest experienced an unfortunate series of events,"" said Morgan Bell, a media and public relations adviser for WestJet. ""We will most certainly use this situation as a learning for our teams, as in no case, regardless of the carrier responsible, would we be comfortable with a 15-year-old being left alone overnight in an airport.   ""We sincerely apologize for not going above and beyond for this guest and letting her and her family down during her travels."" WestJet said Air Canada should have properly issued the ticket for Fenton's rerouted flight or made WestJet aware of any ticketing error earlier. And WestJet said that because travel can be unpredictable, guests under the age of 18 travelling without an adult should have ""a plan in place to handle any potential issues.""  It's not the first time a travelling teenager has been stranded alone at a major Canadian airport. In three separate incidents — in  2017, 2016, and 2013 — teenage travellers were stuck alone overnight at Pearson International Airport in Toronto.

94,Frances Willick,2020-01-17T10:00:00.809Z,When donors cross the line: Charitable sector grapples with sexual harassment ,"As Carly Butler got ready to attend another big gala for her job as a major gifts fundraiser, she put on a special dress she'd often wear on such occasions. But for this particular event at a high-end Nova Scotia resort, she took an extra precaution, placing a safety pin at the neckline to be prudent. She'd heard there had been ""bad behaviour"" at the event in the past. As she and her co-workers arrived at the resort, one charity staffer joked to the crew, ""OK, ladies, lock up your vaginas!"" Soon after, Butler had an experience she would later describe as ""a general disrespect"" of her professionalism. Her job as a fundraiser for the IWK Foundation — the charitable organization that supports the women and children's hospital in Halifax — required her to drum up $1.5 million in donations the year she was employed there. During the event, a potential donor asked her to meet him outside in 10 minutes so they could drive his luxury car down a nearby private runway, even though he was drunk. When she said no, he told her she could drive — that there were no police around, and what happened at the resort would stay at the resort. She didn't get in the car that day nearly five years ago. But she worries that younger or more vulnerable women starting out their fundraising career may have. As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across industry after industry, some in the fundraising sector say it's time for their profession to step up efforts to tackle and prevent sexual harassment. Workers in some fundraising roles can be particularly vulnerable to harassment due to the deep power imbalance between fundraisers — who are often young women, and whose jobs depend on meeting donation targets — and donors, who are often wealthy older men. And events like golf tournaments, galas or auction evenings — especially where alcohol is involved — are ripe for abuse of that inequality, say industry insiders. CBC News spoke with nearly a dozen women across the country who work in the non-profit sector. Nearly all had experiences of being harassed by donors or other employees, either with unwanted touching, sexual innuendo or inappropriate propositions. One spoke of a former premier grabbing her butt at an event, another of an older donor putting his hand on her knee and offering to ""treat"" her to a night at the iconic Ottawa hotel Chateau Laurier, while another woman told of a men's group of potential donors leaving a photo of a naked woman on the podium where she was about to speak. Jacquie Stoyek, who worked in marketing at the IWK Foundation for about five years until leaving in 2017, attended the same fundraiser as Butler. She recalled seeing a businessman — already intoxicated first thing in the morning — making comments about a foundation staff member and pretending behind her back to grab her butt. Stoyek said a senior foundation staff member saw that and gave her a look that said, ""Watch out for this one,"" and it became an ongoing joke. The IWK Foundation declined to answer any questions about the fundraising event, saying in a two-sentence statement it is ""unable to provide comment on the specific circumstances"" of Butler and Stoyek's allegations. But at the time — after Butler reported the luxury car incident to her peers and superiors — she was told not to go to future meetings with that donor by herself. Butler said the man cancelled a followup meeting with her when he learned she would not be alone. The IWK Foundation said in a statement: ""With respect to the issue of harassment, it is a very important topic in every sector and we continue to work within our organization to foster a culture of openness, respect and safety."" The foundation would not comment on whether the event is still taking place. A survey on sexual harassment conducted in 2018 by the Harris Poll for the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that a quarter of female respondents and seven per cent of male respondents had experienced sexual harassment in the field. The survey involved about 1,000 fundraisers, including about 900 people living in the U.S. and 100 living in Canada. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, a donor was the perpetrator. But less than half of those who were harassed told their organization about the incident. Beth Ann Locke, who until recently served as the chief philanthropy officer for the B.C. Women's Health Foundation, said women are worried about the questions that will be asked — ""What did you do to make him do that? Did you flirt with him?"" They are also concerned that reporting the incident will hurt their career, say many in the industry. If they no longer work with a major donor who has harassed them, they may not get invited to events, be asked to take on large accounts or meet their donation targets for the year. At small organizations, there often isn't another staffer who can take over an account involving a harasser. Fundraisers are also passionate about the organizations and causes they work for, and are reluctant to do anything that could harm them, say several of the women interviewed by the CBC. Locke is one of the co-founders of Ms. Rupt, a group that aims to spark conversation and action on challenges facing female fundraisers. ""What drives me crazy is that all of us as fundraisers work to help people who have no voice — so whether that's the Amazon rainforest or, you know, dogs in Halifax or people with dementia, right? ""And yet we don't stand up for ourselves and we kind of allow this to happen in our own profession."" Locke said she has experienced several incidents of harassment over the course of her career, including someone asking her to be their ""mistress,"" someone stroking her arm and commenting on her skin and an uninvited hand on her knee under the table. She said the most severe instance of harassment occurred years ago while she was working in the U.S., when a superior grabbed her wrist — which she promptly wrenched away — and then held his erect penis through his clothes, saying, ""This is what you do to me."" Locke said she reported the incident to human resources, which forced the man to take three days off without pay and lectured both parties about ""this kind of stuff going on in our office.""  ""It was like a dressing-down you'd get from your parents,"" Locke said. That type of lacklustre response does not appear to be unusual, according to the Harris Poll survey. Of the respondents who had experienced sexual harassment and told their organization about it, 71 per cent said no action had been taken against the perpetrator. Thirty-five per cent of respondents who took steps to deal with the harassment said they experienced a negative impact on their career after reporting it. Locke said organizations within the non-profit sector need to take allegations more seriously. She said she's heard stories of organizations giving donors or other perpetrators a ""pass"" for harassing behaviour: ""'He's sweet.' 'Oh, don't worry about it.' Even kind of a 'he doesn't know what he's doing' thing.… Or 'they're from a different age when that was allowed.' I've heard that one."" Some smaller non-profits that run on a shoestring budget don't have a separate human resources department to deal with complaints.  Lucy White, a Toronto consultant for the non-profit sector, said one of the barriers to change in the industry is that when people do file complaints about harassment, the cases are often settled out of court and out of the public eye, often with non-disclosure agreements that forbid them from discussing details. ""So the real problem is no one ever admits publicly that they did anything wrong and we never find out any of the facts,"" White said. ""We're left in the dark about how often this kind of thing happens."" That silence also means other organizations and those who sit on their board of directors never learn what kind of financial repercussions can stem from findings of harrassment, and the liabilities their own charities could face if allegations emerge. ""What happens is they think it's not a big deal, right?"" White said. There is some movement afoot to help prevent sexual harassment in the fundraising sector. The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), an organization that has 3,500 members across Canada and over 30,000 internationally, has formed the Women's Impact Initiative to address challenges facing women in the sector. The AFP, which helped commission the Harris Poll survey, is following up on the results by interviewing fundraisers about their experiences of job-related harassment. The association already has a donor bill of rights that outlines what donors are entitled to as a result of their donations, but it is now considering developing a similar document outlining a donor's responsibilities when working with fundraisers. Some in the profession say non-profits should take other concrete steps, including implementing and enforcing clear anti-harassment policies, overtly encouraging employees and bystanders to come forward with complaints and improving diversity on boards of directors. But money is often the bottom line for charitable and non-profit organizations. Perhaps accepting donations from harassers is where the buck must stop, said Caroline Riseboro, the president of AFP Toronto, the largest chapter in the world. ""If targets are missed, boards tend to get nervous. But, you know, boards need to understand if targets are missed because of a harassment issue, then that's OK. Better to keep employees safe than to meet the target or the goal."" Riseboro said she believes most boards do take action when they know about instances of harassment, but board members often don't realize the behaviour is going on. For some in the fundraising sector, any impending cultural change has come too late.  Butler, the fundraiser who worked for the IWK Foundation, left the profession, saying despite the enjoyable aspects of the job, ""there's a whole bunch of distasteful things about it"" — including, sometimes, the dynamic between the people who work in fundraising and donors. ""It doesn't feel great after a while.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-violence-harassment-fundraising-1.4945951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,N/A
95,Anonymous,2020-01-21T21:31:09.477Z,Unpaid taxes from oil and gas companies have more than doubled to $173M in rural Alberta,"The amount of unpaid property taxes that oil and gas companies owe Alberta rural municipalities has more than doubled over the last year, a trend some are calling a tax revolt. Rural Municipalities Alberta said Monday that a survey of its members shows that they are owed a total of $173 million — a 114 per cent increase since a similar survey was done last spring. ""Municipalities require property taxes to provide the infrastructure and services that industry relies on to access natural resources,"" association president Al Kemmere said in a release. ""If Alberta's property tax system is not amended to prevent oil and gas companies from refusing to pay property taxes, many rural municipalities will struggle to remain viable."" In Ponoka County, south of Edmonton, Reeve Paul McLauchlin estimates his municipality is owed about $2.6 million out of a total municipal budget of $27 million. Ponoka now has a ""write-down budget"" — a budget for money owed by failed companies unlikely to ever be paid. The county never had such a budget until recently, McLauchlin said. ""It creates operational constraints, our ability to provide community services. We have non-profits asking for assistance. We say 'no' more and more."" Industry says the way taxes are assessed is driving companies out of business. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, said Ben Brunnen, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""We defend the need for the province to take a look at how assessment works and have it reflective of the market,"" he said. ""A lot of these unpaid taxes are coming in jurisdictions where you've got assets that are older and not as productive or economic. The choice for these types of assets is to shut (them) in or find a way to reduce costs."" Those shut-in wells often end up abandoned and unreclaimed after a bankruptcy, said Brunnen, who suggested some municipalities are going to have to accept less oil and gas revenue. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled last year that municipalities are unsecured creditors in the case of a bankruptcy, which puts them at the back of the line for tax debt collection on infrastructure such as pipelines. ""Oilpatch property taxes are now voluntary,"" suggested Regan Boychuk, a researcher with the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, which works to understand the impact of old energy infrastructure. Some of the unpaid taxes are assessed to companies that remain in operation. McLauchlin, an oilpatch consultant, said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin said. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs."" Some of that has already occurred. Last year, Alberta's United Conservative government implemented legislation allowing municipalities to cut taxes on certain kinds of wells by up to about one-third. The province initially reimbursed municipalities for the cuts.  But the municipalities say that program has ended and they've been left to absorb the loss. Boychuk said mill rates on wells and other facilities haven't changed in years. Oil and gas reserves, however, have declined. ""What industry is really saying is that they've depleted their wells so far they can't cover operating costs. The wells are done and whatever wealth remains needs to be directed to cleanup rather than looted any further before bankruptcy."" The number of wells under care of the Orphan Well Association, an industry-funded group that cleans up abandoned wells, stands at 3,400 — an increase of 300 since last January. McLauchlin said industry is important to his county and council is happy to try to work out payment plans. Honouring those debts is one of the two things in life that is supposed to be unavoidable, he said. ""You've got to pay your taxes."" Alberta Municipal Affairs Minister Kaycee Madu said in a statement to CBC News that his government recognizes the impact this issue is having on rural communities. ""We are working to identify potential tools that may help balance the interests of municipalities with the economic realities facing many employers since the 2014-15 downturn,"" he said. ""A conversation is underway within government on strategies to address this situation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,[],N/A
96,Anonymous,2019-11-04T17:22:27.576Z,"Hospital patients in Canada lacking English need access to interpreters, study says","Waking up with worsening pain had Surjit Garcha worried, but the red blisters on her stomach were so alarming that she went to her neighbour's home to try to explain, in her limited English, that she needed help. Garcha, who lives alone, doesn't have the English skills to call her doctor's office and felt more comfortable going to someone she trusts. Her neighbour took her to the emergency department in Delta, B.C., where Garcha learned she had shingles, a viral infection that can include complications such as scarring and vision and hearing loss in older adults. Garcha, now 82, said the intense pain was bad enough, but not being able to understand what was wrong with her made her feel even more vulnerable. ""The employees who bring food to patients would leave it outside the door, because they could catch what I had and no visitors could come in my room,'' she said in Punjabi about her experience three years ago. Garcha's only solace was that a nurse spoke Punjabi, but it wasn't until her daughter arrived from Seattle the next day that she had any contact with a family member. Interpreters trained in medical terminology are more often provided for patients in Canada's larger centres, but a researcher from the University of Toronto said lack of access to interpretation could potentially result in unsafe health care through missed diagnoses and medical errors, suggesting language services should be a priority. Dr. Shail Rawal, lead author of a study that includes data from Toronto General and Toronto Western hospitals, said patients with a chronic disease and limited English are more likely to return to the emergency room or be readmitted to hospital because of poorer understanding of discharge instructions and not taking medication as required, compared with those who are proficient in the language and were discharged with similar health concerns. The study was published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association and includes data for all patients discharged from the two hospitals with acute conditions, pneumonia and hip fracture, and chronic conditions heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, between January 2008 and March 2016, amounting to 9,881 patients. ""We saw that if you had heart failure and limited English proficiency you were more likely to come back to the emergency room to be reassessed in 30 days after you were discharged,'' said Rawal, an assistant professor in the University of Toronto's department of medicine and a staff physician at the University Health Network, which includes the two hospitals. ""Patients who had limited English proficiency and heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease were more likely to be readmitted to hospital in the 30 or 90 days after discharge,'' she said. For those with pneumonia or hip fracture, the data showed no difference in return to hospital regardless of patients' ability to speak English, Rawal said. ""Our thinking is that those are acute conditions that have a pretty standard treatment, whether it be surgery and then rehabilitation or a course of antibiotics, whereas the two chronic conditions require a lot of patient-centred counselling and patient management plans.'' Of the 9,881 patients: Rawal said patients at the two hospitals have around-the-clock access to interpretation in various languages by phone and in-person interpretation is also available but must be pre-booked and is typically offered during business hours. ""The quality of care or the level of access to interpretation, in my view, should not vary based on which hospital you happen to present at with your illness,'' she said. ""Currently, that is the case, that depending on what hospital you go to in our city, in our province or across the country, you will have varying levels of access to professional interpretation services and I think that in a linguistically diverse country the language needs of patients and families should be met by institutions.'' Family members often step in to interpret and alleviate a patient's anxiety but may end up having to rearrange their schedules while waiting for nurses, doctors or specialists to show up at the bedside, Rawal said. However, she said previous research studies have shown that families are less accurate in their interpretation than professionals and sometimes may not wish to translate what a clinician is saying, perhaps to lessen the impact if the prognosis would be too upsetting. Kiran Malli, director of provincial language services for the Provincial Health Services Authority in British Columbia, said patients in Vancouver and the surrounding area have access to 180 languages through interpreters who work at hospitals and publicly funded long-term care homes. The top three languages are Cantonese, Mandarin and Punjabi, Malli said. In-person and phone interpretation is provided without a pre-booked appointment. The health authority started a pilot project last year to provide services by phone to family doctors' offices, she said. Another pilot on video-remote interpreting at hospitals, which Malli said would greatly benefit patients needing sign language — which is already being provided — will also start soon and benefit those living in isolated parts of the province. A few scattered grassroots programs were available in B.C. in the 1990s but the current standardized one didn't start until 2003, she said. ""It was getting pretty evident that we needed to do something a little more than just pulling up any bilingual person or calling on the overhead paging [system] to say 'If anybody speaks Cantonese could you please come to emergency,''' Malli said of the current program's genesis. ""Research shows us that as people get older, even if you know English when you're younger, you tend to revert back to your mother tongue as you age,'' she said, adding elderly people in medical distress tend to forget the English skills they have. ""I do think we are seeing more elderly patients for that reason,'' she said. It's unfair for health-care staff to expect family members to act as interpreters because, just like English-speaking patients' relatives, their role should be to support their loved ones and not to be burdened further, Malli said. ""If we are looking at equity, as family I should just be there to support my family member through whatever it might be rather than act as their language conduit,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/patients-lacking-english-need-equal-access-to-interpreters-in-canada-study-1.5346763,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/gitxsan-phrasebook-hospital-1.5345201 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/heath-technology-cma-1.5239575,N/A
97,Jason Proctor,2020-01-21T00:47:15.560Z,"Meng Wanzhou case is about the U.S. wanting Canada to enforce sanctions it rejects, defence says","Meng Wanzhou's lawyers appealed to Canadian independence Monday as they accused the U.S. of trying to use Canada to enforce economic sanctions Canadians have rejected in order to extradite the Huawei executive. Defence lawyer Richard Peck kicked off the start of Meng's formal extradition hearing in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver by telling Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that despite the Crown's claims to the contrary, the case is all about U.S. sanctions against Iran. ""It's all based on sanctions,"" Peck said in his opening statement. ""In the end, we're being asked to impose on Canada an obligation to assist the U.S. in the enforcement of its sanctions — sanctions that we have expressly rejected."" Peck said any attempt to suggest otherwise was a ""facade."" ""Canada is a sovereign nation. We have our own heritage, our own ethos, our own identity, our own standards, our own laws,"" he said. ""Canadians and Canadian courts have never hesitated to protect these values in the face of adversity — let alone on request or demand."" A lineup of cameras greeted Meng on her way to court this morning, as she left the multimillion-dollar Vancouver home where she lives under house arrest.  The 47-year-old chief financial officer of China-based telecommunications giant Huawei waved to supporters, some wishing her a happy Chinese New Year, as she arrived at the downtown courthouse about 15 minutes later. The week-long hearing comes more than a year after Meng's arrest at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018. American prosecutors want Meng sent to New York to face fraud charges related to allegations she deceived banks about Huawei's control of a company accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Over five days this week, her defence team and lawyers for Canada's attorney general will debate the question of so-called double criminality — specifically, whether the offence Meng is accused of would be considered a crime if her alleged conduct had happened in Canada. WATCH | Meng leaves her Vancouver home, greets a throng of cameras at court: Meng has made a point of displaying the GPS-monitoring ankle bracelet she wears as part of the terms of her $10-million bail agreement. She wore a black dress with giant white polka dots as she made her way, flanked by security guards, into the giant courtroom. It's the same courtroom where her bail hearing was held. Glass walls cut the lawyers and Meng off from a public gallery that holds about 150 people. The gallery was overflowing and Holmes announced the court was planning to broadcast the proceedings into the overflow area. The defence is expected to use about two days of court time, to be followed by the Crown's submissions. Both sides have filed arguments in advance of the hearing. The Crown plans to argue that the ""essence"" of the conduct is what is important in Canadian extradition as opposed to ""offence-matching"" laws on either side of the border. They say Meng is charged with fraud in that she is accused of making a misrepresentation that put banks at risk of loss. But Peck rejected that logic, saying it was a ""fiction"" to suggest the U.S. had any interest that didn't involve sanctions when it came to policing the private dealings between foreign citizens and their banks. He ran through the history of U.S. sanctions against Iran and Canada's decision to drop economic sanctions against the Islamic republic as a result of an international deal to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said the U.S. decided to implement sanctions again in 2018 when President Donald Trump left the treaty. But Canada did not follow suit. ""That move was out of step with the international community,"" Peck said.  ""What it resulted in was a decision by the United States to criminalize conduct that Canada and most of the other countries, if not all, permit."" The courtroom was filled with an array of onlookers, including lawyers from other parts of the building, students and numerous Huawei employees, many of whom have made a habit of attending the proceedings. During the afternoon, Holmes interrupted Peck's co-counsel Eric Gottardi as he discussed the elements of fraud. She asked him whether a person could be successfully prosecuted in Canada given the same set of circumstances, but with the alleged lie being told in Canada instead of Hong Kong. Gottardi seemed to indicate that they probably could. The judge then asked why the same consideration wouldn't apply to an extradition hearing. He told her he would need the night to ""crystallize"" his answer. Media from around the world have obtained court accreditation in advance of this week's hearing. Mo Vayeghan, a Vancouver criminal defence and extradition lawyer, says the case is unusual and largely without precedent, but the Crown has a good chance at success. ""American prosecutors understand that the allegations they are making need to meet the test of dual criminality,"" he said. ""They get this issue. That is why the United States prosecutors, in their indictment, they have worded their allegations broadly to include misrepresentations and fraudulent activity."" If the defence succeeds in convincing Holmes the bar of double criminality has not been met, the extradition proceedings against Meng would come to an end. But the court has scheduled a series of other hearings if necessary. Those include a week of arguments in June in which the defence will claim that Meng's rights were violated when she was detained by Canada Border Services Agency officers for three hours before her arrest by RCMP. Meng's lawyers will also argue that she is being used as a political pawn in the U.S. and China's trade battle. Her lawyers have cited comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Reuters shortly after her arrest that he would intervene in the case if it would help get the U.S. a better trade deal with China. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China last week, with no sign that he had heeded a suggestion from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December that any pact should deal with Meng and two Canadians who were detained in China shortly after her arrest. Entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were later formally arrested and now face accusations of spying in China, where they are incarcerated without access to lawyers or family.

98,Anonymous,2019-12-09T20:20:32.128Z,"Paris pension strikes shut public transport, cause traffic chaos","Paris commuters made the slow trek to work Monday through massive traffic jams as strikes against retirement plan changes halted trains and subways for a fifth straight day — with the prospect of a tougher day ahead. French President Emmanuel Macron prepared for one of the toughest weeks of his presidency as his government gets set to present a redesign of the convoluted French pension system. Macron sees melding 42 different retirement plans into one as delivering a more equitable, financially sustainable system. Unions view the move as an attack on the French way of life even though Macron's government is not expected to change the current retirement age of 62. Citing safety risks, the SNCF national rail network warned travellers to stay home or use ""alternative means of locomotion"" Monday instead of thronging train platforms in hopes of getting one of the few available trains running. The national road authority reported more than 600 kilometres of traffic problems at morning rush hour around the Paris region — up from 150 kilometres on an average day. Paris police planned for a huge pension protest march on Tuesday, similar to the one last Thursday when more than 800,000 people across France took part. Fearing possible violence on its fringes, police warned they would mobilize significant resources immediately to stop violence. All restaurants and shops along the march route were ordered closed, police said. Air France, the national carrier, said more than 25 per cent of its domestic traffic would be grounded Tuesday by the strike, along with more than 10 per cent of its medium-haul flights. Long-haul trips were not to be affected. It said the French civil aviation authority had asked all airlines to cut back flights 20 per cent on Tuesday at six airports, including Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille.

99,Anonymous,2019-12-09T20:20:32.128Z,"Paris pension strikes shut public transport, cause traffic chaos","Paris commuters made the slow trek to work Monday through massive traffic jams as strikes against retirement plan changes halted trains and subways for a fifth straight day — with the prospect of a tougher day ahead. French President Emmanuel Macron prepared for one of the toughest weeks of his presidency as his government gets set to present a redesign of the convoluted French pension system. Macron sees melding 42 different retirement plans into one as delivering a more equitable, financially sustainable system. Unions view the move as an attack on the French way of life even though Macron's government is not expected to change the current retirement age of 62. Citing safety risks, the SNCF national rail network warned travellers to stay home or use ""alternative means of locomotion"" Monday instead of thronging train platforms in hopes of getting one of the few available trains running. The national road authority reported more than 600 kilometres of traffic problems at morning rush hour around the Paris region — up from 150 kilometres on an average day. Paris police planned for a huge pension protest march on Tuesday, similar to the one last Thursday when more than 800,000 people across France took part. Fearing possible violence on its fringes, police warned they would mobilize significant resources immediately to stop violence. All restaurants and shops along the march route were ordered closed, police said. Air France, the national carrier, said more than 25 per cent of its domestic traffic would be grounded Tuesday by the strike, along with more than 10 per cent of its medium-haul flights. Long-haul trips were not to be affected. It said the French civil aviation authority had asked all airlines to cut back flights 20 per cent on Tuesday at six airports, including Paris, Bordeaux and Marseille. Only about a sixth of French trains were running Monday and international train lines also saw disruptions. Activists also blocked bus depots around Paris.

100,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-17T14:58:18.301Z,B.C. appoints special prosecutor to probe Crown conduct in decade-old child murder case,"The office of B.C.'s attorney general has appointed one of the country's top defence lawyers to probe the conduct of prosecutors involved in a second-degree murder charge laid against a babysitter in 2011. Marilyn Sandford, a Vancouver lawyer, was named as a special prosecutor Wednesday following inquiries by CBC's The Fifth Estate about why defence counsel was not provided a key report that contradicted evidence used to charge Tammy Bouvette of Cranbrook, B.C., with murder. In May 2011, the then-28-year-old babysitter called 911 after she found 19-month-old Iyanna Teeple unresponsive in a bathtub. Iyanna was flown to Calgary for treatment, where she eventually died. Retired RCMP Cpl. Chris Faulkner told The Fifth Estate's Mark Kelley that the Mounties originally considered the death a tragic accident, after Bouvette said she left the baby to attend to a spill in another room. ""I don't believe that she ever intended to kill the child,"" Faulkner said. ""And there's nothing in our investigation that would state that she intended to cause the death."" That all changed after a B.C. prosecutor heard from a Calgary medical examiner in October 2011. Court documents obtained by The Fifth Estate show that the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, Dr. Evan Matshes, told prosecutors there was ""no benign"" explanation for some injuries found on the toddler and he identified bruising that was ""typical of child abuse.""  Three weeks after speaking with Matshes, B.C. prosecutors charged Bouvette. RCMP praised the ""efforts of the medical examiner in Calgary"" as being ""instrumental in pushing the case forward."" The Fifth Estate discovered that medical experts were asked to review the autopsy after concerns were raised about some of Matshes' other findings. Alberta Justice had convened an expert panel to analyze his findings in 14 cases, including Iyanna's. The panel of three forensic pathologists stated in their report that the comments Matshes made to the prosecutor about ""intentional injuries"" on the body and prior abuse were ""unreasonable."" Bouvette's lawyer, Jesse Gelber, told The Fifth Estate he did not receive that review, despite asking the Crown prosecutor if further disclosure was available. ""I had no idea, that was not disclosed to me,"" said Gelber. By law, prosecutors must provide defence counsel with all relevant documents in a criminal case. Without knowing about the panel finding in her favour, Bouvette pleaded guilty to criminal negligence in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""I would say without qualification that Tammy Bouvette is a victim of a miscarriage of justice,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada who has reviewed the case files obtained by The Fifth Estate. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada … that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge, and so to avoid the potential life sentence took a plea to a lesser crime for a shorter sentence."" For his part, Gelber said the damage will never go away for his client. ""There was a horrible stigma, and that stigma even extended to her family and her children,"" he said. ""It was devastating for her."" The Fifth Estate found Bouvette, now 36, living homeless in New Westminster, just outside of Vancouver. ""I am not a baby-killer … People just look at me differently like I was some type of monster and I'm not,"" she said, before the special prosecutor was appointed. ""I'm a loving person and a loving mom."" Bouvette said knowing about the panel's review of the autopsy has taken ""a big weight off my chest, it makes a big difference."" Still, she will not forgive those who did not disclose that information when it would have really mattered. ""Shame on them for not doing their job right,"" Bouvette said. ""It has taken everything from me: my freedom, my whole self, everything."" The Fifth Estate investigation has found that other autopsy reviews were also not provided to defence lawyers in two other second-degree murder cases in Alberta. In a statement, Eric Tolppanen, head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, said Alberta Justice provided the documentation in Bouvette's case to B.C. Crown prosecutors.  The Fifth Estate later inquired with the B.C. Prosecution Service about whether it had received those documents. After waiting for a response for several days, journalists received the notice that the special prosecutor would be investigating the service's conduct. The statement said the investigations results will be released at an ""appropriate time"" and that neither the Prosecution Service nor the special prosecutor ""will comment further."" Tolppanen also said he views the findings of the expert panel as ""inconsequential"" because the Alberta government agreed to quash the findings after Matshes went to court. An Alberta Queen's Bench justice ruled that the panel's review was not fair to Matshes and that he had not been given enough time to respond or provide additional materials. Although Alberta Justice agreed to the quashing. its lawyer told the court it was ""integral to the administration of justice"" that a second panel investigate the accuracy of Matshes' work. That was more than six years ago. So far there has been no second panel. Matshes continues to stand by his work.

101,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-15T01:14:38.650Z,Police officer sheds tears as he describes 'gruesome' death scene at Regina murder trial,"WARNING: Story contains graphic content.  With tears in his eyes, Regina police Const. Bryceton Fink described the shock he felt when he saw Jenny McKay's body lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor and tried to call out to her. Fink became emotional as he testified Tuesday at the trial of Jason McKay, who is accused of killing Jenny, his wife, in September 2017. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the death of the 33-year-old woman, who was originally from New Glasgow, N.S. The police officer and his partner, Graham McDonald, had been dispatched to the Angus Street residence for a welfare check, Fink​ explained during his testimony at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench. The officers had been told that Jason McKay's mother was worried about her son, who had a history of self-harm. They were told she feared he might be intoxicated, or had used his medication incorrectly.  Fink said ​when they arrived, Jason McKay was covered in blood but assured them he was not injured.​ Fink testified that in response to McDonald's question, ""Where's Jenny?"" McKay's exact response was ""She's dead. I ​f--king killed her."" McDonald stayed with McKay as Fink entered the home, finding what he described as the ""gruesome​""​ scene in the kitchen.  Fink wiped tears from his eyes as he remembered finding Jenny, with a large knife still protruding from her chest. She was cold to the touch and had no pulse. He said what appeared to be blood was smeared on the floor and the kitchen cabinets. Crown prosecutor Adam Breker, who walked Fink through photos of the scene, paused briefly to ask if the scene was difficult and shocking to come across. Fink, his voice thick, agreed it was. Const. Alyssa Gregory was part of the Regina police forensic identification u​nit in 2017. She testified that there was a lot of blood at the crime scene, compared to what she had previously experienced. ​She noted Jenny appeared to have multiple wounds around her head and neck. ​ Gregory found and seized broken knives in the kitchen. She also documented a serrated knife on the floor by Jenny's right hand. She said she found a cellphone on the table, which was later determined to belong to Jason McKay. It contained photos of Jenny's apparently dead body. Gregory said they showed Jenny almost as police found her — except that the knife was missing from her chest in the photos, and a knife was shown ""inside the victim's mouth.""​​ Gregory said the crime scene appeared to mostly be contained to the kitchen area, where she found long strands of hair in Jenny's hands, a blood-soaked blue sweater, and a broken necklace. There was also an engagement ring and a wedding band in the pocket of her shorts. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Thomas Hynes, Gregory confirmed that there had been no apparent effort made to clean up the blood, despite a nearby closet containing cleaning tools. During Tuesday's testimony, several video clips that showed McKay in a police car, and then at the police station, were played in the courtroom. They showed ​McKay becoming combative​ as he was questioned by police, repeatedly challenging the officers to fight him.""He wanted to fight anybody who was willing,"" ​said Const. Garth Fleece, describing McKay as increasingly ""agitated."" Fleece, who was also responsible for photographing Jason McKay's body to document any injuries, testified that McKay appeared essentially uninjured. The trial, which is being heard by Justice Michael Tochor, is scheduled for three weeks. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288,N/A
102,Jonathan Landrum Jr.,2019-12-17T15:13:53.444Z,"The Rise of Skywalker earns tributes, standing ovation at world premiere","Audiences rose to their feet giving the latest Star Wars film a standing ovation after the credits rolled at the ending of the franchise's third trilogy. Cheers often erupted with enthusiasm throughout while viewing The Rise of Skywalker on Monday night. Throughout the film, the audience applauded, gasped and cheered at major plot twists. After the screening, the film was met with a slew of positive reviews after director J.J. Abrams told the audience before the film played that he was ""mostly terrified"" to show the movie, which ran for nearly 2 1/2 hours. ""Nothing brings people together quite like Star Wars,"" Abrams said. Seated in the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood were Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker, and director Steven Spielberg, who Abrams specifically thanked. Hamill received a standing ovation when he was introduced, as did composer John Williams. Walt Disney Co closed off an entire city block in the centre of Hollywood to host the celebrity-studded debut screening of the highly-anticipated film.  Comedian-actor Seth Green, who attended the world premiere with his wife, Clare Grant, said he enjoyed watching how the latest film closed the final chapter of the Skywalker saga. ""I loved it,"" Green said. ""I'm going to be unpacking this for a while. It's dense, it's deep, it's full of awesome stuff. To me, it's a satisfying finale of this saga."" Fans turned the premiere into a living tribute to various eras of the space epic franchise, with some dressing up like Hamill's Luke and Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia from the 1977 original film with others opting for the look of the characters' mother, Queen Amidala, and many donning the armour of Stormtroopers, bounty hunters and Darth Vader. ""It was everything I'd hope it would be and more,"" said Dwayne Smith, who went to the premiere with his wife, Shannon, and son Kayden. Both father and son were wearing black First Order costumes. ""The twists, turns and nostalgia. It was emotional,"" Smith said during the premiere's after party. ""It had action. It had everything. If you're on the fence from the last film, you'll be happy that it's back on track."" Fan Katie Wilson said the movie ""completely blew my mind."" ""They did such a good job being able to mix this new Star Wars world that they created... with the nostalgia that the fans that grew up with Star Wars for years and years love,"" she said.  Attendees were treated to a blue carpet spectacle that included appearances by the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, and Chewbacca stepping out of a black sport utility vehicle and posing for photographers with long arms stretched in the air. Along with Spielberg, filmmakers such as Ava DuVernay, Spike Lee and Noah Baumbach were among those who walked the blue carpet, along with original trilogy stars Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford and the young actors made famous by the newest films: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Kelly Marie Tran.  The premiere was the first time anyone outside a select group saw the ninth film in the core Star Wars story. Rise of Skywalker arrives in theatres Friday. Attendees had a chance to walk past an exhibit lined with numerous photos from previous films including a portrait with the late Fisher and her daughter Billie Lourd, another photo with Mark Hamill hugging Fisher and several Stormtrooper uniforms. Few films have captured the popular imagination like 1977's Star Wars, which has sparked three film trilogies, TV shows, toys and more. The Rise of Skywalker is one of the year's most-anticipated releases, in part because filmmakers have promised a conclusion to the story of the Skywalker clan that includes Luke, Leia and their father Anakin, who became Darth Vader. Disney paid more than $4 billion US to acquire the Star Wars franchise in 2012 and the recent trilogy started by Abrams in 2015 with The Force Awakens.  While it returned beloved characters from the original trilogy to the big screen for the first time since 1983, the story has focused on a new generation of characters played by Ridley, Adam Driver, Boyega and others. Fans remain divided on 2017's The Last Jedi, which showed a late-in-life Skywalker as a bitter recluse who cut himself off from his friends and broader conflicts embroiling the fictional far, far away galaxy. Disney has not yet announced film plans post-Rise of Skywalker. Work on a trilogy set outside the Skywalker story has been halted, and no new stand-alone films have been announced since the poor showing of 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story. ""We're going to make sure we take our time until we know that it's right,"" said Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger. Regardless of the reception to Rise of Skywalker, Disney has already delivered Star Wars fans two wins in 2019. Its theme parks in Florida and California opened massive Star Wars-themed expansions this year where guests are essentially transported to a distant planet. The company's new streaming service, Disney Plus, also debuted the first live-action Star Wars television series in The Mandalorian, which introduced a popular new character: Baby Yoda.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/skywalker-premiere-hollywood-1.5398915,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-1.5330290,N/A

The provincial Crown corporation tasked with online sales and wholesale distribution of recreational pot reported revenues of $64 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. However, Ontario's consolidated financial statements show the OCRC, which operates as the Ontario Cannabis Store, racked up expenses totalling $106 million during the period. Canada legalized cannabis for adult use on Oct. 17 last year, and the rollout was mired by supply chain issues and product shortages, which largely have been resolved in recent months. The supply shortages prompted the Ontario government to cap the initial number of retail licences at 25, but the province is in the process of increasing the number of legal pot outlets to 75 by October. The OCS announced last week that chief executive Patrick Ford would be retiring. Cal Bricker, senior vice-president of horse racing at Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp., was named interim chief executive while a search for a replacement is conducted. More from Queen's Park: Responding Friday to a request for comment from CBC Toronto, a spokesperson for Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips said initial startup costs were to blame for the financial loss. ""Cannabis legalization is a new venture for Ontario. There were investments required for setting up a system that could achieve our objectives — which is to protect youth and combat the illegal market. The OCRC's revenue outlook reflected the initial costs for the development of this retail system,"" Emily Hogeveen wrote in an emailed response. ""The Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (OCRC) needed to make foundational investments to support Ontario's approach to retail sales — which will see a broad network of private retail stores across the province established to effectively combat the illegal market,"" Hogeveen added.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-cannabis-loss-1.5282994,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/cannabis-store-judicial-challenge-1.5281897 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brad-blair-opp-doug-ford-news-conference-1.5281588 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-deficit-update-1.5282527,N/A
104,Rafferty Baker,2019-06-05T22:12:04.505Z,"Overdose crisis death toll would be more than double without harm reduction, study says","The overdose crisis has killed an astonishing number of people across Canada, and British Columbia has been hit especially hard. A new study published Wednesday in the journal, Addiction, found that without harm reduction efforts, the death toll would have been more than twice as horrific. Researchers looked at nearly two years of data, beginning when the public health emergency was declared in B.C. in April 2016 and ending in December 2017. According to the study led by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC), there were 2,177 people killed by overdose in the province in that time. But more than 3,000 deaths were prevented. ""It was one of these things that — you almost had to go back and check the numbers to make sure they were correct — that they actually were that high,"" said Mike Irvine, a post-doctoral fellow at BCCDC who works with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and the Mathematics Institute at the University of British Columbia. Irvine said the impact of widely distributed take-home naloxone kits was the most significant, in terms of lives saved. ""In 2017, there were 60,000 kits that had been distributed, so this is paying tribute, really, to how much that program had ramped up and rolled out across the whole province,"" he said. In contrast, from 2012 to 2015, about 5,000 naloxone kits were distributed. In the period from April 2016 to December 2017, the study found there were: According to Irvine, the three health interventions combined resulted in more overdose deaths prevented than they would have if each were carried out alone. He said the team's research found that as the prevalence of fentanyl analogues like carfentanil began to increase in late 2016 and 2017, so too did harm reduction services. ""We know that this [crisis] is being driven by a toxic, highly variable street drug supply,"" said Irvine. ""There's a huge number of deaths that were averted, in part because of the sheer volume and the scope of these services, but also the fact that the street drugs had become so toxic within that period."" Irvine said the study's findings are a reminder that health officials' response to the overdose crisis in the province is effective, but also that the deadly crisis is still a major challenge.

Preston Manning, who channelled western alienation into the creation of the Reform party in 1987, told the Canadian Club of Calgary that there is a lot of anger across the country. ""Western alienation, fuelled by the downturn in the energy sector and political resistance to the free movement of petroleum across provincial boundaries to tidewater and world markets, is reviving western separatism, particularly in Saskatchewan and Alberta,"" Manning, 77, said Wednesday. ""Separatist sentiment is also reviving in Quebec. The Bloc Québécois is doing better this election than last time. And if the federal courts declare Bill 21 to be unconstitutional, then they're going to have another uprising in Quebec on that basis."" Bill 21 bans some public-sector workers such as teachers from wearing religious symbols on the job. Manning said there is also increasing evidence that millennials ""of any and every political stripe"" are increasingly alienated from politics. He doesn't expect things to get better after the Oct. 21 vote. ""That's going to be a challenge for the next Parliament, no matter who ends up winning the election. Recognize the validity of the concerns. Don't dismiss them. Don't tell people you've got no right to be angry or mad,"" he said. ""I'm worried that you're going to see somewhat of a revival of separatism in Quebec. I don't think western alienation's being addressed. I'm worried that it may end up with a more divided Parliament and a more divided country than we did before."" Manning served as a member of Parliament from 1993 to 2002. He was the only leader of the Reform party, which evolved into the Canadian Alliance, which in turn merged with the Progressive Conservative Party to form today's Conservative Party of Canada. Manning suggested voters may have a wider knowledge of political issues these days from tweets and blogs, but their understanding is shallower. He said he's also disappointed that the level of civility seems to have been eroded by social media. The high number of election promises during the campaign has also caught his attention.

106,Heidi Atter,2020-01-10T19:54:40.311Z,Unifor fences off fuel centre in latest job action escalation,"Unifor fenced off a fuel centre in Regina Friday, the day after a union-produced video identifying replacement workers at the Co-op refinery was posted online. The actions are the latest escalations in a labour dispute that has now stretched on more than a month. About 700 workers from the Co-op refinery were locked out in early December. At a news conference Tuesday, the union said it would escalate job action. On Friday at 4 a.m. CST, union members started fencing off a fuel and propane station in northeast Regina. Unifor said the decision was made after the union asked the company to return to the bargaining and the company did not want to take concessions off the table.  Kevin Bittman, president of Unifor local 594, was on the picket line Friday. ""They've locked us out of our employment, so today FCL [Federated Co-operatives Limited] employees aren't going into their work,"" he said. Bittman said any employees inside were allowed to leave and that the union talked to the fire marshalls and opened some gates for emergency vehicles only. The Co-op Refinery Complex said in a statement the blockades puts public safety at risk. The refinery said the site has large amounts of fuel and propane, and the distribution is critical to heat homes and livestock and construction sites. It's always possible Unifor could be hit with another injunction, Bittman said. ""The legal system is there for a reason and if somebody has a problem with what we're doing, or think it's illegal, that's the avenue they have to go in,"" he said. Bittman said he is not sure if the fences are legal. He said they have a right to picket and that is what they are doing.  On Thursday, Unifor posted a video, titled Meet the Scabs, on its Twitter page. The video names and shows images of about a dozen people. As of Friday morning it had more than 26,000 views. Some photographs appeared to be taken off of social media while others were photographs of people arriving or at their work. Each person is labelled 'Scab at Co-op Refinery.'  The union said previously that it would ""shine a bright light"" on replacement workers in Regina. Unifor made a similar video in Gander, Newfoundland during a labour dispute there.  Scott Doherty, Unifor's lead negotiator and executive assistant to the president, said that being a replacement worker does not grant a person privacy. ""We believe we have the right to do it,"" Doherty said. ""I think people knew that we were at some point in time going to do this."" The Co-op Refinery Complex said in a release that the video was ""disgusting"" and that it was disappointed but not surprised by the release of the video.  ""[Replacement workers] do not deserve to be treated this way. Unifor's behaviour and these tactics are not acceptable,"" Gil Le Dressay, vice president of refinery operations, said in a release.  Le Dressay said the refinery will protect the safety and well-being of people in the video.  ""It is abundantly clear that Unifor's Toronto-based leadership have no respect for anyone but themselves and that their tactics are not in line with Canadian values,"" the release said.  Doherty said he believes Unifor members are still getting support from the public, even when some people don't like what they are doing.  ""Frankly scabs should really think twice about whether or not it's worthwhile for them to take the jobs of somebody who has been disrespected by their employer — as these individuals have,"" he said.  Bittman said the union is not putting people's safety at risk by identifying replacement workings. ""There's lots of work out there. They don't need to be going inside and doing that,"" he said.  Bittman says his members aren't feeling any pressure to stop picketing.  ""The members are solid.

107,Holly Caruk,2019-12-26T12:00:00.378Z,From a hockey-themed wedding to facing off against cancer: How these Manitoba newlyweds stayed strong,"When Kyle and Stefanie Calder said ""I do"" in September 2018, they didn't realize the ""in sickness and in health"" part of their vows would be put to the test so soon. The young Manitoba couple — who attracted media attention during the Winnipeg Jets' 2018 playoff run with their remarkable ""fan cave"" — celebrated their special day with a Winnipeg Jets-themed wedding, a Stanley Cup cake, and a ceremonial puck drop. A month and a half later, after Kyle suffered a knee injury at work, they got some devastating news. ""I got a call that morning.… I don't remember a whole lot of the conversation, I very clearly just remember [hearing] 'You have cancer,'"" said Kyle, who just turned 31. ""It was very frightening to hear those words, and there's still a part of me now that still doesn't want to believe that I even had it,"" he said. Scans showed that what the Calders thought was a knee injury was osteosarcoma, a very aggressive form of bone cancer. ""My first question for [the doctor] was, 'Am I going to die?'"" said Kyle. ""It was definitely shocking. Not what we were expecting at all,"" said Stefanie, 29. There had been no symptoms, other than the pain in Kyle's knee. He's a carpenter and a hockey player, and is no stranger to being bumped and bruised. ""He had injured himself at work. We thought, you know, at the worst he broke something or he fractured something,"" said Stefanie. ""As soon as he said it was cancer, it was just … where do we go from here? What's our next step?"" The following weeks were filled with more scans, blood tests and a bone biopsy. The couple, who live near Beausejour — about 50 kilometres northeast Winnipeg — soon realized any plans they had for their future, or even a honeymoon, would have to wait. ""We have a motto, which is 'one day at a time,' because we started looking further and further ahead, and it became very overwhelming very quickly,"" Kyle said. Stefanie and Kyle had planned on starting a family, but were told that while Kyle was undergoing treatment, that wouldn't be possible because of the side effects of his chemotherapy. ""The very next day we went to the fertility clinic and talked with the doctors there, and yeah — we left pretty upset,"" said Kyle. They were told their best plan was to try in vitro fertilization, but it wasn't something they could afford. The only other option the couple saw was to put off the cancer treatment. ""It was, let's try and see if we can conceive while we still have that chance now, because we were told it would be up to two years before we could try [to] conceive naturally, with him going through chemo treatments,"" said Stefanie. Kyle delayed the start of his chemotherapy until the New Year, in the hopes he and his wife could have one last normal Christmas together. Kyle said because he was young and otherwise healthy, doctors began an aggressive round of chemotherapy. ""Physically, I'm going to say that I was somewhat prepared for what was going to happen. I wasn't nearly prepared in any way mentally,"" Kyle said. Within a few weeks of getting treatment, Kyle casually ran his hand through his hair while watching TV one day. ""I just kind of touched my head, and my whole hand was just full of hair,"" he said. He underwent three months of chemotherapy before travelling to Vancouver for surgery, where about eight inches of his tibia was removed and replaced with a steel prosthetic. Part of his calf muscle was removed and used to rebuild the muscle over his knee. Then came more chemo. Along with that came nausea, loss of appetite, and mouth sores so severe it hurt to drink water. ""The mental game was very tough, and is still very tough,"" Kyle said. ""It takes a lot some days just to get out of bed."" As Kyle fought a physical battle, he and his wife also struggled to navigate the health-care and benefits system. Stefanie had to continue to work, while also being Kyle's primary caregiver. As the physical tolls became apparent, so did the emotional ones. ""I wasn't myself.… I didn't feel like myself. I definitely didn't look like myself,"" said Kyle. ""[You] go to a dark place. That happens.… It still happens."" As the year went on, the couple stayed strong and leaned on each other — and their love of hockey — to get them through. The pair still made a point of sharing every Jets game together, sometimes listening over the radio from a hospital bed. ""We watch them together,"" said Stefanie. ""We always, always make sure that that is something that at least brings that little bit of light to our day."" Now, the couple are looking forward to a better year coming up. ""I was never told, 'Kyle, you are in remission.' But I was told that the chemo had worked, everything was successful,"" Kyle said. He has a followup exam in the new year, and will need those checkups regularly for the rest of his life. There's also a chance his body will someday reject the steel implant. The two are still looking forward to one day starting a family, and still figuring out how to adjust to their new life. In some ways, things are getting better. Kyle has recently been able to head back downstairs into the couple's Jets cave — something he couldn't do for a while because of the pain and stiffness in his leg. That's helped them return to some sense of normalcy, even though things will never quite be the same. The couple who bonded over their love of hockey were also a team on the ice — they played together on a coed hockey team. They may never have that chance again. ""I'm struggling, mentally, with it,"" said Kyle. ""Just trying to cope with everything that we just went through. Still trying to plan for the future and then realize the things that I'm not going to be able to do anymore."" That includes ""most likely not being able to play hockey ever again — not on skates anyways,"" he said. ""So there's a lot of grief, and I've tried really, really hard through all of this to not ever try and feel down on myself, or self-pity."" The couple say the support they've received from family, friends and co-workers has been critical in helping them through the past year. ""You can't survive without those supports,"" said Stefanie. But Kyle is quick to give the credit to his wife. ""It's very important to me that other people know how much of a rock star my wife is,"" he said. ""I wouldn't still be here if I wasn't with her and [didn't] have the bond that we have together."" He also says it's important for people to know that it's not just those who have cancer whose lives are affected by the disease — those around them make sacrifices as well. ""People might not always show that they have things going on in their lives that may be upsetting or causing problems for them or their family,"" he said. ""I just want people to realize that there's families out there that are fighting physically, but mentally there's probably an even bigger fight.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/hockey-wedding-cancer-newlyweds-1.5386245,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-jets-fan-cave-couple-1.4605500,N/A
108,"Melissa Mancini, Katie Pedersen, Valérie Ouellet",2018-01-26T10:00:00.637Z,'It's a horror movie': Nursing home security footage provides raw picture of resident violence problem,"Meyer Sadoway died in hospital on Jan. 20, 2013, four days after breaking his hip at his nursing home in Toronto. Staff at Baycrest told his family he'd fallen twice. But the security camera footage from the hallway — which his family says it had to wait six months to finally watch — told a much different story. ""It's a horror movie,"" says Diane Miles, Sadoway's younger sister. It shows the 84-year-old standing in front of his room at night as a larger man wearing one shoe lumbers toward his door. The two men struggle briefly before the bigger man shoves Sadoway to the floor. As Sadoway writhes on the ground, his attacker grabs a chair and hurls it at him, striking Sadoway's walker. ""I thought I would explode when I saw it,"" Miles says. ""I thought, 'How is this possible?'"" A Marketplace investigation has found reports of resident-on-resident abuse have risen sharply in Ontario nursing homes. When Marketplace first examined the issue back in 2006, there was an average of four reports each day, according to provincial data provided by long-term care facilities. A decade later, there were about nine reports a day provincewide, despite a fairly small increase in the number of residents — from 75,128 in 2006 to 78,000 in 2016. Experts say there are two major factors behind the rise: a growing portion of the nursing home population suffers from dementia, and many facilities don't have enough staff to handle the behavioural challenges that come with it.  Many of the nursing home officials who spoke with Marketplace say the increased numbers reflect more thorough reporting practices.  According to the most recent provincial data, reports of resident-on-resident abuse rose 105 per cent in just six years, from 1,580 in 2011 to 3,238 in 2016. Meanwhile, the prevalence of dementia increased from 56 per cent of residents in 2009-2010 to 63.1 per cent in 2016, according to the Ontario Long Term Care Association, which says it represents 70 per cent of facilities in the province. ""We have a much older and sicker and frailer population, so you're getting more people who are acting out and have these behaviours, and also the people that they are acting out against are frailer and more likely to suffer some kind of consequence,"" says Jane Meadus, a staff lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto. Sadoway's sisters, Miles and her twin Frances Sadoway, spent many years advocating on behalf of their brother, who had schizophrenia, a developmental disability and lived in institutions for most of his life. A stroke in 2003 left him with decreased mobility and difficulty swallowing food. That was followed by a heart attack in 2008. His ailments also included arthritis, cataracts and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In July 2012, he was transferred to a special unit at Baycrest for people with memory loss and behavioural issues. Living with so many people suffering from memory loss was difficult for Sadoway, his sisters say. He found the unit too noisy and often became frustrated. He lashed out aggressively toward other residents on several occasions in the months before he died. Long-term care residents with dementia are sometimes referred to as ""exit-seeking."" Experts say they get confused and try to leave when they don't know where they are. Sadoway's room was near the exit. His sisters say fellow residents with memory problems would gravitate to the area and try to go outside. When they couldn't open the exit door, they would drift into Sadoway's room and mill about. His sisters say this is why the security footage appears to show him standing guard in front of his door. They learned after the fact that their brother's assailant had become increasingly violent and attempted to fight other residents in the days before the attack. He tended to wander at night, going in and out of other residents' rooms. Workers have been calling for a minimum staff-to-resident ratio in Ontario long-term care homes for years. The province only requires there be a registered nurse on duty 24 hours a day. It's difficult to prevent violence if there aren't enough workers on the floor, says Miranda Ferrier, president of the Ontario Personal Support Workers Association, which represents 35,000 PSWs and advocates for standards in the profession.  ""When we're talking about putting more care into the system, we need to talk about more scrubs on the floor. How many staff do you have?"" she says. ""I truly believe that is the answer to so many of our problems."" So, too, is proper training, Ferrier says. The majority of PSWs aren't trained in crisis prevention and intervention strategies for people with dementia, she says. ""That's not mandatory for us."" At night, when residents with dementia tend to need the most support, staffing levels can be especially low, she says. ""They don't sleep. They're up. And they're up all night. And typically what they'll have is one personal support worker on a floor of 25 or 30 [residents]."" Antipsychotic medications used to be more widely prescribed in nursing homes to treat symptoms of dementia such as aggression. In 2012-2013, nearly a third of seniors in Ontario facilities were prescribed these drugs without a related diagnosis of psychosis. But there has since been a push from families and advocates to get seniors off antipsychotics because the drugs were found to have dangerous side-effects, including increased risk of confusion, falls and death.   CBC hired two statisticians to analyze government data from more than 600 long-term care facilities in the province over the past five years. They found that as antipsychotic usage went down, reports of resident-on-resident abuse went up. Julia Kirkham, a physician and researcher at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., who studies geriatric psychiatry, says there's a lot of pressure on nursing homes to reduce the use of antipsychotics and to prevent violence at the same time — a daunting task made more difficult without adequate staffing or resources. ""There has to be some give there,"" she says. Kirkham is working with 10 nursing homes in Ontario and Saskatchewan to train staff to recognize which residents would benefit from being taken off antipsychotics. But she says there's a need for more research on potential unanticipated or unintended consequences. She says another factor that may help explain the violence numbers is simply that nursing homes are being more proactive with their reporting. Sadoway's sisters chose not to have an autopsy, for religious reasons, so there is no official cause of death. They say the coroner encouraged them to ask questions about how their brother broke his hip. It took six months before an agreement was reached with Baycrest to meet and discuss their brother's final hours at the home.  It was that day, sitting in a room in their brother's former home, surrounded by Baycrest staff, when they saw the video for the first time.  ""I'm thinking, 'I can't believe that's my brother,'"" Miles says of the experience. Baycrest said it couldn't speak to Sadoway's case specifically, but the home did tell CBC in an email that while advocates may believe more staff would eliminate violent behaviour, ""no amount of care planning can prevent all altercations, short of restricting a dementia patient's rights and freedoms through environmental, physical or drug-induced restraints."" Ontario Health and Long-Term Care Minister Eric Hoskins says the government has committed to a number of strategies to reduce abuse in long-term care, including a promise to provide a daily average of four hours of direct personal care to every resident. The Canadian Union of Public Employees expressed concern about the plan when it was announced in November, saying the ""announcement is not what it seems."" ""Right now, the government counts workers who are off sick or on vacation as if they are by the bedside,"" CUPE Ontario secretary treasurer Candace Rennick said in a statement at the time. ""This doesn't help seniors when they're calling for help to the bathroom."" The union also said it was concerned there was no timeline for the rollout of the plan. But Hoskins says he's confident the government is ""making the changes to reduce and eliminate the violence that we do see, and that regrettably does happen."" He says the government ""won't rest"" until the number of abuse reports in long-term care homes is zero.  ​CBC analyzed six years of data (2011-2016) obtained through Ontario's Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, public records and the Canadian Institute for Health Information. We counted all abuse and neglect reports involving caregivers and residents submitted by long-term care facilities through the ministry's critical incidents system. Some of these reports have been found to be unsubstantiated upon investigation. The ministry's definition of abuse includes physical, sexual, verbal and emotional abuse.

109,Kerry Campbell,2019-11-06T10:00:00.380Z,"P.E.I.'s child advocate to gain independence, new office as PCs look to fulfil election pledge","The P.E.I. government is looking for an office for a new child and youth advocate, and one line in the official tender document sums up a significant change in government policy that occurred as a result of the April 23 provincial election. ""The new office space must be independent and therefore cannot be located on the same floor as any other provincial government department, service or agency,"" the tender states. It's been more than four years since the inquest into the tragic death of four-year-old Nash Campbell touched off a political debate over whether P.E.I. should appoint an independent child advocate to serve as a watchdog over the rights and interests of Island children. After years of deferrals, the Liberal government of Wade MacLauchlan took a partial step in that direction, appointing a new children's commissioner and advocate in January 2019. But rather than an independent officer of the legislature, whose job it is to scrutinize government, that position is part of government, answering to the premier. The office of the current commissioner is on the fifth floor of the Shaw Building, where you'll also find the premier's office and cabinet chambers. Both the PCs and the Greens campaigned during the spring election on promises to make the position independent, and this fall in the legislature the PC government of Dennis King will table legislation to do just that. ""It's really important that that person be outside government systems and able to comment freely and to really identify where there's room for improvement,"" said Jane Ledwell, executive director of the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The advisory council has been pushing for an independent child advocate for the better part of a decade, and was one of the groups that responded to public consultations over the summer and fall looking at a draft of the new legislation. As an example of what a child advocate outside government could take on, Ledwell pointed to recent cases where school staff were convicted of sexual misconduct against students. ""What are the policy things that could have prevented this? What are the systemic ways of addressing these behaviours that could have prevented the harm that has come to children in our community as a result of these abuses?"" said Ledwell.  ""An independent child advocate can look at things at that level and we really hope that that will be one of the priorities when the child advocate becomes independent — to be able to look at some of those recent situations and say, 'OK, where did the system go wrong?'"" According to the draft legislation, the child advocate would have the power to investigate the provision of a wide range of government services and how they impact children. That includes child protection, adoption, social assistance, education, health, mental health and addictions, and programs and services administered through the Department of Justice. The child advocate would also have the power to compel testimony, order the disclosure of documents and investigate deaths and serious injuries involving children if the provision of a government service was somehow involved. Michael Zimmerman, legal and policy advisor for P.E.I.'s existing office for children and youth, said making the child advocate independent from government represents best practices ""throughout Canada as well as worldwide"" as a way to ""protect and promote the rights of children."" Zimmerman said the biggest potential impact to come from the change could be to impress upon the public ""that children and youth do have rights, and they have rights that are distinct from adults, and they also have the right and opportunity to have their voices and opinions heard and considered by decision makers."" Zimmerman said the three staff currently with the office for children and youth — himself included — will transfer over to the new independent office if and when the legislation comes into effect. Michele Dorsey, the current child commissioner appointed by the Liberals, would be eligible to be appointed to the new child advocate position, but that decision would rest with the legislative assembly, on the recommendation of the legislative management committee. As for the change of location referenced in the government tender document, Zimmerman said given that the child advocate position is about to become independent, the office has to move. Zimmerman said families who might want to come forward to the child advocate with concerns about child protection services or the education system need to know the person they're approaching is not part of government. ""We need to ensure ... that people have a safe place to come and talk to us,"" Zimmerman said, adding that an office in a government building ""might impact the ability of people to feel like they're welcome and able to share their thoughts and opinions.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-office-1.5348782,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/patricia-hennessey-nash-campbell-inquest-yields-15-recommendations-1.3015550 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/nash-campbell-patricia-hennessey-inquest-recommendations-province-1.3326779 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-roger-jabbour-students-review-complaints-protections-1.5325190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-arthur-mcguigan-sentencing-sexual-assault-student-1.5321248 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-1.4983425 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-advocate-independent-1.4996182 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-atvs-roads-impoundment-rules-changing-1.5348585 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-souris-boardwalk-complete-1.5348484,N/A
110,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:59:09.204Z,China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,"Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, the head of a Chinese government expert team said Monday, as the total number of cases more than tripled and the virus spread to other cities in China. Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members, state media said. Human-to-human transmission — spread from close contact, some such as among family members — could make the virus spread more quickly and widely, if it spreads easily. The outbreak is believed to have started from people who picked it up at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China.  Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for identifying cases. Four have died. The official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported that as of 6 p.m. local time on Jan. 20, a total of 224 cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in China, including 217 confirmed cases: There are also seven suspected cases: two in Sichuan, one in Yunnan Province, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and one in Shandong Province. In a statement posted on its official Weibo social media account, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed, with pneumonia with one other suspected case. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added. If health-care workers were not exposed at the seafood market but from an encounter with a patient then that's a signal, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer.  It emphasizes the importance of standard infection prevention and control precautions, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. World Health Organization director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will convene an emergency committee on what it calls the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The committee will meet on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it. Declaring a global health emergency can bring more international attention and aid. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital, said Monday the key questions about the virus include: ""This may be more widespread in China than it was earlier believed,"" Bogoch said. Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Bogoch said informing travellers to Canada is important so if anyone coming from China comes down with a respiratory illness knows where to go and what to do to seek care.  Chinese authorities published the genetic sequence of the virus. At Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, scientists have developed a test for the virus, Tam said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035,N/A

Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad continues. The chief of the defence staff, Gen. Jonathan Vance, released a letter on Twitter Tuesday that says Canadian operations in both the NATO training mission and the U.S.-led coalition hunting the remnants of the Islamic State, known as Operation Impact, have been suspended. The letter was addressed to family members of those serving overseas. Vance said all necessary measures to protect forces have been taken and security for the troops is constantly being evaluated. ""The situation in Iraq is complex and it is best to pause our work there in order to fully concentrate our attention and efforts towards the safety and security of our personnel while the situation develops,"" Vance wrote. ""Simply put, we're doing this to ensure their safety and security."" A letter from General Jonathan Vance, Chief of the Defence Staff, to Canadians about our deployed personnel in the Middle East. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpIMPACT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#OpIMPACT</a> <a href=""https://t.co/Y0IdmZdo9f"">pic.twitter.com/Y0IdmZdo9f</a> The U.S., similarly, said a few days ago that it was also pausing anti-ISIS operations in order to concentrate on defending bases and American facilities.  Speaking Monday on CBC News Network's Power & Politics, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said some non-essential personnel had been moved out of Iraq. Vance's letter confirmed the move and said they will be relocated to Kuwait and also indicated that the leave plans of some personnel may be interrupted.    Canada has about 500 troops in Iraq performing the two separate missions.   The Iraqi Parliament voted last weekend on a non-binding resolution calling on the government to expel all foreign troops from the country after the killing Soleimani and several others in a U.S. drone strike last weekend. It still has to be signed by the caretaker-prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, but there are questions about whether he has the legal authority to do so. On Monday, Abdul-Mahdi called for U.S. co-operation to prevent war with Iran and to work the interim government to bring about the exit of American troops from his country. U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper told reporters in Washington that the U.S. is not seeking war, but he conceded he expects Iran to retaliate. He called on Tehran to ""de-escalate"" and warned that the Americans would defend not only their interests, but also their allies in the region.  Canada's former military representative at NATO, retired vice-admiral Bob Davidson, said the Iranians may have political reasons to avoid targeting the Canadian-led alliance training mission in Baghdad. That mission involves a number of European troops, whose countries still back a nuclear deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from last year. The agreement, which was made under former president Barack Obama, tried to limit Iran's nuclear program. But with Washington out, Tehran has been walking back its commitment. European countries are mulling whether to reimpose sanctions or opt for the agreement's dispute resolution mechanism. The Iranians may not be eager to anger those countries, such as Germany, with a direct attack on NATO forces, Davidson said. ""If you think about the efforts of France and the effort which has been applied to finding solutions, I think for the Iranians, slamming that door by attacking NATO forces is rather foolish,"" he said. ""The real challenge is whether NATO forces are in close proximity to U.S. forces. And are the actors on the ground sufficiently sophisticated enough to know the difference between the targets?"" Iran's use of proxy forces, such as Iraqi militias and Hezbollah in Lebanon, also introduce a degree of uncertainty. ""There are a lot of wild cards that could come out as well, so you cannot discount the threat,"" he said. Since returning to Ottawa over the weekend, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has worked the phones with other world leaders, including one call on Monday with Charles Michel, president of the European Council.  The two leaders ""expressed their shared support for preservation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),"" the nuclear deal with Iran.  It is a signal that Canada is sticking close with its European allies. Trudeau also spoke on Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordan's King Abdullah II. Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, says Canada has an interest in ""sustaining"" the anti-ISIS coalition. ""We saw what happened the last time when American troops left Iraq, within two years ISIS had overrun the country and that posed a threat not just to the region but to us as well,"" he said.  Paris says that Trudeau's top preoccupation when speaking with other world leaders is the security and safety of Canadians in the region, followed by maintaining the integrity of the anti-ISIS training mission itself.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-troops-vance-iraq-kuwait-1.5417627,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-qassem-soleimani-us-kerman-1.5417178 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-iraq-soleimani-isis-islamic-state-1.5416383,N/A
112,Anonymous,2019-01-08T18:38:15.918Z,"New documents link Huawei to suspected front companies in Iran, Syria","The U.S. case against the chief financial officer of China's Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Canada last month, centres on the company's suspected ties to two obscure companies. One is a telecom equipment seller that operated in Tehran; the other is that firm's owner, a holding company registered in Mauritius. U.S. authorities allege CFO Meng Wanzhou deceived international banks into clearing transactions with Iran by claiming the two companies were independent of Huawei, when in fact Huawei controlled them. Huawei has maintained the two are independent: equipment seller Skycom Tech Co. Ltd. and shell company Canicula Holdings Ltd. But corporate filings and other documents found by Reuters in Iran and Syria show that Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, is more closely linked to both firms than previously known. The documents reveal that a high-level Huawei executive appears to have been appointed Skycom's Iran manager. They also show that at least three Chinese-named individuals had signing rights for both Huawei and Skycom bank accounts in Iran. Reuters also discovered that a Middle Eastern lawyer said Huawei conducted operations in Syria through Canicula. The previously unreported ties between Huawei and the two companies could bear on the U.S. case against Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, by further undermining Huawei's claims that Skycom was merely an arms-length business partner. Huawei, U.S. authorities assert, retained control of Skycom, using it to sell telecom equipment to Iran and move money out via the international banking system. As a result of the deception, U.S. authorities say, banks unwittingly cleared hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions that potentially violated economic sanctions Washington had in place at the time against doing business with Iran. Meng did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters, and Huawei declined to answer questions for this story. Canicula's offices could not be reached. A Justice Department spokesman in Washington declined to comment. Meng was released on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail on Dec. 11 and remains in Vancouver while Washington tries to extradite her. In the United States, Meng would face charges in connection with an alleged conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge. The exact charges have not been made public. Huawei said last month it has been given little information about the U.S. allegations ""and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng."" The company has described its relationship with Skycom as ""a normal business partnership."" It has said it has fully complied with all laws and regulations and required Skycom to do the same. Meng's arrest on a U.S. warrant has caused an uproar in China. It comes at a time of growing trade and military tensions between Washington and Beijing, and amid worries by U.S. intelligence that Huawei's telecommunications equipment could contain ""backdoors"" for Chinese espionage. The firm has repeatedly denied such claims. Nevertheless, Australia and New Zealand recently banned Huawei from building their next generation of mobile phone networks, and British authorities have also expressed concerns. Articles published by Reuters in 2012 and in 2013 here about Huawei, Skycom and Meng figure prominently in the U.S. case against her. Reuters reported that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. At least 13 pages of the proposal were marked ""Huawei confidential"" and carried Huawei's logo. Huawei has said neither it nor Skycom ultimately provided the U.S. equipment. Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. Several banks questioned Huawei about the Reuters articles, according to court documents filed by Canadian authorities at the request of the U.S. for Meng's bail hearing in Vancouver last month. According to the documents, U.S. investigators allege that in responding to the banks, which weren't named, Meng and other Huawei employees ""repeatedly lied"" about the company's relationship with Skycom and failed to disclose that ""Skycom was entirely controlled by Huawei."" U.S. authorities also allege that at a private meeting with a bank executive, in or about August 2013, Meng said Huawei had sold its shares in Skycom, but didn't disclose that the buyer was ""a company also controlled by Huawei."" The court documents allege that Huawei told the executive's bank that the Chinese company had sold its shares in Skycom in 2009 — the same year Meng stepped down from Skycom's board. Skycom's buyer wasn't identified in the documents. But Skycom records filed in Hong Kong, where the company was registered, show that its shares were transferred in November 2007 to Canicula, which was registered in Mauritius in 2006. Canicula continued to hold Skycom shares for about a decade, Skycom records show. A ""Summary of Facts"" filed by U.S. authorities for Meng's Canadian bail hearing states: ""Documents and email records show that persons listed as 'Managing Directors' for Skycom were Huawei employees."" None of those individuals were named. A company record filed by Skycom in Iran that was entered in the Iranian registry in December 2011 states that a ""Shi Yaohong"" had been elected as manager of Skycom's Iran branch for two years. Huawei employs an executive named Shi Yaohong. According to his LinkedIn profile, Shi was named Huawei's ""President Middle East Region"" in June 2012. An Emirates News Agency press release identified him in November 2010 as ""President of Huawei Etisalat Key Account."" Etisalat is a major Middle Eastern telecommunications group and a Huawei partner. Shi, now president of Huawei's software business unit, hung up the phone when Reuters asked him about his relationship with Skycom. Many corporate records filed by Skycom in Iran list signatories for its bank accounts in the country. Most of the names are Chinese; at least three of the individuals had signing rights for both Skycom and Huawei bank accounts. (One of the names is listed in the Iranian registry with two slightly different spellings but has the same passport number.) U.S. authorities allege in the court documents filed in Canada that Huawei employees were signatories on Skycom bank accounts between 2007 and 2013. Records in Hong Kong show that Skycom was voluntarily liquidated in June 2017 and that Canicula was paid about $132,000 as part of the resolution. The liquidator, Chan Leung Lee of BDO Ltd. in Hong Kong, declined to comment. The Financial Services Commission in Mauritius, where Canicula remains registered, declined to release any of its records to Reuters, saying they were confidential. Until two years ago, Canicula had an office in Syria, another country that has been subject to U.S. and European Union sanctions. In May 2014, a Middle Eastern business website called Aliqtisadi.com published a brief article about the dissolution of a Huawei company in Syria that specialized in automated teller machine (ATM) equipment. Osama Karawani, an attorney who was identified as the appointed liquidator, wrote a letter asking for a correction, stating that the article had caused ""serious damage"" to Huawei. Karawani said the article suggested that Huawei itself had been dissolved, not just the ATM company. In his letter, which was linked to on the Aliqtisadi website, he said Huawei was still in business. ""Huawei was never dissolved,"" he wrote, adding that it ""has been and is still operating in Syria through several companies which are Huawei Technologies Ltd and Canicula Holdings Ltd."" Huawei Technologies is one of Huawei's main operating companies. Karawani didn't respond to emailed questions from Reuters about Canicula. U.S. investigators are aware of Canicula's connection to Syria, according to a person familiar with the probe. Canicula had an office in Damascus and operated in Syria on behalf of Huawei, another person said. That person said Canicula's customers there included three major telecommunications companies. One is MTN Syria, controlled by South Africa's MTN Group Ltd, which has mobile phone operations in both Syria and Iran. MTN has a joint venture in Iran — MTN Irancell — that is also a Huawei customer. MTN advised Huawei on setting up the structure of Skycom's office in Iran, according to another source familiar with the matter. ""Skycom was just a front"" for Huawei, the person said. An official with MTN said no one at the company was available to comment. In December 2017, a notice was placed in a Syrian newspaper by ""the General Director of the branch of the company Canicula Ltd."" He was not named. It announced that Canicula had ""totally stopped operating"" in Syria two months before. No explanation was given.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/huawei-iran-syria-meng-china-1.4970107,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-trudeau-call-meng-wanzhou-extradition-1.4969570 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/huawei-canada-us-1.4953974 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/huawei-ambitions-security-1.4948192,N/A
113,Don Pittis,2020-01-13T09:00:00.208Z,Why central banks hope you think prices are rising: Don Pittis,"Do you feel as if the things you buy every day are getting more expensive? If you live in North America or Europe, your local central bankers might be pleased to hear that. And it's not because they want you to suffer. Instead they hope that if you expect inflation when the latest numbers come out next Wednesday, that's what's going to happen. This week, Canadians get a fresh perspective on where inflation is heading through a brand new set of data coming from the Bank of Canada later today. And while most of us dislike rising prices, odds are economists at the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve will be very jealous of Canada's numbers. At the end of last week, the vice-chair of the Fed, economist Richard Clarida, warned that the U.S. central bank would have to keep struggling against what he called ""global disinflationary pressures."" While the central bankers' fear of falling prices seems to be abating, many, like Clarida, worry that a slowing rate of price growth — where prices rise, but well below the two per cent inflation target — will gradually take the world back to its nemesis, deflation. At its last interest rate announcement, the Fed said it would keep interest rates on hold in 2020 after a series of cuts. But the Fed vice-chair then hinted last week that more cuts might be needed. ""The global disinflationary pressures which I referred to are very powerful forces and policy needs to factor that in in setting policy to get inflation up to the objective,"" said Clarida. Most economists used to imagine inflation in a relatively simple, mechanical way: Based on the idea of the Phillips curve, strong employment leads to higher inflation, and cutting interest rates makes prices rise. But now there are increasing doubts about those relationships. Instead, much more weight is given to inflation expectations. In other words, if you and all your friends think prices won't rise, they won't. It is a strange and circular argument, but research partly financed by the Bank of Canada has shown it has a basis in fact. Unbeknownst to most Canadians, the central bank has been collecting data on our inflation expectations since 2014. It will publish some of that information later today in its first Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations. The data — based on consumer interviews with a rotating cast of 1,000 heads of households — probes not just what inflation will be at the next release, but consumer expectations for the months and years ahead. ""Since expected inflation influences current wage negotiations, price setting and financial contracting for investment, it is one of the main drivers of current inflation,"" reads a 2015 report explaining how the survey works. But as Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz explained last week, adjusting those expectations once they have become deeply rooted in consumer thought is not necessarily easy. ""You make a forecast of inflation one to two years from now and ask where that's going to be relative to your target,"" said Poloz, outlining how the bank tried to bend expectations, and thus the eventual rate of inflation. But, as he explained, that depends where the current rate is relative to the target, and whether the economy is strong or if it is weak, needing stimulus.  In Canada, inflation expectations likely currently sit slightly above the bank's two per cent target rate (though we will find out today), and the central bank is in a relatively happy position. Theoretically, if needed, the bank should be able to nudge those long-term expectations up or down by nudging interest rates lower or higher respectively. That is not so easy in other places, such as parts of Europe, where even low and negative interest rates have failed to push prices up in any substantial way. There are things that could trigger inflation expectations, such as a sudden economic boom in some part of the world, or, as we saw last week, the threat of war that would cause emergency spending and perhaps shortages of raw materials, if oilfields were cut off, for example. But far more worrying for central bankers in countries where both inflation expectations and interest rates are low is what they will do if a new recession that many worry may still be around the corner were to make an appearance. Whereas Canada would still have room to cut and stimulate the economy with lower interest rates, others would once again face the distorting effects of other forms of stimulation, from negative interest rates to bond buying, which have proved less successful in practise than many economic theorists had hoped.  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-canada-world-1.5419612,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/december-canada-jobs-1.5421896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-november-2019-statistics-canada-1.5400624 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-economy-stephen-poloz-1.3775838 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/majority-of-canadians-think-food-prices-rising-faster-than-household-income-1.5399533,N/A
114,Paul Withers,2020-01-17T21:31:55.119Z,"Trade pact will slow Canadian lobster sales to China, says expert","Even though a new U.S.-China trade agreement does not eliminate heavy Chinese tariffs, the deal will result in a loss of Canadian seafood sales to China, according to international trade researcher Mohammad Rahaman of Saint Mary's University in Halifax. Canadian live lobster exports to China, mostly from Nova Scotia, soared after China slapped retaliatory tariffs of 35 per cent on U.S. lobsters. U.S. lobster exports tanked while Canadian sales jumped by 123 per cent, worth a record $384 million, during the 10 months of 2019. The new trade deal does not lower those tariffs. But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products. Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States. He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism."" ""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said. ""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made. But if they really want to do it they can deliver on this promise."" Rahaman added: ""We're going to pay a price in terms of our seafood market access to the Chinese market."" Keith Colwell, Nova Scotia's minister of fisheries and aquaculture, said the province has nothing to fear. ""Basically, it won't make any difference for us."" ""We can sell everything we can catch. We sell top-quality products. We send it on time and their customers are very happy with it."" Global Affairs Canada said it continues to monitor the China-U.S. deal.

""The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry [of] Health are currently examining changes to the application process, including not allowing a change of name where an offender has been convicted of committing specific sexual offences,"" Justice Minister Don Morgan said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.  In 2018, the Ministry of Justice first mulled over the idea of having people applying for name changes undergo a criminal record check.  Sask. considering criminal record checks when applying for name change ""In the interest of public safety, offenders that prey on the most vulnerable in our society should not be able to change their name to avoid public disclosure and scrutiny.""

The man has allegedly settled in Regina — and changed his name.  David Donald Shumey, 76, changed his name to David Donald Stryker and lives in the city, as listed in the Saskatchewan Gazette and reported by the Regina Leader-Post on Tuesday.  Saskatchewan's Ministry of Justice was unaware that Stryker had re-entered Canada and had listed an address in Regina.  ""The Government of Saskatchewan is very concerned about the situation raised where an offender who has been convicted of committing sexual offences has changed their name,"" Morgan's statement read.  The man was living in the U.S. as an illegal immigrant from Canada, according to stories published by the Las Vegas Sun Newspaper in 1999.  ""David Donald Shumey was given the 20-years-to-life sentence Thursday after he tried to place the blame on the girl's parents for leaving her with him at a low-income downtown apartment complex,"" the  Las Vegas Sun article read.   He ""plea-bargained his 88-count child pornography and sexual assault case down to one count of sexual assault of a minor and two charges of using a minor in the production of pornography."" A plea bargain was struck in order to save the victim and a potential jury from a trial, the Las Vegas Sun reporter wrote.  Furthermore, he reported that the man, ""who has eight aliases, admitted he has a ""weakness"" and gave in to impulses while baby-sitting the girl. The girl was reportedly 7 and 8 years old at the time.  According to the Las Vegas Sun, the abuse wasn't discovered until a maintenance man discovered an album of child porn hidden in a vent at the downtown motel where Stryker (then Shumey) was living.  A spokesperson for the Regina Police Service said Tuesday that officers ""are looking into the possibility of this person's presence in the community.""  Sask. considering criminal record checks when applying for name change 4 ways police are fighting the 'dramatic' increase in child sexual abuse online In 2018, two Saskatchewan men who had served time for child pornography charges were thrust back into the public eye because they had changed their names.  One man, Gabriel Michael Fisher (formerly known as Kevin Daniel Hudec) was charged again with making child pornography and accessing it — after his name change.  One month later, Justin William Pasloski — formerly named Justin Gerard Gryba — was thrown back into the spotlight when it was discovered he had changed his name. He had been convicted in 2016 of making child pornography and sentenced to two years less a day.  If a person wants to change their name in Saskatchewan they have to be a resident of the province, must be 18 or older and must be entitled to be in Canada.

116,Anonymous,2020-01-09T22:39:04.364Z,Sask. man concerned as RCMP eye 'super-hub policing model' for rural region,"A concerned Saskatchewan resident says the communication surrounding the RCMP's proposition of a ""super-hub policing model"" for the southwestern part of the province is too little, too late.  Memos were sent out in small communities this week about upcoming RCMP town halls. They said consulting firm MNP had been hired to analyze the existing policing model and ""identify and recommend a specific super-hub policing model for the Swift Current region.""  It doesn't expand on what ""super-hub policing model"" means.  The notification gave communities too little time to digest the information or prepare intelligent feedback before the town halls, said Bill Clary, who lives in Leader, Sask. ""My suspicion is that this whole notion of getting feedback from the community and input — as you find it in the last paragraph of that letter — is all just a checking of boxes,"" he said.  ""How can I formulate a good argument if I don't have the data in front of me to research and say. 'Hold it, I think there's a hole here'?"" RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Rob King insisted that no decisions have been made. He said police are still in the process of figuring out ""how better to serve the area. "" The tender for the consulting firm, which closed in May last year, said, ""The RCMP requires a consultant to provide a report on the concept of implementing a Super-Hub Policing model."" Clary saw the public community notice on Monday.  ""The presentation of this whole thing and all the work that's already gone into it indicates that this has been in the works for some time and yet we've been kept in the dark,"" he said.  The public memo said that ""society and workforce demands have changed and this presents challenges in recruiting top talent for the important job of keeping our communities safe by ensuring staff have access to amenities for their family and employment opportunities for their spouses."" Clary said that for 54 years he's felt as if the relationship between the RCMP and community members is a respectful partnership. He's not sure about that anymore.   He said he's seen this before, with local school boards amalgamated and the loss of local health authorities.  Now, he's wondering if police will also be centralized away from the community.   The public memo said the ""new deployment model"" would provide ""better police service through flexible and scalable staffing plans."" It also said that the RCMP would ""not close any existing detachments in the Cypress Region.""  Without information, Clary said he's heading into the town hall under the assumption that a super-hub model means an unknown group down the road will be called in to fix a problem.  ""As opposed to community policing, where the policeman that is on the streets arresting my kid for speeding is the same dude I have coffee with,"" he said. Clary said someone who knows what's going on in the community might better understand the people they are interacting with — including potential past traumas that could lead to adverse behaviour.  ""It's that proportional response that is allowed when there's that human element.""  Clary believes the RCMP should take its time. He suggested it create a committee of community members who can have access to the MNP existing studies and research. He believes that would allow residents to ""intelligently respond to these proposals.""  King said the RCMP hopes people like Clary who have concerns attend the town halls and share their opinions. He said the process will take about six months, with a report prepared for review in late spring.  ""If there are changes to be made, that part will be communicated with all the partners and stakeholders and the general public."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/rcmp-super-hub-rural-sask-1.5420887,[],N/A
117,Éric Grenier,2020-01-02T09:00:00.619Z,What the 2017 Conservative leadership race told us about what it takes to win,"At some point in the coming year, the Conservatives will choose a replacement for Andrew Scheer. Whenever it comes to a close, that race probably will look very different from the one that ended with Scheer's 13th ballot win over Maxime Bernier in 2017. But that doesn't mean there aren't lessons to be learned from that contest. A few factors will make the 2020 Conservative leadership race a very different beast. For starters, it's likely to be much shorter than the last one. The first contenders in the 2017 contest threw their hats into the ring more than a year before the vote was held. With Justin Trudeau's Liberals leading a minority government, the Conservatives don't have the luxury of a longer campaign this time. Another factor: the Liberals will be asking for a third consecutive term in the next election. Though the Liberal Party has never lost a third election when it has won a first and second, the prospects for the next leader of the Conservative Party look much better today than they did four years ago. It's hard to defeat a first-term majority government. It should be much easier to defeat a two-term government headed up by a relatively unpopular leader. That suggests the calibre of candidates for the Conservative leadership in 2020 is likely to be much better than it was in 2017 — because the person who wins will have a very good shot at becoming the next prime minister, rather than the next sacrificial lamb. But the rules determining how the party chooses its leaders and the make-up of the party's membership were both decisive factors in the 2017 leadership contest. Those things won't be changing, even with a whole new group of candidates. If you're looking for a predictive metric for this leadership race, don't look to polls. Unless they're sampling from a list of actual party members, polls can be (and often are) widely misleading in leadership races. The views of all Conservative voters don't necessarily align with those of party members. The views of all Canadians are even less representative, and name recognition in the early going is an extremely significant factor. In the absence of reliable polls of party members, the amount of money raised by each candidate and the number of endorsements they receive from fellow caucus members can be very instructive. Bernier was the top fundraiser in the 2017 contest, but Scheer, Kellie Leitch, Erin O'Toole and Michael Chong also raised a lot of money (so did Kevin O'Leary, who dropped out before it was all over). Bernier, Scheer and O'Toole had lots of endorsements in addition to good fundraising — and they were the top three finishers on the first ballot. Chong and Leitch did not have lots of endorsements and finished further back. Money and local backers are important in this kind of race. They can even be decisive — because the party's rules force contestants to run national campaigns. Those rules give each riding equal weight, which has a big impact in a party with a base that is disproportionately concentrated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Together, these two provinces have 48 seats in the House of Commons, handed nearly 1.8 million votes to the Conservatives in October's election and represented about a quarter of all voting members in 2017's leadership race. But Quebec — where the Conservatives received less than 700,000 votes — has 78 seats. That makes the province much more important in deciding the contest's winner than Alberta and Saskatchewan. It also puts a premium on the votes of individual members in Quebec; though their votes were worth less, there were nearly four times as many voting members from Alberta or Saskatchewan in 2017 than there were in Quebec. There weren't any major regional candidates in 2017, leading to a patchwork of support for both Scheer and Bernier. While Scheer is from Western Canada, Bernier did quite well in Alberta and the urban centres in the region. And though Bernier was from Quebec, Scheer won a big chunk of that province (in part with the assistance of the dairy lobby, which was against Bernier's plan to dismantle supply management). That might not be the case in this contest, however, particularly if there are notable regional figures who throw their hats into the ring — people like Peter MacKay in Atlantic Canada, Gérard Deltell in Quebec or Michelle Rempel Garner in Alberta. If that happens, the candidate who can hold a regional base while also attracting enough support from another big region of the country will have an advantage over a rival with more concentrated support — even if that support is where most party members happen to live. A recurring topic of debate at Conservative party conventions has been whether to switch to a one-member-one-vote system or stay with the rules that give each riding equal weight, regardless of how many members are in it. The old Reform/Alliance wing has pushed for the former, while the Progressive Conservative wing has pushed for the latter. MacKay himself, who led the PCs into a merger with the Alliance in 2003, has argued in favour of keeping the system the way it is. It's one of the few remaining examples of the old Reform/PC fault line running through the modern party. It's not clear how deep those fault lines really go, however. A few contestants represented the 'Red Tory' wing in 2017 — people like Chong, O'Toole and Lisa Raitt. But who represented the old Reform wing? It's difficult to find an obvious standard-bearer. Scheer perhaps came the closest: his pitch to members was a continuation of the themes of the Stephen Harper years. The old fault line never materialized in the voting, however. When Raitt dropped off the ballot, her supporters split almost evenly between Bernier, O'Toole, Chong and Scheer. Chong's supporters went largely to O'Toole, suggesting significant overlap between the backers of these two moderates. But when O'Toole dropped off after the penultimate round, his votes went disproportionately to Scheer over Bernier. Scheer was able to win because he sat at the nexus of two party factions, as well as his own base of Harper Conservatives. Those factions were the moderates and the social conservatives (those who backed Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux, whose supporters overwhelmingly went to Scheer). He was broadly acceptable to those who didn't want the radical departure from the Harper years that Bernier represented. It all means the different factions of the party are malleable. Being at the centre of the party membership's political spectrum is not necessarily the key to winning; the ranked ballot requires that a candidate have a strong enough base to make it to the later rounds — and the 'centre' might not be the largest faction. If a candidate survives the round-by-round cull, however, they just need to be closer to the centre of the party than whoever else is still standing on the last ballot. On the face of it, winning this contest means following a relatively simple formula: have a regional base and the resources to expand beyond it to ensure a strong first ballot result, then grow from that result by being the candidate acceptable to the largest number of party members.

118,Anonymous,2019-12-28T09:00:00.472Z,7 cold virus and flu myths and questions debunked,"Early sunsets and chilly temperatures signal a shift from the itchy, watery eyes and sneezing associated with pollen allergies to the runny noses and coughs of winter cold and flu season.  But just how long should these respiratory bugs last? And how long are you contagious? Here are some answers. Probably not. ""What I see doing pediatric clinics is that once a child gets a cold-like illness, like a runny nose and cough, is that people presume that it will all be gone within a couple of days,"" said Dr. Jonathan Gubbay, a medical microbiologist and pediatric infectious disease physician in Toronto. That's not exactly right. ""For most of us, it's a seven-day thing and it's gone,"" said David Proud, a professor of physiology and pharmacology at the University of Calgary. ""We whine and complain, but [the cold infection] is really self-limiting."" Proud studies people infected with cold viruses as part of his research into how colds can trigger attacks of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He said that in a ""tiny"" percentage of people, colds can have side-effects such as otitis media, or middle ear infections, which can be worse in those with a tendency to sinusitis. Gubbay said people are infectious for the first few days after symptoms start, particularly the period with a fever. Health guidelines generally recommend keeping kids home from school until the fever is gone for 24 hours. ""The old joke that we have is, you can take all the best available current medications to treat it and it'll go away in a week. Or you can do nothing and it will go away in seven days,"" Proud said.  The reason, Proud said, is there's not much clinical trial evidence, which is the gold standard, to tell if over-the-counter cold medications help. Even so, fever can be uncomfortable for children and adults and fever reducers can help, said Dr. Michelle Murti, a public health physician and Gubbay's colleague at Public Health Ontario. ""Warm, hot liquid can help make the mucus less sticky and help it drain a little bit better,"" Murti said. ""That's why having that steam or a nice hot water or hot tea can be a soothing thing."" Murti added that honey can also help with coughs. One important caution: Children under the age of one shouldn't have honey because of the risk of botulism. Murti said adults don't tend to get a fever with a cold. Now that flu season has begun in every province and territory, if an adult has a fever and cough that comes on suddenly, consider influenza. At the end of December and early January, Murti said Canadians will probably see more flu, with a sudden onset of cough, fatigue, muscle aches and ""feeling like you got run over by a truck."" Health officials recommend flu vaccines. ""That's really the best prevention measure that we have,"" she said. Gubbay said lab testing for influenza isn't recommended for patients outside of the hospital, because it takes days to get the results, which is too late to decide on giving patients antiviral medications. OK, you're no longer going through boxes of tissues. But then the cough sets in … and keeps going.  ""We have a physician here who has a chronic cough clinic precisely because … people don't really understand, if you've never experienced it, how miserable it can make life,"" said Proud, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in inflammatory airway diseases. ""It's actually quite irritating for people, to say the least, not to mention disruptive."" No one knows why such coughs occur. ""We think it may have something to do with [people's] nerves and their sensitivity to various kinds of irritants, but that's really not much more than an educated guess,"" Proud said. Gubbay suggested saltwater sprays or drops can help dry up the nose to prevent such coughs. The good news is that after a couple of weeks of a prolonged cough, people generally aren't infectious, because they're not bringing up the same level of virus as earlier, Murti said. Murti said concerning symptoms of a cough include: A prolonged, more severe, wheezing cough could be from whooping cough, also called pertussis, a bacterial infection. Gubbay said respiratory illness in an infant, particularly in the first few months, is worth having checked out by a health-care practitioner. Ditto for a fever in an older child that's lasted more than 48 hours, or if there are symptoms beyond a runny nose and cough. These include looking lethargic with low energy levels, breathing quickly or requiring a lot of effort to breathe. Murti said cold viruses can last on your skin, including your hands, for a couple of hours after a cough or sneeze. That's why it is important to wash your hands with soap and water often in the first five to seven days of a cold, and to use hand sanitizer.  Public health experts also recommend sneezing into the elbow of your sleeve instead of your hands.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cold-flu-myths-1.5400752,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/washing-hands-song-1.5398385 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-nov-22-2019-1.5369784/some-homemade-soups-may-actually-help-fight-malaria-study-suggests-1.5370383 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/health-hacks-mary-jane-hampton-flu-shot-health-provider-patient-1.5338253,N/A
119,Carmen Merrifield,2020-01-07T13:08:57.461Z,What's changed to protect women since Harvey Weinstein's accusers went public?: 'Everything … and nothing',"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. In October 2017, the New York Times published accounts by several women accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, sparking a worldwide response and fuelling the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment in the workplace. So what has changed since then? ""The confounding thing about the last two years is that everything has changed and nothing has changed,"" says New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor, in a recent interview with The National co-host Adrienne Arsenault. ""I think there's a lot of compassion for what women and others have faced over the years in the workplace and beyond. On the other hand, when we look at the fundamental system, when we look at laws and rules, when we look at a woman who is serving burgers for 10 bucks an hour in a restaurant, it's very hard to say that much has changed in the last two years."" Weinstein is to stand trial on charges of rape, sexual assault and predatory assault, with jury selection scheduled to start today. He denies any allegations of non-consensual sex. While there has been a shift in social attitudes as well as a renewed appreciation of what sexual harassment is and why it has to be prevented, the two New York Times journalists who first broke the story say the judicial system does not reflect that shift. In their recent book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, Kantor and fellow journalist Megan Twohey point to one particular area where they say change is needed most: Weinstein's ""secret settlements"" with women. These non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were at the core of their news coverage, they say, and were arguably the enablers in the Harvey Weinstein saga. ""In the case of alleged predators like Harvey Weinstein, he would do one of these secret settlements and then go on to allegedly harm many other women,"" says Twohey. ""So I think now we're finally starting to have a public debate and conversation about who really benefits, and whether or not these secret settlements have in fact allowed enablers to continue to prey."" In the course of their reporting, Kantor and Twohey say they were able to identify at least eight secret settlements that Harvey Weinstein paid to women who had come forward accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, during a period spanning 1990 through 2015. In effect, they say, paying women in exchange for silence.  ""So when we came knocking on the doors of these women who had been victims of alleged sexual assaults and sexual harassment, they were legally prohibited from talking to us,"" says Twohey. ""Slowly but surely we were able to identify, to unearth those settlements, and start to document them in ways that helped illuminate this tool that he had to use to cover his tracks."" In some American states, such as New Jersey and California, there are limits on the use of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment and assault. But in Canada there is no legislation or clarity in this area, and no guidance from law societies about when NDAs should be used. Roxanne Davis, an employment lawyer based in Calgary, has represented victims and acted as an impartial investigator in cases involving sexual harassment allegations. Given the lack of legislation in Canada, she says, some courts have had to go their own way interpreting NDAs in sexual harassment cases, so that complainants can speak out after accepting settlements. ""In this current environment, it would be useful to have a broader discussion in Canada about whether, from a policy perspective, it is appropriate to enforce NDAs in sexual harassment cases, so courts have some guidance in that area,"" Davis says. Meanwhile, the U.K. has seen some change around NDAs. Last year, the Solicitors Regulation Authority published a warning to lawyers handling these types of agreements. It now says NDAs cannot be used to discourage victims from reporting sexual misconduct to authorities. More changes may come to the U.K., in part because of a lobbying effort by a woman who ultimately refused to be silenced by Harvey Weinstein: his former assistant Zelda Perkins. She spoke with CBC's The National about her experience working with the now disgraced mogul, and gave a harrowing account of how she agreed to one of his secret settlements.  CBC News asked representatives for Harvey Weinstein for his response to these allegations. They replied via email that, ""Neither Mr. Weinstein, nor his representatives will be making any comments on these matters. I hope you can remain objective."" Through the 1990s, Perkins worked as Weinstein's assistant at his Miramax office in London.  Perkins is now opening up about those days and what she says was daily harassment working for Weinstein. Perkins described one occasion when she says Weinstein asked her to take notes as he spoke in his hotel bathroom. ""I agreed that I would sit in the bathroom whilst he was in the sauna, so I couldn't see him, and take notes. And he went in there, and within a couple of minutes he said this isn't working and came out naked, and said 'I'm going to have a bath.'"" Perkins says she tried to leave the room, but he insisted she stay to continue their work. ""He said 'I'm just going to be in the bath, don't be so prissy.' And it sounds ridiculous, particularly now that we are talking about it. But at the time that felt like a pretty safe compromise."" However, by 1998 Perkins says she had reached her breaking point. At that time, Perkins was working with a young assistant, Rowena Chiu. While at the Venice Film Festival, both worked with Weinstein; Perkins took the day shift and Chiu was assigned the later shift. Perkins says she advised the younger Chiu how best to deal with Weinstein's inappropriate behaviour. On the second night in Venice, Chiu told CBC's The National in a recent interview, their work began as it had the previous evening, discussing scripts. However, she says Weinstein also engaged in flattery about her degree in English literature from Oxford, along with asking personal questions. ""He asked me about my boyfriend. He asked me how long we'd been together, and whether he was my first boyfriend, and so on,"" Chiu says. She says Weinstein removed his clothing. ""He asked if I could give him a massage. We had been working mostly on the bed in the sense I was half sitting on the bed and the scripts were spread out on the bed. He had taken his clothes off so he was naked, and so he requested a massage from me, which I was reluctant to give him."" Chiu alleges Weinstein asked her to take off some layers of her own clothing, saying it was warm in the hotel room and she would feel more comfortable. ""And so in that way it's almost an insidious, gradual path towards, you know, asking for more and more overt sexual favours. And so from there it led to him pinning me against the bed and and asking for just one thrust, and saying just one thrust and will all be over. It was pretty terrifying."" Chiu says she managed to pull herself away from Weinstein and out of the room. ""She told me the next day that he'd attempted to rape her,"" Perkins says. ""So I went and confronted Harvey."" The women returned to London and sought legal help, and were told by their lawyers that their only option was an agreement. Perkins says what followed were long, ""intimidating"" sessions in the offices of Weinstein's lawyers Allen & Overy, the leading law firm in London. Perkins recounts how she and her young assistant had to attend two 12-hour negotiating sessions with their lawyers and Weinstein's, one ending at 5 a.m.  ""We weren't allowed pen and paper. We were escorted to the loo,"" Perkins says. As for the agreement itself, she says it contained highly restrictive clauses, including ones that applied to any mental health counselling the two young women might seek in the future. ""We could talk to a therapist as long as the therapist signed their own confidentiality agreement. And if they broke the confidentiality agreement, we were the ones who Miramax would come after for breach of contract."" Perkins says that at her insistence, the NDA included conditions about Weinstein's future conduct, including that he receive therapy, but it's not clear whether they were met. Perkins says a sum of £250,000 in financial compensation was also part of the agreement, to be divided between the two women. She contends it was the ""morality"" of the agreement and the legal process that she found the most horrifying part of her ordeal. ""We had six or seven very reputable lawyers in that room. Every single person in that room did not say that there was anything wrong with our signing that agreement. That agreement was unethical and egregious on every level … to me that is far more disturbing than Harvey's behaviour. ""Harvey is just a weak man. There are thousands of weak men and women who abuse their positions of power and that will always be the case … Now, if you're sitting in a room and you have these erudite lawyers and you have two 23- and 24-year-old girls, and they're telling you that this is how the law works, then for me the world was over, the world was over."" On the day the non-disclosure agreement was signed, Perkins and Chiu left the law offices and shared a taxi home. Chiu describes how they made a pact not to speak to one another. ""I think it was a clear sense that we wouldn't remain in each other's lives, because we talked about how difficult it was not to refer to this period of our lives,"" Chiu says. ""And I think it would have just been odd to continue. What were we to do, meet socially and make chit-chat and pretend that this had never happened? It had been such a difficult and defining and traumatic event."" Almost 20 years later, the New York Times contacted Zelda Perkins and Rowena Chiu. Both decided it was time to end their silence and break their non-disclosure agreement with Weinstein.   Journalist Megan Twohey says she believes Perkins and Chiu took a great risk in speaking out. ""It is a serious risk to break a settlement. These settlements are structured in a way so that if somebody does in fact break them, if somebody does speak out and tell the truth about what's happened, Weinstein is in a position to come after her not just for the money that was paid out at the time, but often for financial damages on top of that,"" says Twohey. Perkins has since found her voice, giving testimony in the U.K. last year to a parliamentary inquiry into workplace sexual harassment. Perkins spoke to MPs about what she sees as the misuse of NDAs to cover up sexual misconduct and crimes in the work environment. Still, the effect of the agreement on Perkins — who was forbidden to speak to anyone, including family and friends — was intense. She says it seemed safer to remove herself entirely from a life in London. ""I left the country, I moved to Central America, lived in Guatemala for five years. So I was away from family and friends. I couldn't really work in the industry anymore. I was afraid, because I couldn't explain to anybody what had happened."" Chiu says it was the enforced silence that weighed heaviest on her life. ""It was not something I was ever able to get away from. I found it an impossible burden to bear, really. And it came to a point where I tried to kill myself a couple of times. And I really felt I was never going to get away from the secret."" New York Times journalist Kantor concedes these secret settlements can offer an alleged victim momentary peace, some financial compensation to move on with their life, and an opportunity to keep their privacy. But there's also a danger. ""The problem is only visible when you look at these collectively, when you say is this really our best tool, what has this masked over the years, what has it enabled over the years,"" says Kantor. ""I think part of what we're beginning to see is that there's a distinction between privacy and secrecy,"" she adds. ""A lot of victims we've talked to, they do want to keep their privacy. But they don't necessarily want secrecy, in the sense that they want how much to tell, what to tell, to be under their control. They don't necessarily want to sign a document that says 'I'm giving up the right to talk about my own personal experiences.'""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5416145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-post-invu-1.5397491 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/non-disclosure-agreements-sexual-harassment-weinstein-1.4462694,N/A

In a report on global immunization coverage, the U.N. agencies found that vaccination levels are stagnating, notably in poor countries or areas of conflict. ""Vaccines are one of our most important tools for preventing outbreaks and keeping the world safe,"" the WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a statement. ""It's often those who are most at risk — the poorest, the most marginalized, those touched by conflict or forced from their homes — who are persistently missed,"" he said. ""Far too many are left behind."" The WHO/UNICEF report found that since 2010, vaccination coverage with three doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine and one dose of measles vaccine has stalled at around 86 per cent. The report said this was too low, since 95 per cent coverage is generally needed to provide ""herd immunity"" to those who are not vaccinated. In 2018 for example, the number of measles cases around the world more than doubled, to almost 350,000. ""Measles is a real-time indicator of where we have more work to do to fight preventable diseases,"" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF's executive director. ""An outbreak points to communities that are missing out on vaccines ... [and] we have to exhaust every effort to immunize every child."" Almost half the world's unvaccinated children are in just 16 countries: Afghanistan, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Iraq, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.

Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recorders for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, Champagne reached out to his counterpart today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes] be sent where [they] should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes contain the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and have information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attack that struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respected on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran. ""In the interests of privacy, I won't go into too much detail ... but I can tell you that the wishes of the family are paramount and we will ensure this is the case in all cases,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to meet with some family members of the crash victims on Monday evening in Winnipeg. On Friday, Trudeau announced that the government would provide $25,000 per victim to assist families in the aftermath of the disaster, while insisting Iran must provide compensation.

Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny Breen said businesses were to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow was piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday, even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to this basement apartment in the Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's a doorway that was previously blocked due to snow and high winds that hit 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carve pathways around homes in the city.  The door of this shed blew open in the Kibride neighbourhood of St. John's.  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking a single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed — with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300 Canadian Armed Forces members are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, some snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on Friday — an aptly named one too. Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],N/A
123,Yvette Brend,2019-11-28T19:22:29.444Z,MEC loses $11M  as new CEO braces against storm of competition,"Mountain Equipment Co-op, Canada's largest outdoor gear retailer, is losing money, says its new CEO Philippe Arrata — a lot of it. The outdoor recreation gear and clothing retailer lost $11.487 million last year on sales of $462 million, according to financial statements audited by KPMG and posted on MEC's website. Arrata, the former CFO of Best Buy, says the co-op is at a turning point, facing slow sales, inventory backups, supply chain problems and ever-increasing online competition. ""The sales growth hasn't materialized, as we've seen increased competition by traditional big-box players and emerging e-commerce players,"" Arrata said in a statement Tuesday about the recreation equipment giant's financial challenges. Since its founding in Vancouver in 1971, MEC has expanded to 20 cities across Canada with 2,700 employees, and today bills itself as Canada's largest supplier of outdoor clothing and recreation gear with a reputation for a commitment to environmental protection. But some longtime MEC members say the 22-store co-op has lost money by spending too much on stores in Toronto and Vancouver and racking up more debt while inventory piled up and sales slowed because of stiff competition from online retailers like Amazon. Steve Jones said he is glad to see MEC's leader acknowledging the seriousness of the situation. The software executive ran unsuccessfully for MEC's board in 2018. He's long been critical of ""aggressive expansion"" and is calling for transparency around financial details such as the CEO's salary. Jones said some members think MEC has strayed in recent years from its founding retail goals, which focused on selling gear for outdoor pursuits such as climbing, cross-country skiing, canoeing and kayaking. ""I don't think that the membership ever really formally gave the board or the leadership the mandate to pursue that type of growth,"" said Jones. ""When you think about backcountry tents or snowshoes, we are in a very strong position. I worry that [we are] trying to compete in other categories such as jean jackets and running shoes,"" he said. Jones and other longtime MEC members questioned the co-op removing the word ""co-op"" from the chain's logo in 2013 and then, this spring, replacing the 1% for the Planet program — which donated to environmental causes — with an internal program called MEC All Out. Meanwhile, the co-op's balance sheets show no cash assets or any dividends paid to members last year. Arrata said sales grew 1.7 per cent, but costs grew faster — up 4.4 per cent. ""Every day and every waking moment I'm thinking about how can we improve — actually, even during sleeping moments,"" said Arrata in an interview Tuesday. Arrata took over in July and launched an internal rallying cry warning of the financial crunch. He says his new team will turn around an ""unsustainable trajectory.""  Compounding his challenge is the unionization this year of two MEC outlets in B.C., creating the potential for higher labour costs. University of British Columbia accounting professor Kin Lo, who studied MEC's financials, confirmed the co-op's finances do show strain. But he sees Arrata's experience as a past Best Buy exec as a plus. ""I think Arrata has a good shot,"" said Lo, who also believes MEC's physical stores — where buyers can touch and try products — are a key asset. With Amazon, you have to go by what is shown on screen ""and just roll the dice sometimes,"" he said. Arrata acknowledged the financial headwinds in staff memos over the past few months. He says he also sought advice from another co-op that faced similar struggles in the past. Recreational equipment retailer REI Co-op turned around its troubles and in 2018 listed $570 million in cash assets and $129 million in member dividends. Arrata said MEC will offer up its price matching, product guarantees and passionate staff to cement its bond as ""part of Canadian DNA."" The Montreal-born retailer recalled how his own Egyptian immigrant father loved to take the family on outdoor adventures. He said he recently noticed a Syrian mother talking to staff at the MEC in Kitchener, Ont. She had bought a tent and told them about her family's first backyard tenting experience in the rain. It struck Arrata how MEC makes emotional connections with people who come to buy gear in the stores. That is something online retailers can't do, and he says he hopes experiences like this will help MEC weather this financial storm. ""Retail is always tough. Ten years ago there were different retailers that kept us up at night, and 10 years later there are a different set of retailers that keep us up at night, because the sands always shift in retail."" The retail co-op is governed by a board of directors that is elected by members. Lifetime membership in MEC is $5.

When outbreaks occur, they tell us that some groups of people do not have adequate immunity,"" the Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement.   If vaccine coverage drops below 95 per cent in a community, the risk of infection rises, the agency said, noting the current national level of coverage is 89 per cent.    Measles killed more than 110,000 people around the world in 2017 — most of them children under five, according to the World Health Organization. This year, the organization has identified the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate against preventable diseases — known as ""vaccine hesitancy"" — as one of the top 10 threats to global health.  Yet, despite the fact they're on the wrong side of the scientific evidence, Kurasawa said, anti-vaccination advocates — also known as ""anti-vaxxers"" — have gained the upper hand in a raging social media battle.  That's because public health authorities have been ""relatively slow"" to respond to anti-vaccination propaganda in ways that are appealing to social media audiences, he said. Instead, they have relied on the assumption that ""putting out the truth and factual information"" is enough. But social media ""relies on short, relatively catchy or attention-grabbing memes, messages, videos ... an informal tone,"" Kurasawa said.   Anti-vaccination groups have mastered that style — attracting people to false content ranging from claims that vaccines cause autism (an idea that was scientifically debunked long ago) to insisting that being infected by measles as a child can protect against heart disease and cancer later in life.   Some anti-vaccination groups also solicit donations online from their supporters to continue making — and sometimes advertising — such content.  ""They've been very savvy. They've been very well funded,"" said Richard Carpiano, a professor of public policy and sociology at the University of California, Riverside.    It's a stark contrast to the approach public health authorities have taken in disseminating information, he said.   ""They've been kind of really heavily pushing on a very old type of model of medical authority,"" Carpiano said. ""You know, 'trust us ... I'm a doctor and I tell you that vaccines are good. And here's our website.'""   ""But the reality is … parents spend more time online than they're going to be spending in their clinician's office,"" he said. ""So the online world is really quite critical for where parents, particularly new parents ... are most susceptible to this kind of [anti-vaccination] misinformation.""  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, acknowledges that ""just the public health messaging of facts is not enough."" Health authorities need to do a better job at connecting with people on social media platforms about vaccination, she said.   ""We are in a really critical moment right now,"" she said. ""We recognize we do need to do more."" Tam said she's ""really happy"" to see that big social media companies — including Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest — are taking some responsibility for stopping the spread of anti-vaccination misinformation on their platforms.   Pinterest — a site on which users (called ""pinners"") save visual content they like from other blogs or websites to their personal page — has had a ""health misinformation"" policy since 2017, spokesperson Jamie Favazza told CBC News by email.  ""We don't allow advice when it has immediate and detrimental effects on a Pinner's health or on public safety. This includes promotion of false cures for terminal or chronic illnesses and anti-vaccination advice,"" the policy said.   The company actively started blocking ""certain searches"" — such as ""anti-vaccine"" or ""anti-vaxx"" — last year, Favazza said, ""because results were leading to harmful misinformation."" Pinterest has also gone a step further, she said, to ""identify and block websites of people or groups that explicitly affiliate themselves with health misinformation. This immediately removes their content from our platform and prevents people from saving new Pins from their websites to Pinterest.""   Other social media sites have not gone that far.   ""Videos that promote anti-vaccination content have been and remain a violation of our longstanding harmful or dangerous advertising policy,"" said a spokesperson for YouTube (which is owned by Google) in an email to CBC News.   But the company has not given any indication it will actually remove the content. Instead, the policy dictates that anti-vaccination videos can't make money by hosting ads.   YouTube is also ""surfacing more authoritative sources and reducing recommendations for anti-vaccination videos. We also show information panels where users can fact check information for themselves,"" the company said.   Facebook also said it has ""taken steps to reduce the distribution of health-related misinformation."" ""We know we have more to do. We're currently working on additional changes that we'll be announcing soon,"" a spokesperson for Facebook told CBC News in an emailed statement.   Some of the measures under consideration, Facebook said, include reducing or removing anti-vaccination content from Facebook's ""recommended"" feature, as well as ensuring that content doesn't appear as high up in search results and people's personal feeds.    In a Feb. 18 open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's CEO, a spokesperson for Vaccine Choice Canada — a not-for-profit group that promotes anti-vaccination information but says its goal is simply to express ""legitimate"" concerns about vaccine safety — appealed to the social media company to resist ""pressure to restrict the right to freedom of speech.""     ""These efforts at censorship are a desperate attempt by a desperate industry to control the behavior of free-thinking citizens,"" wrote Ted Kuntz, identifying himself as a ""parent of a vaccine injured child now deceased."" Kuntz told CBC in an email that Zuckerberg has not responded to his letter.    Both Kurasawa and Carpiano dispute the argument that removing anti-vaccination content from social media sites is a violation of freedom of speech.  ""You can certainly opine or, you know, voice your opinion — that's freedom of expression,"" Kurasawa said. ""The fabrication of evidence and claiming that it is accurate — then that's when there's a problem.""  The public consequences of scaring people into not vaccinating their children — and potentially contributing to the spread of a dangerous disease — also need to be considered, Carpiano said.   ""Really, when it comes to vaccinations it's not simply an individual choice,"" he said. ""It has consequences for other people ... It's not just simply whether you decided to put a seatbelt on or not.""  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says the best way to deal with vaccine hesitancy is to address parents' fears.

As winds and snow started to die down, people from Gambo to Trepassey are wincing as they open their doors to snow drifts that at times completely eclipse the outside world. Shag it. I’m just going to use the front door until spring. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlblizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlblizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlstorm?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlstorm</a> <a href=""https://t.co/7otioIfKot"">pic.twitter.com/7otioIfKot</a> Anyone have some tips for digging out?<br><br>1.

Give up<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> The City of St. John's has plows on the roads, but only to keep emergency routes clear as a state of emergency remains in effect. Dan Bobbett, mayor of Paradise, tweeted a warning to residents early Saturday morning: clearing over 75 centimetres of snow off town property will take time. Advice from all sides? Hole up, hunker down and wait, since there's nowhere to go anyway. Some Avalon residents have found uses for the nine- to 10-foot drifts blocking their doors, leaving them wondering how to tunnel out — and then, of course, how to stomp and flail their way through the drifts to get enough leverage to move the snow around. Others have given up entirely. On Saturday, CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup opened the national phone lines to hear how Canadians across the country are coping with winter weather. Still snowed in, many callers from Newfoundland shared their stories. Sonja Mills of Port Rexton told host Duncan McCue that she and her wife, Alicia, are passing the time with marathon games of cribbage.  ""[We are] really just kind of hanging in there, hoping the power doesn't go out [and] getting prepared for it,"" Mills said. But the couple had a more pressing concern on their minds. As owners of Port Rexton Brewing Company, they strapped on skis Saturday afternoon and braved the weather to check on their beer. ""With the power on ... things are still happening in the brewing tanks, so we're going to go keep an eye on things,"" she told McCue. For Bob Cole, the legendary broadcaster who retired last year after a half-century of work for Hockey Night in Canada, it was a chance to give some old friends an update on what's happening in his home province. ""It took a state of emergency, by the way, to get me on Hockey Night again,"" Cole told Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean on Saturday night before the beginning of the Toronto Maple Leafs-Chicago Blackhawks game. Watch as Bob Cole discusses the blizzard on Hockey Night in Canada: Others took advantage of the snowdrifts for a little thrill seeking. When he looked at the snow-covered streets of St. John's, free of moving vehicles, Matt Wells saw an opportunity. ""I walked out the front door, strapped on the snowboard and then I proceeded on down Prescott, over Duckworth and on down to Water Street,"" Wells told McCue. ""It was surprising, actually, because there was so much snow, it was actually difficult to get any speed up. It was difficult to go faster or pick up any speed because the snow was so deep,"" he said of his ride. Video of Wells' slide through the streets was shared widely on Facebook on Saturday. Wells is originally from the west coast of New Zealand and attended university in Halifax, but only moved to St. John's a few months ago.  ""It was probably ill-advised for me to go do it myself. But definitely worth it in the end,"" he says of his ride. There were those who wouldn't let the blizzard get in the way of a fun Saturday night. Stumbled across an impromptu Georgetown block party with bonfire in the middle of what should be a street. Beer and comraderie freely shared with all <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLStorm2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NLStorm2020</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QxUlea6rti"">pic.twitter.com/QxUlea6rti</a> And still more have found creative ways to spend this stretch of forced confinement. Some, like Adam Meyer, turned to the ephemeral. Meyer called in CBC's radio special to read something he'd written while watching the blizzard rage: I moved to St. John's just in time for the greatest winter storm in a generation. Now I stand half-buried in a cold Sahara watching streetlights flicker meekly like  tea candles on the verge of being snuffed by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The house rocks and surges like a wooden ship so that when I close my eyes I see icy cliffs, too close, disappear under the frigid surf thrown around by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  When the power finally fails the world goes not black, but purple, and from the otherworldly shade  it's obvious St. John's is a sibling of Pluto; an icy frontier at the edge of system space, in orbit but  made distinct by the distance and cold as a dwarf-planet by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The air around the city feels sick as if decades of jet fuel and international trade routes  have concocted a nasty bug to be slowly purged with each retching gust that spews  a break-locking, street-clogging mess culminating in the greatest winter storm in a generation.  I moved to St. John's in time to witness its cold burial but  tomorrow I will wake and find life in the morning after the greatest storm in a generation.  What a load of snow!!

126,Brittany Wentzell,2020-01-20T10:00:00.873Z,What Pictou County can learn from the Bowater paper mill closure,"The former mayor of a Nova Scotia municipality that lost its major employer in 2012 has some words of wisdom for Pictou County, N.S., which is facing the closure of Northern Pulp by the end of the month. Christopher Clarke was elected mayor of the Region of Queens Municipality just months after the former Bowater paper mill in Brooklyn closed in June 2012. He said the closure was felt immediately. ""People who had mortgages, in some instances, walked away from their mortgage and left whatever equity they had, they just walked away from the community,"" Clarke said. ""Property values plummeted and have taken quite some time to recover."" Northern Pulp's effluent treatment site at Boat Harbour is legislated to close at the end of the month. Without a place for its effluent the mill can't operate. The company recently said it plans to continue with the environmental assessment process for a proposed new effluent treatment facility. Trent Hupman was at Bowater the day its closure was announced. While he previously worked at the mill, he had a large contract doing maintenance work at both Bowater and the nearby Oakhill Sawmill in Lunenburg County. ""It was very devastating for the whole community,"" Hupman said. ""I was actually working on the site that day and it was really surreal … a lot of people were unsure of their futures."" The closure threw 320 people out of work at Bowater and then the Oakhill Sawmill closed, which led to a ripple effect in Nova Scotia's forestry sector. Clarke said the Region of Queens began working closely with neighbouring municipalities in Lunenburg County, particularly the Municipality of the District of Lunenburg, to try to diversify the local economy. ""We did things like take an inventory of all our assets, worked with groups that could encourage employers to find the right workforce,"" he said. He said the provincial and federal governments also worked closely with the municipalities, which provided economic development officers, and established the Port Mersey Commercial Park at the former mill site. The park was created after the former NDP government led by Darrell Dexter purchased Bowater's assets for a dollar. The park is run by a Crown corporation and is now home to multiple businesses, including cannabis producer Aqualitas, which employs 85 people. Hupman is one of several former mill employees working at the company. The Stephen McNeil government announced a transition team to help forestry workers as Northern Pulp shuts down. Other plans include a $50-million transition fund to help those in the forestry sector affected by the shutdown. From that, $7 million will be spent on silviculture work and forest road building, a move that should keep up to 300 people working in the woods as usual for the next year. Much like the McNeil government, the NDP government set up a transition team, which included representatives from the business community, forestry sector, the provincial government and several municipalities. But unlike the Dexter government's transition team, there are no municipal representatives on Northern Pulp's transition team. Clarke said municipalities in the Pictou area are going to have to work together to tackle issues arising from Northern Pulp's closure. He expressed disappointment at the loss of Northern Pulp, but said it's important for the community to be positive moving forward. ""We started to focus on the attributes we had, the opportunities that exist here and how we could move forward,"" Clarke said. ""If there was a turning point, it was changing our attitude from 'Woe is us' to 'Hey, we're a great place.'""

127,Anonymous,2020-01-15T22:11:42.016Z,Garneau says compensation for Flight PS752 victims' families is a 'priority',"Transport Minister Marc Garneau said today that pushing for compensation for the families of Canadians killed when Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down a week ago in Iran is a priority for the federal government. ""One of the requirements from Canada's point of view, along with justice, is compensation. Compensation to be provided by those that stand guilty of playing a role in this tragic accident. But let's do the homework first,"" Garneau told a news conference in Ottawa this afternoon. ""While we can't bring back their loved ones, we can make sure that they receive compensation to help them navigate this difficult time."" Liberal MP Omar Alghabra, who has been tasked with working directly with the victims' families, said the government also is providing financial supports to those affected and options for further financial supports are being considered. For starters, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada is waiving and reimbursing all visa and immigration-related fees for those affected by this tragedy. The department also is expediting requests for visa and other required travel documents, said Alghabra, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister. Alghabra was asked today if the federal government is considering offering the family members a form of interim compensation while they wait for a proper compensation claim to be settled with Iran. ""We are actively exploring these options and we hope a decision will be made in short order,"" he said. Alghabra said the government is offering legal assistance to families as well. ""We are working hard to provide legal resources to grieving families,"" he said. ""Families should not feel pressured into making legal claims immediately while they are in mourning and attending to the returning of remains of their lost ones and funeral arrangements."" After days of denial, officials in Tehran admitted last week that Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 was shot down unintentionally by Iranian missiles. Canadian transportation investigators and consular officials are in Iran this week as the investigation into the crash gets underway. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne tweeted this morning that consular officials are reaching out to banks and insurance companies to help the families of the victims, and have reached out to airlines to begin discussing their travel to and from Iran. Garneau said Canada is still seeking official status in Iran's investigation, which would allow Canadian officials to take part in the analysis of the flight recorders' data. After Garneau's press conference, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada issued a series of tweets saying Canada's desire to participate in the investigation is focused on aircraft safety — not on any future court proceedings. ""A safety investigation is all about finding out what happened and why, and preventing it from reoccurring. A safety investigation under Annex 13 shall be separate from judicial proceedings,"" the TSB said. Today's update in Ottawa came as Canadian officials and other international allies prepared to meet in London Thursday to push Iran for justice for the families of the victims. A safety investigation is all about finding out what happened and why, and preventing it from reoccurring. A safety investigation under Annex 13 shall be separate from judicial proceedings. See section 5.4.1 of Annex 13 <a href=""https://t.co/R6mrzrJLVT"">https://t.co/R6mrzrJLVT</a> (5/5) Iran's judiciary spokesperson Gholamhossein Esmaili said earlier this week that ""extensive investigations have taken place and some individuals are arrested."" His statement on the judiciary's website did not name the arrested individuals or say how many had been detained. Meanwhile, a new video uploaded to YouTube from Iran appears to show the moment Flight PS752 was hit by two missiles. CBC has not independently verified the video, but the New York Times reported it has confirmed the video is security camera footage that shows two missiles striking the airliner. The plane crash happened just hours after Iran launched air strikes against two military bases in Iraq where U.S. forces, and some Canadians, were stationed. The attack was ordered in retaliation for the Trump administration's targeted killing of Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, the week before.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-ps752-garneau-update-iran-1.5424649,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/kevin-mccarthy-trump-soleimani-iran-1.5426345,N/A
128,Mark Gollom,2020-01-08T09:00:00.010Z,#MeToo 'is bigger than one man': How the Harvey Weinstein trial impacts the movement,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. For Montreal actress Erika Rosenbaum, who is among the dozens of women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct and abuse, his trial is an important moment in our culture, as he represents the beginning of the #MeToo movement.  Although Weinstein, once one of the most powerful figures in the film industry, has gone from power broker to pariah, he still needs to face real justice in the courtroom, she said. ""I don't think that we can ... say that justice is served until he is actually held accountable legally,"" she said. Rosenbaum is part of the group Time magazine named the Silence Breakers and declared Persons of the Year in 2017, individuals who went public with their allegations of sexual harassment and assault and helped inspire the #MeToo movement. She says an acquittal of Weinstein would be a huge disappointment, but she also believes the movement ignited by the accusations against the movie mogul has become bigger than one man. ""To say it would be a huge setback — I think it's minimizing the movement. I think that this is bigger than one person. I think that this is bigger than one industry. I think this is just part of the story."" The ""Me Too"" movement actually began in 2006, founded by activist Tarana Burke, who used the term for survivors of sexual violence, particularly black women and girls. But it became a viral hashtag in October 2017 when, about a week after the New York Times published its bombshell report on Weinstein, actress Alyssa Milano asked her Twitter followers: ""If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet."" If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet. <a href=""https://t.co/k2oeCiUf9n"">pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n</a> Thousands of women responded to her tweet, relaying their own experiences of harassment and abuse.  ""He put #MeToo on the map, a movement that has taken over the country and the world,"" said reporter and actress Lauren Sivan, part of a group of Silence Breakers and Weinstein accusers who appeared outside the Manhattan courthouse on the first day of Weinstein's trial on Monday. The trial is a ""cultural reckoning,"" said actress Sarah Ann Masse. And regardless of its legal outcome, she said, it is a victory to see ""Weinstein and the systems that have protected him for decades held accountable."" The 67-year-old former Hollywood producer is facing charges of first- and third-degree rape, two counts of predatory sexual assault and one count of a criminal sexual act, based on the accusations of two women. He has also been accused by dozens of other women of sexual misconduct that dates back decades. He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. When CBC News recently asked representatives of Weinstein for his response to some of the allegations that have been made against him, they replied via email: ""Neither Mr. Weinstein, nor his representatives will be making any comments on these matters. I hope you can remain objective."" Rosenbaum, the Montreal actress, said despite the personal setback that would result from an acquittal, the #MeToo movement has become ""a bell that cannot be unrung."" ""I think that women are going to continue to come forward and hold the men who step out of line accountable."" Kristen Houser, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania-based National Sexual Violence Resource Center, said the #MeToo movement has grown so far beyond the Weinstein case that she hates to link them. ""Ultimately, this is one case, and what the #MeToo movement has shown us is that there are tens of thousands just like it."" Houser also doesn't believe a guilty verdict or acquittal will necessarily have a big impact on other women coming forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct. People make decisions about whether to come forward based on their first-hand knowledge of their local communities, the resources available, all the while weighing whether anything will come of making a report, she said. ""What happens to Weinstein might influence a handful, but for most people, they're looking at their social circle, their employers, their family,"" Houser said. Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, an organization that helps connect women who have faced workplace sexual harassment with legal representation, said the Weinstein case has certainly been very important in shining a light on issues like the use of non-disclosure agreements, which often keep allegations against powerful people hidden. In 2017, the New York Times reported some women with allegations against Weinstein received payouts in return for signing confidentiality clauses and keeping quiet. But what's truly historic, she said, is what has been established as a result of the movement.  ""The creation of things like the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, and all of these people coming forward, people talking about sexual harassment, what was created by the Silence Breakers coming forward. That's historic,"" Tejani said. It has been the catalyst for really significant change in the area of sexual harassment, she said. Since the #MeToo movement started, her organization has received requests for assistance from almost 4,000 people and has funded 18 outreach grants to groups that work with low-wage workers to help them learn about workplace sexual harassment and what they can do about it.

129,Brooklyn Currie,2020-01-18T10:00:00.418Z,This N.S. man's family lost everything in a house fire. Here's what he learned,"Brian Verboom and his family had only been out of their Stewiacke, N.S., home for a few minutes when they got word from a family member on vacation in Texas that the Verboom's house was on fire. The family member said a friend had texted her a photo of the burning home. ""That's social media for you,"" said Verboom. The family had been out running errands and by the time the Verbooms made the seven-minute drive back to the house on July 25, 2018, one end of it was completely engulfed in flames. Investigators determined the cause was electrical, Verboom said. He said the hardest thing to lose in the fire was the family photos of Verboom, his wife, Rae-Lee, and their five children. ""Our youngest daughter, most of hers are online that we can get back. But our older daughters, most of those pictures were physical pictures in photo albums,"" Verboom said. After the fire, the couple spent almost 40 hours a week for an entire month making a detailed inventory of their possessions — including their age, how much was paid for them and current value — and going back and forth with their insurance company. ""[It] is the most time-consuming, physically, emotionally, and mentally draining thing you have to do,"" he said. Through his loss, Verboom's hoping to help other families in a similar situation put their lives back together. He wrote an informal nine-page guide called ""What we learned from a total loss fire,"" which he shared on Facebook. One of his pieces of advice is for people to catalogue their possessions. The list isn't just for large items like furniture and appliances — it's clothes, shoes, books, even things like coat hangers and toiletries. A year and a half after the fire, Verboom said he's still remembering things he forgot to list. ""Every little thing adds up, especially if you have to go and replace it all at once,"" he said. ""You just never think of it when you do it through the years."" Verboom suggests keeping all receipts and doing a walk-through video tour of your home every six months, to prove the condition of things like cabinets and furniture, and help jog your memory as you're making a complete inventory of everything you've ever owned. This is in line with what the Insurance Brokers Association of Nova Scotia suggests you do to protect your belongings, whether it's from fire, theft or other damage. Gina McFetridge, a spokesperson for IBANS, said a ""small minority"" of people actually do it. ""No one would disagree that it's a great idea, but the second you finish putting that policy in place, you go home ... and it all falls to the back-burner. You forget about it,"" she said. ""We're not preparing for disaster every day."" Verboom said it's important to be meticulous about listing your possessions and to know just how much it would cost to rebuild your home. He recommends bringing in a contractor to have them quote you. ""We were way off,"" he said, noting the cost to rebuild the home was about $80,000 more than the insurance policy covered. In the end, Verboom and his family bought a prefabricated home for the property instead of rebuilding. ""[It was] late fall, early winter ... it would get us into a house sooner​​​​​​,"" he said. Verboom said the thing that surprised him the most throughout the process was how many costs would come out of their total insurance payout that he hadn't considered, like demolition, food, hotels and salvage costs. Verboom said he's received a lot of positive feedback from people about the guide. ""I hope nobody has to use it ... but if anybody does, I hope it makes the situation for them easier to get through,"" he said.

Dan Bobbett, mayor of Paradise, tweeted a warning to residents early Saturday morning: clearing over 75 centimetres of snow off town property will take time. Advice from all sides? Hole up, hunker down and wait, since there's nowhere to go anyway. Some Avalon residents have found uses for the nine- to 10-foot drifts blocking their doors, leaving them wondering how to tunnel out — and then, of course, how to stomp and flail their way through the drifts to get enough leverage to move the snow around. Others have given up entirely. On Saturday, CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup opened the national phone lines to hear how Canadians across the country are coping with winter weather. Still snowed in, many callers from Newfoundland shared their stories. Sonja Mills of Port Rexton told host Duncan McCue that she and her wife, Alicia, are passing the time with marathon games of cribbage.  ""[We are] really just kind of hanging in there, hoping the power doesn't go out [and] getting prepared for it,"" Mills said. But the couple had a more pressing concern on their minds. As owners of Port Rexton Brewing Company, they strapped on skis Saturday afternoon and braved the weather to check on their beer. ""With the power on ... things are still happening in the brewing tanks, so we're going to go keep an eye on things,"" she told McCue. For Bob Cole, the legendary broadcaster who retired last year after a half-century of work for Hockey Night in Canada, it was a chance to give some old friends an update on what's happening in his home province. ""It took a state of emergency, by the way, to get me on Hockey Night again,"" Cole told Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean on Saturday night before the beginning of the Toronto Maple Leafs-Chicago Blackhawks game. Watch as Bob Cole discusses the blizzard on Hockey Night in Canada: Others took advantage of the snowdrifts for a little thrill seeking. When he looked at the snow-covered streets of St. John's, free of moving vehicles, Matt Wells saw an opportunity. ""I walked out the front door, strapped on the snowboard and then I proceeded on down Prescott, over Duckworth and on down to Water Street,"" Wells told McCue. ""It was surprising, actually, because there was so much snow, it was actually difficult to get any speed up. It was difficult to go faster or pick up any speed because the snow was so deep,"" he said of his ride. Video of Wells' slide through the streets was shared widely on Facebook on Saturday. Wells is originally from the west coast of New Zealand and attended university in Halifax, but only moved to St. John's a few months ago.  ""It was probably ill-advised for me to go do it myself. But definitely worth it in the end,"" he says of his ride. There were those who wouldn't let the blizzard get in the way of a fun Saturday night.

Meyer called in CBC's radio special to read something he'd written while watching the blizzard rage: I moved to St. John's just in time for the greatest winter storm in a generation. Now I stand half-buried in a cold Sahara watching streetlights flicker meekly like  tea candles on the verge of being snuffed by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The house rocks and surges like a wooden ship so that when I close my eyes I see icy cliffs, too close, disappear under the frigid surf thrown around by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  When the power finally fails the world goes not black, but purple, and from the otherworldly shade  it's obvious St. John's is a sibling of Pluto; an icy frontier at the edge of system space, in orbit but  made distinct by the distance and cold as a dwarf-planet by the greatest winter storm in a generation.  The air around the city feels sick as if decades of jet fuel and international trade routes  have concocted a nasty bug to be slowly purged with each retching gust that spews  a break-locking, street-clogging mess culminating in the greatest winter storm in a generation.  I moved to St. John's in time to witness its cold burial but  tomorrow I will wake and find life in the morning after the greatest storm in a generation.  What a load of snow!!

131,Sara Minogue,2020-01-17T14:18:32.480Z,Dene Nation seeks formal apology for TB treatment in 'Indian hospitals' ,"The Dene Nation is seeking a formal apology for the way its members were treated in medical institutions. ""A lot of our members, since 1945 to 1980, were sent down to the Charles Camsell Hospital,"" said Dene National Chief Norman Yakeleya, referring to the former hospital in Edmonton. ""A lot of our people that were sent down to the Charles Camsell Hospital suffered a lot of abuses."" Yakeleya wants an apology similar to the one Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered to Inuit in Iqaluit last March. Yakeleya raised the issue with Northern Affairs Minister Dan Vandal in Yellowknife earlier this week. That followed a conversation with Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Caroline Bennett last March, in which Yakeleya said she was receptive to the idea.   ""This issue is long overdue,"" Yakeleya said. ""The time is right now."" The Dene experience looms large in a major pending lawsuit. The former Charles Camsell Hospital is named among 28 other segregated ""Indian hospitals"" in a proposed $1.1 billion lawsuit against the federal government. That lawsuit is expected to receive its official class action certification next week.  Edmonton lawyer Steve Cooper, who launched part of the lawsuit, said Camsell cases make up about 25 per cent of the hundreds of people the class aims to represent.  ""The majority of N.W.T. residents, and even a family member of mine, would have been in regular attendance at the Camsell Hospital,"" he said. ""When they were suffering from TB initially, but thereafter, any sort of situation where they needed better medical care than could be offered in the N.W.T.""  Cooper, whose dad was a teacher, grew up in the territories, and recalls his mother being sent to Edmonton for treatment, possibly more than once.  He's now heard hundreds of stories and says the experience of patients at Charles Camsell were ""horrendous, uniformly.""  He tells stories of children being put in body-casts as a form of discipline, of people being denied treatment for the illnesses they were sent out for, and of former patients who died and were never returned home, their families never informed of what happened to them.  Cooper says the case is similar to the residential school lawsuits, and that he hopes it will similarly be the start of a healing process.  For Yakeleya, the issue is personal. He had family members who went to Charles Camsell and never returned.  His father also went. Yakeleya can remember the day he returned home, took off his T-shirt, and showed him the scars on his back from the treatment he'd received.  ""I got scared actually. Two big scars on his back there, two big lines, about a foot and a half, two feet. It was surgical. It was for TB."" Yakeleya says work is just beginning to address those who were buried in or near the hospital, and whose families were not informed.  ""There are people still alive in our Dene communities who  know that their loved ones are buried somewhere in around Edmonton,"" he said. ""In their mind, sitting in their small communities, they still think their loved ones are gonna come back.""  Yakeleya says he's learned that some may be buried on First Nations reserves near Edmonton, and says research is just beginning to locate and identify graves.  ""We have some major healing to do to help the people who lost their loved one,"" he said. ""It's painful but it has to get done."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/dene-nation-seeks-tb-treatment-apology-1.5430271,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indian-hospitals-class-action-lawsuit-1.5425171,N/A

French Language School Board,"The French Language School Board on P.E.I. says it's dealing with a deficit of more than $253,000 from the 2018-19 fiscal year. The board was working from an operational budget of $17.3 million. The numbers were discussed at the board's recent annual meeting, said Brad Samson, the board's director of corporate services. P.E.I.'s French student population has surpassed 1,000 — an increase of 22 per cent over the past five years, according to the board. However that progress has brought financial challenges, Samson said. ""The deficit has been due to several circumstances mainly relating to salaries and transportation,"" he said.

But what do pet owners do in these frigid conditions when they want to give their animals some exercise without freezing their paws? A Saskatoon entrepreneur has come up with a solution: an indoor dog park. Jocelyn Davey-Hawreluik, owner of Furbaby Pet Care, said she added the indoor park to her business at the end of October because dog owners were telling her they were looking for an indoor facility, even when it isn't frigidly cold outside. She started her business last January as a mobile service for dog sitting and dog walking but with the extreme cold last winter, it was hard on most of the dogs. ""You just couldn't walk them for very long,"" she said. It's not just the cold you have to worry about when walking your pets, she said. ""It's the salt on the ground. ... They're getting that burn on their paws."" Davey-Hawreluik saw all the posts on Facebook from dog owners wondering where they could take their pets indoors and the wheels started to turn, she said.  The facility is on Jasper Avenue. There are two spaces for dogs to play in: the small are has 900 square feet of turf and 1,200 square feet of epoxy cement on the small side, and the large area has 1,900 square feet of turf and 600 square feet of epoxy cement. Davey-Hawreluik said while they do consider the size of the dog when deciding what area the dog goes in, it is more about their personalities. ""We look at behaviour and who wants to play with who,"" she said. ""For example, a couple of days ago we had a big Rottweiler playing so nicely with a little Frenchton [a French bulldog and Boston terrier cross]. It looks wrong but they were the best mix."" While so far no dogs have been banned because of aggression, Davey-Hawreluik said they will give an overly excited dog a time out. ""Usually after a while they're ready to come back and play."" On Tuesday night, they had more than 70 dogs come to the park over a two and a half hour period. She said it's probably best to book ahead because they have maxed out with the number of dogs they can have at one time. The indoor dog park is open Monday to Friday from 6-8:30 p.m. and on weekends from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/indoor-dog-park-saskatoon-cold-weather-1.5427724,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/low-temperature-influx-pets-surrendered-shelters-1.5425733 https://www.cbc.ca/life/pets/a-vet-on-how-to-protect-your-dog-against-the-worst-of-winter-1.5028868,N/A
134,Beth Brown,2020-01-13T10:00:00.772Z,"Nunavut government asks to lower caribou hunt on Bluenose East herd, ban Bathurst harvest","The Government of Nunavut is asking to lower the annual harvest limits of two declining caribou herds in western Nunavut, but impacted communities say the proposed restrictions will have severe impacts on their way of life. A proposal submitted by the territory's Department of Environment to the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board in December asks for the total allowable harvest of Bluenose East caribou to drop to around a third of what it is now, from 340 to 107 annually. It also calls for a ban on harvesting females. Another proposal that came at the same time, during meetings with the wildlife board in the community of Kugluktuk, asks for a total ban on the hunt of Bathurst Caribou in Nunavut. Currently, there are only 30 tags for that herd, which is already banned for hunting in the Northwest Territories. Changes to the Bluenose East herd would have the largest impact on residents in Kugluktuk, the only community in Nunavut who hunt them.  A population survey from 2018 shows the population of the Bluenose East herd was halved in just three years, counting around 19,250 caribou left. The same survey also showed that females are dying young, and not birthing enough calves.  The herd is mostly hunted across the territorial border, in the Northwest Territories, and in June, the N.W.T. reduced its total allowable harvest. Changes proposed by the Nunavut government are meant to bring Nunavut's harvest in line with what's happening in the N.W.T.  ""You can't have one jurisdiction doing one thing and another jurisdiction implementing different management actions on the same herd,"" Drikus Gissing, director of wildlife management for the department of Environment, said. ""If it's not coordinated, you won't have proper conservation initiatives put in place.""  Kugluktuk, Gissing said, has access to other caribou, noting that the decline seen by the Bluenose East and Bathurst herds has not stopped.  ""We're trying to slow down the decline,"" he said.  Kugluktuk's Hunters and Trappers Association has its own plans for conservation of the Bluenose East herd. To date, the community has never hunted all its allowed tags in one year, said Amanda Dumond, manager for the community hunters association. Changing migration patterns have meant the herd is getting harder to access, she said. Instead, Kugluktuk is asking the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board not to reduce the harvest below 250, and for a one to one ratio of hunting males and females.  ""We know that there's a decline. But we also know that there's a community that relies on this for food and for clothing. A lower [total allowable harvest] will really impact our community,"" she said.  The hunters and trappers' association has its own policies to protect the herd. It's banned all sport hunts, and doesn't allow hunters to hunt around the community, where female caribou harvest in spring.  Dumond said a male-only hunt would restrict the harvest of Bluenose East caribou to the fall.  ""We would not be accepting that. It would take away from our cultural history or needs for the animals at different times of the year,"" Dumond said.   She said that could also lead to overhunting of the Dolphin Union caribou — another declining herd that has no restrictions on it.  A moratorium on hunting Bathurst caribou also impacts Kugluktuk, as well as two outpost camps, Bathurst Inlet and Bay Chimo. By extension, that change also impacts the community of Cambridge Bay.  Another survey from 2018 shows there are around 8,210 caribou in the Bathurst herd — half as many caribou as there were in the herd five years ago, when the Wek'èezhìi Renewable Resources Board put a ban on its hunt on the N.W.T. side of the border.  In 2015, Nunavut's wildlife board chose to allow 30 tags for the Bathurst herd for community use. Right now, the 10 tags that Kugluktuk has are used solely by one family who live off the land, around 280 kilometres outside of the community, at Contwoyto Lake.   ""A [total allowable harvest] of zero would greatly impact that family who rely on these tags for sustenance harvesting,"" Dumond said. ""For the community itself they're not accessible. There's not a lot of action we can take to help (with conservation).""  The outpost camps each have ten tags, which are used for food and economic gain through sports hunts, which is allowed under the Nunavut Agreement.  But Gissing says this complicates the issue, because communities across the territorial border gave up hunting Bathurst caribou.  ""We do not like to recommend harvest restrictions. We know that these restrictions have significant implications for communities from a social perspective, from a food security perspective,"" he said. ""When we recommend these limitations on harvesting, it's basically as a last resort.""  The Nunavut Wildlife Management board will hold public community meetings in Cambridge Bay and Kugluktuk in March to discuss the government's proposals, and to hear what the communities want.   Gissing said it's too soon to have a timeline for any changes, but that a decision would be unlikely to come into force until after July 1, when the new harvest season starts.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-asks-for-change-bathurst-bluenose-east-caribou-1.5422078,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-herds-decline-2018-1.4913934 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bathurst-caribou-range-plan-1.5257383 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-nunavut-caribou-management-1.5116148 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/management-plan-caribou-nwt-at-risk-1.4501154,N/A

Fowler confirmed the identification documents presented by the girl and her grandfather — a birth certificate matched with a status card, and a health card matched with a status card — did meet the bank's criteria. However, he said, staff were unable to ""validate"" their identities. ""We have many tools and practices for validating identification,"" Fowler said. ""In this case, we couldn't get the validation done and we overreacted and called police."" Vancouver Police Chief Adam Palmer said officers followed standard practices in handcuffing the man and the 12-year-old.  Palmer also said the 911 call from the bank described the alleged fraudsters as a 16-year-old South Asian female and 50-year-old South Asian male — something Fowler categorically denies.  ""That information is inconsistent with any information that we have regarding what actually happened,"" he said. Fowler said staff have been reprimanded, but did not elaborate. He did not say whether Johnson and his granddaughter have been offered compensation.  The incident has sparked intense backlash, protests outside the branch and condemnation from the mayor of Vancouver. The head of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs has also called on institutions to beware of racial profiling.

Johnson lives in in Bella Bella, a Heiltsuk community located on B.C's Central Coast.

136,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-11T13:40:05.694Z,Hydro-Québec to provide 'expertise' in refurbishing Mactaquac Dam,"NB Power is turning to Hydro-Quebec for help in refurbishing its largest hydroelectric dam at Mactaquac near Fredericton.  NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas and Hydro-Québec CEO Éric Martel made the announcement at a Friday morning news conference at the dam. The agreement will see the Québec utility provide its long expertise with hydro dams to NB Power to allow the dam to continue operating until 2068.  ""We are happy to share the expertise of Hydro-Québec acquired over the years,"" Martel said, pointing out the utility recently did a similar refurbishment on its Beauharnois dam near Montreal. The deal will also see New Brunswick's utility agree to import a substantial new amount of electricity from Québec between now and 2040. NB Power has been buying hydro power from Quebec since 2012. The 47 terawatt hours to be purchased from now until 2040 is substantial. That power will fill some of the gap created when Mactaquac's turbines shut down for the refurbishment and will be a positive backup plan if no alternative to coal is found for the Belledune generating station by a 2030 deadline. ""We're facing carbon-reduction pressures in New Brunswick that, without their help, would cost way more money,"" he said, estimating the cost of replacing the Belledune plant at $2.5 billion. ""This is why we're exploring other sources, but Hydro-Québec will fill a good portion of that right now.""  One terawatt hour of electricity is worth about $60 million based on average on-peak prices charged in the New England market last year in which New Brunswick operates .    That would make a deal to buy 47 terawatts of electricity over the next 20 years worth between $2 billion and $3 billion. Only part of that will  be needed to replace reduced output from Mactaquac during renovations. The dam currently produces an average of about 1.6 terawatts of electricity per year for NB Power, 60 per cent of the utility's hydro generation. The two utilities will also discuss building new transmission lines between the two provinces. The Mactaquac dam opened in 1968 with an expected service life of 100 years. However, an alkali aggregate chemical reaction in the dam's concrete has been causing the dam to expand over the years, resulting in the expected end of life in 2030.  The cost of a complete rebuild of the dam has been estimated at between $2.7 and $3.6 billion, depending on which option was chosen, a major expense for a Crown corporation and a province already deeply in debt. Thomas said Friday the contract with Hydro-Québec for the refurbishment will cost around $100 million, but will represent ""hundreds of millions"" in savings compared to a costlier full replacement of the dam. The Quebec utility's ability to spread the work over a longer time period will reduce the impact on NB Power and on ratepayer bills, he said.  And he said NB Power and its customers will also benefit from the inexpensive supply of hydro power from Quebec.  ""It represents significant savings."" Thomas said the price for electricity in this part of North America is pegged to natural gas so it's impossible to predict the cost. ""We can't give you a precise figure because it fluctuates year to year,"" he said. Thomas and Martel said the refurbishment would shut down only one of Mactaquac's six turbines at a time, allowing the others to continue running.  While the utility's large debt won't allow rate reductions on power bills, rate increases will be lower than they would be otherwise, he said.  ""We're the lowest in Atlantic Canada and this secures us to stay the lowest in Atlantic Canada,"" he said. ""We can't compete with our [Quebec] friends here, because they have the size and the natural resources, but we are benefiting from them enormously.""  The two agreements make it easier for NB Power to move toward the federal government's goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Thomas added. ""Net zero doesn't happen without all the energy sources available,"" he said. But he warned it may not be possible for the federal government to help pay for the refurbishment from its green infrastructure fund, which specifically mentions transmission projects and renewable energy. Energy exports to the United States are now tax-free and tariff-free, but federal subsidies could jeopardize that and invite American trade retaliation, the CEO said. Premier Blaine Higgs said last year he didn't want to let Québec sell more electricity to New Brunswick until that province reversed its opposition to oil pipelines passing through its territory on the way to New Brunswick. But the premier said Friday afternoon that he considers the electricity supply agreement to be a continuation of existing contracts. ""This is a good agreement for New Brunswick, for a backup supply for us, or a makeup supply for us in the absence of, or let's say outside, fossil fuels."" Assuming the refurbishment is approved by the Energy and Utilities Board and through an environmental impact assessment, work could start on the dam in 2025 or 2026. Friday's announcement comes a decade after the Liberal government of Shawn Graham attempted to sell the Crown utility to Hydro-Québec, a widely unpopular proposal that eventually collapsed. At the time, Graham said the deal fell apart when Hydro-Québec discovered that the looming cost of refurbishing Mactaquac was greater than originally expected, creating a greater financial risk for the Quebec utility. At the time, Quebec was accused of trying to corner the electricity market in eastern North America. The then-premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Danny Williams, accused Québec of trying to block its route to sell its electricity into the U.S. market. Marcel said that his agreements with NB Power ""open the door to more deals with Atlantic Canada."" If more transmission links between the two utilities are built, Quebec could sell more of its power via New Brunswick to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, while hydro power from Labrador could pass through Quebec and New Brunswick into New England.  ""Gaetan and I want to send a message that having provinces working together can be good for the other ones,"" he said. ""Together with this interconnection we will definitely offer more opportunity to the Maritimes but also to the U.S. market.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-hydro-quebec-mactaquac-1.5421849,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/mactaquac-dam-refurbishment-project-federal-loan-1.4642524 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/mactaquac-nbpower-dam-future-option-1.3905066,N/A
137,Jesse Campigotto,2020-01-18T20:19:27.740Z,"With Bianca out, here are the Canadians to watch at the Australian Open","The first Grand Slam tennis tournament of the new year could have been a real treat for Canadian fans. For the first time ever, the country has a reigning major singles champion. Bianca Andreescu's quest to win her second consecutive Slam at the Australian Open would have been must-see TV. But Andreescu's knee still isn't right from the injury she suffered at the end of October, so she won't be playing in Melbourne. This is a huge bummer, obviously. But not all is lost. Five Canadians are playing in the singles draws, which get going this weekend. Here's who they are and what else you should know: With Andreescu out, the 20-year-old Shapovalov is Canada's best tennis player. He wasn't even seeded at the most recent Slam (the late-summer U.S. Open) but the lefty made sure that wouldn't happen again. He showed no mercy in crushing 18th-seeded fellow Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime in the first round before eventually losing a five-setter to No. 13 Gael Monfils in the third. Shapovalov went on to win his first ATP Tour title (at a lower-tier tournament in Sweden) and also reached the final of a more prestigious Masters-level event in Paris before the end of 2019. That run turned him into the highest-ranked Canadian on the men's tour, and he closed out the year by leading Canada on a surprising run to the Davis Cup final. Shapovalov has carried the momentum into this season: he beat two top-seven-ranked opponents at the ATP Cup and is now ranked a career-high 13th in the world. That's also his seed for the Australian Open, where he'll meet Marton Fucsovics in the first round Sunday at 7 p.m. ET. The Hungarian is ranked 66th. They've never faced each other. Barring an upset, Shapovalov is on course to face Roger Federer in the fourth round. That would match his best run ever at a Slam, which happened at the '17 U.S. Open. Shapovalov made it to round 3 in Australia last year. The 19-year-old hit a career-high 17th in the rankings back in October, but he's slipped to 22nd after going 2-5 in his last five individual tournaments of 2019. Felix then got off to a rough start to 2020, losing three of his four singles matches for Canada at the ATP Cup. He did better this week against softer competition at an Aussie Open tuneup event in Adelaide, where he lost in the semifinals. Auger-Aliassime is seeded 20th for his first appearance in the Australian Open's main draw. He'll face a to-be-determined qualifier in the first round. If he wins that, he'll face an unseeded player in the second round before likely meeting the 10th-seeded Monfils (or possibly fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil). Felix's best Slam showing came last year at Wimbledon, where he reached the third round. The best Canadian player of the previous decade just isn't the same anymore. Once ranked as high as third in late 2016 (the year he reached the Wimbledon final and the semis of the Aussie Open), Raonic is down to 35th. He's still capable of blasting big serves, but he's 29 now (old for tennis) and his 6-foot-5, 216-pound body (big for tennis) is breaking down. A bad back forced him out of the Rogers Cup in Montreal last August, and a glute injury kept him from playing in the U.S. Open. Since then, he's played in only six matches and lost five of them. The Australian Open gave Raonic its lowest seed — No. 32. In the opening round he'll face veteran Radu Albot, who's 48th in the world rankings. They've never played each other. Next up would be an unseeded player, followed by a potential matchup with the sixth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas in the third round. Unseeded and unpredictable. Pospisil is way down at 146 in the world rankings — far below his career high of 25 reached in 2014. But the 29-year-old is on the rise. He fell as low as No. 248 in the fall after missing a long stretch of time due to back surgery. But Canadian fans will remember his dynamite performance at the Davis Cup, where he went 3-1 in singles matche s and teamed with Shapovalov for clutch doubles wins in the quarter-finals and the semis. Pospisil is a journeyman, but he can be a dangerous one. And he's got a beatable (if scary) first-round opponent in 123rd-ranked Ivo Karlovic, who's 40 years old and stands nearly seven feet tall. The 17-year-old won three straight qualifying matches to get in. She won the 2019 French Open junior girls' title and was the runner-up in last year's Australian Open junior event, but this is her first real Grand Slam. Fernandez is ranked 213th in the world. Her opponent in the first round is 65th-ranked Lauren Davis of the United States. Fernandez is the only Canadian in the women's singles draw, and also the only Canadian who survived qualifying. Genie Bouchard, Brayden Schnur, Steven Diez and Peter Polansky all got eliminated. Gabriela Dabrowski is ranked seventh in the world in women's doubles, so she's guaranteed a spot in that lower-profile event. Dabrowki recently ended her three-year partnership with China's Yifan Xu. In Australia, she'll play with Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko, who she's won a tournament with in the past. Unlike Dabrowski, Ostapenko still focuses on singles, so Dabrowki may have to find other partners this year when Ostapenko isn't available.

138,Catherine Cullen,2019-12-19T22:18:22.809Z,"New vaping advertising limits coming, but no further restrictions on nicotine yet","With government figures showing a spike in the number of young people vaping, the federal government is preparing to place stricter limits on advertising and make health warnings on vaping products mandatory, CBC News has learned. However, Ottawa is not yet ready to go as far as many health advocates want by further restricting the flavoured vape products known to appeal to younger users. It's also still considering whether to further limit the level of nicotine in vaping products. Under the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, it is prohibited to sell vaping devices that contain 66 mg/g of nicotine or more because they have been deemed ""very toxic"" by regulators. Most products sold legally are below that threshold. The government has been considering the moves since consultations began in February. Proposed regulations include banning advertising anywhere it can be seen or heard by youth, which includes public spaces, convenience stores and online. They would also ban in-store displays of vaping products except for specialty stores that restrict entry to people 18 years or older. Some brands already include health warnings on their products, but the proposed regulations would make it mandatory for all. But that won't go far enough for some public health advocates. Earlier this fall, organizations including the Canadian Medical Association called on the government to go further. They want more limits on the number of flavoured products available, in an effort to make vaping less attractive to youth. They have also called for stricter limits on nicotine levels. Dr. Andrew Pipe, a professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa and a clinician scientist in smoking cessation at the university's heart institute, welcomed the federal initiative but said more needs to be done.  ""I want to emphasize that the regulations that have been proposed have already been in place in Quebec, for instance, for some time and they've experienced the same rapid increase in vaping amongst young people as is being experienced all across Canada,"" Pipe said in an interview.  ""Far from being a package of comprehensive regulations, this is just an initial attempt to address some of the more egregious marketing practices of the vaping industry.""   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was asked on CBC's Power & Politics what's holding his government back from moving further and faster on vaping. ""I think we need to leave room for proper science. We're a government that works on evidence-based decisions,"" Trudeau said. A government official, speaking on background, said earlier that Health Canada still hopes to take action on flavours and nicotine levels in the new year. Officials are currently still debating the best way forward. Health Canada has cracked down on shops selling illegal vaping products that defy current federal regulations. In 2019, the agency raided more than 3,000 vape shops, collecting more than 80,000 units of non-compliant vaping products. The products seized include those that feature flavours advertised as ""confectionery,"" soft drinks or energy drinks, and products that exceed existing nicotine levels or include banned additives. Under existing regulations, the government has restrictions on which ingredients can be put in a vaping product. According to the government official, many of the vaping-related illnesses reported by people in recent months have come from users of vaping pods purchased on the illegal market. These products often include a vitamin E acetate additive, which the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said is partly to blame for the recent spate of vaping-related illnesses. All of this is happening as youth e-cigarette use skyrockets. According to the government's figures, via the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey, the number of students (grades 7-12) who say they have used an e-cigarette in the past 30 days has shot up to 20 per cent in 2018-19 — double the number from the previous year. Health Canada said the changes will be published in Canada Gazette on Dec. 21, followed by 30 days of public comments and consultation. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/vaping-restrictions-mandatory-federal-1.5402210,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-health-canada-smoking-troubling-signs-1.4909402 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-plain-packaging-vaping-law-1.4662112,N/A

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening for direct arrivals at New York City's JFK International Airport is expected later Friday followed by screenings on Saturday at San Francisco International Airport. The third airport is Los Angeles International Airport. The risk from the coronavirus to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. While the U.S. State Department has issued a health alert update about travel to the Wuhan region, the CDC has urged citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Friday it will not implement extra screening measures, but is ""monitoring the situation closely with our partners on both sides of the border."" The CBSA did say there are plans in progress ""to implement signage"" in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal airports to raise awareness of the virus to travellers. Elsewhere, Thailand has found a second case of a new Chinese coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as they ramped up checks on Chinese visitors, nearly a million of whom are expected for Lunar New Year holidays next week. The latest patient is from China's central city of Wuhan, which has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, with two deaths, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread. The 74-year-old woman, quarantined since arriving in Thailand on Monday, was found to be infected, health officials said. ""We're very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of diseases,"" Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, adding that the situation was under control and there was no outbreak in Thailand. ""We're fully alert."" The two Chinese patients were now safe but needed to go through a few more procedures before Thai authorities could let them return home, he added. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thailand, which is on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, said on Monday it had found a 61-year-old Chinese woman carrying a strain of the coronavirus, the first time it was detected outside China. Japan reported its first case of the infection on Thursday, after a Japanese man returned from visiting Wuhan, known for picturesque lakes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the virus could spread and warned hospitals against it. Thai health officials have stepped up monitoring at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan — Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai and Phuket — and others that receive charter flights from the Chinese city. Since Jan. 3, Thailand has screened 13,624 passengers. Health officials also asked Thai AirAsia and China Southern Airlines, which run direct daily flights from Wuhan, to halt boarding by those suffering from high fever and respiratory symptoms, and reschedule their flights.

141,Bonnie Allen,2019-12-03T16:29:27.522Z,Regina rapist unapologetic as judge ponders sentence for horrific sexual assault,"Warning: This story contains content that some readers may find disturbing.  The defence lawyer for a Regina man convicted of sexual assault causing bodily harm argued in court Monday that the man's lack of remorse shouldn't factor into his sentence. Minutes later, Gioulian Nikdima, 50, stood up in Court of Queen's Bench and made it clear to Justice Fred Kovach that, despite his conviction, he takes no responsibility for forcing anal sex on a 49-year-old woman, inflicting injury. A nurse who specializes in rape exams testified the woman suffered one of the worst anal injuries she had ever seen. ""My only mistake in this case was meeting that woman,"" Nikdima told the court. ""She could leave any time she want ... I know women."" The woman said what started as a first date with a ""perfect gentleman"" in March 2016 turned into a horrific sexual assault after Nikdima drove her outside the city. The two met through the online dating site Plenty of Fish. Defence lawyer Nicolas Brown asked for a three-year prison sentence and said the judge should consider the fact that Nikdima didn't use any weapons or threats. He argued the assault wasn't premeditated, but rather an escalation of consensual sexual activity, which led the accused to take it ""too far."" He asked the judge to disregard Nikdima's lack of remorse. ""It's not uncommon for people who are accused and convicted of sexual assault to maintain that position,"" Brown said. Regina prosecutor Randene Zielke asked that Nikdima serve a five-year prison sentence and be added to the sexual offender registry. Zielke argued a three-year prison sentence is the starting point for sexual assaults in Saskatchewan, and one involving significant injury, as sustained by this woman, would warrant a much higher sentence.  Both the defence and Crown agreed Nikdima will almost certainly be deported to Greece after serving time, as required by the Immigration Act. Nikdima is a permanent resident who immigrated from Greece six years ago. The prosecutor emphasized that Nikdima preyed upon the woman's vulnerability after driving her outside the city. When Kovach convicted Nikdima in September, he said he wasn't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that all sexual activities in the vehicle that day were non-consensual. He specified Nikdima committed sexual assault causing bodily harm at the point that Nikdima penetrated the woman anally without communicated consent, and then disregarded her screams of pain. In sentencing submissions, Zielke spoke at length about the violence of forced sodomy.  ""[The victim] described the pain as being the worst she had ever felt, as though she's being stabbed,"" Zielke said.  ""Sexual assault is a crime of violence. It is an inherently violent act. It violates the safety, privacy and sanctity of one's body. Forced sexual intercourse is amongst the most serious imaginable acts of personal violence."" When Zielke described the severity of the woman's anal injury, Kovach suggested someone could sustain that kind of injury through consensual sex as well. He also questioned any sentencing arguments that suggested Nikdima had lured the woman outside the city in a ""nefarious"" scheme. The woman submitted a victim impact statement, read by the Crown, that described how that date changed her and her life. Before March 2016, she said, she had a great life with a career, friends, family and activities she enjoyed. ""I thought the only thing missing was someone to share my life with,"" the woman said. ""What I can't get past is how [Nikdima] was a perfect gentleman and in a blink of an eye, he was unrecognizable. I didn't expect that a first kiss would result in years of pain and suffering."" The woman said she didn't know why she didn't fight that day, and it still haunts her. After the assault, she said, ""I didn't want to be in my skin."" The victim said she reported the sexual assault to prove to her adult daughter that she was ""still the strong woman who had raised her.""  As CBC News reported during the trial, the woman used a Google image search to track down her rapist, who had used a fake name online, and reported him to police. The woman has seen a therapist or life coach every week since the assault more than three and a half years ago. She said she still suffers anxiety attacks in public places. ""The fear and terror of that day are never far away.""

142,Anonymous,2019-12-17T21:09:49.351Z,UN urges 'reboot' of refugee response as millions are uprooted globally,"The United Nations urged governments, businesses and others on Tuesday to ""reboot"" the world's response to refugees as the number of people fleeing their homes rises along with hostility to migrants. The first Global Refugee Forum, being hosted in Geneva by the UN and Switzerland on Tuesday and Wednesday, is meant to draw pledges to pave the way for a fairer and more co-ordinated approach to hosting and integrating millions of refugees worldwide. ""Our world is in turmoil and 25 million refugees are looking to us for solutions,"" Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees, told the event. He said the number is far higher if adding people displaced within their own countries. ""As a new decade dawns with some 71 million people uprooted from their homes globally, inside and outside their countries, it's time to reboot our responses,"" Grandi said. The forum also underscored international tensions, with Turkey's president complaining of a lack of support for his country's plans to resettle up to a million Syrian refugees in Turkey to Turkish-controlled regions of northern Syria. Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan, used his appearance to criticize neighbour and archrival India. He called for a ""broad alliance"" of governments, business, development institutions, the aid community, sports organizations and others. Business executives and the head of the International Olympic Committee were among those attending the forum. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said ""developing and middle-income countries admirably host the vast majority of refugees and warrant greater support."" In addition, he said, ""at a time when the right to asylum is under assault, when so many borders and doors are being closed to refugees, when even child refugees can be divided from their families, we need to reaffirm the human rights of refugees."" At the forum Tuesday, Canadian Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino announced $50.4 million over the next four years to help the United Nations Refugee Agency respond to the humanitarian and protection needs of refugees around the world. ""Canada has a proud and long-standing tradition of responding to the needs of vulnerable people,"" Mendicino said. ""We are at the forefront of working with partners to advance innovative solutions for those who've been forced to flee their homes."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose country's invasion of northern Syria to drive U.S.-allied Kurdish forces out of a ""safe zone"" along the border has drawn widespread criticism, said Syrian oil revenues could be used to help relocate Syrians in Turkey. He complained, in a veiled swipe at the U.S., that no one wants to spend the money on the refugees. ""I say: 'Come let's take out the oil in the wells together and let's implement projects in these areas … so that these people can be settled in the houses, schools, hospitals that we build,'"" Erdogan said. ""But they don't support it because they need the oil more [than refugees].""

143,Brandie Weikle,2017-01-16T21:44:25.833Z,Text 911 for help? CRTC holds hearing on upgrading emergency services,"You may one day be able to text 911 for help, send a photo, or even share video of a bad guy fleeing a scene. The next generation of 911 services is the subject of a Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) hearing that started Monday. ""Simply put, technological advances could allow citizens in need of emergency assistance to send text messages, photos, videos and other data to 911 operators, in addition to making 911 phone calls,"" said CRTC chairman Jean-Pierre Blais in a written statement containing his opening remarks at the hearing Monday morning. Blais said broadband service has transformed many aspects of everyday life, and that emergency services should also benefit from a tech upgrade. In some parts of Canada, people can register for a service that allows them to text 911. The Deaf Wireless Canada Committee wants that service to be available across the country, especially to benefit the deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals who are unable to communicate with standard phone calls. But widely available text to 911 services that don't require registration are still a way off. The hearings held over five days will aim to establish the roles and responsibilities of telecommunications companies in rolling out the so-called NG-911 (next generation 911), figure out a timeline for getting these set up, and sort out who will pay the bill. That's what this really comes down to, said Dr. Louis Francescutti, an emergency department physician and professor of public health at the University of Alberta.  ""We could do this today if we wanted to, but the service providers are saying, 'Why should they have to pay for it? It should be the government that pays for it,'"" Francescutti told CBC News. ""And yet these service providers have been collecting 911 fees from all of us. ""They've been collecting a lot of money. How come they haven't been using it to enhance the 911 technology?"" Before we get fancy with uploading photos and video to 911 operators, we might want to think about the reliability of the technology we do have, said Francescutti. There are currently two types of 911 service, basic and enhanced. Those with basic 911 have to tell operators their location, while enhanced 911 service is supposed to determine the user's location automatically through a process of triangulation. ""The problem with that is that if you live in downtown Toronto on the 30th floor of a building, it'll be able to tell that you might be in that building, but for example it won't be able to give you the altitude of where you are in that building,"" said Francescutti. He said 50 per cent of 911 calls are now made from cellphones, and that cell networks that use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology aren't as reliable at locating us as we think. Francescutti pointed to the 2008 case of toddler Elijah Luck, who died after 911 dispatched an ambulance to Mississauga, Ont., the last address the company had for the family, instead of their home in Calgary. Yet location problems are not the greatest threat to our 911 system, he said. ""The biggest risk we have is, for example, when Rogers, their cell system had an outage, that means [millions of] customers are basically without 911 services,"" said Francesccutti. ""We put ourselves in a very vulnerable situation."" ""The sad thing about all of this is that the technology for 911 systems that are very sophisticated is made in Quebec and it's exported to the United States,"" he said. Solacom, headquartered in Gatineau, Que., supplies its 911 technology to U.S. dispatch centres that provide emergency service to 93 per cent of the U.S. population, said Francescutti. Washington mandated that cellphone companies update their technology to provide better location services in emergencies by 2005, putting Canada 12 years behind the U.S., he said.  Patricia Valladao, a media relations manager with the CRTC, said in an email that the hearings will address VoIP technology's ""major impact on the networks, systems, and arrangements used to provide 911 services.""   The hearing will also address the CRTC's desire to plan ahead to replace those existing 911 networks that run on aging telecommunications equipment nearing the end of its lifecycle, she said.  The hearing follows a period of public consultation last year during which the CRTC solicited comment from Canadians through its website. The CRTC says that an estimated 96 per cent of Canada's population currently has access to basic or enhanced services, and that it's the responsibility of local governments to establish 911 centres. Those who live outside the service area of a 911 centre must dial a seven- or 10-digit phone number for emergency services. Francescutti said he worries that the average Canadian believes emergency services in our country are far more reliable than they are. ""When you call 911 they answer, '911, what's your emergency?' The real emergency is we don't have a 911 system that works the way it should.""    ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/next-generation-911-crtc-1.3937434,[],N/A

And mosquitoes. And Winnipeg. But mostly change.  Heck, Regina only just started filling in a vacant condo hole in our downtown after wondering what could possibly fix the problem for almost 10 years. (It was dirt.) And now, the plump Gainer we knew and embraced has crawled back down his (equally oversized) gopher hole.  Sure, new Gainer's manic grin makes him look like if Chewbacca was trying to sell you on a pyramid scheme, but he also looks familiar to me.  He's the face of the new, younger Saskatchewan. His forced smile is the same one people my age give during the seventh round of a job interview for a temporary gig with no benefits.  His new kicks are the most expensive thing he owns.  He's skinny now because all he eats is KD and vape juice.  He probably can't even afford cable to watch football.  Face it: the new Gainer is a millennial.  The old Gainer had his time. Those inky, pupil-less eyes of years past didn't need to focus on anything in particular because high oil prices almost guaranteed him an upper-management position by 30. And you know the old Gainer doesn't know how to put his phone on silent, even though he's been shown 100 times by younger, patient gophers. The thing is, Saskatchewan's refusal to move on is a defining feature. That stubbornness is why we once got into a fight with Norway because their moose statue is taller, more handsome and chews with its mouth closed. It's why every first-born child in the province is named Brad Wall or IPSCO. It's why our strip clubs are legally only allowed to show workplace-safety seminars.  Sure, we can have some fun and point out the new Gainer looks like the Pokemon version of Steve Buscemi, but the truth hits closer to the heart. People want the old Gainer back because it's bittersweet and maybe a little scary to see something you love change.  But this new Gainer is still our Gainer … even if he looks like a Vancouver hipster who pays for $12 coffees with bitcoin.

145,Philip Drost,2019-12-10T13:19:27.813Z,New affordable housing units approved by Fredericton council,"Seven new affordable housing units received final approval at Monday night's Fredericton city council meeting. Jason LeJeune, Housing First project coordinator for the United Way, said the new units will help the homeless population in the city.  ""They are people that aren't housing ready. They aren't ready for private sector housing, or even subsidized housing on a lot of levels,"" said LeJeune. ""This is purpose built to serve that community, where we take them where they're at. There are no barriers. We take them into housing and then wrap the services around them.""  The new units will be located at 156 Jaffrey St. on the city's north side, and 590 Albert St., on the south side. The four units on Jaffrey Street will be owned and run by Smythe Street Church, while Christ Church Cathedral will own and run the three units on Albert Street. LeJeune said profits will go to the United Way to continue helping Fredericton's homeless population. The units will be single occupant, one bedroom apartments, and tenants will pay 30 per cent of their income. The John Howard Society already runs four similar units in the city.  Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien said the city had to step outside its comfort zone to help make the affordable units possible. O'Brien said homelessness doesn't fall under municipal jurisdiction, but the city wanted to find a way to help. ""Legislatively, municipalities don't have any funding or legislative authority to do healthcare, education or social services,"" said O'Brien. ""But to just sit back and say, 'We're just waiting for the provincial government to solve everything. They only have limited time and people."" The city had small parcels of land, which it supplied for the affordable units. At Monday night's meeting, council also approved another motion for staff to examine its bylaws around single resident occupancy units. This will make it easier to develop affordable housing.  ""This doesn't solve homelessness, but it shows you can be as caring and compassionate as possible to address the situation,"" O'Brien said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-affordable-housing-1.5390318,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/affordable-housing-fredericton-1.4945232 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-homeless-volunteers-tents-needs-1.5290908 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-homeless-population-rising-1.5256345,N/A
146,Anonymous,2020-01-17T22:58:29.082Z,"Trump responds to Iran's supreme leader, says he should be 'very careful with his words'","U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be very careful about what he says after Khamenei harshly criticized the United States in a Friday prayers sermon in Tehran. ""The so-called 'Supreme Leader' of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!"" Khamenei struck a defiant tone in his first Friday sermon in Tehran in eight years, calling Trump a ""clown"" who only pretends to support the Iranian people but will ""push a poisonous dagger"" into their backs. Khamenei said the mass funerals for Iran's top general, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike earlier this month, show the Iranian people support the Islamic Republic despite its recent trials. He said the ""cowardly"" killing of Qassem Soleimani had taken out the most effective commander in the battle against ISIS. In response, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting U.S. troops in Iraq, without causing serious injuries. Khamenei said the strike had dealt a ""blow to America's image"" as a superpower. In part of the sermon delivered in Arabic, he said the ""real punishment"" would be in forcing the U.S. to withdraw from the Middle East. As Iran's Revolutionary Guard braced for an American counterattack that never came, it mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport, killing all 176 passengers, including 57 Canadians and dozens of others bound for Canada. Authorities concealed their role in the tragedy for three days, initially blaming the crash on a technical problem. Their admission of responsibility triggered days of street protests, which security forces dispersed with live ammunition and tear gas. Khamenei called the shootdown of the plane a ""bitter accident"" that saddened Iran as much as it made its enemies happy. He said Iran's enemies had seized on the crash to question the Islamic Republic, the Revolutionary Guard and the armed forces. He also lashed out at Western countries, saying they are too weak to ""bring Iranians to their knees."" He said Britain, France and Germany, which this week triggered a dispute mechanism to try to bring Iran back into compliance with the unravelling 2015 nuclear agreement, were ""contemptible"" governments and ""servants"" of the United States. He said Iran was willing to negotiate, but not with the United States. Khamenei has held the country's top office since 1989 and has the final say on all major decisions. The 80-year-old leader openly wept at the funeral of Soleimani and vowed ""harsh retaliation"" against the United States. Thousands of people attended the Friday prayers, occasionally interrupting his speech by chanting ""God is greatest"" and ""Death to America."" Tensions between Iran and the United States have steadily escalated since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which had imposed restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The U.S. has since imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, including its vital oil and gas industry, pushing the country into an economic crisis that has ignited several waves of sporadic, leaderless protests. Trump has openly encouraged the protesters — even tweeting in Farsi — hoping that the protests and the sanctions will bring about fundamental change in a longtime adversary. After Soleimani was killed, Iran announced it would no longer be bound by the limitations in the nuclear agreement. European countries that have been trying to salvage the deal responded earlier this week by invoking a dispute mechanism that could result in even more sanctions. Khamenei was always skeptical of the nuclear agreement, arguing the United States could not be trusted. But he allowed President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, to conclude the agreement with President Barack Obama. Since Trump's withdrawal, he has repeatedly said there can be no negotiations with the United States. Khamenei last delivered a Friday sermon in February 2012, when he called Israel a ""cancerous tumour"" and vowed to support anyone confronting it. He also warned against any U.S. strikes on Iran over its nuclear program, saying the U.S. would be damaged ""10 times over.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-oman-meeting-1.5430504 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-uranium-enrichmant-nuclear-deal-1.5428896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-justice-crash-ukranian-arrests-1.5426809,N/A
147,Anonymous,2020-01-20T21:06:05.947Z,Lawyer argues detective hired by Sandeson's defence team was a 'traitor',"A lawyer for convicted killer William Sandeson has argued that a detective hired by the defence before the murder trial but who later talked to police was a ""traitor"" and that the judge did not address the issue fairly. Dalhousie student Taylor Samson, 22, was killed in August 2015 in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. He is appealing that conviction. A hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway Monday morning in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer Ian Smith asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes liveblogged from court: He focused much of his arguments on the issue of retired RCMP Sgt. Bruce Webb, who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment.  Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until in the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe.  The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Josh Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of the detective's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. He said Arnold failed to ask himself whether Canadians would be shocked to learn a member of the defence became a ""state agent"" in the midst of an investigation. ""The defence had a traitor of the defence team... [Sandeson] was betrayed by someone with a duty to him,"" Smith told the three-member Appeal Court panel. ""It was incumbent on the trial judge to consider all the factors."" Had police sought legal advice, Smith said they likely would have been told not to accept Webb's information. He argued it was a violation of the police's oath of office. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb.  She pointed out that the name ""Bruce"" was referred to throughout the statements from the two witnesses ⁠— which were in the hands of the defence before the trial ⁠— and that it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone that he was involved. ""We see the connection that should have made this absolutely apparent to [Sandeson's lawyer],"" she said. ""It's all over this that he was involved. ""You know what the easiest thing to do is here, you call up and the Crown and say, 'Who's Bruce?'"" She said the trial judge was in the best position to determine if there was a miscarriage and whether a mistrial was warranted. But Justice David Farrar, a member of the Appeal Court panel, suggested Monday police had an obligation to defence to tell them what Webb had done. ""How can our system ever survive if we allow police to subvert the interest of justice?"" he said. MacLellan noted Arnold found that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. She agreed with those findings. She also said Webb feared he could be charged with obstruction of justice if he failed to reveal to investigators that two Crown witnesses had lied in their earlier police statements. Smith said another ground for appeal is that investigators conducted the search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant, claiming there were ""exigent circumstances"" which justified their actions. Police said that at the time of the search, they were worried Samson was being held hostage as part of a drug deal gone bad. But Smith argued there was no evidence Samson had been in the apartment and that the search was not lawful. ""They had only a hunch that Samson was present,"" he said. ""The search of the home is a serious invasion of privacy."" Smith said after the initial search, police returned to the apartment to turn off a DVR Sandeson had been using as part of a surveillance system, fearing its contents could be erased remotely. Smith argued there was no evidence to suggest that could happen, and there was no reasonable basis for returning to the apartment a second time. Smith claimed Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officer's aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. He noted Sandeson is repeatedly referred to as a ""monster."" Sandeson said very little during the interrogations and asked for a lawyer, he said. Smith also argued the finding of first-degree murder was unreasonable. He said the Crown's theory that he planned the killing is possible, but so are the theories that he was simply planning a drug deal or a robbery. ""There's also strong evidence that there was no plan,"" said Smith, noting Sandeson identified his apartment in text messages and had items in his apartment that would identify him. Two days have been set aside for the appeal hearing. MacLellan is expected to continuing making arguments on Tuesday. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-appeal-hearing-taylor-samson-1.5163626 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/former-mayor-queens-northern-pulp-1.5431434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/children-in-care-policy-review-community-services-1.5432535 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493,N/A

The Calgary Police Service's child abuse unit began investigating on Tuesday after police received multiple tips from the public about the video that appears to show a woman slapping and biting a toddler. Calgary police investigate Twitch video that shows woman slap, bite child while playing Fortnite It shows a woman playing the video game Fortnite as she repeatedly slaps and then bites a screaming toddler, seemingly frustrated with the child for distracting her from the game. The video then cuts to a few hours later, showing her roughly handling an infant before throwing the child onto the bed she's sitting on. The user's Twitch account, which the CBC is not naming to protect the identity of the children, appears to have been deleted, but a copy of the video was posted to Twitter on Monday.  ""It's very shocking, it's very concerning,"" said Staff Sgt. Peter Siegenthaler, with the child abuse unit. ""We see more and more of these videos surface.… It's hard, because sometimes these videos have been circulated for years and it's hard to determine the origin and time these videos are produced."" Siegenthaler said tips about the video came in from as far away as California, and within two hours of viewing it, police were able to track the online persona to a Calgary residence, where officers found a woman, man and two children. The woman was arrested and the children were taken to a safe location. The 31-year-old woman has been charged with one count of assault for her conduct against the younger child. She is set to appear in court on Jan. 17, 2020. Her name will not be released to protect the identity of the children. The timestamp on the video during the encounter with the toddler shows more than four hours had elapsed since the user began playing, and then during the encounter with the infant more than seven hours had elapsed.  A spokesperson for Twitch confirmed in an email the user's account has been suspended. The spokesperson said the company would not provide further comment. The Twitter user who recorded and posted the clip confirmed to CBC News that he reported the incident to Crime Stoppers.  ""This investigation is continuing because there are other videos out there,"" Siegenthaler said. CBC News has viewed multiple Twitch videos from an account identified as belonging to the woman's husband. They show a man berating the two children in a loud voice while using profanities, and ignoring screams and cries of children while gaming. Siegenthaler said he could not confirm if charges are pending against the husband and said police only became aware of the husband's videos Wednesday morning. But he did say there is a ""good likelihood"" further charges will be laid. In a Twitch video posted Sunday on the husband's account, two women can be heard talking in the background while the man plays Fortnite. ""They're gonna think I've abused him, though,"" one woman says. ""Oh, my goodness, what did he do?"" the other woman asks. ""He was climbing up in the closet,"" the first woman says. Approximately six hours and 45 minutes into that video, a child can be heard loudly crying and whining in the background as a woman repeatedly says, ""Go to sleep."" In another video, the man steps away from the game briefly, visibly annoyed by the sound of a screaming child. ""Can you f--king stop. It's not f--king torture ... great now I'm gonna f--king die,"" he says, placing the screaming child on his lap, and, ignoring the child, returning to his game.  CBC News reached out to both the woman and her husband and has yet to receive a response. Siegenthaler said police rely on tips from the public in cases like this.  ""If you come across one of those videos, pick up the phone, let us know,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-fortnite-video-charges-1.5400971,[],N/A
149,Anonymous,2019-12-19T12:59:02.173Z,Former Quebec premier Jean Charest considering run for Conservative leadership,"Jean Charest is thinking about running to replace Andrew Scheer as federal Conservative Party leader, according to sources close to the former Quebec premier. Those sources told Radio-Canada, CBC's French language service, that Charest is consulting with his family. Charest hadn't seriously considered a leadership run until several caucus members and former MPs reached out and urged him to do so, according to sources. The sources said Charest is being drawn toward the leadership race by his focus on a number of issues facing the country right now, including national unity, the environment and Canada's place on the international stage. Charest served as a minister in Brian Mulroney's cabinet and later served as leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives when they were down to just two seats in the 1990s. He left the federal scene in 1998 to join the Quebec Liberal Party, eventually serving as premier between 2003 and 2012. If Charest does formally enter the ring, he'd be a controversial candidate. For years now, Quebec's anti-corruption squad, known as UPAC, has been investigating the Quebec Liberal Party's financing during the Charest period. Sources told Radio-Canada Charest is aware of the pall that investigation could cast over his candidacy, but maintains he did nothing wrong. The next step in the leadership contest is for the Conservative Party's National Council to form a leadership election organizing committee, which will decide on the rules, procedures, process and timelines for the contest.

The pill was Orkambi, a medication designed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients with a specific mutation. Patients like Verleg call it life-changing, but B.C. and other provinces don't cover its hefty cost: about $250,000 per patient per year or $170.54 per pill. Since Verleg's extended health plan also ruled it too expensive in January, she says her lung function has become ""unstable,"" and she spends half her days on IV antibiotics. Now, she is one of two lead plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit against the federal minister of health and others for $60 million in damages for denying the coverage. The suit alleges that failing to cover a ""medically necessary treatment"" is a violation of the charter rights of cystic fibrosis patients with the mutation and hopes to change how Canada handles rare diseases. Orkambi is approved by Health Canada, but it's up to individual provinces what they pay for under provincial health plans, and they take guidance from a federal drug review body called the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health. B.C. decided in March 2017 not to cover Orkambi, saying it was ""not cost-effective,"" given the high price tag and what the government characterized as a ""modest improvement in lung function."" CADTH's earlier review made the same call, noting that while two double-blind randomized controlled trials had shown ""statistically significant absolute improvements"" in lung function, the magnitude of improvement was of ""uncertain clinical significance."" In a statement, the B.C. Ministry of Health said it won't comment on the lawsuit, but said there is ""insufficient evidence"" to pay the drug's high cost and defended the decision. ""This process ensures that important drug listing decisions are based on evidence-based, clinical analysis involving patient groups and are not the result of political lobbying,"" said the statement. The lawsuit disputes those rulings, saying the medication is medically necessary for the approximately 200 patients in B.C. who have that type of cystic fibrosis. The second lead plaintiff, Lilia Zaharieva of Victoria, B.C., says Orkambi stopped years of steep decline that had her heading for a lung transplant. ""In the year before I took Orkambi, I could hardly walk between my classes without feeling short of breath,"" said the 31-year-old, who now has access to the drug from the company on compassionate grounds. The Toronto lawyer spearheading the case, who himself has cystic fibrosis with a different rare mutation, says Canada's drug evaluation system isn't fair to people suffering from rare diseases, where markets are small and large clinical trials are hard to come by. ""The system doesn't work for rare conditions,"" said Chris MacLeod of Cambridge LLP. ""Lives are on the line."" ""We all agree it's too much money. No one wants to defend a high-priced drug. Therefore, you sit down at a table and negotiate."" Beyond financial relief, the suit asks for a more ""transparent, objective and evidence-based system"" for drug approval in Canada, and for B.C. to negotiate with the drug manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Cambridge LLP is taking on the case on a contingency basis, with neither firm nor plaintiffs getting money from Vertex, said MacLeod. MacLeod said they chose B.C. — though all provinces ""are in the same boat"" — because of successful charter challenges here in the past, including on medically-assisted death. CADTH is currently re-reviewing Orkambi, after the manufacturer submitted new evidence that the B.C. government said it recommended be considered. The federal minister of health declined to comment.

151,Anonymous,2019-12-17T20:00:03.844Z,"France on strike: Power cuts, school closures, Eiffel Tower closed","French union activists cut electricity to nearly 100,000 homes or offices, Eiffel Tower staff walked off the job and Paris opera workers joined in Tuesday's nationwide protests across France, singing an aria of anger as workers rallied against the government's plan to raise the retirement age to 64. Despite 13 days of crippling train and subway strikes, French President Emmanuel Macron and his government stayed firm. The prime minister declared his ""total"" determination to reshape a pension system that unions celebrate as a model for the rest of the world but that he calls unfair and destined to collapse into debt. Lighting red flares and marching beneath a blanket of multi-coloured union flags, thousands of workers snaked through French cities from Brittany on the Atlantic to the Pyrenees in the south. Hospital workers in scrubs, Air France staff in uniforms, lawyers wearing long black robes — people from across the French workforce joined in the strikes and protests in higher numbers than the last cross-sector walkout last week. The retirement reform that has brought them together is just one of their many gripes against Macron, a business-friendly centrist they fear is dismantling France's costly but oft-envied welfare state. Workers from the hard-left CGT union on Tuesday carried out what they called ""targeted"" blackouts on electricity networks around Lyon and Bordeaux to call attention to their grievances, and their power. Several European countries have raised the retirement age or cut pensions in recent years to keep up with lengthening life expectancy and slowing economic growth. Macron argues that France needs to do the same. Tourists cancelled plans and Paris commuters took hours to get to work Tuesday, as train drivers kept up their strike against changes to a system that allows them and other workers under special pension regimes to retire as early as their 50s. ""Monument Closed"" read a sign on the glass wall circling the base of the Eiffel Tower, which was shut for the second time since the strike — one of the most protracted France has seen in years — started Dec. 5. ""It's very frustrating for us, unfortunately,"" South African tourist Victor Hellberg said, gazing up at the 19th century landmark. ""We had decided to be here for one day and that's life I suppose."" Victor Garcia, visiting from Barcelona, said he's used to protests at home but admitted not climbing the Eiffel Tower's steps ""is kind of a bummer."" Police in Paris barricaded the presidential Elysee Palace, bracing for violence by yellow vest activists or other radical demonstrators. Across the French capital, union leaders demanded that Macron drop the retirement reform. ""They should open their eyes,"" Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT union, said at the head of the Paris march. With riot police watching closely, protesters carrying humorous signs and colourful costumes marched past the historic Bastille plaza. On the steps of the opera house overlooking the monument, workers sang famous arias and played instruments to defend their special retirement plan. Bernard Buffet, a costume fitter, is 63 and retiring in April after 35 years at the Bastille Opera, but is protesting in solidarity with younger colleagues. ""The government is stuck on the reform. They are very arrogant,"" he said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe confirmed new negotiations with unions starting Wednesday, but showed no sign of backing down. ""Democratic opposition, union opposition is perfectly legitimate,"" he told lawmakers. ""But we clearly laid out our plans. And on this plan, the creation of a universal retirement system, my determination ... is total."" He also paid tribute to ""the French who go to work despite difficulties."" In addition to transportation troubles, parents faced shuttered schools and students had key exams cancelled Tuesday as teachers joined in the strike. Hospitals requisitioned workers to ensure key services Tuesday, as nurses, doctors and pharmacists went on strike to save a once-vaunted public hospital system that's struggling after years of cost cuts. Tuesday's protests upped the pressure on Macron, whose key architect of his pension overhaul had to resign Monday over alleged conflicts of interest. Unions fear people will have to work longer for lower pensions, and polls suggest at least of half of French people still support the strike. Unions at the SNCF rail authority want to keep the strike going through the Christmas holidays. While patience was running short among Paris Metro riders squeezing into scarce trains , the strike troubles weren't enough to scare away some visitors to the City of Light. Spanish tourist Lydia Marcos, finding the Eiffel Tower unexpectedly closed, shrugged it off and said, ""It's like an excuse to come here another year.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-strike-1.5399580,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-pensions-strike-1.5392670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/paris-pension-strikes-traffic-1.5389742,N/A
152,Anonymous,2019-11-10T09:00:00.161Z,Fury FC fans dismayed after club comes to 'crushing halt',"Some Ottawa Fury FC fans say the club's announcement to suspend operations for 2020 is ""gut-wrenching,"" while others say the news left them unsurprised. The club is blaming ""politics"" by soccer's governing bodies for not meeting a sanction deadline, which was required for the team to continue to play in the U.S.-based United Soccer League. Fan Aaron Hooper said Friday's news was the ""worst-case scenario."" ""It's sad that this day actually came,"" said Hooper, who stopped by TD Place to purchase a Fury hat from the merchandise shop. ""That was one of my fears last year when they were going through the sanction debacle ... that if they didn't join the Canadian Premier League, maybe one of the steps would be them folding."" The Canadian Premier League kicked off in April and, ahead of its launch, questions arose about whether the Fury would be forced to join the new league or be allowed to remain in the U.S.-dominated USL. The Fury, who are owned by the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group (OSEG), ended up getting permission to remain in the USL for the 2019 season, as was their preference. For some fans, the writing has been on the wall ever since.  ""For me personally, at this point, I'd like to see a different organization try their hands on a soccer team, because [OSEG] made a lot of mistakes over the past years,"" said Jon Eden, a member of Fury fan group Stony Monday Riot. ""It's very disappointing but somewhat predictable."" Eden said the Fury's departure will leave a ""big void"" in the lives of local soccer fans. ""I'm sad, because I really enjoy going to live soccer games,"" he said. CONCACAF, one of FIFA's six governing bodies, said on the weekend it was disappointed and surprised by the team's announcement. ""There is a clearly defined process outlined in CONCACAF and FIFA rules for sanctioning clubs to compete in leagues in foreign territories,"" a statement from the organization said. ""We have recently been working through an incomplete application for Ottawa Fury to compete in the United Soccer League in 2020. We will not comment on the details of that application and given today's announcement we now consider the matter closed."" The news wasn't a sure thing for all fans, however: Eric Beevis said Friday's announcement ""blindsided"" him. ""[The announcement] is gut-wrenching,"" said Beevis, adding he ""proudly"" wore an Ottawa Fury jersey to work Friday. ""Since [Thursday], when the first echoes started floating about on social media, I still haven't been able to wrap my head around this."" He said when the Fury's season wrapped up a few weeks ago, he felt a sense of ""momentum."" ""The feeling I got from that last game was that things were picking up,"" Beevis said. ""I was looking forward to building off of that ... and it just comes to a crushing halt."" Some fans point to the Canadian Premier League as a source of hope, as a team from Ottawa would play against clubs from other Canadian cities and more exciting rivalries could be developed. That would be ""easy marketing,"" said Hooper. ""I think one day we're going to see, whether it's at TD Place or another stadium ... a team that this city backs behind,"" he said.

153,Jason Warick,2019-11-20T12:00:00.542Z,"Drop in new car registrations in Sask. may suggest changing attitudes toward vehicle ownership, experts say","Fewer people are registering new vehicles in Saskatchewan, according to data from Statistics Canada released this week. While the province's recent economic downturn might be the obvious culprit, Saskatoon CarShare Co-operative board member Dave Palibroda suggests it may also be due to changing attitudes about car ownership. ""It used to be you had to get a car. You turn 16, the most important thing is to get your licence and get a car and drive. It felt like freedom,"" he said. ""But now it seems as though owning a vehicle is more of a burden in certain situations."" Back in 2014, Saskatchewan drivers registered more than 59,102 new vehicles, according to a Statistics Canada report released Monday. That number dropped steadily in the following four years, hitting 52,382 registrations last year — an 11 per cent drop from 2014. The province's population grew by about 50,000 over that period, according to provincial government data. Palibroda and University of Saskatchewan planning professor Bob Patrick agree the province's economic downturn is likely the biggest cause. But they say alternatives are also improving, making car ownership less of a necessity than it has been in the past. While some need vehicles for work or long commutes, car sharing, cycling, walking and public transit are options for growing numbers of people. Patrick, who is the chair of the U of S regional and urban planning program, says policy makers should take note of that. ""Here's a chance to use this as an opportunity to further push transit, push urban design and push good land-use planning."" One category of vehicle registrations was up in Saskatchewan, though, according to the Statistics Canada data. More people are registering electric and hybrid vehicles. The numbers are still small — those vehicles still account for well under one per cent of the total number registered in the province. But registrations for battery electric vehicles grew from just eight in 2014 to 45 in 2018. Plug-in hybrid registrations saw a similar increase, going from 11 to 43. Hybrid electric vehicle registrations, meanwhile, have fluctuated, according to Statistics Canada. There were 214 hybrid electric vehicles registered in 2014, but fewer than 200 registrations in each of the following three years. The number climbed back up to 229 last year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sask-new-car-registrations-down-1.5365234,[],N/A
154,Anonymous,2019-12-20T01:06:56.513Z,Family friend aims to raise $50K to help former Roughrider George Reed deal with mobility issues,"Age has caught up with George Reed — the Saskatchewan Roughriders' all-time rushing yards leader — and now a family friend is looking to ease the pressure on Reed's body and mind. Eric Johnson said he has noticed Reed's mobility deteriorate as the Rider great, now 80, got older. In the last five years, Johnson said, Reed has had an ankle replacement and multiple back surgeries. ""I see how painful it is for him to get around and to walk and how hard it is for him to get around,"" Johnson said on Thursday. Johnson talked with Reed and his family — Reed's wife, Angie, and daughter, Georgette — about potentially setting up a campaign on the online fundraising site GoFundMe, after Reed said he would like a knee brace and additional physiotherapy treatments — if money was no barrier. Reed lost muscle in his left leg after the back surgeries and his knee locks up on him sometimes, Johnson explained. The walker Reed uses is also ""worn out and beat up."" ""This will be one way to help improve his quality of life. He loves to be out in the public.… He loves the game of football,"" Johnson said. The GoFundMe campaign, titled ""The Great George Reed #34 Needs Our Help!"" was launched on Dec. 6. As of Thursday, it had already raised more than $16,000 of its $50,000 goal. Johnson has been a friend of the Reeds for years, as they have been regular patrons of his Regina restaurant, Smokin' Okies BBQ. During that time, their relationship developed and they became close.  ""He loves to come here and sit, and have a visit and have a beer — and we want him to keep coming … and keep getting out."" Reed played 13 seasons for the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He won the league's most outstanding player award in 1965 and is considered one of the greatest CFL runnning backs to ever play the game. At the time of his retirement in 1975, he had amassed the most rushing yards in CFL history. Reed finished his career with 16,116 rushing yards — then a CFL record — and 134 rushing touchdowns. His yardage record was surpassed in 2004 by Mike Pringle, but remains second all-time in the league.

155,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-04T14:05:48.876Z,'It's unprecedented': What is behind Australia's devastating fires?,"Australia continues to burn after more than a month of raging bushfires, and it doesn't appear the smoke-filled skies will be clearing any time soon. As of Friday, more than five million hectares have burned, 19 people have died and 21 people are missing. Tens of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes. More than eight million more were under an emergency order. While Australia is no stranger to bushfires, this one has captured the world's attention. Images of burnt-out cars, people fleeing homes, a parched koala desperately drinking from a cyclist's water bottle and angry townspeople screaming at Prime Minister Scott Morrison for more action are making global headlines. And there's a good reason for the attention. ""In my experience of doing this fire monitoring, in some places you see intense fires over quite large areas maybe for a week or a few weeks, but to see them for four months in one particular place … it is quite surprising,"" said Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ""We only have 17 years of [CO2 emissions] data,"" said Parrington, who works in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Development Section at ECMWF analyzing wildfire emissions, among other sources. ""But in that context then, yeah, absolutely, it's unprecedented."" Australia has been experiencing warmer, drier conditions lately — a result in part to something called a Positive Indian Ocean Dipole, a phenomenon similar to El Niño.  As a result of westerly winds in the equatorial region weakening, warm water from the deep ocean shifts towards Africa from the Indian Ocean and cool water rises up in the east. For Australia, this temperature difference means drier and hotter weather for much of the continent.  However, that's not the only factor. The country has been experiencing long-term drought conditions, even when there isn't a positive dipole. In Eastern Australia, which includes New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria where the fires are the worst, rainfall has been the lowest on record. New South Wales alone has been the driest on record with rainfall 36 per cent below the 1961–1990 average, according to Australia's weather and climate agency.  The Murray-Darling Basin that stretches from Queensland southwest to South Australia, has experienced the driest 34 months on record, compared to other 34-month records starting in January. Victoria, where a state of disaster was declared, has also had its driest 34 months on record.  The fear is that the fingerprints of climate change are all over this. Like the rest of the world, Australia is dealing with the consequences of a warming planet. Since 1910, the average temperature for the country has warmed by 1 C. Preliminary data from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), suggests that in 2019 the annual temperature in that country was 1.52 C above average. (The official report is set to be released on Jan. 9.)  If the data holds, it will blow out the record high set in 2013 when the annual temperature was 1.33 C above average. ""The duration, frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased across large parts of Australia since 1950,"" the Australian government reported. ""There has been an increase in extreme fire weather, and a longer fire season, across large parts of Australia since the 1970s."" Renowned climatologist Michael Mann, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Penn State University, was in Australia during the fires. In a recent opinion piece in the Guardian, he described ""smoke-filled valleys"" and ""brown haze.""  ""What is happening in Australia is a harbinger for other countries — a taste of what our future will look like if we don't act now,"" Mann told CBC News. Of particular concern to him is the planned Adani coal mine in Queensland (also known as the Carmichael mine) that would be one of the biggest in the world. And that mine could release more than 4.49 gigatonnes annually of CO2 — the leading contributor to the climate crisis. The carbon dioxide emissions would be among the ""highest in the world for any individual project,"" according to a 2011 joint report to the Land Court of Queensland. Parrington recalls one of Australia's worst fires, known as Black Saturday, which in 2009 killed 173 people in Victoria, injured 414 and killed more than a million animals, both wild and domesticated. The human death toll pales in comparison thus far, but Parrington says the peak of the fires lasted just a few days. ""But the fact that this has been going on for several weeks, is really concerning, particularly as a lot of [fires] are occurring upwind of large population centres,"" he said. It's particularly the scale of the current fires and number of people impacted, including those in New Zealand, where smoke from the fires has drifted, that concerns him. And that smoke can produce toxic chemicals like benzene and hydrogen cyanide, Parrington said.  Then there's the effect on glaciers. The reflectivity of an object is referred to as the albedo. In the case of ice, its white surface reflects solar radiation, and it stays cool. But if the ice darkens for some reason — say, if black soot falls on it — that warms it up. ""Once it gets into the upper troposphere [lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere], it can get picked up by the jet stream there and be transported thousands more kilometres,"" Parrington said. ""If there is transport to Antarctica … any deposition of soot or black carbon to the ice would mean a change to the albedo and potential acceleration of the melting, local to where that deposition took place."" Already, the Australian fires have changed the albedo on glaciers in New Zealand. And the world's glaciers are already threatened with climate change.  So, is this a sign of things to come? ""What the future holds is much worse in the absence of concerted action on climate,"" Mann said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canadians-australia-fires-1.5406295 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/australia-bushfire-1.5403850,N/A
156,Mike Crawley,2020-01-20T14:00:17.452Z,Why the Ford government isn't stopping teachers' strikes with back-to-work legislation just yet,"More than one million students across Ontario face a day of cancelled school in the coming week because of teachers' strikes, but the government of Premier Doug Ford is not using legislation to stop the walkouts — at least not yet.  Legislating teachers back to work is ""the last step,"" Ford said this week when he took questions from reporters at Queen's Park. ""What we really want to do is get a deal.""  How much labour disruption would it take for the government to legislate an end to the strikes? When I asked Education Minister Stephen Lecce, he said that's not his focus right now, and said negotiated agreements are the ""best option for all the parties.""   What neither Progressive Conservative politician mentioned: imposing back-to-work legislation now would not likely stand up in court. To defend such legislation, the government must persuade a court that its actions have a ""pressing and substantial purpose."" That's the legal test established by the Supreme Court of Canada to justify violating the right to free collective bargaining enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A day of school lost here and there to rotating strikes almost certainly doesn't meet that bar, according to legal experts.  ""There's a difference between a pressing and substantial purpose and an inconvenience to the public,"" said Kevin Banks, director of Queen's University's Centre for Law in the Contemporary Workplace.  ""If the government's reasons [for back-to-work legislation] have to do with inconvenience, then it may well be too early,"" Banks said in an interview. ""If things get to the point where the school year is in jeopardy, I suspect that there's a good chance a court would say, 'Yes, that is a pressing and substantial purpose.'""  This is one of the key reasons why Ontario teachers unions are strategically choosing to hold one-day strikes. They fear a full-blown indefinite walkout would soon prompt the government to reach for the hammer of back-to-work legislation. The unions figure these short, rotating work stoppages are their best bet to dissuade the government from making such a move, or to win a legal battle if it comes to that.  Most recently in post-secondary education, it took weeks of strikes rather than days before previous Ontario governments resorted to legislation.  The 2018 strike at York University lasted two months before Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government introduced a back-to-work bill. It died when Queen's Park was dissolved for the election campaign, then the new Ford government moved to end the strike with its first piece of legislation.  In 2017, a faculty strike closed the province's 24 colleges, cancelling courses for hundreds of thousands of students for five weeks before the Wynne government legislated an end to the dispute. That back-to-work bill might not have withstood a legal challenge had the government brought it in sooner, Minister of Advanced Education Deb Matthews told reporters at the time.  ""You have to have a very, very good rationale, that the academic year [must be] in jeopardy,"" Matthews said, explaining that the Supreme Court set a ""very high bar.""  In the 1990s in Ontario, it typically took about five weeks into an education strike before an arm's-length body called the Education Relations Commission ruled that a labour dispute was putting the school year in jeopardy, giving the government the political go-ahead for back-to-work legislation. Mike Harris's Progressive Conservative government pre-empted that process in 1998, moving to legislate when some 200,000 students in eight boards had been out of class because of labour disputes for just two weeks at the beginning of the school year.   In 1997, the Harris government tried to use the courts to stop a province-wide strike just as it began.  A judge declined to give the province the emergency injunction it sought. A two-week strike ensued, ending when teachers returned to work voluntarily.  If the Ford government eventually chooses back-to-work legislation, it faces another key strategic decision: how to determine the terms of the contract? Does the government impose a contract or send the dispute to binding arbitration?   An arbitrator might give the teachers a contract that exceeds what the government wants to spend, either in a wage increase or class size provisions, issues at the centre of the current round of stalled negotiations.  An imposed contract would itself undoubtedly face a legal challenge. The government would again have to prove it is  meeting that legal test of a ""pressing and substantial purpose"" to justify violating the right to free collective bargaining.  Its likely argument: the province is in a serious fiscal imbalance and can't afford to give the teachers what they're asking for.  ""I'm not entirely sure that that argument would fly, but it's at least a plausible argument,"" said Banks.  It's an argument that will be put to the test in an upcoming legal challenge against the government's three-year cap on public sector wage increases at one per cent annually. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/etfo-public-teachers-strike-1.5427368 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-oecta-1.5425273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-teachers-unions-update-1.5429134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-french-teacher-work-to-rule-1.5428910,N/A
157,Mike Crawley,2019-11-06T20:16:25.507Z,Doug Ford's budget update will promise to 'build Ontario together',"Premier Doug Ford's beleaguered government will try to turn the page on its rocky past year Wednesday with a budget update that is expected to aim for a sunnier tone.  Finance Minister Rod Phillips delivers Ontario's fall economic statement in the afternoon and will announce a lower deficit for the 2019-20 fiscal year than the $10.3 billion shortfall projected in the spring budget. You can watch Phillips deliver the statement around 3:15 p.m. ET in the video below.  That budget was tabled in April by Phillips's predecessor Vic Fedeli, who was demoted from the finance portfolio barely two months later.  Last year's fall economic statement marked the beginning of the cuts that have characterized Ford's government and contributed to his slide in the polls. The PCs scrapped the province's environmental commissioner and French language services watchdog.  This year's version ""will not be full of cuts,"" a senior government official told CBC News on Tuesday. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the overall approach of Wednesday's budget update will be ""slow and steady, showing that we know what we're doing, that there's a steady hand at the wheel.""  A former insider who maintains close ties to the government believes the statement will form part of a shift in emphasis from Ford's PCs.  ""What I expect is this new, pragmatic, moderate approach we're seeing from Premier Ford and his government is going to be cemented in law with the fall economic statement,"" said David Tarrant, a vice president of the public relations firm Enterprise Canada. Tarrant, who was Ford's strategic communications director until May, helped craft the PCs' 2018 campaign platform, and previously worked for Stephen Harper when he was prime minister. He anticipates the budget update will send a new message to groups that ""have felt like they were at odds with this government."" That message: ""If you're prepared to work co-operatively with the government, the government's actually prepared to move on some of the positions it has taken in the past and find common ground,"" said Tarrant. ""Hopefully some of these groups actually will take up the offer.""  Ford and his behind-the-scenes team are trying to portray the government as setting a new tone since the premier emerged from his self-imposed exile during the federal election campaign and the Legislature resumed from its longer-than-usual adjournment. The government has also walked back some of its cuts.  The change ""is about more than just decorum in the Legislature; this is about pursuing a policy agenda that's actually about building Ontario together,"" said Tarrant.  At a news conference Monday, Ford hinted at the theme of the budget update, standing behind a podium labelled ""Building Ontario Together.""  The phrase is strikingly similar to the title of the previous Liberal government's 2015 budget: ""Building Ontario Up.""   Although Ontario's steady run of economic growth began well before Ford took office in June of last year, he's happy to take credit.  ""The economic success we have achieved so far is absolutely incredible,"" said Ford in question period Tuesday. ""Our province is absolutely booming right now. We haven't seen unemployment numbers like this, so low, in decades, because we've created the environment for companies to thrive and prosper and grow within this province.""  NDP Leader Andrea Horwath is unconvinced that Ford's PCs are truly charting a new path.  ""The tone makes no difference whatsoever. It's the pain that everyday families are feeling with the cuts that this government's been implementing,"" Horwath said in an interview Tuesday.  Horwath said this is still the same government that tried to portray its spring budget (entitled ""Protecting What Matters Most"") as progressive and generous.  ""It took a couple days for people to look at the fine print to realize that in fact it was exactly the opposite,"" she said. ""It was a heavily devastating budget when it came to cuts.""    ""While there's an effort to change the tone, the song remains the same,"" said John Fraser, the Liberal interim leader, in a news conference Tuesday.  ""The premier's cut-first, think-later approach to governing just doesn't work,"" said Green Leader Mike Schreiner on Tuesday. ""We'll see if they back off on some of the cuts that are directed at the most vulnerable.""  What's most unclear is how the budget update will deal with two key pressure points facing the Ford government in its two biggest-spending ministries, health and education. The latest figures show Ontario's hallway-healthcare problem is not getting any better, as the province heads into flu season, which is always an added strain on hospitals.  Contract talks with Ontario's two biggest teachers unions are at an impasse and the government could be facing province-wide teacher strikes later this month. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-fall-economic-statement-setup-1.5348260,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-ontario-economy-fall-economic-statement-preview-1.5342644 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-ontario-legislature-resumes-1.5333187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-deficit-update-1.5282527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rod-phillips-new-ontario-finance-minister-no-change-fiscal-priorities-communication-1.5187574,N/A
158,Janet Davison,2020-01-14T18:29:34.081Z,Why a 'curious interest' and questions of money loom over Harry and Meghan coming to Canada,"Prince Harry and Meghan clearly want to come to Canada — and senior members of the Royal Family gave their wish their blessing at their Sandringham summit on Monday. But how Canadians feel about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spending part of their time here as they step back from their senior roles in the Royal Family is more nuanced. ""I'd say there's a curious interest to some degree as to how this will unfold, that certainly Harry and Meghan's enthusiasm about Canada is well-received,"" said Carolyn Harris, a longtime royal observer and Toronto-based author and historian. ""There are many who have commented that Harry and Meghan — as Harry is unlikely to succeed to the throne — should be able to live life on their own terms, provided they will be indeed be financially independent."" While some Canadians may welcome Harry and Meghan, others may feel great indifference. ""People who support the Crown, most of them will think this is nice,"" said John Fraser, author of The Secret of the Crown: Canada's Affair with Royalty, and founding president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada. ""The idea of members of the Royal Family actually having some domicile in a Commonwealth country, to me, is wonderful. It suggests the possibility — especially if the Queen goes along with the idea — that Harry and Meghan can be special Commonwealth ambassadors or supporters."" Others who are often less interested in the Crown, he suggests, will ""think they are leeches on the body politic."" But whatever interest there is among Canadians could be tempered by one very tricky topic: money. ""I think any support for Harry and Meghan would be negatively affected if the couple were seen as making use of public funds in Canada for their security while they live a private life,"" Harris said.Chenoa Paccagnan, of Invermere, B.C., echoed a similar sentiment. ""I love my royals, but I am not interested in paying for long-term security or maintenance if they choose to spend increased time in Canada,"" Paccagnan wrote in an email to CBC's Royal Fascinator newsletter over the weekend. Others looked at the financial aspects differently. Bill Kostiuk, of Alliston, Ont., said it would be ""an honour and a privilege"" to have Harry and Meghan living in Canada. ""They do so much for charitable organizations and they seem to inspire the younger generation in a very positive way,"" he said in an email to the Fascinator. ""Thousands of immigrants come into Canada and no one questions who's going to pay for what and what they will do for income. I wish people could get off the gossip train and let this couple and their young child try to have a life together without all the finger-pointing."" WATCH: Expert Robert Lacey says Harry and Meghan might follow the Obamas' example managing their finances: Harry and Meghan's seismic announcement last week that they wanted to step back included mention that they want to become financially independent. And in a statement Monday, Queen Elizabeth said Harry and Meghan ""have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives."" But what exactly that means remains unclear. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Monday the federal government hasn't decided if Ottawa would help cover security costs associated with a move to Canada by the sixth in line to the throne and his wife. Watch: Harry and Meghan should expect a 'stampede' of offers There's little doubt security for such a high-profile couple will carry a hefty price tag. ""The question of security is a serious issue,"" said Fraser. ""Whether they are here or anywhere, they are major public figures who need protection,"" he said. ""At the moment, unless something is being worked out with the Canadian government, they don't have any official status here other than the respect there is — and also the lack of respect — for members of the Royal Family."" A statement from Her Majesty The Queen. <a href=""https://t.co/IVSyfeojqk"">https://t.co/IVSyfeojqk</a> Fraser said the cost for security would probably have to be covered privately. ""I don't think it should be a Canadian government cost,"" he said. Christine Richardson, of Uxbridge, Ont., said in an email to The Royal Fascinator that she can understand why Harry and Meghan may want to step back, but feels ""very strongly they can't have their cake and eat it, too."" ""Independence means what it says, and from a financial perspective, it should not cost Canadians anything (i.e. for security) if they live here part-time. Also, they should have to pay income tax relating to money made in Canada, just like the rest of us."" Taxation poses significant unknowns around Harry and Meghan's plans, and would depend on numerous issues. ""If Harry spends enough time in Canada to become classed a Canadian resident, then he would start to become liable to Canadian taxes,"" Craig Prescott, director of the Centre for Parliament and Public Law at the University of Winchester in southern England, said via email. ""With Meghan, she is still a U.S. citizen and so is liable to U.S. taxation on her worldwide income (as U.S. taxation operates on citizenship rather than residency — only Eritrea and Myanmar do the same). There are reliefs and exemptions to this, but they appear to be relatively limited."" Under U.K. tax rules, Prescott said, if overseas tax is paid on overseas income, then you can claim relief to avoid being taxed twice. WATCH | U.K. PM Boris Johnson says he's a 'massive fan' of the Royal Family: ""How this operates will depend on any double tax treaty between the U.K. and that country. The U.K. has a double tax treaty with the U.S. and Canada,"" he said. While much remains unknown about how Harry and Meghan's part-time residency will unfold, Fraser said a lot of that will be answered ""just by them taking up residence here of some sort, whatever it is."" The only people he can see being really upset by the move are the British tabloids that ""love either praising them or damning them."" WATCH | Canada undecided on covering Harry and Meghan's security costs: Fraser expects there will be some ""fervent following"" of Harry and Meghan for a little while. ""But I think they have a fair chance of having a more normal life over here, whatever a normal life is, a private life, than they do in the U.K.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-romance-prince-harry-meghan-markle-photos-pictures-1.5117068 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-rift-meeting-harry-william-statement-1.5424586,N/A
159,Ryan Snoddon,2020-01-15T18:19:29.863Z,"Snow, strong winds and bitterly cold temperatures on the way","A system moving through Nova Scotia Thursday and into Friday will bring some snow, strong winds and then usher in the coldest temperatures so far this season.  A few days ago, this soon-to-be-storm was looking primed to bring the province one of the biggest snowfalls of the winter. Since then, however, forecast models have shifted and shuffled further southeast with the track, keeping the significant snowfall offshore instead. Having said that, the timing of the snow will make for a slick Thursday afternoon and evening commute for the Halifax region and across much of the province. Be sure to leave yourself some extra time and space out there. The strengthening system will become a full on storm as it tracks south of the Maritimes on Thursday night. And while we aren't looking at big-time snowfall totals, the winds will be wicked across the region on Friday.  Widespread gusts of 60-80 km/h look set for mainland Nova Scotia on Friday, with the strongest along the coasts. For the Northumberland shore and Cape Breton winds look likely to reach 90-110 km/h, with onshore flurries and blowing snow for Friday and Friday night. Winds will ease from west to east across the mainland on Friday night and in Cape Breton on Saturday. Get your long johns and wooly socks ready, because those strong winds will be ushering in the coldest temperatures so far this season across the province. The Arctic air will spill in on Friday and stick around for Saturday as well. Highs on Friday will be in the -9 C to -12 C range. With those howling winds, windchill values will be well into the minus teens and -20s throughout the day. Temperatures will bottom out in the minus teens and -20s across the province on Friday night and will remain cold on Saturday, with -10 C to -13 C highs looking set for most. Friendly reminder to bring your pets inside when temperatures are this cold. Temperatures will rise dramatically on Sunday, thanks to yet another system looking set to track into the region. At this point, that system is looking likely to be another snow mixing to ice, rain and wind event.

Canadian live lobster exports to China, mostly from Nova Scotia, soared after China slapped retaliatory tariffs of 35 per cent on U.S. lobsters. U.S. lobster exports tanked while Canadian sales jumped by 123 per cent, worth a record $384 million, during the 10 months of 2019. The new trade deal does not lower those tariffs. But China has pledged to buy $32 billion worth of American agricultural products over the next two years, including lobster and other seafood products. Rahaman says the Chinese government has the clout to compel its companies to switch back to lobster from the United States. He calls it ""pseudo-capitalism."" ""They have private corporations who are heavily indebted to state-owned banks and, through that channel, China can actually direct trade and commerce,"" he said. ""I understand there is a lot of skepticism on whether they will actually follow through on the promises they have made. But if they really want to do it they can deliver on this promise."" Rahaman added: ""We're going to pay a price in terms of our seafood market access to the Chinese market."" Keith Colwell, Nova Scotia's minister of fisheries and aquaculture, said the province has nothing to fear. ""Basically, it won't make any difference for us."" ""We can sell everything we can catch. We sell top-quality products. We send it on time and their customers are very happy with it."" Global Affairs Canada said it continues to monitor the China-U.S. deal.

161,Anonymous,2020-01-16T23:38:39.795Z,"Rocky Johnson was a champion for black equality, says tag-team partner Tony Atlas","Transcript To some, he's best known as the father of wrestler-turned-movie star Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson. But to wrestling fans, Rocky Johnson was a legend all his own.  The Nova Scotia-born champion died at the age of 75, the WWE confirmed on Wednesday.  During his years in the ring, Johnson — also known as Soulman — made history as a Hall of Famer. And he did it alongside Tony Atlas. Together, the pair made up pro-wrestling's first all-black championship tag team The Soul Patrol. And Atlas says their partnership was just one of many ways Johnson broke barriers.  Here is part of his conversation with As It Happens host Carol Off.  I'm sorry for the loss of your friend.  It feels like I didn't lose a friend. It feels like I lost a brother.  I met Rocky in Florida for the first time [in 1975] ... and I wanted to fight everybody, so nobody wanted to get near me. So Rocky came and started talking to me and said, ""What's the problem?"" And I said ... ""I'm getting tired [because] every time I walk in the dressing room, somebody calls me a n----r.'"" He said, ""I had to go through all that stuff too. ... You have to stand up for yourself."" Rocky had to fight racism his whole life. You know, you watch the way that man wrestles, you look at the way he was built ... he never got the push that the Caucasian wrestler got.  [Rocky's] mother basically showed him the door when he was about 13 and he had to do it all on his own. What did he teach you? What was the most important lesson you got from Rocky?  I left home when I was 14. So we pretty much had the same type of upbringing.  Rocky was the type of guy who would stand up for himself. With me, I let it build and build and build until I can't handle it anymore and then I would explode, which got me in a lot of trouble. But Rocky, he always spoke up for himself. Sometimes he'd wrestle a guy in a main event. ... They'd give Rocky $500 and they'd give the guy that Rocky wrestled $1,500.  All he ever wanted in this business was ... equality for black wrestlers.  You and Rocky were the first all-black tag-team world champs. What was he like in the ring? Tell us a bit more about the way he wrestled — his style, his skill.  If you look at a match of Rocky Johnson and then look at a match of Dwayne Johnson, it's like you're looking at the same person. Dwayne moves like his father. He wrestles like his father. He acts like his father. He's got that same pride that his father had. So Dwayne is like a chip off the old block. He's just bigger and better looking. But other than that, he wrestles just like his dad.  Rocky was the type of guy who did his job. He never took his problems to the ring. He was very professional — very professional. Very, very fan-friendly. You only need to [ask] people that got his autograph and met him. You know, Rocky would ... hold you at that table for hours. You know, he loved his fans. He was a great guy. He was probably one of the best African-American wrestlers to ever have been in this business.  You mentioned Rocky's son Dwayne — known as The Rock — Dwayne Johnson. A movie star and a wrestler, quite extraordinary. What did Rocky think of the success that his son had?  He was very, very proud of his boy. [But] he'd never use his son's success for his own gains. You know, he went on his own merits. He'd never try to use his son to get bookings or to do anything.  Rocky's wife used to call me to help get Rocky booked. And I must have got ... at least 20 or 30 phone calls [today]. And I told my wife — just before you guys called me — I said, ""That's a damn shame. When that man was alive nobody paid him any attention. They ignored him."" It's a shame.  Is there any particular memory of him ... some image — some moment you cherish — that you'll remember?  What I cherish about Rocky Johnson is that he stood up for himself as a man. And that was [unthinkable] in the '60s and the '70s for a black man to stand up for himself. So, if you could take Mohammed Ali and Martin Luther King and put them together, you've got Rocky Johnson.  Written by Chloe Shantz-Hilkes. Interview with Tony Atlas produced by Kevin Robertson.

162,Anonymous,2013-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,"My Selfie, Myself","Can a selfie reveal something more about ourselves than just vanity? One researcher says yes. For many of us, the word ""selfie"" probably conjures up a poorly-lit image of a teenage girl pouting at a camera. This week, Oxford Dictionaries named selfie The International Word of the Year. It's based on how much use of the term increased over last year. And the term, like the practice itself, is ubiquitous. From celebrities to your pals on Facebook to Pope Francis, the selfie is everywhere. Even on this box of Girl Guide cookies we bought this week:  Although we may think of selfies as a contemporary trend, this form of self-portraiture has a history dating back to ""the dawn of photography,"" says Aimee Morrison. Morrison is an Associate Professor of English Language and Literature at Waterloo University (https://uwaterloo.ca/). Recently, she has delved into the history of the selfie, in the broader context of historical photographic portraiture. This week on Spark, we ask Morrison about her findings. The selfie, she says, is a mode of expression that has long served as a way for people to ""craft narratives about themselves."" And while selfies may be considered vain or frivolous, they arise from a natural fascination that ""all human beings"" have with their own images. Selfies, then and now Selfies may have been around for a while, but the ways we share them have changed, Morrison says. While photographic self-portraits were at one time mainly for personal use, taking a selfie has now become an inherently social activity. Morrison views the selfie as a way for us to engage with others online. The majority of today's selfies are taken on cellphones, using apps like Instagram, which creates ""a kind of baked in sharing"" element. Further, by sharing these images of ourselves with our networks, they become a sort of ""stand in"" for our physical selves - even if we can't be somewhere, our images can. ""Now you can choose how you want to represent yourself."" Selfies can also be empowering for their subject, says Morrison. She argues that there are few situations where we control how we are portrayed in an image. Morrison uses the example of the school portrait, where we are told exactly how to pose. The selfie provides an alternative way for us to compose the image we'd like to project. ""Now you can choose how you want to represent yourself. You become a producer of images of yourself, instead of one who is passively photographed and represented by others."" But if we can choose the images that we project, why do all selfies seem to look the same? ""People base their practices both on what they see their peer group doing, and also what they see in the media,"" says Morrison. And, if those images are homogeneous, our selfies will be too.

163,Mike Rudyk,2019-04-24T17:41:15.271Z,New high-altitude rescue helicopter ready to save lives in Yukon,"Performing air rescues on Mount Logan — Canada's highest peak — is never easy.  But a Whitehorse company has a new aircraft that could make such high-altitude rescues safer. Horizon Helicopters' new Airbus AS350-B3e is based at its Whitehorse hangar. It's there to assist in mountain rescues in Kluane National Park. ""This is just going to give us as the pilots, and the parks people, and the people who are rescued ... more power at those altitudes, which can make it safer for everybody,"" said Cole Hodinski, operations manager and chief pilot for Horizon Helicopters. Last year, Quebec mountain climber Monique Richard was the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Logan in a solo trek, but she was forced to call for help on her descent. Horizon Helicopters was part of the team that successfully executed the high-altitude rescue, at about 5,500 metres, using an older model Airbus AS-350. The company's new helicopter is certified for altitudes higher than 7,000 metres — or more than 1,000 metres higher than the summit of Mount Logan. ""A number of years ago, Airbus did a record-setting landing on top of [Mount] Everest, just to give you an idea of how high they have taken it,"" said Hodinski. The peak of Everest is about 8,848 metres. ""This particular machine, compared to the one that landed on Everest, has more horsepower and a number of other [modifications] that help improve the performance at altitude,"" said Hodinski. Horizon Helicopters isn't the only company in Yukon with helicopters that can do mountain rescues, but according to Airbus, the AS350-B3e is a newer model with more power and other modifications to help it better perform at high altitude. Hodinski says the helicopter has sophisticated computers that adjust the flow of oxygen according to the altitude, for the pilot and passengers. Specialized software helps keep the craft level in high mountain winds. The craft also has a rescue Helicopter External Transport System (HETS), and enough horsepower to safely lift a person at high elevations, using a long line. Most helicopters don't have the power to climb in the lower-density air found at higher altitudes. Pilots have to constantly calculate air pressure and temperature, and in some cases do it while wearing an oxygen mask. ""The biggest challenge from Mount Logan is the weather and the remoteness. It feels like being on the moon,"" said Hodinski. ""It's big, it's a long way away, and it is a really, really large mountain. It makes you feel really insignificant and small."" He says the new lightweight helicopter has features that allow it to almost defy gravity, including a fast fin on the tail boom. That's a new technological performance modification on the aircraft. ""If you look at the tail boom, you can definitely see the bulge on this side. The idea of this fast fin is, it uses the 'Coanda effect,' which in layman terms, it turns it into a wing."" That means less power is needed at the craft's tail rotor and more power can be used for the main rotor, especially in cross winds and for heavy lifting. The machine will be used for training with pilots in Kluane National Park this week. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/high-altitude-rescue-helicopter-yukon-kluane-1.5108365,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/richard-mount-logan-rescue-1.4690895,N/A

167,Mark Ting,2020-01-12T17:00:00.634Z,High returns or recession: What does 2020 have in store for your money?,"It's that time of year when investment analysts break out their crystal balls and issue predictions for what the upcoming year will bring for financial markets. This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy — conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.  Forecast: No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains. U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.   Forecast: Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019. Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared — markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.  Forecast: Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities. Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring, I believe that other international factors such as U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a good time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments that are more defensive. As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio. Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions. Forecast: Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets. Overall, I'm expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and I believe that stocks will outperform bonds. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

168,David Thurton ,2018-10-23T12:30:00.795Z,"Proposed oilsands mine poses 'high mortality risk' to bison and birds, Environment Canada says","Environment and Climate Change Canada raised a litany of concerns with Teck Resources's proposed Frontier Oilsands mine during the last week of hearings.  Environment Canada was among several federal government departments that presented on Monday during the public hearing for the mega oilsands project.  Frontier is a $20.6-billion mega mine that's undergoing public hearings in Fort McMurray before a joint review panel established by the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.  Frontier, which was first proposed as a four-phase project in 2011, would be built in two phases of 170,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) and 90,000 bpd with a planned mine life of 41 years. The mine's lease area, 110 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, covers 292 square kilometres. Environment Canada joined the region's First Nations in raising concerns about the impact of the mine on the health of the Ronald Lake Bison herd. The herd's current range overlaps with the Frontier lease area.   Susanne Forbrich, a regional director and the team lead for Environment Canada at the hearing, told the panel there is concern the mine would cause significant habitat loss for the wood bison herd.  Forbrich warned a loss of habitat would result in the depletion of the herd and facilitate disease transmission, as seen in other herds in Alberta.  ""It is Environment and Climate Change Canada's view that the project represents a high risk to the Ronald Lake herd,"" Forbrich told the panel. ""And that some of Teck's mitigation measures are potentially uncertain or ineffective.""  Forbrich also raised concerns that the mine would kill migratory birds that breed in Wood Buffalo National Park.  Frontier represents a ""high mortality risk"" particularly for whooping cranes — one of North America's rarest birds — and other migratory species, said Forbrich.  Environment Canada fears the mine would create more tailings ponds, which the cranes could mistake for a lake despite bird deterrent efforts, she said.  ""This conclusion is based on evidence that whooping cranes land near the proposed mine, that whooping cranes have landed at existing oilsands mines and at tailings ponds despite the availability of bird deterrent systems,"" Forbrich told the panel.  Environment Canada submitted a list of recommendations for bison, whooping cranes and other wildlife the proposed mine would impact.  When it comes to bison it's calling for Teck to fund independent studies to understand the impact of the mine on the bison.  For whooping cranes, it called for the reduction of the size of tailings ponds and for the use of mitigation measures such as drones to patrol the area, and to fund studies into cumulative effects of the oilsands on migratory birds.  In documents filed with the joint panel Teck said it disagrees the Frontier Mine would pose a significant risk to the bison or migratory birds. But the mining company has agreed to fund studies to monitor bison and bird health and the effect of its mitigation measures.   Teck, First Nations and other groups are scheduled to cross examine Environment Canada and other federal agencies on Tuesday and over the next three days — the last week of the public hearings before closing statements.  Connect with David Thurton, CBC's Fort McMurray correspondent, on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or email him at david.thurton@cbc.ca ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/environment-canada-teck-frontier-mine-1.4873973,[],N/A
169,Robson Fletcher,2016-10-10T18:59:42.086Z,The new two solitudes: 'Alberta and the rest of Canada',"This story was originally published Oct. 3. Sumara Diaz was laid off in February, and she counts herself among the lucky ones. It was the first layoff of her 17-year career in Alberta's oil and gas sector, and she's well aware that many of her colleagues have been through the experience multiple times.  She's spent the last eight months hunting for jobs, networking and trying to stay positive. She doesn't expect much from others — she finds it hard to ask for help — but she says a little support from the rest of the country for the tens of thousands of other Albertans like her would be nice. ""Alberta has always been the strong province that has helped the other provinces,"" Diaz said. ""You would hope people would think the same way: 'OK, now it's our turn to help Alberta.' But the mentality out there is: 'Well, you guys have made all this money. You're in oil and gas. What goes around comes around.' And I've heard that from people. I've heard that from people I know."" And she's far from alone in that sentiment. In a countrywide survey of Canadians' attitudes conducted by the Angus Reid Institute in partnership with CBC, Albertans stood out in their responses to questions about national belonging. More so than people in virtually any other province, Albertans said they feel disrespected, ripped off and generally mistreated by the rest of Canada. Survey respondents were asked if they agree with the following statements:   A total of ​735 Albertans were surveyed as part of the national survey. A probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Click on the interactive tabs below to see the responses by province: Shachi Kurl, executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, said the survey results reveal a growing rift between Alberta and the rest of the country. ""Albertans are aggrieved. They're anxious. And they're really feeling left out of what Canada is supposed to be,"" she said. The title of Hugh MacLennan's 1945 novel Two Solitudes has served for decades as a reference to the divide between Canada's anglophones and francophones, but Kurl sees a new schism in our country's culture. ""That has really shifted westward,"" she said. ""If you think about those two solitudes today, it really is between Alberta and the rest of Canada."" Darren Sartison feels that sense of isolation every time he thinks about getting Alberta oil to tidewater. As president of Groundswell, an information technology consultancy based in Calgary, he doesn't work directly in oil and gas, but the sector accounted for 50 per cent of his total business at its peak. Now, it's down to about 20 per cent, as his cash-strapped clients increasingly look to offshore firms in India for their IT needs. Like many Albertans, Sartison sees new pipelines as key to improving the fortunes of the oil and gas industry, and thereby those of the province. He said he's routinely baffled, however, by the opposition from other Canadians, who seem more willing to accept oil imported from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela than to pump it in from Alberta. ""It's very frustrating, because [new pipelines] would help everybody out,"" he said.  ""Why can't they see one plus one equals two? It's just such an obvious equation here. Why are they not putting it together?""  Mark Salkeld, president of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, took his frustration a step further when he asked the federal government earlier this year, via a written budget submission, to tie have-not provinces' equalization payments to their acceptance of pipelines.     Once the story made the news, Salkeld said, he was inundated with hate mail, but he stands by the tactic. He described it as an attempt to shake Canadians out of an accidental or wilful ignorance about what drives their economy — as well as their home appliances. He, too, sees pipelines to tidewater as critical to Alberta's future, so oil producers can sell to markets outside the United States, which is rapidly transitioning from their biggest customer to one of their biggest competitors. ​""It's very, very frustrating,"" Salkeld said of Canadian pipeline opposition. ""There's a real strong sense of parochialism in this country and it's getting tiring. It's about 'not in my backyard' or 'I want a piece of the action,' when this is a national issue."" Despite his frustration, Salkeld doesn't believe most Canadians are anti-oil. He just thinks they take their energy for granted and a ""vocal minority"" drives the most strident opposition. And he may be on to something. The national poll found a ""seismic shift"" in Canadians' opinions on energy versus the environment compared with a decade ago, with 68 per cent now saying they see Alberta's oil industry as ""an overall asset because of its contribution to the Canadian economy."" A majority of respondents in every single province agreed with that assessment, as opposed to saying the oil industry is ""an overall liability because of the environmental risk."" Even in Quebec, where pipeline opposition is strongest, 55 per cent of respondents described the oil industry, in general, as an overall asset to Canada. If that offers any comfort to Albertans, it comes at a time when they could really use it. While most Albertans still feel secure about their own futures, there is a growing unease about what's looming for the province as a whole. ""In Alberta today, people are far less optimistic about the future of their province and the future of their country, relative to people in other provinces,"" said Kurl. ""They're very worried about the next generation, which is a theme you see across the country, but it is pronounced in Alberta."" Survey respondents were asked if they were optimistic or pessimistic about: Click on the interactive tabs below to see the responses by province:​ Despite a job hunt stretching into its ninth month, Diaz still counts herself among the dwindling group of optimistic Albertans. She believes the worst will soon be behind the province, and companies that have cut to the bone will soon need to start hiring again to maintain their operations, and hopefully start new ones. But some support from the rest of Canada could help speed things along, she noted, particularly when it comes to getting pipelines built. ""This is boom-and-bust industry; we all know it. The boom is great, but when we're in a bust we have to work together to get back out,"" she said. ""When it gets better, we're going to be there to help them, like we always have. So, right now, we need the same help."" The Angus Reid Institute conducted an online survey Sept. 6-12, 2016, among a representative, randomized sample of 3,904 Canadian adults who are members of the Angus Reid Forum. The sample plan included large oversamples in certain cities and regions, including which were then weighted down to provide a national snapshot. For comparison purposes only, a probability sample of this size would carry a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

170,Anonymous,2020-01-20T03:32:45.008Z,'The Meghan effect is real': How the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could find success as influencers,"As Prince Harry and Meghan Markle embark on a post-royal life, the Duchess' star power could prove lucrative for the couple. ""The Meghan effect is real,"" said Mae Karwowski, the CEO of New York City-based influencer marketing agency Obviously. ""Whenever she does go out in public and is seen wearing a specific pocketbook or a pair of jeans or a blazer, it could sell out immediately."" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced earlier this month on their Sussex Royal Instagram account that they would step back from their roles as ""senior members"" of the Royal Family, and work toward becoming ""financially independent"" through ""professional income"" — a move prohibited under royal protocol. At the same time, the pair pushed readers to a website bearing the couple's trademarked brand name.  But the moniker was thrown into question over the weekend when it was announced that both Harry and Megan will no longer be working members of the Royal Family, will stop using their His/Her Royal Highness titles and receive no taxpayer money for royal duties. On Sunday, with the status of the couple's royal branding up in the air, marketing experts weighed in on what the future holds for Harry and Meghan's public persona on Cross Country Checkup. ""What they've kind of chucked, as they are making this exodus, is ties to the royal family brand and the heritage,"" said Cele Otnes, the author of Royal Fever: The British Monarchy in Consumer Culture. How they move forward may depend on Meghan's expertise as a brand influencer. Before becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan was known for both her turn in the TV series Suits and a lifestyle website called The Tig. Shuttered in 2018, the blog was a space for Meghan to feature favourite brands.  ""She definitely knows what she's doing,"" Karwowski said. Now, with nearly 11 million followers, the Sussex Royal Instagram account could be Harry and Meghan's key to future financial success, she suggests. ""If they did want to become influencers, and really utilize this Instagram account and utilize that media presence that they have, they could monetize this in a very significant way."" Every day influencers — those without royal genes — who have a similar follower count, can make more than $100,000 for a single Instagram post, according to Karwowski. With official brand ambassador status — deals that would have Harry and Meghan appear in ad campaigns and at public events — the payout would be ""much wider,"" Karwowski said. While it remains to be seen how the loss of their royal designation will shape the Duke and Duchess' brand, Otnes says Harry and Meghan need to consider the image they want the world to see. ""They have to think very clearly about what are the components of Harry and Meghan — and of Harry and Meghan as a couple — that they need to retain in order for this not to go down in flames,"" the University of Illinois professor said. She suggests that the couple hire a brand consultant to help determine exactly what products, services and experiences they might offer. ""If I may offer the couple a little bit of unsolicited advice, they seem to be most powerful when they leverage their humane side,"" Otnes said. Influencer marketing expert Karwowski says that a ""number"" of brands have already reached out to her agency asking about whether or not the royal couple was looking to partner with new companies. She believes that Harry and Meghan will only be working with high-brow clients — ones focused on sustainability, quality and ""heritage brands"".

171,Carmen Merrifield,2020-01-07T13:08:57.461Z,What's changed to protect women since Harvey Weinstein's accusers went public?: 'Everything … and nothing',"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. In October 2017, the New York Times published accounts by several women accusing film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, sparking a worldwide response and fuelling the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment in the workplace. So what has changed since then? ""The confounding thing about the last two years is that everything has changed and nothing has changed,"" says New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor, in a recent interview with The National co-host Adrienne Arsenault. ""I think there's a lot of compassion for what women and others have faced over the years in the workplace and beyond. On the other hand, when we look at the fundamental system, when we look at laws and rules, when we look at a woman who is serving burgers for 10 bucks an hour in a restaurant, it's very hard to say that much has changed in the last two years."" Weinstein is to stand trial on charges of rape, sexual assault and predatory assault, with jury selection scheduled to start today. He denies any allegations of non-consensual sex. While there has been a shift in social attitudes as well as a renewed appreciation of what sexual harassment is and why it has to be prevented, the two New York Times journalists who first broke the story say the judicial system does not reflect that shift. In their recent book She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement, Kantor and fellow journalist Megan Twohey point to one particular area where they say change is needed most: Weinstein's ""secret settlements"" with women. These non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were at the core of their news coverage, they say, and were arguably the enablers in the Harvey Weinstein saga. ""In the case of alleged predators like Harvey Weinstein, he would do one of these secret settlements and then go on to allegedly harm many other women,"" says Twohey. ""So I think now we're finally starting to have a public debate and conversation about who really benefits, and whether or not these secret settlements have in fact allowed enablers to continue to prey."" In the course of their reporting, Kantor and Twohey say they were able to identify at least eight secret settlements that Harvey Weinstein paid to women who had come forward accusing him of sexual harassment and sexual assault, during a period spanning 1990 through 2015. In effect, they say, paying women in exchange for silence.  ""So when we came knocking on the doors of these women who had been victims of alleged sexual assaults and sexual harassment, they were legally prohibited from talking to us,"" says Twohey. ""Slowly but surely we were able to identify, to unearth those settlements, and start to document them in ways that helped illuminate this tool that he had to use to cover his tracks."" In some American states, such as New Jersey and California, there are limits on the use of NDAs in cases of sexual harassment and assault. But in Canada there is no legislation or clarity in this area, and no guidance from law societies about when NDAs should be used. Roxanne Davis, an employment lawyer based in Calgary, has represented victims and acted as an impartial investigator in cases involving sexual harassment allegations. Given the lack of legislation in Canada, she says, some courts have had to go their own way interpreting NDAs in sexual harassment cases, so that complainants can speak out after accepting settlements. ""In this current environment, it would be useful to have a broader discussion in Canada about whether, from a policy perspective, it is appropriate to enforce NDAs in sexual harassment cases, so courts have some guidance in that area,"" Davis says. Meanwhile, the U.K. has seen some change around NDAs. Last year, the Solicitors Regulation Authority published a warning to lawyers handling these types of agreements. It now says NDAs cannot be used to discourage victims from reporting sexual misconduct to authorities. More changes may come to the U.K., in part because of a lobbying effort by a woman who ultimately refused to be silenced by Harvey Weinstein: his former assistant Zelda Perkins. She spoke with CBC's The National about her experience working with the now disgraced mogul, and gave a harrowing account of how she agreed to one of his secret settlements.  CBC News asked representatives for Harvey Weinstein for his response to these allegations. They replied via email that, ""Neither Mr. Weinstein, nor his representatives will be making any comments on these matters. I hope you can remain objective."" Through the 1990s, Perkins worked as Weinstein's assistant at his Miramax office in London.  Perkins is now opening up about those days and what she says was daily harassment working for Weinstein. Perkins described one occasion when she says Weinstein asked her to take notes as he spoke in his hotel bathroom. ""I agreed that I would sit in the bathroom whilst he was in the sauna, so I couldn't see him, and take notes. And he went in there, and within a couple of minutes he said this isn't working and came out naked, and said 'I'm going to have a bath.'"" Perkins says she tried to leave the room, but he insisted she stay to continue their work. ""He said 'I'm just going to be in the bath, don't be so prissy.' And it sounds ridiculous, particularly now that we are talking about it. But at the time that felt like a pretty safe compromise."" However, by 1998 Perkins says she had reached her breaking point. At that time, Perkins was working with a young assistant, Rowena Chiu. While at the Venice Film Festival, both worked with Weinstein; Perkins took the day shift and Chiu was assigned the later shift. Perkins says she advised the younger Chiu how best to deal with Weinstein's inappropriate behaviour. On the second night in Venice, Chiu told CBC's The National in a recent interview, their work began as it had the previous evening, discussing scripts. However, she says Weinstein also engaged in flattery about her degree in English literature from Oxford, along with asking personal questions. ""He asked me about my boyfriend. He asked me how long we'd been together, and whether he was my first boyfriend, and so on,"" Chiu says. She says Weinstein removed his clothing. ""He asked if I could give him a massage. We had been working mostly on the bed in the sense I was half sitting on the bed and the scripts were spread out on the bed. He had taken his clothes off so he was naked, and so he requested a massage from me, which I was reluctant to give him."" Chiu alleges Weinstein asked her to take off some layers of her own clothing, saying it was warm in the hotel room and she would feel more comfortable. ""And so in that way it's almost an insidious, gradual path towards, you know, asking for more and more overt sexual favours. And so from there it led to him pinning me against the bed and and asking for just one thrust, and saying just one thrust and will all be over. It was pretty terrifying."" Chiu says she managed to pull herself away from Weinstein and out of the room. ""She told me the next day that he'd attempted to rape her,"" Perkins says. ""So I went and confronted Harvey."" The women returned to London and sought legal help, and were told by their lawyers that their only option was an agreement. Perkins says what followed were long, ""intimidating"" sessions in the offices of Weinstein's lawyers Allen & Overy, the leading law firm in London. Perkins recounts how she and her young assistant had to attend two 12-hour negotiating sessions with their lawyers and Weinstein's, one ending at 5 a.m.  ""We weren't allowed pen and paper. We were escorted to the loo,"" Perkins says. As for the agreement itself, she says it contained highly restrictive clauses, including ones that applied to any mental health counselling the two young women might seek in the future. ""We could talk to a therapist as long as the therapist signed their own confidentiality agreement. And if they broke the confidentiality agreement, we were the ones who Miramax would come after for breach of contract."" Perkins says that at her insistence, the NDA included conditions about Weinstein's future conduct, including that he receive therapy, but it's not clear whether they were met. Perkins says a sum of £250,000 in financial compensation was also part of the agreement, to be divided between the two women. She contends it was the ""morality"" of the agreement and the legal process that she found the most horrifying part of her ordeal. ""We had six or seven very reputable lawyers in that room. Every single person in that room did not say that there was anything wrong with our signing that agreement. That agreement was unethical and egregious on every level … to me that is far more disturbing than Harvey's behaviour. ""Harvey is just a weak man. There are thousands of weak men and women who abuse their positions of power and that will always be the case … Now, if you're sitting in a room and you have these erudite lawyers and you have two 23- and 24-year-old girls, and they're telling you that this is how the law works, then for me the world was over, the world was over."" On the day the non-disclosure agreement was signed, Perkins and Chiu left the law offices and shared a taxi home. Chiu describes how they made a pact not to speak to one another. ""I think it was a clear sense that we wouldn't remain in each other's lives, because we talked about how difficult it was not to refer to this period of our lives,"" Chiu says. ""And I think it would have just been odd to continue. What were we to do, meet socially and make chit-chat and pretend that this had never happened? It had been such a difficult and defining and traumatic event."" Almost 20 years later, the New York Times contacted Zelda Perkins and Rowena Chiu. Both decided it was time to end their silence and break their non-disclosure agreement with Weinstein.   Journalist Megan Twohey says she believes Perkins and Chiu took a great risk in speaking out. ""It is a serious risk to break a settlement. These settlements are structured in a way so that if somebody does in fact break them, if somebody does speak out and tell the truth about what's happened, Weinstein is in a position to come after her not just for the money that was paid out at the time, but often for financial damages on top of that,"" says Twohey. Perkins has since found her voice, giving testimony in the U.K. last year to a parliamentary inquiry into workplace sexual harassment. Perkins spoke to MPs about what she sees as the misuse of NDAs to cover up sexual misconduct and crimes in the work environment. Still, the effect of the agreement on Perkins — who was forbidden to speak to anyone, including family and friends — was intense. She says it seemed safer to remove herself entirely from a life in London. ""I left the country, I moved to Central America, lived in Guatemala for five years. So I was away from family and friends. I couldn't really work in the industry anymore. I was afraid, because I couldn't explain to anybody what had happened."" Chiu says it was the enforced silence that weighed heaviest on her life. ""It was not something I was ever able to get away from. I found it an impossible burden to bear, really. And it came to a point where I tried to kill myself a couple of times. And I really felt I was never going to get away from the secret."" New York Times journalist Kantor concedes these secret settlements can offer an alleged victim momentary peace, some financial compensation to move on with their life, and an opportunity to keep their privacy. But there's also a danger. ""The problem is only visible when you look at these collectively, when you say is this really our best tool, what has this masked over the years, what has it enabled over the years,"" says Kantor. ""I think part of what we're beginning to see is that there's a distinction between privacy and secrecy,"" she adds. ""A lot of victims we've talked to, they do want to keep their privacy. But they don't necessarily want secrecy, in the sense that they want how much to tell, what to tell, to be under their control. They don't necessarily want to sign a document that says 'I'm giving up the right to talk about my own personal experiences.'""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5416145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-post-invu-1.5397491 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/non-disclosure-agreements-sexual-harassment-weinstein-1.4462694,N/A
172,Brooklyn Currie,2020-01-18T10:00:00.418Z,This N.S. man's family lost everything in a house fire. Here's what he learned,"Brian Verboom and his family had only been out of their Stewiacke, N.S., home for a few minutes when they got word from a family member on vacation in Texas that the Verboom's house was on fire. The family member said a friend had texted her a photo of the burning home. ""That's social media for you,"" said Verboom. The family had been out running errands and by the time the Verbooms made the seven-minute drive back to the house on July 25, 2018, one end of it was completely engulfed in flames. Investigators determined the cause was electrical, Verboom said. He said the hardest thing to lose in the fire was the family photos of Verboom, his wife, Rae-Lee, and their five children. ""Our youngest daughter, most of hers are online that we can get back. But our older daughters, most of those pictures were physical pictures in photo albums,"" Verboom said. After the fire, the couple spent almost 40 hours a week for an entire month making a detailed inventory of their possessions — including their age, how much was paid for them and current value — and going back and forth with their insurance company. ""[It] is the most time-consuming, physically, emotionally, and mentally draining thing you have to do,"" he said. Through his loss, Verboom's hoping to help other families in a similar situation put their lives back together. He wrote an informal nine-page guide called ""What we learned from a total loss fire,"" which he shared on Facebook. One of his pieces of advice is for people to catalogue their possessions. The list isn't just for large items like furniture and appliances — it's clothes, shoes, books, even things like coat hangers and toiletries. A year and a half after the fire, Verboom said he's still remembering things he forgot to list. ""Every little thing adds up, especially if you have to go and replace it all at once,"" he said. ""You just never think of it when you do it through the years."" Verboom suggests keeping all receipts and doing a walk-through video tour of your home every six months, to prove the condition of things like cabinets and furniture, and help jog your memory as you're making a complete inventory of everything you've ever owned. This is in line with what the Insurance Brokers Association of Nova Scotia suggests you do to protect your belongings, whether it's from fire, theft or other damage. Gina McFetridge, a spokesperson for IBANS, said a ""small minority"" of people actually do it. ""No one would disagree that it's a great idea, but the second you finish putting that policy in place, you go home ... and it all falls to the back-burner. You forget about it,"" she said. ""We're not preparing for disaster every day."" Verboom said it's important to be meticulous about listing your possessions and to know just how much it would cost to rebuild your home. He recommends bringing in a contractor to have them quote you. ""We were way off,"" he said, noting the cost to rebuild the home was about $80,000 more than the insurance policy covered. In the end, Verboom and his family bought a prefabricated home for the property instead of rebuilding. ""[It was] late fall, early winter ... it would get us into a house sooner​​​​​​,"" he said. Verboom said the thing that surprised him the most throughout the process was how many costs would come out of their total insurance payout that he hadn't considered, like demolition, food, hotels and salvage costs. Verboom said he's received a lot of positive feedback from people about the guide. ""I hope nobody has to use it ... but if anybody does, I hope it makes the situation for them easier to get through,"" he said.

173,Anonymous,2020-01-19T22:27:15.812Z,Family 'remaining hopeful' as second full day of searching ends for N.L. man,"A second full day of searching for a young Roaches Line, N.L., man who went missing as a blizzard intensified in eastern Newfoundland early Friday afternoon has ended without success. But his father, Wayne Wall, is not losing faith that his son, Josh Wall, 26, will be found alive. ""I'm remaining hopeful. It's another night that he's out there,"" Wayne told CBC News Sunday evening. Bay Roberts RCMP, the Avalon North Wolverines Search and Rescue and a CH149 Cormorant from 9 Wing Gander were all part of the search Sunday, along with an RCMP police dog. The search is expected to resume Monday, though with the added challenge of a weather forecast that shows more snow, up to 15 centimetres, followed by rain showers or drizzle in the morning. ""It is now believed that Joshua may have made it out of the wooded area, where he was walking to get to a friend's home in Marysvale, and back onto Roaches Line,"" an RCMP press release said Sunday. Roaches Line is a village in the area of Conception Bay North. ""Residents in the general area are asked to search their properties, vehicles, sheds and other outbuildings, in the event Joshua sought shelter there."" I’m with a crew searching for Josh Wall, missing since Friday, in Roaches Line, NL. <a href=""https://t.co/OMQf4wwSig"">pic.twitter.com/OMQf4wwSig</a> Glenda Power, a civilian spokesperson for the RCMP, told CBC on Sunday that attempts were made to search for Wall when he was reported missing, but the blizzard hampered those efforts.  Police received information that Wall may have taken side roads and trails, she said. A man was seen on Roaches Line yesterday, she said, but it's not been confirmed that it was Wall. The family is distraught, Power said, and concerned for Wall's safety. Anyone who has information is asked to call Bay Roberts RCMP at 709-786-2118. Darkness halted the search for Wall Saturday evening. ""I'm frantic this morning,"" his mother, Nora Wall, told CBC's Terry Roberts on Sunday. Her son has not been heard from since 1 p.m. on Friday, just as the storm was intensifying. Josh went into the woods around 12:30 p.m. on Friday, with plans to walk along a backcountry trail from his family's home on Roaches Line to visit a friend in another Conception Bay community, Marysvale. His parents said Josh has health issues and is prone to panic attacks. He messaged his location in the wilderness to his friend in Marysvale around 1 p.m. on Friday, along with a message saying he was lost and that his phone's battery was low on power, said Wayne Wall, Josh's father.  Wayne said his son was in pain Friday morning and wanted to go to the hospital, but the storm prevented them from travelling. Josh later told his parents he was going to visit a friend in Marysvale, and decided to leave on foot. Josh was wearing a heavy winter jacket and a warm hat, mittens and boots. But it's not believed he was wearing snow pants.

174,Anonymous,2020-01-20T21:06:05.947Z,Lawyer argues detective hired by Sandeson's defence team was a 'traitor',"A lawyer for convicted killer William Sandeson has argued that a detective hired by the defence before the murder trial but who later talked to police was a ""traitor"" and that the judge did not address the issue fairly. Dalhousie student Taylor Samson, 22, was killed in August 2015 in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. He is appealing that conviction. A hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway Monday morning in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer Ian Smith asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes liveblogged from court: He focused much of his arguments on the issue of retired RCMP Sgt. Bruce Webb, who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment.  Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until in the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe.  The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Josh Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of the detective's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. He said Arnold failed to ask himself whether Canadians would be shocked to learn a member of the defence became a ""state agent"" in the midst of an investigation. ""The defence had a traitor of the defence team... [Sandeson] was betrayed by someone with a duty to him,"" Smith told the three-member Appeal Court panel. ""It was incumbent on the trial judge to consider all the factors."" Had police sought legal advice, Smith said they likely would have been told not to accept Webb's information. He argued it was a violation of the police's oath of office. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb.  She pointed out that the name ""Bruce"" was referred to throughout the statements from the two witnesses ⁠— which were in the hands of the defence before the trial ⁠— and that it shouldn't have been a surprise to anyone that he was involved. ""We see the connection that should have made this absolutely apparent to [Sandeson's lawyer],"" she said. ""It's all over this that he was involved. ""You know what the easiest thing to do is here, you call up and the Crown and say, 'Who's Bruce?'"" She said the trial judge was in the best position to determine if there was a miscarriage and whether a mistrial was warranted. But Justice David Farrar, a member of the Appeal Court panel, suggested Monday police had an obligation to defence to tell them what Webb had done. ""How can our system ever survive if we allow police to subvert the interest of justice?"" he said. MacLellan noted Arnold found that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. She agreed with those findings. She also said Webb feared he could be charged with obstruction of justice if he failed to reveal to investigators that two Crown witnesses had lied in their earlier police statements. Smith said another ground for appeal is that investigators conducted the search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant, claiming there were ""exigent circumstances"" which justified their actions. Police said that at the time of the search, they were worried Samson was being held hostage as part of a drug deal gone bad. But Smith argued there was no evidence Samson had been in the apartment and that the search was not lawful. ""They had only a hunch that Samson was present,"" he said. ""The search of the home is a serious invasion of privacy."" Smith said after the initial search, police returned to the apartment to turn off a DVR Sandeson had been using as part of a surveillance system, fearing its contents could be erased remotely. Smith argued there was no evidence to suggest that could happen, and there was no reasonable basis for returning to the apartment a second time. Smith claimed Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officer's aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. He noted Sandeson is repeatedly referred to as a ""monster."" Sandeson said very little during the interrogations and asked for a lawyer, he said. Smith also argued the finding of first-degree murder was unreasonable. He said the Crown's theory that he planned the killing is possible, but so are the theories that he was simply planning a drug deal or a robbery. ""There's also strong evidence that there was no plan,"" said Smith, noting Sandeson identified his apartment in text messages and had items in his apartment that would identify him. Two days have been set aside for the appeal hearing. MacLellan is expected to continuing making arguments on Tuesday. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-appeal-hearing-taylor-samson-1.5163626 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/former-mayor-queens-northern-pulp-1.5431434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/children-in-care-policy-review-community-services-1.5432535 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493,N/A

176,Maryse Zeidler,2019-07-06T14:00:00.148Z,B.C.'s 'oldest working farm' is up for lease on Salt Spring Island,"British Columbia's ""oldest working farm"" is up for lease in the Southern Gulf Islands — but the guy who's been running it for decades hopes he'll get to stay.  Ruckle Park Heritage Farm is located in Ruckle Provincial Park on Salt Spring Island. Laura Patrick, a Salt Spring Island Trustee with the Islands Trust, says the farm and the park are a crown jewel for islanders and visitors alike.  ""It's a gem,"" Patrick said over the phone between meetings. ""It's a beautiful setting and to me it's what Salt Spring and the Gulf Islands are all about."" The farm grows fruits — mostly apples and pears — and vegetables, and has a variety of livestock. It also includes some heritage buildings that people can visit on their way to the provincial campsite.  The Ruckle family first bought the 82-hectare farm in the 1870s. Last year, when the last of them died, it was officially handed over to B.C. Parks as part of an agreement signed with the family in 1973.  The province recently issued a request for proposals for a person or corporation to operate the farm, which it calls the ""oldest working farm"" in B.C.  Mike Lane, 60, has been working on Ruckle farm since 1990, first as a farm hand helping the family out, and later leasing the farm from them to run it himself as they got older.  Lane says he feels uneasy knowing that the lease might go to someone else.  ""I'm not real comfortable with it,"" he said. ""I guess I have to complete this proposal process and wait and see what happens.""   According to documents released prior to the RFP, the province will consider allowing new activity on the farm but isn't ""entertaining significant changes to how the farm and broader park area will look and feel."" Lane says over the years he has invested a lot of time maintaining and upgrading the farm, including miles of fences he built by hand.  If he isn't the successful applicant, Lane says, he'll have to leave by the end of 2020.   ""It takes a while to liquidate this much assets of farm equipment and livestock and everything else. You can't just put your stuff in a suitcase,"" he said. If that happens, he's not sure what he'll do next. Lane says there isn't much money in farming, and anything he would have invested into retirement savings has gone into operating the farm instead.  The province wouldn't say how much interest the RFP has garnered so far, but Lane says some officials told him at least a couple of people were interested.  Trustee Laura Patrick says she doesn't think many Salt Spring Islanders are aware the farm is up for lease.  ""I really hope that B.C. parks will be open with the islanders and invite them in to share what they're doing,"" she said.   Brenda Guiled, co-founder of Friends of Ruckle Park and author of a book on the history of the area, says she hopes the province keeps the park as a place for people to connect with nature and learn about farming. The Ruckle family often invited visitors onto the farm, Guiled says, and left the farm to the province in a sense of duty to continue that work. ""It's a place where people come to visit and everyone who comes to visit here knows it and they love it,"" she said.     ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-s-oldest-working-farm-is-up-for-lease-on-salt-spring-island-1.5202219,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tomorrow-s-harvest-documentary-1.5200628 https://gem.cbc.ca/media/media/short-docs/episode-170/38e815a-011451e9a1e https://www.cbc.ca/radio/nowornever/small-towns-big-now-or-never-moments-1.4859300/british-columbia-family-left-in-limbo-after-death-of-young-farmer-1.4861327 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/this-couple-left-vancouver-to-start-a-farm-without-a-clue-how-to-do-it-1.5190997,N/A

When the Liberals took power under John Savage's leadership, Smith was assigned his first major cabinet portfolio, minister of community services. He later took over the job of minister of housing and municipal affairs. But it was during the MacLellan years that Smith got his most challenging jobs, heading the Health Department and briefly carrying on the duties of justice minister. When the Liberals lost government in 1999, Smith was named caucus chair, a position he held until he left politics in 2003. In 2000, Smith joined the medical research firm MedMira, a Halifax-based company best known for its HIV test kits.  Company CEO Hermes Chan said he and Smith travelled throughout the world marketing the kit and other MedMira products.

179,Murray Brewster,2020-01-15T18:24:47.648Z,"As Australia burns, a plan for a joint seaborne firefighting unit is getting a second look","The devastating wave of wildfires ravaging Australia has rekindled interest in an unsolicited proposal dropped on the Canadian government four years ago: a call for Canada and Australia to develop and share a couple of strategic water bomber squadrons. The pitch initially was made in a so-called green paper drafted by the Quebec-based Davie Shipyard with the support of the aerospace firm Bombardier — and was the subject of high-level meetings among senior members of the Liberal government, including one discussion with then-environment minister Catherine McKenna. The proposal — which was drafted before much of Fort McMurray, Alta., was levelled by a wildfire in 2016, and long before Australia's current crisis — was quietly shelved after the initial pitch. It landed at a time when the Davie Shipyard of Lévis, Que. was lobbying hard for work under the National Shipbuilding Strategy and caught up in the political controversy surrounding Vice-Admiral Mark Norman and a supply ship leased from the company. ""I think when we initially proposed the idea, it was too soon,"" said Spencer Fraser, chief executive officer of Federal Fleet Service, the Davie Shipyard's sister company. ""There were still people within Canada and society that were denying extreme weather events and climate change. What's important today is — look, it's real. So let's do something about it."" No one from the Liberal government was willing to comment Monday — but there was word last week that officials in two federal departments had dusted off the proposal and had asked questions of Viking Air Ltd., the B.C. company which now owns the rights to Bombardier's CL-415 water bomber. While the threat of climate change has been the focus of intense political debate in Canada, most of that debate has been about policy measures, such the federal carbon tax. Questions about how governments should respond to weather patterns already altered by climate change haven't played a large role in that debate. The proposal — which apparently was shared informally by the companies with the Australians in 2016 — calls for the construction of up to 14 state-of-the-art water bombers and a new ship (or a converted older one) to transport the aircraft between the two countries. ""Their fire season is completely at a different time of the year than ours,"" said Fraser. ""The idea would be to move strategic firefighting assets from Canada, after our fire season, down to Australia and vice versa. That way both publics — Australia and Canada — could share the costs, instead one country bearing the cost."" Provincial governments in Canada and state governments in Australia have jurisdiction over efforts to fight wildfires, through a mixture of government-owned and private assets. ""The idea is not to supplant the current businesses doing firefighting,"" Fraser said.  ""This is [meant] to have a second level, to have more assets [at the federal level] when things go really bad."" Military units in both countries have been tasked to help with wildfire outbreaks — mostly by organizing evacuations, but occasionally on the front lines of the wildfires themselves. A few dozen Canadian firefighting specialists are in Australia, but the country suffers from a chronic shortage of water bombers. Greg Mullins, the former fire commissioner of the state of New South Wales, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Jan. 3 that the country should tap into Canadian expertise and assets. ""Our prime minister should be on the phone with Justin Trudeau from Canada, right now, saying, 'Justin, we need 20 or more of your water-scooping, purpose-built water bombers that are in mothballs during your winter,'"" he said. Fraser said the companies originally involved in the pitch in 2016 studied the logistics of flying water bombers between Canada and Australia and concluded it would be complicated, even perilous, to refuel the aircraft along the way in less-than-friendly nations. Even before the current wildfire season, there was a lot of debate in Australia about buying more firefighting aircraft. Another former New South Wales deputy fire and rescue commissioner, Ken Thompson, told ABC the country needs more large aircraft that are available year-round. ""We've got real concerns about the impact that climate change is having on fire behaviour and we've got very serious concerns about the small numbers of large aircraft that are available to support firefighters and local communities,"" Thompson said on Nov. 14. The Australian High Commission in Ottawa did not respond Monday to CBC's request for comment. The original pitch that went to the Canadian government recommended a bi-national arrangement: the two countries would share an annual $145-million lease and, in return, the companies would deliver everything from aircraft and ships to crew members. Fraser said the company isn't wedded to a single approach and is open to proposals from either federal government. Dave Perry, a vice president and senior analyst with the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, said he's aware of the water bomber proposal and believes it merits study. When governments talk about strategic national assets, they often mean defence assets like fighter jets and warships. But depending upon the country, certain industries or natural resources can be considered strategic national assets as well. Perry said climate change will force federal officials to redefine what they consider to be strategically vital to Canada's interests and future survival. ""There is categorically a need to make sure we're putting additional resources into mitigating — as much as we can — the effects of climate change,"" he said. Perry was on the fence about whether a fleet of shared water bombers is a solution, but said institutions need to be thinking in those terms. ""I do not know if this is the kind of thing that's needed or not, but it's an idea and something definitely worth kicking the tires on,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/australia-wildfires-canada-waterbombers-1.5425580,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wildfire-boreal-forest-research-1.5424680 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-fire-crews-australia-front-line-teams-1.5417221 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cost-of-natural-disasters-canada-1.5416837,N/A

Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny Breen said businesses were to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow was piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday, even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to this basement apartment in the Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's a doorway that was previously blocked due to snow and high winds that hit 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carve pathways around homes in the city.  The door of this shed blew open in the Kibride neighbourhood of St. John's.  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking a single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed — with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300 Canadian Armed Forces members are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, some snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on Friday — an aptly named one too. Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],N/A
182,Anonymous,2018-07-23T15:46:34.884Z,Will Pegg will die an assisted death. He couldn't feel more alive,"July 23, 2018 update: When this documentary first aired in December, Will Pegg didn't think he'd get to see and hear finches again this spring — but he did. His partner Louise, along with their extended family of friends, continue to support him. Pegg sat with his friend Raven Hume to send us this recorded update: Read Story Transcript Will Pegg's body is slowly falling apart, riddled with metastatic bone cancer. First his rib cage will fall apart, then his vertebrae. That will crush the nerves in those areas and may cause paralysis. At 58, he knows he doesn't want to die this way. So he's chosen to go on his own terms, with a medically assisted death. ""It seems beautiful that we can end our time together on this planet potentially somewhere that's beautiful for me and them and with a lot less drain on the resources of myself, my family and the Canadian medical system."" Pegg was diagnosed in January 2017, a mere six months after medically assisted dying was made legal here. At least 2,000 Canadians have died this way since. About one-third of those have happened in British Columbia — the majority on Vancouver Island, where Pegg lives in Victoria. Those who live on the island have chosen assisted death at a rate five times higher than the rest of Canada. Cancer was the most common reason why people decided to get an assisted death, representing about 63 per cent of all cases in this country so far, according to Health Canada.  Pegg has been getting to know Dr. Stefanie Green, who will administer the drugs that will kill him. She explained how it works in a recent visit. There are four doses of medication. Pegg has to say he is ready to go before Green will start, and even then, she will ask him again, just in case he's changed his mind. The whole process only takes about 10 minutes. It's a scary thought for some, but Pegg has come to terms with it. ""Stefanie gave me my life back. And I think the perception might be that MAID [medical assistance in dying] is about dying. But as far as my personal experience of it, it is about living,"" he said. ""In my situation, it's allowed this year to flower and for me to have full participation in the culture, in my family life. Stefanie is in the position to accord me mercy, which is an incredible gift in the midst of dark circumstances."" Green worked in maternity for many years — the sign pointing to her office still says ""maternity and newborn care."" When the law changed last year, she began taking on patients at the opposite end of life. She feels very privileged at the opportunity. ""This is an amazing opportunity to be involved with someone on such an intimate level,"" she said. ""And I don't take that for granted."" Given the relationships she makes with her patients, Green said there's no weight on her in helping people die.  ""I always feel like I've done something good when I leave,"" she said. ""I will never assist someone who I don't think meets the criteria of the law, so I don't put myself in a position where I'm worried about going to jail. ""I've only experienced gratitude from people and — it sounds weird — I feel like I've done a good thing. I feel satisfied, I feel good."" Pegg has surrounded himself with positive people, like Green. Also in the group are Quakers, Buddhists, environmentalists, nurses, and counsellors. When he became sick, they set up committees and got to work.  There's Marga St. James, a dear friend since the '80s who has put her life on hold to help him. She sorts out his finances and registers him for palliative care. Dan Jason is Pegg's farming friend. Before he got sick, Pegg ran his own organic gardening business. He primarily hired young people who were recovering from addictions and trauma. Jason runs Seed Spirit Farms, which Pegg likes to visit. On his last trip there, they planted garlic together. Erin Munro was 24 when she first met Pegg. He hired her as a gardener, and they went on to become dear friends. She's supports Pegg and his decisions — going to doctor's appointments with him — but has mixed feelings about when he decides to die. ""I just don't want to miss any moments, that comes up for me. Because it's just so final,"" she said. ""The end is the end and that's it.""  And of course, there's Louise Takeda. She was a mere acquaintance of Pegg's before the diagnosis. But after he told her the bad news, she decided there was still time to get to know him. She began volunteering to stay with him after his chemo treatments. And unexpectedly, they fell in love.  The two were married in November. It was a Buddhist wedding, and Pegg said it probably would not be legally recognized. It's a special kind of love to fall in love with someone who is dying, said Pegg. ""She really saw me at my completely lowest ebb and my most vulnerable.""  ""My body aged 10 years in a few months. My hair fell out, my skin fell apart,"" he said. ""You really have to find a love that's greater than that pain,"" added Takeda. ""And be willing to make that space in your own heart to have pain, to have fear and to be okay with that."" Pegg has come to terms with it. He doesn't know when he'll be ready to die. But he's in no rush. Last February, it looked like he might die soon, and then his treatment started working. When the time comes, he'd like to die on a beach at Clayoquot Sound, on the far west coast of Vancouver Island. ""Having never died before, or at least not that I'm aware of, it's a bit hard to envision. But this whole process for me has been about trying to embrace wellness for the people around me,"" he said. ""It would be without drama, hopefully, without a lot of footprints left on their hearts because of my desire for things to be this way or that way. I'll need to surrender to what's possible. And there should be singing."" The documentary, One More Moment, was produced by The Current's Kristin Nelson and Liz Hoath.

183,Bethany Lindsay,2019-08-03T14:42:54.050Z,'No no no no no no': Wheelchair users say even accessible taxis will refuse rides in Vancouver,"Two weeks ago, Gabrielle Peters spent a rare day out in Vancouver with friends. They took in a cultural festival in the afternoon, then headed for dinner at a restaurant Peters had always wanted to try. ""As soon as we sat down, my anxiety started. In the back of my mind was, 'I'm going to have to call a taxi,' and that's likely to be not a good experience,"" she remembered. Peters uses a wheelchair. It's always a challenge to find a taxi that will take her, but she says the night of July 20 was the worst it's ever been. She and her friends say she was refused by multiple drivers with accessible vehicles who dropped off passengers while she was waiting in front of the restaurant. Meanwhile, she was dealing with serious back pain from a day spent wheeling over uneven surfaces. The restaurant didn't have a wheelchair-accessible bathroom, so she desperately needed a toilet. ""Drivers are giving me the, 'No no no no no no' and driving away,"" Peters said. This wonderful driver from Richmond Taxi helped me transfer into his regular taxi. <a href=""https://twitter.com/bambinoir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@bambinoir</a> and the club staff started chasing taxis and he felt so bad for what we’ve been through he insisted my ride is free. Meet Mohit - the greatest cab driver in BC <a href=""https://t.co/0XKi7h9uZL"">pic.twitter.com/0XKi7h9uZL</a> Mohit kept apologizing and we all told him it’s not his fault. <br><br>Mohit: I know but we’re a community and people shouldn’t be treated this way. <br><br>I started to cry. I really wasn’t sure how I was going to get home. Mohit is the hero we needed tonight.   But this isn't a story about one horrible night in the life of a woman who uses a wheelchair. This is a story about all the frustrating nights, mornings and afternoons disabled people have trying to find reliable transportation in Vancouver. Other wheelchair users who spoke to CBC for this story confirmed they're frequently refused cab service, and said they believe drivers prefer to use the extra space in accessible taxis to carry tourists' luggage. They say the situation is even more desperate for wheelchair users who also happen to be poor or people of colour, and the situation isn't likely to improve when Uber arrives in B.C. ""This is part of a larger problem, and all the solutions that they're proposing are not solutions for this particular problem,"" Peters said. Urban planner Amina Yasin points out that Uber and Lyft have had their own issues with discrimination.  ""We're innovating on a cracked foundation, and we're not really solving the root of a lot of these problems for a lot of people,"" said Yasin, who is co-chair of the Canadian Institute of Planners' social equity committee and speaks on inclusive infrastructure. Ride-hailing is set to begin in B.C. in the fall, and companies like Uber and Lyft will have to pay a 30-cent fee for every trip in a non-accessible vehicle. The revenue is meant to support more accessible transportation options, but officials at the transportation ministry say they haven't yet determined how the funds will be allocated. Vancouver Taxi Association spokesperson Carolyn Bauer told CBC she'd like to speak with Peters about her experience, and find a way to make things right. That includes holding the drivers who passed her by accountable — Bauer said all taxi companies have penalties for discriminating against disabled passengers. ""We take very seriously our responsibility to provide timely transportation services to everyone, and will continue to work diligently to ensure we live up to this obligation,"" Bauer wrote in an email. The B.C. Transportation Ministry notes it's strengthened penalties for businesses and drivers that fail to follow the Taxi Bill of Rights, which prohibit discriminating against people with disabilities. Fines of up to $50,000 can now be issued for anyone who does not comply, and licences can be suspended or cancelled. So far this year, the Passenger Transportation Branch, which regulates taxis, has four complaints on file related to excessive wait times for people with wheelchairs that resulted in trip cancellations. Peters says the complaint process is difficult to navigate, a subject she's written about in the past. Peters is not alone in her experiences with cabs. Bronwyn Berg lives in Chemainus, but has similar stories from her visits to Vancouver. She says she's had taxis speed past her while the driver yells ""no wheelchairs!"" out the window. That's why Berg never lets the dispatcher know she has a wheelchair when she calls for a cab — something that wouldn't be possible if she used a power chair. When she's hailing from the street, ""if I'm with one of my adult children, they'll say, 'No one's going to stop for us unless you hide.' I've hidden behind the bushes and around the corner while they hail a cab."" The consequences for a person's quality of life are hard to fathom for anyone who doesn't have to deal with this on a daily basis. The cost of a wheelchair-adapted vehicle is out of reach for many people, and public transit can be extremely uncomfortable, depending on the disability. HandyDART service, meanwhile, has to be booked a day in advance. ""You have a whole different metric for whether or not you're going to go out,"" Peters explained. ""I start off by being excited that I have this opportunity to go do something, and then I start thinking about all of the various barriers between getting there and being there and getting home … and suddenly start going, you know what, it's not worth it."" Berg points out that reliable transportation is also a crucial part of staying safe. According to Statistics Canada, disabled Canadians are almost twice as likely to be victims of violent crime, and disabled women are twice as likely to be sexually assaulted. ""There is a really hopeless, desperate feeling if you're in a city and it's dark and late and you cannot get home,"" Berg said. If the situation is going to improve, Peters believes wheelchair users need to be at the table when any sort of transportation policy is under discussion. Accessibility should be built into the system from the beginning, not padded on as an afterthought. ""You need to start with us,"" she said. On top of the province's current focus on increasing the supply of wheelchair-accessible cabs, Peters also wants tougher rules to ensure drivers will actually pick up wheelchair users — and handle both people and their chairs with care, an issue worthy of its own story. She's especially skeptical about the introduction of ride-hailing in B.C. this fall. Uber and Lyft depend on drivers using their own vehicles, which means wheelchair-accessible cars are few and far between. And ride-hailing companies generally don't require hands-on training for dealing with wheelchairs. ""What we need is more regulation, not less,"" Peters said. ""What we need is more training, not less. We need rules.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessible-taxis-vancouver-1.5234791,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-by-september-1.5204519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cabbie-lied-about-why-he-refused-blind-man-s-ride-admits-i-don-t-like-dogs-to-tribunal-1.4615367 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/handydart-vancouver-island-1.5016951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/accessibility-law-1.5005005,N/A
184,Stephen Whyno,2020-01-15T23:13:51.124Z,"Golden Knights fire head coach Gerard Gallant, hire Peter DeBoer","Gerard Gallant was abruptly fired by the Vegas Golden Knights on Wednesday less than two years after leading them to the Stanley Cup Final in their first season of existence and winning NHL coach of the year honours along the way. Peter DeBoer, fired last month by the San Jose Sharks, takes over immediately and will be the Vegas coach the rest of the season. General manager Kelly McCrimmon announced the change in the aftermath of a 4-2 loss to Buffalo on Tuesday night that dropped Vegas out of a playoff position in the Western Conference. The Golden Knights have lost four in a row, matching the longest point drought in their brief franchise history. ""You've seen consistency issues,"" McCrimmon said in Ottawa. ""We are like a lot of teams — had real high hopes for the year, still have real high hopes for the year. We're in a unique position where we're right in the mix, so this isn't a case where the bottom fell out and we were left with no choice. It was a situation more where proactively it was our belief that this was going to be the best thing for our organization."" Before some rough patches this season, Gallant was on a honeymoon since being hired in April 2017 to coach the league's 31st team. He helped president of hockey operations George McPhee and McCrimmon during the Golden Knights' successful expansion draft and instilled a workmanlike attitude that helped a ragtag group of players come together during a magical inaugural season. Vegas won eight of its first nine games and put together a stirring run through the playoffs to land in the final against the Capitals. McCrimmon said the decision was made over the past several weeks. Assistant coach Mike Kelly, who came to Vegas with Gallant from the Florida Panthers, was also fired. ""I think our team has more to give, and that was what into the decision,"" McCrimmon said. This is the seventh coaching change in the NHL this season and the fifth for performance reasons. Vegas is the third team to change coaches after facing the Sabres, a loss that didn't sit well among players. ""It's tougher, especially when you're losing to teams you know that you're better than,"" Golden Knights winger Mark Stone said Tuesday night. ""We're a better hockey team. Just have to find ways to put the puck in the net, and we've kind of gotten stale the last bunch of games."" The Golden Knights are 8-6-1 in their last 15 but are only three points out of first place in the Pacific Division. Gallant was set to coach the Pacific team at All-Star Weekend later this month after Vegas led the division at the halfway mark. Things haven't gone well since then. The power play is 5 of 12 over the past 12 games, and the penalty kill gave up two goals to the Sabres, who are ranked 21st in the league. ""They're still doing the same type of things, whether it's unlucky or bad opportunities,"" Gallant said after the loss. ""It's just not working right now."" DeBoer is the second coach to be fired this season and join a new team; John Hynes went from New Jersey to Nashville. He is now with his fourth team as head coach after stints with New Jersey, Florida and San Jose. ""His teams are always very well prepared, very well coached,"" McCrimmon said of DeBoer. ""He's an intelligent guy. Teams have always been very strong special teams. He's been to the Stanley Cup Final with two different teams. He enjoyed a lot of success in the National Hockey League as a coach and I think with this opportunity he'll continue to do that."" Vegas is 24-19-6 and next plays Thursday night at Ottawa with DeBoer expected to be behind the bench.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/vegas-golden-knights-gerard-gallant-fried-peter-deboer-hired-nhl-1.5427673,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/nhl-coaching-carousel-gallant-laviolette-de-boer-1.5428355 https://stats.cbc.ca/hockey/nhl/team/269 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/knights-gallant-calls-sharks-deboer-a-clown-ahead-of-tonight-s-game-7-clash-1.5108149,N/A
185,Sam Juric,2019-02-18T12:00:00.069Z,7 tips to help manage the winter blues on P.E.I.,"From dropping temperatures to shorter days — there are many reasons the winter months can be a tough time for some Islanders. Ashley Belanger-Birt, a peer support worker at the Canadian Mental Health Association in Charlottetown, said the offices see between five and 10 people every day and many of them are struggling with seasonal affective disorder or as it is also commonly referred to — the winter blues. Christine Beck is a clinical psychologist on the Island who stresses the importance of staying in tune with your emotions to help manage your mental health.  Here are just a few ways to help manage the winter blues as advised by Belanger-Birt and Beck.  ""We tell people to keep their blinds open, make your house as bright as possible,"" Belanger-Birt said. But on days where coming by sunlight can be a challenge, Belanger-Birt said, there are artificial lamps — often referred to as SAD lamps — you can purchase, which help to simulate the beneficial effects of being outside under the sun.  ""It helps change your rhythm and make you feel as if you're having more sunlight throughout the day,"" she said. ""The more I have practised, the more I've understood that your physical well-being is important to your mental well-being,"" Beck said. Beck said studies have shown that exercise near greenery like parks and forests have an impact on your mood. And walking or exercising near water has an even greater impact.  ""Rest is very underappreciated,"" said Beck. People often find themselves on the go and can forget to take time during the day to check-in with themselves. Putting down electronic devices and taking-in the moment is a good place to start. ""Our electronics are something that add to the quality of our life but they can't be the centre of it,"" she said. Joining a team of some kind during the winter, Belanger-Birt said, can help in several ways to manage the winter blues including possibly getting some more sunlight, being physically active and being in an environment that encourages you to be social with others. Making plans to look forward to can be a great way to keep your chin up during those cloudy winter days. Jotting down some goals you'd like to accomplish is a way to help you look forward to the exciting things that lie ahead, said Belanger-Birt. If you're able to — plan a small trip with friends or family for the future. It can help to keep your mind on the brighter side of things. Writing down your daily thoughts and feelings can also be a great coping mechanism, Belanger-Birt said. It gives you the chance to take stock of the day and how you were feeling. ""Journal everything,"" she said. ""Write down everything you're feeling and then you know, you're able to track."" It can be easy to become isolated during the winter months, said Belanger-Birt, but keeping up with social connections is key. ""Stay social — make plans — go out to a movie. Make sure you're keeping in touch with your friends and family.   ""Once you're doing all that, it really contributes to your mental wellness. Small steps are huge with mental health. It's the little things that build up to the big things,"" Belanger-Birt said.

That's double the number of confirmed cases the regulator said it had received before last May.  In 2018, Marketplace went undercover to find out if plastic surgeons were downplaying the risk of breast implants. The common heartburn medication Pepcid is in short supply across Canada, and experts say it's a direct result of the recent international recall of Zantac. Zantac was recalled in the U.S. and Canada in October after a potentially cancer-causing chemical was found at low levels in the drug.

187,Anonymous,2018-11-28T01:16:33.115Z,P.E.I. lays out 5-year plan for mental health and addictions spending ,"The province announced more details Tuesday of its plan to improve Prince Edward Island's mental health and addictions programs and services. Two weeks ago in the 2019-2020 capital budget, government said it planned to spend $100 million over the next five years. Officials with the province said along with with planning firm CannonDesign they've spent the past year poring over data from P.E.I.'s mental health system and meeting with care providers, patients and others to figure out what is needed most and when. They said only half of the 12,000 people who were referred for mental health and addictions help were seen in the 2016 – 2017 year. They also discovered wait times for mental health and addictions patients in the ER usually range between nine and 30 hours.  They outlined today where they plan to spend millions of dollars to try to fix some of these issues.    In the coming year, the province plans to establish what it is calling ""e-mental health solutions"" — more online help for patients including an online self-assessment tool, rural tele-mental health services, virtual therapies and peer counselling.  ""We don't necessarily want people going to emergency if they can get that service closer to home,"" said Verna Ryan,  chief administrative officer of mental health and addictions services for Health PEI. ""Whether it is through a crisis team, an act team [Assertive Community Treatment] or through a community hub, that is what we want. We want people to feel supported and have their needs addressed as close to home as possible."" The following year, the province plans to have four community access centres open in Charlottetown, Summerside, West Prince and Kings County. They will be looking for central locations that would be open 12 hours a day, seven days a week, where people can have access to services and community mental health and addictions staff. ""Ideally with the community hubs, we want it to be a place where people will want to go, where they might get more than one service met,"" said Dr. Heather Keizer, Health PEI's chief of mental health and addictions. ""Depending on the community, it might be place where they could get a cup of coffee, where they might be able to have contact with a social worker to fill out their paperwork — because that is a big issue with many people."" The province is also planning to have mobile crisis response teams up and running next year. ""If you have a mobile crisis unit in place, you can actually reduce the visits to the emergency room by up to 60 per cent,"" said Keizer. ""We would really like to have that in place first to be able to guide us as we move forward — we want to give the best care in the best location possible.""  A new eight-bed housing facility is planned to be ready on the grounds of the current Hillsborough Hospital by 2020-21, officials said. The facility will serve two purposes — assisting patients transitioning from the hospital to the community, and a day program for patients spending the day who do not need hospitalization. The following year, government plans to add a dedicated 12-bed emergency department for mental health and addictions at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, with eight treatment spaces and four beds for stabilization. The province also plans during this year and the year after to create more mental health residential services in Charlottetown and Summerside, to give long-term housing with community mental health supports for those living with mental illness. The province's new mental health and addictions hospital should be up and running by 2024 -25, officials said.  ""Some of the components that we have laid out to '24-'25 are sequential, so we need certain things in place before we can make changes,"" Ryan said.

188,Dana Hatherly,2020-01-15T02:31:47.759Z,'A little bit of crazy': Manitoba firefighter helping to battle out-of-control wildfires in Australia,"After spending his summer battling blazes in Canada's North, a Dauphin-based man is now spending much of his winter fighting fires Down Under. Originally from a Hutterite colony in southern Manitoba, Matt Wollman has been stationed for nine weeks in Australia, where out-of-control wildfires are threatening humans, animals and the natural habitat. He's one of six firefighters from the province who have been deployed to Australia, ""You have to be really crazy not to be a bit scared, but I have a little bit of crazy in me,"" Wollman, 22, said. Wollman spoke Tuesday via Skype with Ismaila Alfa of CBC's Up To Speed, outside his house near the little town of Moss Vale in Australia's southern highlands. ""(The fires) do scare me,"" Wollman said. ""It's just the immensity of these fires and the damage, the power you see coming of them, just the weird things that happen."" He said the scariest moment during his time in Australia came when a flame-damaged tree came crashing to the ground only tens of metres away from him. ""Just this massive sound. My heart just jolted."" Wollman said his original plans to go backpacking were put on hold in late November when he scored a seasonal job with Australia's Forestry Corporation, which manages two million hectares of state forests. Less than 10 days later, he started training for the role and familiarizing himself around the area in New South Wales where he would be working to protect pine plantations that provide a high-value timber industry. Nearly two weeks ago, as the burning intensified, his crew's safety was in danger of spot fires ablaze several kilometres away. Wollman said those were offshoots caused by existing fires quickly moving in on them from all directions. ""We were kind of sandwiched in between,"" he said. The team kicked into top-gear patrol mode. ""Within 15 minutes, the forest was burning so actively that we couldn't go in there. We had to pull out of there. We had people in there trying to fight the fire but they got pushed out because the flames got into the tops of the trees,"" he said. ""It's not safe, at all."" The wildfires were creeping closer and closer to endangering the community of Wingello, southwest of where he was staying. ""We got into the mode of protecting as many houses there as we could."" Building Impact Assessment teams continue assessing the damage to properties. So far 2,176 homes destroyed, more than 25,000 buildings saved. Since 1 Jan, 1,260 homes lost. This figure is likely to increase as teams continue to work through fire affected areas. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nswrfs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nswrfs</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nswfires?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nswfires</a> <a href=""https://t.co/pml0Y2kKmq"">pic.twitter.com/pml0Y2kKmq</a> Wildfires are being regularly monitored and mapped out online by the Rural Fire Service for consistent updates. Whenever fire danger is significant, people perched up high in watch towers located in New South Wales look out for signs of flames and smoke. Wollman said he has spent quite a few days stationed in a tower among the treetops in the thick of it. ""If you're right there, it could be very quick,"" he said. With the right type of fuel, wildfires can move hundreds of metres in a matter of minutes. ""You want it to be kind of just creeping along the ground slowly so you can keep up, but a lot of these fires get driven by the wind, and they get down into these steeper gullies and gorges,"" he said. As the flames sneak uphill, they burn a lot faster, he said. Wind further fuels the fire. ""You won't be able to outrun those fires, so you have to be positioned safely when you're attacking anything that could run at you."" It's been estimated more than a billion animals have been affected by the wildfires. The forest floor is covered with dead wildlife, Wollman said. ""It's quite surreal, honestly,"" he said. He hasn't seen mammals, birds and reptiles fleeing the fiery forest, but has seen the impact on wildlife firsthand. ""Unfortunately, yes, I have seen quite a few get burned over,"" he said. ""It's really sad."" Wildfires in Australia have killed 27 people and burned more than 7.3 million hectares so far this season. The full extent of the damage is unknown as the situation continues to unfold in an area where summer has just started. Abnormally high temperatures coupled with the heat of the wildfires makes for an extremely hot environment. Adding to the uncertainty, eucalyptus trees, for example, contain an oil that pops when it burns and are well-known for creating spot fires. ""They light up really fast, and the fire in them can be quite aggressive,"" Wollman said. The oil will burn, and the live embers can get picked up by wind, carried to other areas, and reignite where they land. From 100 metres away in the treetops, decked out in heavy fire-protective gear, including a helmet, mask and goggles, Wollman said he can feel the heat. ""You're sweating, you're hot,"" he said. ""It's pretty unbearable."" Crews make sure to keep cool, stay hydrated and watch out for each other's safety. Thick plumes of smoke can block out the sun, making it appear dark as night during the day. ""It doesn't just go up, straight up, it gets blown into your face,"" Wollman said. His sister Candice Doherty lives near Portage la Prairie, where she works at a family-run greenhouse. ""We couldn't be prouder of him,"" she said. Given the dangers, Doherty is still thrilled her brother has the courage to help people — no matter who or where they are in the world. ""I don't think he's crazy at all,"" she said. ""I think he has an incredible heart.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/matt-wollman-australia-fires-1.5426763,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/australia-wildfires-canada-waterbombers-1.5425580 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-manitoba-australia-wildfire-impact-1.5413496 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/koala-animal-sanctuary-australia-wildfires-1.5423833 https://www.cbc.ca/news/toxic-wildfire-smoke-australia-1.5422624,N/A
189,Keith Boag,2020-01-16T09:00:00.834Z,"For Democrats in 2020, winning isn't everything — it's the only thing ","If electability is the test, then here's a statistic Elizabeth Warren or Amy Klobuchar might have found handy in their argument for a female nominee at Tuesday night's Democratic debate: the last two white men to win the party's presidential nomination — Al Gore in 2000  and John Kerry in 2004 — both lost in the subsequent general election.  The most Gore/Kerry-like candidate in this Democratic primary happens to be the front-runner, former vice-president Joe Biden. So the beauty of the argument, at least for Warren and Klobuchar, is that they wouldn't even have to mention his name while they tried to vaporize his perceived advantage. It speaks to how all-important the ability to win is in this primary season, which kicks off with the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary in a couple of weeks. And no, primaries aren't always like that.  When their short-term prospects have looked dismal, both parties have indulged in passionate soul-searching primaries about what they will stand for in the long run. (See the Democrats and Jesse Jackson against Ronald Reagan in 1984 or the Republicans and Pat Buchanan against Bill Clinton in 1996.) But winning is definitely what this primary is about. That's partly because Democrats believe they can win in November and partly because they believe they must win. In hyperbolic, hyper-partisan America, some Democrats fear the country as they know it will disappear if Donald Trump is re-elected; some Republicans fear civil war if he isn't. To borrow the football line, in 2020, winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.  WATCH | 'The only people on this stage who have won every single election they've been in are the women' — Elizabeth Warren makes her electability argument: So for all the talk of health care, income inequality and left versus further left, it's no wonder the struggle for the soul of the Democratic party is, for many Democrats at this moment, a struggle that can wait until after they've rid the White House of Trump. And how is that project going anyway? It looks like it might come down to how the African-American vote, crucial to winning the nomination, is already sizing up. Thus far, two of the three African-American candidates, senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, have dropped out of the race before the first ballot is cast, and no one can see a credible path forward for the third: former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. He hasn't qualified for a debate and isn't likely to. African-American voters generally like Biden. A recent poll showed Biden with 48 per cent support among African Americans, and a commanding 28-point lead over his nearest rival, Bernie Sanders.  There's a wild card who political observers agree they can't see winning but almost superstitiously won't count out: three-term mayor of New York and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg.   He's eschewed the usual conventions of the Democratic primary process — can't be bothered with Iowa and New Hampshire, for example — and his views align with only a small proportion of voters who are socially liberal and economically conservative.  But he is throwing piles of cash into television advertising in states that come later in the primary schedule, and campaigning on his spectacularly successful record in business and at least somewhat successful record as mayor.   As for the rest, Iowa and New Hampshire will winnow down the field. Biden will continue on to the first big state for African-Americans: South Carolina. Sanders, as we learned in 2016, never quits. For Warren, Klobuchar and Buttigieg, the end will come when the money runs out. This is not the field Democrats imagined a year ago. With its pale complexion — all the realistic contenders are white — and surfeit of billionaires (two), it's probably not the look they were going for.  Conventional wisdom gives Trump the advantage in November thanks to a relatively strong economy and the prestige of incumbency in the Oval Office. A significant majority of Americans tell pollsters they believe he'll win, even though a significant majority also says they hope he doesn't. One of the lessons of the 2016 election — perhaps the most important lesson — is to confront conventional wisdom with rational skepticism.  Trump has never been above 45 per cent public approval in either of the most respected polling averages — Fivethirtyeight.com and Realclearpolitics.com — and usually he's closer to 42-43 per cent. No U.S. president with that bad a polling record has ever been re-elected.  WATCH | The Democrats who will present the impeachment case at the Senate trial speak to media: Plus, in the exclusive category of impeached presidents — Trump is now the third in U.S. history — he'll be the first to contest for re-election. Trump understands impeachment is not something he can brag about. And though he will use it to play the victim to his base, his base is not big enough to re-elect him.   So, maybe the question for the 2020 election is this: Will it look more like the one in 2016 or the one in 2018? In 2016, a relative handful of votes in key states — 77,000 in all — gave Trump the White House in an electoral college victory even though he lost the popular vote.  In 2018, a massive turnout of Democrats, stirred up by Trump to vote against him, overwhelmed Republicans at the polls and won the party the House of Representatives in the biggest midterms landslide since 1974. Based on Trump's approval record over three years, it would be an astonishing turnaround if he were to win the popular vote in November. If he doesn't, but wins the presidency in the electoral college again anyway, that will be the sixth time in history that's happened, the third time in this century a Republican president has done it and the second time that president is Trump. George W. Bush did it in 2000. Which brings us back to Warren, Klobuchar and that thing about the last couple of white men to lead the party. The reason Bush won the 2000 election was that it came down to a recount in Florida. And the reason that happened was that Gore fumbled the ball in his own end zone and lost the vote in his home state, Tennessee. Another point for Warren and Klobuchar to remember when they're making the case for giving the ball to a woman this time.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iowa-new-hampshire-democratic-primaries-1.5427362,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-democratic-presidential-candidates-debate-1.5427047 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/warrens-sanders-debate-confrontation-1.5428854 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/house-impeachment-managers-1.5427543 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/democrats-new-documents-impeachment-1.5427255 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-republican-primaries-1.5315911 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-donald-trump-impeachment-senate-trial-1.5394531 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-house-vote-analysis-1.5401650,N/A
190,Liam Britten,2020-01-15T12:00:00.479Z,"'You feel ashamed': Despite tighter rules, struggling British Columbians still embrace payday loans","Downtown Eastside poverty advocate Elli Taylor has seen many desperate people struggling with payday loans. She's been that person herself. In 2014, while working as a part-time convenience store clerk in Williams Lake, Taylor took out what she thought would be a manageable $250 loan to buy a bus pass and Christmas presents for her 14-year-old twins. Her take-home pay was about $250 every two weeks, but monthly instalment payments of $50 became a problem with the then-legal rate of $20 interest and fees for every $100 loaned. ""You're snowballing into not being able to afford your groceries,"" Taylor said. ""You feel ashamed. It's dehumanizing."" It's stories like that that make it clear why B.C. has tightened the rules for payday lenders starting in 2016: lowering how much can be borrowed and the interest rates allowed. But while the number of lenders has declined under these new rules, data show British Columbians are actually borrowing from them more.  Payday loans offer quick cash but demand interest and fees greater than other loan types especially if not repaid quickly — perhaps six to seven times the cost of an equivalent amount from a credit card cash advance or line of credit. Advocates say many low-income people can't access those cheaper options, and payday lender regulations are missing the point: too many British Columbians just aren't making enough money to get by. Isaiah Chan, director of counselling of the Credit Counselling Society, said the fact that there aren't fewer people seeking help with those debts speaks to bigger problems with affordability. ""Something's triggered it: either some sort of disruption like a family emergency or job loss, illness, something where they have to quickly resort to borrowing money at a higher cost,"" Chan said. ""The story that we hear from clients [is] they had nowhere else to turn."" Since 2016, the province has taken a series of steps to tighten payday lending rules: the maximum fee for every $100 borrowed is now $15, limits have been placed on information collection and the amount that can be loaned has been lowered to half a paycheque or half the earnings of one pay period. Chan welcomes those changes but isn't seeing an impact. The society helped over 20,500 Canadians from B.C. to Ontario through its debt management program in 2019. About 30 per cent had payday loan problems, numbers similar to 2018. Chan said the people who rely on these loans tend to be poorer, have few credit options and are ""desperate."" Taylor remembers that desperation. Falling behind, unable to afford groceries and without other options, she took out more loans to stay afloat. The lenders would send people to her house and call her employer. Taylor also has clinical depression. She blames the stress of the loan for making her illness worse until she could no longer work. She became homeless. ""I was suicidal,"" she said. ""I just felt like, what the f--k is wrong with me?"" Taylor says she's doing better now, but it took time. She moved to Vancouver where there are more supports for her mental health, and found work with organizations Raise the Rates and Carnegie Community Action Project. She was able to pay the loans off eventually, after getting tax refunds from previous years she had not filed for, but to this day her credit rating is shot. Alan Evetts of the Canadian Consumer Finance Association, an industry association for payday lenders, said payday lending provides much-needed cash, quickly, to people who normally wouldn't be able to get it. He said it's unfair to compare the higher rates of payday lending with lower-interest options like lines of credit, likening it to comparing the nightly price of a hotel room to monthly rent. ""They're intended to be used very differently."" A provincial spokesperson said further regulations are coming that will stop lenders from issuing further loans to a borrower who already has a loan with that institution and put in a waiting period after a borrower has paid off a loan before they can take on another one. Economist Iglika Ivanova of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives said regulations typically show governments don't understand payday lending. ""Payday loans are pitched as a sort of last resort,"" Ivanova said. ""A lot of people are actually taking these loans for utility bills and for groceries ... that are expected but they can't pay for."" Ivanova said banks and credit unions need to provide alternatives. Vancity's Fair and Fast Loan is one positive example, offering small, short-term loans at an interest rate about one-twentieth that of a payday loan.  For Taylor, the answer is more affordable housing, food security and a basic income. ""No amount of changing interest rates of loans is going to help,"" she said. ""We need equity.""

191,Adam Carter,2020-01-10T17:22:35.482Z,Families of Iran plane crash victims facing uphill battle to recover remains,"Manant Vaidya knows the tragedy of losing loved ones in an airline disaster better than almost anyone. And in the wake of the plane crash in Iran that killed all 176 passengers on board, his heart is aching this week. Vaidya endured the same anguish these families are now facing; he lost his parents, sister, brother-in-law and two nieces last year when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after takeoff from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Now the Brampton, Ont., man is once again seeing news stories of entire families wiped out. ""Those families looked just like the family I lost,"" he said. ""It all came back to me."" Vaidya has also lived through a logistical nightmare that the victim's families are now starting to navigate: Trying to recover their loved one's bodies and bring them home for funerals. Many of those who died in this week's crash were Muslim, and Muslims customarily must bury their loved ones as quickly as possible after death — something that proves almost impossible in a complex incident like this. WATCH | Manant Vaidya says he wishes no one would ever lose family in an airline disaster again Experts also say that repatriating the bodies of Canadians killed in the crash will be hampered by heightened military tensions and the fact that Canada severed diplomatic ties with Iran years ago. ""There's a lot of psychological trauma the families now have to endure,"" said Liyakat Takim, a religious studies professor at McMaster University in Hamilton. ""The trauma is just unbelievable for them."" Takim is also feeling that trauma first-hand; he was close friends with religious pilgrimage tour leader Asghar Dhirani, who died in the crash. ""I keep thinking about his last moments … it keeps coming in my mind,"" he said. Authorities have said the bodies and remains recovered from the site of the crash have been taken to the coroner's office for identification. Hassan Shadkoo's wife, Sheyda, was one of the victims. Speaking to CBC News from Toronto's Pearson International Airport Wednesday night, he said that instead of his wife returning to him, he was headed to Tehran to retrieve her remains and be with her family. ""I wish I didn't exist now,"" he said. Mohammad Tarbhai, a relative of crash victims Alina and Afifa Tarbhai, told CBC News that authorities need to carry out DNA testing, and he isn't expecting their bodies to be released for at least a week. Vaidya's experience shows that, in all likelihood, reclaiming the bodies of the Canadians who died won't be a simple process. He flew to Ethiopia after the crash last March, hoping to identify and retrieve his family's remains from that crash site. He quickly learned that would be impossible with an ongoing investigation. The only thing he was able to take was soil. ""That's all that was left to me,"" he said. Vaidya, who is Hindu, brought that soil to India, and was able to use it to perform end-of-life rituals. ""As long as you have the soil and you have the thoughts in your heart and mind … that is how we got the closure initially,"" he said. It wasn't until November that he was able to return to Ethiopia to officially recover his family's remains and bring them to India for final cremation. Muslim families dealing with this tragedy won't be able to observe normal customs, Takim said. Usually, a dead person's body would be washed and wrapped in a white shroud before prayers and a burial, he said, which would take place as soon as possible after death. ""The normal procedure would not be applicable in these cases,"" said Takim, adding that a precedent does exist for longer waits for burials in extenuating circumstances, such as when a post-mortem examination is necessary. This whole situation is undoubtedly very traumatic for the families involved, he said. ""Their loved one has not died a normal death."" Vaidya stressed that the families of the Iran crash victims should reach out to Global Affairs Canada. ""They were very helpful,"" he said. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne spoke to his Iranian counterpart earlier this week and stressed ""the need for Canadian officials to be quickly granted access to Iran to provide consular services, help with identification of the deceased and take part in the investigation of the crash,"" according to a readout of the call. The readout didn't say whether Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif agreed to Champagne's request. Champagne said Thursday that despite Canada's rocky relationship with Iran, he's been reassured that Canadian investigators will get visas to enter the country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that intelligence now indicates the Ukrainian aircraft that crashed outside of Tehran was shot down by an Iranian missile, possibly unintentionally. Iranian officials have denied the allegation. ""We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,"" Trudeau said Thursday during a news conference in Ottawa. ""The news will undoubtedly come as a further shock to the families who are already grieving in the face of this unspeakable tragedy,"" he said. The crash happened just hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to order the targeted killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. In a report released Wednesday, the Iranian aviation authority said that it has invited ""all the states involved"" to join a growing team investigating the plane crash. The organization's initial report into the crash said a fire broke out on the Boeing aircraft immediately before it hit the ground. adam.carter@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-body-recovery-funerals-1.5421321,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-toronto-victims-1.5418882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-plane-crash-canada-access-investigation-1.5421352,N/A

City hall plans to find out,"Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante wants to find ways to address the unsightly empty storefronts that are plaguing the city's commercial arteries.  Her administration has asked the city's economic and urban development commission to look into the high vacancy rates this fall, with a report to be made public in December.  The city will then hold public consultations in January 2020. At a news conference Monday, Plante said every street and neighbourhood faces its own challenges when it comes to ensuring commercial space is rented out. She rejected the idea there was a quick-fix solution to the vacancy-rate problem.  ""Some of the local business streets in Montreal are doing well; some not so well,"" Plante said. ""It's not a one-fit-for-all solution. We need to put all the right people around the table."" The vacancy rate is between 10 and 15 per cent on commercial streets in Montreal, according to figures provided by the city. She said several factors have led to the increase in vacancies, including rising rents, real estate speculation and the rise of online shopping. At least one business owner welcomed the measures announced Monday.  Anne-Marie Laflamme, co-founder of Atelier B, a clothing boutique on St-Laurent Boulevard in the Mile End, said many businesses in the neighbourhood have been forced to close because of rent increases.  ""We are lucky because we have great landlords. I think that's the only reason we're still here,"" Laflamme said.  She encouraged the city to take steps to curb gentrification. ""If [the neighbourhood] becomes only vacants and chains it will not be interesting for anyone,"" Laflamme said.  Plante defended the city's go-slow approach toward the problem, saying it will take time to listen to the concerns of merchants and identify the best solutions available.

So said an old friend and driver in Beirut as Iran and the U.S. faced each other down in the immediate aftermath of the killing of Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad a week ago. He wasn't referring to that crisis though. Lebanon has too much history perched on the edge of wider regional conflicts to be too rattled by fears of another. He was talking about Lebanon's economic and financial crisis, the worst since civil war ravaged the country between 1975 and 1990. The Lebanese pound has depreciated by more than 30 per cent against the U.S. dollar since September. And capital controls imposed by the banks are drastically limiting how much money people can withdraw, leaving many struggling to pay rent and put food on the table. Ask people on the streets here about ""the situation"" and that's what they think you're talking about. ""The most dangerous thing in Lebanon is economic collapse,"" said Makram Rabah, a political analyst, historian and lecturer at the American University of Beirut. Lebanon has been without a government since the end of October, when protests against corruption and mismanagement forced the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. The Sunni leader of the Future party, whose father, Rafik Hariri, was assassinated in 2005, is allied with Western nations and the Gulf states. ""They're acting so selfish — all of them,"" said 21-year-old student Sarah Ayoub, referring to the political elite she demonstrated against. The protests were remarkable in that they crossed the sectarian lines that tend to define Lebanese politics, drawing demonstrators from the Sunni, Christian, Druze and Shia communities. They were united in their opposition to what they see as rampant cronyism, nepotism and influence peddling.  ""We have to change the system and the laws so that there's less favouritism,"" Ayoub said. ""And if we're all equal in that matter, without someone having an advantage because of who they know, then something will improve."" Rabah focuses the blame on Iran and its Lebanese acolyte, Hezbollah, the Shia paramilitary group and powerful political party that exerts considerable sway in Lebanon. ""Iran has hijacked these states from within, which has exposed their economies,"" he said, referring also to Iraq, where anti-corruption protests were fuelled in part by anger over Iranian meddling in the country's affairs. Iran has funded militias inside Iraq. It has also helped arm and fund Hezbollah in Lebanon, boosting its power. Before his death, Soleimani was accused of ordering a deadly crackdown on the protests in Baghdad. ""Soleimani is someone who was spreading chaos and destruction in the region,"" said Rabah. ""I do not support any kind of assassination, but at the end of the day, he got what he deserved in the sense that you live by the sword, you die by the sword."" But in south Beirut, Hezbollah heartland, there are huge billboards bearing Soleimani's image hanging from freeway overpasses and on the sides of apartment buildings, sharing the streets with pictures of Iran's ayatollahs. ""[Soleimani] is a loss because he has been fighting against terrorism and ISIS in Lebanon and Syria and Iran,"" said Ahmad Nasser, a father out walking with his nine-year-old daughter on Hadi Nasrallah Boulevard. The street is named after Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah's son, who was killed during a guerrilla raid against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon in 1997. Nasser is also worried about the country's economy, but he says Hezbollah must be a part of any solution. ""Hezbollah is a part of the social composition of Lebanon and has to be in government,"" he said. Nasser supported the anti-government protests in the fall but says he has since changed his mind, fearful of a power vacuum developing. It could also be because the man chosen to lead a new government, Hassan Diab, has the backing of Hezbollah. Diab has so far failed to win support from al-Hariri, or from Christian factions worried that his association with Hezbollah, already the target of U.S. sanctions, will deter much-needed international investment in Lebanon. After Soleimani's death, Nasrallah warned that U.S. soldiers would be returned home in coffins in retaliation. Earlier this week, Iran launched missile strikes against military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops, none of whom were injured. Hours later, a Ukraine International Airlines flight crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran, killing 176 people, including 57 Canadians — revised down from an earlier estimate of 63. Both Canada and the U.S. believe an Iranian missile shot down the plane — a claim Iran denies. Like the United States, Canada considers Hezbollah a terrorist group. But it is also an important part of the social fabric in large parts of Lebanon. ""They're not going away. It's not like there are 10 people and we can deport them,"" said economist and political analyst Kamel Wazne. ""They have representatives in parliament and municipalities and they're a powerful organization and it's very well structured."" Wazne says Lebanon will count on the Lebanese population abroad to help the country out of its economic crisis. There have also been calls to create a government of experts to help solve the problem. But 21-year-old Ayoub doesn't have much confidence that what's currently being negotiated is much more than a portfolio shuffle. ""We were on the street for 70 days and we still couldn't [overthrow] them,"" she said. When she does turn her mind to the recent escalation of tension between Iran and the U.S., she says American President Donald Trump has done well for himself by putting his country first. Ayoub says she'd like to see Lebanon's leaders focus more on putting the country and its people ahead of politics.  ""If politicians in Lebanon were behaving the same way that Trump is behaving, we wouldn't have revolted against them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-us-soleimani-killed-retaliation-1.5418302 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-united-states-trump-conflict-sanctions-retaliation-1.5420012 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-diab-new-pm-1.5402520 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-trump-iran-iraq-soleimani-1.5419972,N/A

Michael Robertson made his first court appearance in Saskatoon Provincial Court today. Robertson was arrested early Friday morning, along with co-accused Nicole Paddy. She has been charged with accessory after the fact to murder. Officers arrested Robertson and Paddy after a chase in the middle of the night in Brevoort Park on Saskatoon's east side that involved the police plane, tracking dogs and officers. At one point, the pair were fleeing through backyards in the quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood. Robertson was also charged with breaking entering. Police said he had broken into a home during the chase and tried to hide there. The March 12 death of Genereaux was the city's fourth homicide of the year. Genereaux, 44, was found with serious injuries in a house on the 400 block of Avenue I S. and later died in hospital. The Saskatoon police plane, tracking dogs and officers all assisted in Robertson's arrest. Robertson is a known member of the Indian Posse. At the time of Genereaux's murder, he was wanted on a Canada-wide warrant for breach of parole. Among his many tattoos, he has the numbers nine and 16 in blue script on his left cheek. The number nine corresponds to the letter ""I,"" while 16 matches ""P.""

197,Isaac Olson,2019-11-22T10:00:00.082Z,"Drive drunk twice in Quebec, get ignition breathalyzer for life","Starting Monday, Quebec motorists convicted of drunk driving twice in 10 years will have to blow into a breathalyzer every time they start a car — for the rest of their lives. Their licence will be branded so any intercepting police officer will know to inspect the driver's ignition for an interlock device — a piece of equipment that prevents the car from starting if the driver's estimated blood alcohol concentration is above the legal limit. Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Canada, commended the province for the change. ""When you compare it to other provinces, nobody else has done anything like this,"" Murie said. ""It would be the toughest interlock legislation, not only in Canada but globally."" The new regulation was added to the province's Highway Safety Code when it was overhauled in 2018 and goes into effect just in time for the holidays. A driver with a restricted licence cannot use any car that does not have the device installed, said Mario Vaillancourt, spokesperson for Quebec's automobile insurance board (SAAQ). Getting caught without an interlock device will lead to a three-month licence suspension and a $1,500 fine, he said. And the vehicle they're driving will be impounded for 30 days or more, depending on the circumstances. In addition to the other penalties that come with a second conviction, this licence restriction includes an immediate seizure of the vehicle and impoundment for 90 days, imprisonment and a licence suspension for at least two years. Previously, interlock devices could be installed for life on a second offence if there were aggravating factors such as refusal to co-operate with police or if the motorist's blood alcohol level was double the legal limit, Vaillancourt explained.  Third-time offenders also faced the lifetime restriction. Quebec's Ministry of Transport says from 2013 to 2017, alcohol-related crashes killed an average of 100 people annually. That's on top of the approximately 220 serious injuries and 1,800 minor injuries. ""Although road safety is improving in Quebec, accidents caused by drinking and driving are still causing too many deaths each year,"" Transport Minister François Bonnardel said in a statement Thursday. He said this legislation sends a clear message to motorists and repeat offenders that ""driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs is unacceptable."" MADD Canada's Murie said Quebec's next challenge is to ensure the new legislation is enforced. ""Most of the time, people who get this penalty don't install the device in the first place,"" said Murie, noting unlicensed and uninsured drivers often get behind the wheel regardless of their restrictions. ""You just have to have tactics to deal with those people who are noncompliant."" Murie said the interlock devices have proven to be one of the best weapons against impaired driving, especially with repeat offenders.  He said there needs to be a high level of enforcement by the Transport Ministry, the courts and police to ensure that repeat offenders are installing the devices. People can also help by double-checking anybody's licence before lending them their car, said Theresa-Anne Kramer, a spokesperson for MADD Montreal. The SAAQ says visually checking a driver's licence may not be enough, as a hard copy does not always provide up-to-date information. The agency reminds people that their car could be impounded for 30 days or more if the driver breaks the law. For a fee of $1.75, the SAAQ will verify a licence through its website. ""That would be a wise thing to always do whenever you lend your car, even to your best friend,"" said Kramer.  ""That person might have kept it secret that they have an alcohol interlock in their own vehicle. Family members might not be aware of it. Friends might not be aware of it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drunk-driving-twice-quebec-breathalyzer-for-life-1.5369145,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jordan-taylor-tina-adams-sentence-jail-1.4997185 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/distracted-driving-laws-increeased-1.4723341,N/A
198,Kailea Switzer,2020-01-19T13:00:00.987Z,The agony of letting our kids take risks: Opinion,"I am a first-time mother of a one-year-old, and over the past year I've had to temper my fears a million times. From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own — it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away. Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me — they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.  This was also the way my parents parented — they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you — it has to be your own choice.""  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes — it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party — the discomfort has proven worth it.  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people — empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective — are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like — that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business — I would never have believed you.  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in"" my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it. I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

199,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-15T01:31:33.697Z,RCMP set up checkpoint restricting access in Wet'suwet'en territory amid clash over pipeline,"The RCMP have blocked access to a First Nation's territory in northern B.C., heightening tensions as government officials and hereditary chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en continue to clash over the Coastal GasLink pipeline.  The Mounties have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.  Meanwhile, the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs continue to assert their own laws — saying they want Coastal GasLink and the RCMP off the territory.  ""Being restricted on your own territory is against our law. We've always had free access to our entire territory,"" hereditary chief Na'moks said. The pipeline by Calgary-based TC Energy is meant to move natural gas from northeastern B.C. to the coast, where a liquefied natural gas plant is scheduled for construction. On Monday, B.C. Premier John Horgan said the project will proceed, that Coastal GasLink has all the necessary permits to build its pipeline, and that ""the rule of law needs to prevail"" — citing a B.C. Supreme Court decision that in December granted the company an injunction for unimpeded access to work sites.  Work in the area has been temporarily suspended with the exception, under an agreement with the chiefs, of some winterizing.  On Tuesday, the company released a letter from president David Pfeiffer offering to meet Na'moks on Friday. But the chiefs have said they only want to talk government-to-government with Ottawa and the province. Among the outstanding issues for Coastal GasLink is that the Morice Forest Service Road, which is subject to the injunction, remains impassable.  The RCMP said in a news release on Monday that the checkpoint is ""to mitigate safety concerns [and] … allow emergency service access to the area.""  It said the hereditary chiefs, elected government officials, journalists and people delivering supplies to the area will be allowed to travel through the checkpoint with permission from the operations commander. It said other people not listed may be allowed to move through the checkpoint, with approval.  The chiefs say access is being restricted, and that the new checkpoint came as a surprise.  Communication continues between the province and the chiefs through a separate process that started last year and isn't specific to any particular project.  Speaking to reporters on Monday, Horgan said those discussions need to continue and described the Wet'suwet'en as ""leaders in issues around self government and self determination and rights and title in Canada.""  The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs were part of a landmark Indigenous rights and title case at the Supreme Court of Canada, along with their Gitxsan neighbours. The 1997 decision affirmed that the Wet'suwet'en never gave up title to their lands but the matter has never been fully resolved between governments.  Horgan didn't say where the Coastal GasLink project fits into ongoing discussions with the chiefs, except to say: ""This is a pipeline — it's an industrial project and there's so much more at stake for the people of northern British Columbia than just this project.""  That includes the 20 First Nations that have signed agreements with Coastal GasLink and stand to benefit from the project.  Na'moks said the hereditary chiefs listened to what Horgan said on Monday and saw a contradiction between his touting of the rule of law and the First Nation's leadership in the area of rights and title. Horgan's stance ""weakens"" the province's relationship with the Wet'suwet'en, he said.  ""Here we are trying to build a stronger relationship. We are a government, we'll remain a government, we are on our lands, we'll remain on our lands, and we will govern it as we see fit."" But Na'moks agreed with the premier's statement that the relationship has improved over the last year ""It is better,"" he said. ""This time last year we had guns pointed at us. So that relationship is better. Any relationship where you're not looking down the barrel of a gun is a better relationship.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/rcmp-checkpoint-coastalgaslink-wetsuweten-1.5427015,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-pipeline-horgan-british-columbia-1.5425745 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-first-nation-gives-natural-gas-company-one-time-access-to-winterize-site-1.5424502 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/wet-suwet-en-coastal-gaslink-jan7-1.5417641 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-company-posts-notice-to-clear-way-1.5419257,N/A

Defence department wants to hear it,"The Department of National Defence (DND) and Canadian Armed Forces are asking scientists and engineers for help to develop a viable and cost-effective way to clean up space debris. While natural celestial bodies like asteroids and comets are considered debris, there is also a host of earthly objects polluting the cosmos — including inactive satellites and fragments leftover from their disintegration, such as screws and paint chips. Researchers estimate that as of January 2019, there were some 34,000 pieces of debris floating in space with a diameter of more than 10 cm. Jesse Rogerson, an astrophysicist and a science advisor at the Canadian Aviation and Space Museum, told CBC Radio's Ottawa Morning that since debris is orbiting at speeds of at least 28,000 to 30,000 km/h, a collision between a small object like a screw and the International Space Station could cause ""serious damage."" While space garbage is harmless to humans on Earth, it can pose serious risks to astronauts in orbit. In its request for proposals, DND said there are currently no ongoing operations to mitigate the risks of space debris, and existing prototypes of tools engineered for the task have proven ineffective. Last year, researchers tested a satellite that gets close to a piece of debris, launches a harpoon and pulls the debris into itself to de-orbit the object, Rogerson said. ""On prototype, that sounds great — you're grabbing a piece, you're bringing it down,"" he said. ""But, it doesn't have a large scale-up possibility with it. So if you want to take down, say, hundred of thousands of things or millions of things, you need to do better than that."" Now, DND is looking for innovative concepts and designs that will allow the department to track small debris and remove multiple objects of all different sizes. People have until Sept. 9 to submit them. While DND searches for ways to reduce debris already in space, scientists are simultaneously developing methods to limit the number of manmade objects put into orbit when rockets and satellites are launched in the future. ""Every launch we do, we want to think about the space that we're using,"" Rogerson said.  ""You want less stuff to fall off and you want to have a plan to de-orbit once it's not in use anymore.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/dnd-rfp-cleaning-up-space-junk-1.5236544,[],N/A

Stepping off the grounds of their high school, those with cellphones out, filming, knew what was about to happen. But the Grade 9 student in Windsor, Ont., into his first days of a new school year, did not. It happened quickly on Sept. 12 of last year. An older boy approached Jayden Trudell, 15, from behind and blind-sided him with a hard punch to the head. Jayden was then picked up and dropped, his head slammed into the pavement. As the video shows, he did not move. Yet the assault continued, with kicks and punches. ""His neck was bent in a weird way, so I thought he was dead,"" his cousin, Jaxson Da Silva-Trudell, recalled of the attack. ""I thought Jayden died right then and there."" Jayden was rushed to hospital in critical condition and spent months recovering from a fractured skull, a brain bleed and hearing damage. His attackers were expelled, charged and ultimately convicted of assault. ""No one knew at the time if Jayden was gonna live or die,"" said his grandfather, Kevin Trudell, a retired police officer. The approach of investigators at the scene, he said, was indicative of the seriousness of the assault. ""They treated it as a murder scene. It was [like] a murder investigation."" Jayden's case may seem like an egregious example, but violence in Canadian schools appears to be rife when you ask students directly about peer-on-peer behaviour at school. WARNING: This video may be disturbing to some viewers: According to a survey conducted by Mission Research for CBC News, more than one-third of students between the ages of 14 and 21 say they were physically assaulted at least once before reaching high school. Boys are even more likely to face violence, with four in 10 boys between the ages of 14 and 21 reporting they were on the receiving end of an assault involving slaps, punches, kicks or bites. In high school, one in five boys surveyed say they were threatened with a weapon. It's a sombre statistic that turned deadly last month at a Hamilton high school. Just a month into Grade 9, 14-year-old Devan Bracci-Selvey was fatally stabbed while on school property. It reportedly came after weeks of his family pleading with school officials to confront bullying at the hands of other students. In a tearful and angry statement after her son's death, Shari-Ann Bracci-Selvey said ""everyone failed my son."" Two students have since been charged with his murder. While the Greater Toronto Area is home to Canada's greatest number of students, the survey also reveals significantly higher rates of violence in its high schools compared to other regions in Ontario and across the country. Students in Quebec, meanwhile, reported the lowest incidence of experiencing violence at the hands of another student. The Prairies stood out for reports of unwanted sexual contact, such as inappropriate touching or grabbing, with one in four saying they have experienced it. An even higher number — nearly one in three — have experienced peers sharing a sexual rumour or message about them with others at least once, significantly higher than the national average. CBC News asked school boards and education officials across Canada to release their own records on violent incidents. Many refused or placed significant roadblocks in the way of accessing the information, including demands for hundreds of dollars in order to process the request. One board worried the release of such records might cause ""reputational risk"" to its individual schools. Faced with those barriers, CBC decided to go to the students directly, commissioning a survey of more than 4,000 young people. ""You first have to be able to identify what the problem is — understand how serious it is, how many people are affected by it — and then move forward with a plan to fix it,"" said Tracy Vaillancourt, a violence prevention expert at the University of Ottawa and one of the academics who helped design the survey. Vallaincourt, who visits schools regularly, said the findings are significant because they reveal a ""disconnect"" when it comes to understanding the scope of this issue. ""What schools tell us is that they've got a handle on this. And now we have youth telling us anonymously that we don't have a handle on it.… That disconnect is going to cause harm."" ""You'd also be hard-pressed to find a girl who hasn't had her breasts or butt grabbed,"" one respondent anonymously wrote in a comments section that followed the survey. ""A boy exposed his penis and ejaculated on the clothing of a group of girls who were chatting during lunch hour,"" said another. ""It was disgusting."" While one in four girls surveyed said they had personally faced unwanted sexual contact, perhaps most striking was how early it occurs — beginning as early as kindergarten for some. In Grade 4, nearly one in 25 girls say they first experienced unwanted sexual touching. By Grade 7, the likelihood increased to nearly one in eight. And this is contact that students said happened on school property. One respondent recalled seeing someone ""lift up a girl's shirt to show off her boobs in the cafeteria and everyone laughed while she freaked out."" The survey suggests the risk of unwanted sexual contact for the first time peaks between Grades 7 and 10, before declining in the final years of high school. Boys are not immune. Similar to allegations previously made at Toronto's prestigious St Michael's College School, one respondent reported unwanted grabbing at school that escalated: ""It was a basketball team that did it and they forced another male … to put a broom stick handle up his ass."" Read more stories in this series: Police were the first officials to respond when Jayden Trudell was viciously beaten just off school property. Now in Grade 10, the student has largely recovered. But even as Jayden lay in a hospital bed, friends of those behind the surprise attack threatened his cousin, who had witnessed it and jumped in to help. They warned Jaxson Da Silva-Trudell — and through him, Jayden — more attacks could come. ""If you go to a teacher,"" Jayden said, ""you'll get labelled as a snitch and that'll just make more people hate you."" The survey mirrored that sentiment. More than one-third of children who said they experienced violence in elementary/middle school did not report any of the incidents. In high school, nearly half chose not to report an incident. That finding is not surprising to Vaillancourt, though she says it should be a wake-up call to students and school administrators. ""If I meet an administrator and they say, 'We don't have a bullying problem at our school,' I will say, 'OK, well then you probably just have an issue with denial.' Because every school has this problem,"" she said. It's not that students don't know they should report, Vaillancourt said. Rather, it's often a pack mentality that influences the decision. Even when students do report incidents to a teacher or principal, the survey results suggest they are often left unsatisfied by the response and unsure about their decision. ""The school did not set up or follow through with a safety plan,"" one respondent wrote in the survey. ""I had to switch schools for this year."" ""I was told I was bullied because I was too nice and I needed to toughen up,"" another reported. ""If you tell people, it can make it worse for you,"" said one student. Nearly three out of four survey respondents said they were not fully satisfied by how school officials reacted after reporting a physical or sexual violation by another student. ""Think about the implications are for the [student's] future,"" said Vaillancourt. ""You have the bravery of coming forward, the bravery of telling a supposed trusted adult about this heinous act that occurred — and nothing happens. What does that tell you about when you witness it again or maybe you're victimized: what are you going to do about that?"" Though the attack on Jayden Trudell happened more than a year ago, his recovery continues to be monitored by doctors. While those who jumped him are gone from the school, W.F. Herman Academy, many of their friends are not; both Jayden and Jaxson have experienced continuing threats. ""School is more like survival of the fittest,"" said Jayden. ""I was more worried about the kids than my grades."" With his medical team's OK, the teen has also returned to one of his hobbies, boxing. The workouts partly serve to restore his fitness, but also his confidence. ""You know, let the anger out,"" he said. ""I feel good. I can always get stuff off my mind."" He's also moved schools — to ensure his safety and for a fresh start. His family doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of the teen returning to W.F. Herman, unimpressed by school officials who they say never called to see how Jayden was doing in the days immediately after the attack. When Marketplace asked the Greater Essex County District School Board for more information about what steps it's taking to prevent similar incidents, it refused to comment. ""We must decline your request for an interview, as Greater Essex County District School Board personnel do not discuss or comment on situations involving individual students,"" said spokesperson Scott Scantlebury. ""We have no problem being perceived by our communities as extremely protective of the privacy of students."" That comment doesn't surprise experts like Vaillancourt, who believes some schools are more focused on risk management than transparency. ""I could've written the end of that script,"" she said. ""This could've been handled differently, this could've been a teaching moment, right, where they could convey to other schools who could learn from this horrible incident.""

204,Alicia Bridges and Victoria Dinh,2019-07-22T21:42:04.762Z,Friend remembers Sheree Fertuck at accused killer's court appearance in Saskatoon,"Greg Fertuck made a brief court appearance in Saskatoon on Monday to face a first-degree murder charge over the disappearance of his estranged wife Sheree in 2015.  Fertuck, aged 65, appeared by video-link to set a date for a bail hearing but the proceeding was adjourned until August 14. He is also charged with causing indignity to a body, although her body has not been found. Sheree's friend Heather Mitchell, who was also friends with Greg after she met the pair in the '80s, travelled from Regina to attend the court appearance.  ""I just really feel like somebody needs to be here for Sheree and I'm sure I'm not going to be the only one, but I just felt it was important,"" said Mitchell.  Sheree Fertuck was last seen on Dec. 7, 2015 at her mom's farm near Kenaston, Sask. Her abandoned semi-truck was found at a nearby gravel pit the next morning with her coat, keys and cellphone inside.  Greg Fertuck denied killing Sheree in an interview with CBC at the Saskatoon Provincial Correctional Centre earlier this month.  He said he was the focus of a Mr Big sting operation — a controversial police tactic in which officers pretend to be criminals to draw out a confession.  Fertuck said he told undercover officers he killed Sheree but now says it was a story he made up because he was afraid of an undercover officer he thought was a ""crime boss."" Mitchell said her friend was a ""wonderful person"" who worked hard as a gravel hauler but liked having fun and loved her children and grandchild dearly.   ""She's just a really, really good person,"" said Mitchell.  ""I loved her a lot."" Mitchell said she feels relieved that charges have been laid over her friend's disappearance.  ""It's still really about, actually, the truth coming out which I don't know if it has or not, I don't know any of that information yet,"" Mitchell said.  ""But it's just really, really about justice for Sheree and her family. It was tough."" Last week the Saskatchewan RCMP announced they are looking for pieces of dark-coloured tarp-like or polyethylene material in the search for the missing 51-year-old.

Kristian Ayoungman was found dead in his vehicle on March 17 on a rural highway near Strathmore, east of Calgary. The 24-year-old was a Siksika Nation member and Junior B Hockey player for the Siksika Buffaloes senior AA hockey team, as well as a former player with Strathmore's Wheatland Kings. Two brothers, Brandon Daniel Giffen, 25, and Kody Allan Giffen, 22, are both charged with first-degree murder. Melodie Hunt-Ayoungman says she's struggling with a court's recent decision to allow Kody Allan Giffen out on bail with conditions. ""I was in disbelief,"" she said. But despite her initial shock, she says she still has faith that justice can be done. ""There's government changes across Canada in regards to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and with the judicial system … I do have faith in the Crown that they will do the best that they can do."" She says she hopes something good will arise from her son's death. ""Maybe it takes my son's life to make the world change,"" she said. ""The way people will see his true nature, about how First Nations are, because there are good people out there and my son was a very great man."" Reuben Breaker, a member of the Siksika council who has been supporting Hunt-Ayoungman, says he's less optimistic about the case.

208,Emma Davie,2020-01-18T20:00:24.209Z,'It will be a hub': New Halifax YMCA inches closer to opening,"After almost three years of construction, the new John W. Lindsay YMCA in Halifax is gearing up for opening day this spring. On Wednesday, the YMCA opened a community hub on Spring Garden Road to give people a chance to try out some of the equipment, learn more about the facility and sign up for a membership. The general manager says 300 people have already joined. ""It's really important so that people have a sense of belonging,"" Jim Pomeroy said. ""We want to make sure people are out of their houses. ""It will be a hub where people can congregate, enjoy, hang out with their family, hang out with their friends, meet new people and connect with everyone else."" Cathy Murphy stopped by on Saturday afternoon to pre-register, saying she was excited for the new YMCA to be up and running. ""It's going to be a great, well-equipped gym and, of course, we're interested in the gym part mostly, that's our biggest motivation,"" she said. ""And the fact that it's going to be so community-oriented as well."" Pomeroy said the facility on the corner of South Park and Sackville Street — which is 70,000 square feet over four floors — is ""more than just a gym and swim."" He said they will have adaptive fitness classes, like chair yoga, there's a two-lane walking track, an aquarium and a family and child community centre that can be booked for events. Until they open, Pomeroy said there will be pop-up fitness classes in the community. Membership manager Brittany Alminayan said she's heard from many people in the area who are eager to get back their swimming pool. But she says it's important for them to make sure the new space is inclusive for everyone.

209,Laura Glowacki,2020-01-04T01:06:40.655Z,"Ontario's rising rents hurt the poor, Ottawa advocates say","Advocates for retirees and people living in poverty in Ottawa are calling on the province to rethink raising rents in Ontario. Landlords can increase leases by 2.2 per cent this year. It's the largest increase in provincial rental guidelines in more than six years. ""A lot of seniors are on fixed incomes and really find it difficult when they have to face rent increases every year,"" said Rick Baker, president of Canadian Association of Retired Persons Ottawa. ""What is happening is it's pushing more people out in the streets."" Rent in Ottawa out of reach for low-income earners, report finds Norma-Jean Quibell, an advocate with the Ottawa chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, is calling for a freeze on rents until minimum wages go up.  Ontario froze the minimum wage at 14 dollars per hour two years ago, the same year it jumped up from $11.60 an hour. ""One of the biggest problems that is going on in Canada and in the western world in general is inflation with things like rents, food, gas, transportation in general but minimum wages and incomes aren't going up to match that,"" Quibell said. ""ACORN would like to see a rent freeze for that reason because if you're not going to raise people's income, why are you raising their rent?"" Dakota Brasier, a spokesperson for Ontario's Housing Minister Steve Clark, said the Progressive Conservatives are not responsible for setting rents. Rent guidelines are calculated based on the Ontario Consumer Price Index. ""Our government remains committed to ensuring the continued protection of tenants, including from unlawful evictions and keeping buildings well maintained,"" wrote Brasier in an email to CBC. ""It is important to note that landlords are not required to raise rents every 12 months, and if they choose to increase rent it can be lower than the guideline."" Rents in Ottawa have been steadily rising in recent years and at a much higher rate than the province's rent control guideline. Data from the private rental website, Rentals.ca in collaboration with Bullpen Consulting, found rents of condos and apartments rose about nine per cent over the course of 2019. ""It's been a tough year for anyone looking for a rental in Ottawa last year,"" said Matt Danison, the CEO of Rentals.ca, an online rental advertisement company based in Ottawa and Toronto. Many landlords are renovating older housing stock and increasing rents on properties that were once more affordable, he said. They're having no trouble filling them because of high demand. According to the last rental market report by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation released in 2018, the overall vacancy rate in the city is 1.6 per cent. Typically a healthy target rate is three per cent. ""Ottawa is one of the fastest growing real estate markets in Canada right now,"" Danison said. But property owners are grappling with rising costs of their own, developer Peter Deeb told CBC Radio's All in a Day Friday. ""We've obviously seen a big jump in hydro costs. Property taxes have risen and [so have] our maintenance and repair costs,"" Deeb explained. Maintenance costs have climbed, Deeb said, because landlords are now competing with larger condo developers to hire workers. Those developers can pay higher wages, meaning smaller landlords are also forced to pay more for repairs. These increases and dwindling profit margins have led to Deeb selling some of his properties. ""Unfortunately what that's done is it's driven all of the developers into the condo space to build expensive condos...and it's diminished the rental pool for more affordable housing,"" Deeb said.  Quibell herself wonders whether she could afford to find a home in Ottawa if she and her family of five had to move. The 35-year-old Quibell currently pays about $1,500 a month for a four-bedroom garden home in Accora Village, a rental complex in Britannia. The house comes with a dishwasher, laundry, central air and a parking spot. Ottawa-area residents love where they live, but not what they're paying: survey Her family makes ends meet with two minimum wage incomes and 45 per cent of their earnings going to pay rent, she said. Looking on Kijiji one day in late December, many of the housing options were too far from downtown to be feasible for her family and most costed in excess of $2,000 a month. ""A largish family could not afford these rents if they're low income,"" she said looking at the online ads. ""That's the kind of housing crisis that we are currently in.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/rising-rents-ottawa-ontario-1.5412991,[],N/A
210,Sara Fraser,2018-03-17T12:00:00.601Z,"How a P.E.I. student got into Harvard and says you can, too","Kailea Switzer had a panic attack and froze during her first mid-term exam at Mount Allison University — she says she felt like ""a fraud,"" that she wasn't smart enough to be there, and she was about to let down her whole family.  Now 30, the former Colonel Gray High School student has not only a degree in psychology and music from Mount A plus plus a bachelor's degree in education, she also has a master's in education from Harvard, graduating in 2014. ""I really felt like I was going to get kicked out at any moment,"" Switzer recalls from her home in California, where she's lived with her husband Greg Alsop for the last few years. Especially in her first few years of university, she said ""I was convinced everybody around me was smarter.""  Islander heads to Harvard for cancer research Harvard undergrad cracks code of knotted Inca rope used as 'an ancient Excel spreadsheet' As Grade 12 students across P.E.I. are busy applying to universities and buckling down for the final push toward the end of the school year, it's likely few of them have considered they could ever one day attend Harvard, a private Ivy-league university in Cambridge, Mass. ""I think a lot of times people don't think they should even try to apply,"" Switzer said. ""You don't feel like you're the kind of person that would be possible for — I relate to that, I felt like that for so long.""   Switzer, who's from a large, close-knit P.E.I. family (yes, her dad is Ron Switzer from platinum-selling P.E.I. band Haywire), said Harvard wasn't on her radar, either. In fact, she had planned for years to attend UPEI, like all her cousins, and hadn't thought much beyond that.  But then she won a Loran scholarship, requiring her to enrol in an off-Island university. Sight unseen, she chose Mount Allison because it was close to P.E.I.  Switzer had always been ambitious and a straight-A student, winning full scholarships to Mount A, but says she had to work hard for good grades. She became a ""systems junkie,"" developing what she considered workarounds to compensate for not being the smartest. After working as a teacher in California for a few years, Switzer recently started a business coaching students.  In a recent blog post, she shared her tools and strategies for academic success — ones she has used herself and is now teaching others.  While some students swear by using one big binder for everything, Switzer advises separate binders for each class. It cuts down on sorting and sifting to find what you need. Invest in a large, dry-erase four-month calendar that shows all your assignments, exams and deadlines for the entire semester, she said.  This forces students to consider their semester as a whole.  ""At a glance, you'll know your priorities,"" she said. Set a weekly work baseline, Switzer said.  ""Think of being a student as your job and aim for 40 hours of 'work' every week, including time spent in class,"" she said.  Aim for eight hours per weekday then if you prefer to do less, use the weekend to catch up. Approaching her time this way allowed Switzer to work 15-20 hours a week during university and participate in school clubs and activities, she said. This is Switzer's most important tip, she said — get a head start on school work the first few weeks of the year, before a lot of assignments are due.  ""Once you get behind, it's really hard to catch up,"" she said.  Double up on your readings the first week, doing the readings for week one and week two. Then in week two, you can do the readings for week three.  This way, you'll get familiar with content before class and ""prime your brain"" for it, she said. And if you get sick or go through an emotional breakup, you'll have a buffer of time. ""Do this consistently and you'll be shocked at how little you need to study,"" she said.  When studying, practise retrieving information you've ""saved"" in your brain. ""It's like looking for a file on your computer — if you've saved it with a deliberate file name, you'll be able to locate it,"" Switzer said.  Quiz yourself with the answers covered — ""this will reveal what info is neatly filed away and what has been stuffed in your brain's junk drawer,"" she said.   ""Take ownership of your experience and get help when you need it,"" Switzer said.  This includes going to talk to professors during their open office hours — something she initially found intimidating.  ""That was one of the things that helped me the most — getting to know my professors,"" Switzer said. See them as allies — they want to help students learn.  She'd even complete papers and assignments early and go over them with professors before they were due to improve her work and marks.  Use free campus writing services, counsellors, tutors and librarians, she advises — ""your tuition is paying for student services, so use them!""  ""Decide that growth should be difficult, and it should be uncomfortable, and don't be afraid to 'look' like you are trying,"" advises Switzer. Progress is what is important — not perfection. Embrace learning for its own sake.  Don't approach school as a burden or an obstacle, she said — this will reduce your motivation. Instead, realize how privileged you are to be able to get a university education. ""If you can shift to having that perspective of gratitude for the experience,"" Switzer said, you will be more successful.  After implementing and tweaking these systems, Switzer found her master's from Harvard easier than her first degree, she said.  ""For me, Harvard represented going as far as I could think of ... it became my version of the Olympics. It's just this dream I had to see if I could do it,"" she said.  Tuition was about $40,000 for the one year Switzer spent at Harvard. The school and her parents did provide some financial assistance to help her with living expenses, and Switzer spent money she had been saving for school since she was 14 to independently cover her tuition. She even deferred acceptance for a year to save more money and avoid a student loan.  And that first panic-stricken mid-term exam at Mount Allison? Switzer remembers she received a grade of D-minus, ""which was I think generous, in retrospect,"" she laughs. Switzer and her husband have purchased a home in Charlottetown and plan to move to the Island in a few months. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-harvard-student-kailea-switzer-study-tips-1.4577789,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-mental-health-services-forum-1.4576177 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-drugs-oversight-long-term-care-facilities-1.4577542,N/A

212,Anonymous,2019-10-30T23:53:31.356Z,Historic former Saint John church faces demolition once again ,"A historic and long-vacant stone church in the heart of Saint John may be facing its final days. The former Centenary Queen Square United Church, now known as the Gothic Arches, has been sold to a local developer. Percy Wilbur says it is likely impossible to save the church. ""Unfortunately, there's no profitable business case for investing all the money it would take to make the structure stable, plus all the money to renovate and convert the building,"" he said in a news release.   ""You can't get the rents to justify the costs."" Wilbur said in a followup interview he plans to build a high-end apartment building on the site, between six and eight storeys tall with anywhere from 65 to 90 apartments.  The huge stone building, which was built in 1882 and runs the length of a city block, has been vacant and unheated for the last 10 years.   The roof is missing hundreds of shingles, which are strewn around the property. The church is on the city's dangerous and vacant buildings list. ""We canvassed the immediate neighbourhood over the last few weeks and spoke to neighbours before I actually purchased it just to confirm that, you know, what I'm doing is the right thing,"" Wilbur said in the interview. ""And we were met with overwhelming support, like 100 per cent support."" ""I'm sure there's going to be people that are going to be sad and disappointed that it's been torn down, but hopefully we'll cheer them up with what we plan to replace it with."" This isn't the first time the church has faced demolition. In the late 1990s, members of the congregation realized they could no longer afford to keep the building, which could seat 1,400 people. They struggled to find a buyer, until Saint John landlord Phillip Huggard purchased it. He changed the name to Gothic Arches and tried to turn it into a performance space and home to non-profit businesses. But he had to put it up for sale in 2009. In 2011, he told CBC News that if the building wasn't sold soon, it would have to be demolished. ""If we're looking another five, six years well, will there be maintenance issues? You know, probably,"" he said at the time. ""We don't want that. We don't want to have big, big expenses that we can't handle."" He also said heating costs were running about $20,000 a year. The building was finally sold to a Toronto businessman, Jody McCairns, in 2012. He said he would convert it into condos and a community centre. But that never happened. Wilbur said he plans to dismantle the former church, trying to salvage as many of the heritage items as possible and incorporate them into the new build as special features. If the pieces — such as pews, stained glass, stone — don't fit, he would like to find them a good home elsewhere. He said he hopes to tear down the structure before the new year and complete the residential project in two years. Wilbur's most recent project was the renovation of a rundown 150-year-old building at Charlotte and Union streets that now houses an upscale art gallery and apartments. The church property is assessed at $75,000 for tax purposes. Service New Brunswick's website lists the purchase price for Wednesday's sale at $100,000.   Centenary Queen Square United Church holds the honour of hosting the first ever church-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the Maritime provinces in 1996.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/centenary-queen-square-church-sold-wilbur-1.5341803,[],N/A

A statement from the mayor says Bowman will be raising concerns about public safety issues. He has repeatedly said solving many of Winnipeg's crime problems rests with getting help from the other levels of government.

The case raises concerns about how to stay safe when online transactions must include real-life meetings. ""When you're buying something, selling something, connecting through an e-commerce site, you need to recognize that not communicating with strangers doesn't work,"" one of the world's experts on digital safety, Parry Aftab, told CBC News. Though communication is necessary, both buyers and sellers must remember they are dealing with strangers and take precautions for their safety.

215,Paul Withers,2020-01-13T13:54:11.709Z,Canada imposing mandatory gear marking for some fisheries in 2020,"Hundreds more fishermen in Atlantic Canada are being drawn into the effort to protect endangered right whales this year. Specially coloured fishing gear rope will become mandatory with the start of the season in every lobster and crab fishery in Eastern Canada. The rope must identify the region, species being fished and individual fishing area. The requirement is also intended to maintain access to the U.S. seafood market by demonstrating Canada has rules comparable to those in place for fishermen south of the border. The details were spelled out in a notice to fish harvesters that was issued by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) on Dec. 20, and make good on a promise made by the federal government earlier in 2019. ""The new requirements are part of the government of Canada's continuing efforts to improve tracking of gear, address ghost gear and further identify management measures threats to marine mammals, in particular North Atlantic right whales,"" the notice says. DFO says further management measures to protect the right whale will be announced in the coming weeks. The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act requires seafood imports to be caught under fishing rules equivalent to whale protection measures in place in the United States. Gear marking is mandatory in U.S. trap fisheries. After almost two dozen right whales have died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence over the past three years, some American politicians, fishermen and environmentalists said Canadian fishing regulations are too lax. Without further protections, they are calling for a ban on some Canadian seafood. Brian Guptill, a lobster fisherman on Grand Manan Island, N.B., said it's all about keeping the border open for Canadian seafood. ""In order to prove that we're not the problem, gear marking is the solution,"" Guptill said. The notice spells out the colour schemes to be braided into rope used in all non-tended, fixed-gear fisheries in Eastern Canada. One colour will signify the DFO region, another the species and, for lobster and crab fisheries, a third colour will identify individual fishing areas within each region. The scheme has been designed to distinguish between Canadian and U.S. fishing gear involved in whale entanglements. Gear marking will be mandatory for ropes attaching gear to the primary buoy. They are known as vertical lines and are seen as the threat to whales from fishing. A tracer line — a silver transparent tape inside the full length of rope — will be permitted as an alternative. The tracer line must identify the country, region, species and fishing area. Mandatory gear marking is already in place for some fisheries in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. About 150 lobster fishermen on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore will be among the first impacted by expanded gear marking when their season opens in April. ""They're well behind the 8-ball getting to us. There's some colours involved that we don't even know the availability of,"" said Peter Connors of the Eastern Shore Fisherman's Protective Association. He said he's not aware of a single entanglement in his area. ""If they cause some protection, they do some good then. The fishermen will do whatever they can do to comply,"" Connors said. Fourteen fisheries will operate with new colour schemes at some point in 2020. By landed value, the most significant species affected are lobster and snow crab. But cod, shrimp and squid trap fisheries, longline and gillnet fisheries are also being assigned mandatory colour schemes. The interlaced coloured strands must be a minimum of 15 centimetres in length and, at minimum, will be required at the top, middle and bottom of the vertical line, or every 27 metres. Guptill, also president of the Grand Manan Fishermen's Association, is resigned to what is coming. ""Any rope that isn't marked is going to be blamed on Canada or any fishery that it isn't marking its rope. So you're damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" he said.

Marie-Rose Gauthier was a resident of a home for autonomous seniors, Manoir Champlain, and her family said she was very happy there in her apartment equipped for independence. She was able to welcome family members and cook meals. But on June 23, she fell while out on her balcony and was unable to call for help. She was stuck there for some 36 hours until someone notified the residence that they hadn't been able to reach her. The woman was dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia when she was taken to hospital. She died three days later. Her daughter, Denise Ouellet, said it appears she fell face first and lost consciousness. Friction wounds on her mother's elbows show that she tried to get up off the cement floor, she said. Her family wants to see regulations changed and to force residences to better monitor seniors at risk of falling. But the Manoir Champlain's administration says the victim refused to wear an alert bracelet, refused to move into an apartment with more supervision and cancelled her telephone alarm system. ""We can't do more,"" said Nathalie Boivin, director of nursing and staff at the residence. ""It's a home for autonomous, retired people, and we try to give them as many choices as possible for their safety, but, you know, we can't force them."" Manoir Champlain is located about 170 kilometres north of Quebec City. With 404 units, it serves autonomous and semi-autonomous residents, as well as those in recovery. Meals and snacks can be served at home. Housekeepers and personal assistance services are also available. Boivin said she will respect the coroner's finding in this case. The Quebec government is also waiting for those findings before reacting to Gauthier's case. The government is already reviewing regulations surrounding seniors' residences. The discussion has been front and centre since Hélène Rowley Hotte Duceppe, the 93-year-old mother of former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe, died of hypothermia in Montreal this past winter. The Quebec coroner has since determined her death could have been prevented. Quebec's minister in charge of seniors, Marguerite Blais, is working on new safety procedures for seniors' homes in the province, ""so that never again will this sort of terrible accident happen,"" said Premier François Legault when the coroner's report was published last month. Andrée Laforest, the minister of municipal affairs and housing, said pride also plays a factor as autonomous seniors do not always want to be watched around the clock.  A province-wide seniors federation, the Fédération de l'âge d'or du Québec (FADOQ), says increasing regulations and monitoring increases costs and those costs are then passed onto the residents. That means, the organization says, that each new rule reduces access to housing for less-affluent seniors.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-woman-dies-93-senior-residence-1.5198082,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/coroners-report-gilles-duceppe-mother-death-1.5179581,N/A

The capsule will stay in orbit for a few days but won't dock with the International Space Station as planned. It will return to Earth as early as Sunday, landing in the New Mexico desert, NASA and company officials said. They said the capsule was stable and safe. Friday's blast-off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, went flawlessly as the Atlas V rocket lifted off with the unmanned Starliner capsule just before sunrise. But a half hour into the flight, Boeing reported that the capsule didn't get into the right orbit. Officials said the spacecraft's timer didn't work properly and it burned up too much fuel to safely make the trip to the space station. Because <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Starliner</a> believed it was in an orbital insertion burn (or that the burn was complete), the dead bands were reduced and the spacecraft burned more fuel than anticipated to maintain precise control. This precluded <a href=""https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Space_Station</a> rendezvous. This was Boeing's chance to catch up with SpaceX, NASA's other commercial crew provider that successfully completed a similar demonstration last March. SpaceX has one last hurdle — a launch abort test — before carrying two NASA astronauts in its Dragon capsule, possibly by spring. A successful Starliner demo could have seen Boeing launching astronauts by summer. But that might not be possible now. At a briefing, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said it was too early to know if another test flight would be needed before flying astronauts. ""I'm not ruling it out,"" Bridenstine said on whether the next Starliner might carry crew. Had astronauts been on board, they may have been able to take over, correct the problem and get the capsule to the space station, he said. It's been nearly nine years since NASA astronauts have launched from the U.S. The last time was July 8, 2011, when Atlantis — now on display at Kennedy Space Center — made the final space shuttle flight. Since then, NASA astronauts have travelled to and from the space station via Kazakhstan, courtesy of the Russian Space Agency. The Soyuz rides have cost NASA up to $86 million US apiece. The U.S. space agency handed over station deliveries to private businesses — first cargo and then crews — in order to focus on getting astronauts back to the moon and to Mars. Commercial cargo ships took flight in 2012, starting with SpaceX. Crew capsules were more complicated to design and build, and parachute and other technical problems pushed the first launches from 2017 to now next year. Last April, a SpaceX crew capsule exploded during a ground test. The U.S. needs companies competing like this, Bridenstine said Thursday, to drive down launch costs, boost innovation and open space up to more people. He stressed the need for more than one company in case of problems that kept one grounded. Thousands of spectators jammed the launch area Friday, eager to witness Starliner's premiere flight. The United Launch Alliance rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and was visible for at least five minutes, its white contrail a brilliant contrast against the dark sky. Boeing Starliner launch this morning. <a href=""https://twitter.com/NWSJacksonville?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NWSJacksonville</a> <a href=""https://t.co/2ZcwPeSRED"">pic.twitter.com/2ZcwPeSRED</a> The mood quickly turned sombre as news of the setback trickled out. All three astronauts assigned to the first Starliner crew were at control centres to watch the launch: NASA's Mike Fincke and Nicole Mann, and Boeing's Chris Ferguson. Ferguson commanded the last shuttle mission. He's now a test pilot astronaut for Boeing and one of the Starliner's key developers. ""This is why we flight test, right? We're trying to get all of the bugs removed out of the system,"" said Fincke at the briefing. ""There's always something."" Built to accommodate seven, the white capsule with black and blue trim will typically carry four or five people. It's five metres tall with its attached service module and 4.5 metres in diameter. For the test flight, the Starliner carried Christmas treats and presents for the six space station residents, hundreds of tree seeds similar to those that flew to the moon on Apollo 14, the original air travel ID card belonging to Boeing's founder and a mannequin named Rosie in the commander's seat. The test dummy — named after the bicep-flexing riveter of World War II — wore a red polka dot hair bandanna just like the original Rosie and Boeing's custom royal blue spacesuit. The flight was designed to test all systems, from the vibrations and stresses of liftoff to the touchdown at the Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, with parachutes and air bags to soften the landing. Even the test dummy is packed with sensors. On the eve of the flight, Bridenstine said he was ""very comfortable"" with Boeing, despite the prolonged grounding of the company's 737 Max jets. The spacecraft and aircraft sides of the company are different, he noted. Boeing has long been involved in NASA's human spacecraft program, from Project Mercury to the shuttle and station programs. Boeing began preliminary work on the Starliner in 2010, a year before Atlantis soared for the last time. In 2014, Boeing and SpaceX made the final cut. Boeing got more than $4 billion to develop and fly the Starliner, while SpaceX got $2.6 billion for a crew-version of its Dragon cargo ship. NASA wants to make sure every reasonable precaution is taken with the capsules, designed to be safer than NASA's old shuttles. ""We're talking about human spaceflight,"" Bridenstine cautioned. ""It's not for the faint of heart. It never has been, and it's never going to be.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boeing-starliner-crew-capsule-1.5403868,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-capsule-accident-1.5213155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nasa-commercial-crew-astronauts-1.4772011,N/A

Bella at Charlottetown Airport may be able to help,"Next time you're at the Charlottetown Airport there's a chance you could make a new furry friend. On Wednesday mornings, travellers at the airport will have a chance to meet — and pet — Bella, a therapy dog.  It's a new program organized by St. John Ambulance and the airport with the hope that Bella, a golden retriever, will reduce the anxiety and stress of travellers.  ""We know that travelling can be a really stressful experience — whether it's anxiety, fear of flying, delays, cancellations, all those things,"" said Vanessa Smith, manager of marketing and communications with the Charlottetown Airport Authority. ""So, to have a dog come and surprise you, put a smile on your face. We know that that can help immensely in the travel process."" Pamela Smith, Bella's handler, will be roaming the terminal, baggage and gate areas of the airport. Smith approached the airport with the idea to introduce therapy dogs.  ""Airports aren't necessarily the most enjoyable place to be … and there's not a lot to do and I guess you're in more of a closed-in area, so it's another option of something to do,"" she said.  The St. John Ambulance therapy dog program has more than 3,000 dogs across Canada that visit places like hospitals, schools, seniors' centres and airports. The program officially launched Thursday, but Bella has already had three visits to the airport. So far, customers and staff are enjoying the experience.  ""I think it just puts a smile on their face and calms their nerves. It's a sense of, you know, home. Maybe they have a pet they're remembering. So, I think it's just a positive experience,"" Vanessa said.  Some passengers are unaware of Bella's role and confuse her as a dog sniffing for contraband or a service dog that is not to be interfered with, said Pamela. ""That's kind of being worked out as well and explaining to people that this dog actually works for them and they're able to access her if they like to while we're here,"" she said. ""As opposed to a service dog that's supposed to be respected and working for one individual."" And, Bella enjoys the experience as well.  ""She soaks it all up and she's quite taken by most of the people here. When I mention going to work she gets quite animated and excited,"" Pamela said.  Pamela said she thinks Bella is an extremely empathetic dog and may be able to notice when someone is in need of a cuddle.  ""She tends to gravitate towards certain people. And I'm not sure sometimes whether that's just the love of dogs or whether she does sense their need,"" she said.  To be qualified as a therapy dog, Bella did special training with St. John Ambulance. But, Pamela said, she also got some extra training in special needs evaluation, which involves the elderly, children, how to work with equipment people with disabilities might use and how to work in closed-in spaces.  Right now, Bella only visits the airport once a week, but the hope is to add more dogs and visits in the future.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-airport-therapy-dogs-1.5385440,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dogs-adoptable-1.5230357 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-emma-spence-bikejoring-1.5142188 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/island-mlas-to-get-a-1-5-per-cent-salary-bump-in-2020-1.5385128 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-stratford-high-school-capital-budget-1.5385231,N/A

220,Zulekha Nathoo,2019-02-10T21:17:29.911Z,Grammys 2019: 'Music's biggest night' faces battles to stay relevant,"With a rap musician yet to win record or song of the year at the Grammys, several major artists reportedly refusing to perform at this year's ceremony and Ariana Grande accusing the show's producer of stifling her creativity, the ceremony often billed as ""music's biggest night"" is facing a number of battles in its efforts to stay relevant. Here are five things to watch for:  According to the New York Times, Drake is among the major artists who refused to perform at this year's Grammy Awards. His chart-topping album Scorpion scored him seven nominations, trailing behind only Kendrick Lamar, who has eight. But Drake's turbulent relationship with the awards show is raising the question of whether the Toronto rapper will even show up. Despite having multiple nominations in 2017, he didn't attend the event, explaining his frustrations in an interview the following day. ""The only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I've rapped in the past or because I'm black."" In reference to Hotline Bling taking two rap trophies that year, he added, ""I won two awards but I don't even want them because it feels weird to me."" Despite hip hop's domination of mainstream music, the genre can't seem to conquer the biggest awards of the night: record, song and album of the year. No rap track has ever won record or song of the year. The last time a hip hop artist won album of the year was in 2004, when Outkast took it home for Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. This year's album of the year hopefuls, which come from a larger field because the number of nominees has been increased, include: Despite the Grammys track record, some musicians remain hopeful. Toronto native Sevn Thomas — who produced songs on Grammy-nominated hip hop albums Astroworld (Travis Scott) and Beyoncé and Jay-Z's Everything is Love — says this year could be the one to finally make history. ""Especially black artists, we haven't really gotten what we've deserved in the past at the Grammys,"" said Thomas. ""I feel like now they're coming to the realization that urban music and hip hop music is kind of leading the charge."" Pop star Shawn Mendes, jazz artist Diana Krall and R&B crooner Daniel Caesar are among the other Canadians up for awards. ""We've always had talented producers and songwriters in the city, but it's like, now, everyone's looking to Toronto as a new hotbed of talent,"" said Matthew Burnett, one of Caesar's producers. Burnett has also worked with Childish Gambino, Eminem and Drake. ""It's cool that there's visibility now for us. The talent has always been there but I'm happy to have this moment to let it shine."" Behind the scenes, Toronto's Boi-1da, whose real name is Matthew Samuels, was nominated six times, including for producer of the year for his recent collaborations with Drake, Cardi B, and Beyoncé​ and Jay-Z, among others. ""I dreamed about this as a kid and it's happening,"" Samuels said about his producer of the year nomination. ""I've been working hard for 10 years."" Noah Shebib, known as ""40,"" is another of Drake's associates and is recognized with four nominations for songs from Scorpion.    One person unlikely to put the event in her calendar is Ariana Grande, even though she's nominated for two awards. She said Thank U, Next to Grammy show producer Ken Ehrlich when he told media that the superstar was asked about the possibility of performing but couldn't ""pull something together"" in time. In a tweet to her 60 million followers, she fired back by saying Ehrlich was ""lying"" and that she declined to attend because her ""creativity and self-expression"" were being ""stifled."" Grande went on to say they couldn't agree on which song she would sing. The songstress might offer some colourful reactions on social media from her couch, should she win. i’ve kept my mouth shut but now you’re lying about me. i can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken. it was when my creativity &amp; self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more. 🖤 Musicians such as Cardi B, Brandi Carlile, Kacey Musgraves and Janelle Monae are among the women nominated in top categories — an improvement over last year's notable lack of equality. In 2018, Canadian Alessia Cara was one of only three female performers to win a major prize. The other two were members of the band Little Big Town, who won for best country duo/group performance. While women are better represented in this year's list of nominations, a recent study done by the University of Southern California's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative shows a huge gender gap overall at the awards show. According to the report published last week, only 10 per cent of Grammy nominees from 2013 to 2019 were female. Of that number, 37 per cent were women of colour. Alicia Keys, one of the few women of colour in Grammy history to win song of the year, in 2002 for Fallin', will host the awards. The 61st annual Grammy Awards will be broadcast live Sunday, Feb. 10, at 5 pm PT/8pm ET, and CBC News will be on the red carpet for the event.

221,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-19T10:00:00.694Z,Late fee to renew medical licence in N.S. frustrates doctor,"A physician who is licensed in Nova Scotia says the timelines and late fees for licence renewals are another barrier to recruiting doctors to the province. Dr. Ajiri Ikede, a Dalhousie University graduate who works in Ottawa, maintains a licence in Nova Scotia to keep his options open. It's common for physicians to have licences in multiple provinces. Licences for Nova Scotia doctors expire each year on Dec. 31 and the annual fee is $1,950. Ikede incurred a late fee of $487 for paying his fee after Nov. 30, but before the end of the year. ""I said, 'How can I be late on something that hasn't expired yet?' And they said, 'Well, that's our policy as long as you don't meet our renewal window,'"" he said. Ikede compared it to home or auto insurance, and said it would be unacceptable to charge late fees early. It's up to each province's medical college to set rates and renewal rules. In New Brunswick, a licence is $600, but the late fee is $200. Ontario also charges a 25 per cent late fee, but that kicks in after the licence expires. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only other jurisdiction that charges a late fee before a licence expires. Ikede admits he was repeatedly warned by email that his fees were due. He's been licensed in the province since 2010 and never missed the deadline before. ""Imagine if you got an email the first week of November knowing that your licence is good till the end of the year,"" he said. ""That's not going to be on the top of your priority list of the other 150 emails you get that day."" Ikede isn't alone. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia said about 100 other physicians were issued a late fee this year. It said the late fees add a layer of protection for patients. ""Our legislation requires that a physician's licence is suspended if not renewed by year end,"" it said in a statement. ""When this happens, the first week of January may have cancelled surgeries or closed clinics or emergency departments."" Last year, more than 500 physicians renewed on the last day before the late fee took effect, the college said, while the remaining 100 were charged the $487 fee. ""These 100 physicians would have had their licences suspended by force of law, and patient care would have been interrupted dramatically,"" the statement read. Ikede said he understands the necessity for deadlines, but said the 25 per cent fine is extreme. He said it took five minutes to renew his licence online. ""The college is getting almost $50,000 every year just from late fees collected in the month of December,"" he said. ""That seems like a lot of money to me to be collecting and when you consider that the removal process is pretty much automated."" Ikede said he's so frustrated that he plans to stop renewing his licence in Nova Scotia. The college said it will waive Ikede's late fee and review the ways it communicates with physicians in the future.

222,Anonymous,2018-12-18T22:31:45.683Z,'Sad day for charter rights': Police take heat for new mandatory breath sample law,"           A new law that came into effect Tuesday allowing police to demand a breath sample from a driver — even without reasonable suspicion they have been drinking — has prompted both protest and praise. The changes will have serious consequences, warns one Winnipeg lawyer, while many took to social media to decry the change as unconstitutional. Police and anti-drunk driving advocates, however, say the new legislation is important. The Winnipeg Police Service posted a Twitter message Monday afternoon about the new law, which came into effect on Tuesday. ""Research suggests that up to 50 per cent of drivers with a blood alcohol concentration above the legal limit are not detected at roadside check stops,"" the WPS said in a media release. ""Mandatory alcohol screening will assist in deterring individuals impaired by alcohol from driving, as well as better detect those who do."" Winnipeg criminal defence lawyer Saul Simmonds says he thinks the new legislation is invasive and infringes on citizens' rights by allowing police to essentially go on ""fishing expeditions.""  ""And if a person doesn't give a sample that the officer decides is sufficient, they can be charged with the Criminal Code offence of refusing a roadside screening device,"" he said.  ""That has all the consequences of a criminal case."" Individuals also won't have access to counsel at these roadside tests, even though failing one could result in losing their licence or other consequences, he added.  ""If you don't have a right to counsel, how do you decide as an individual whether you should be answering questions or not?"" He said he expects backlog within the courts to get worse as people challenge the legislation on constitutional grounds. Not everyone is opposed, however.  Trevor Ens with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) says the organization believes the legislation will save lives.  ""Perception is what it is — that police, at any chance, can give [impaired drivers] a screening is something that will deter them,"" he said.  ""Getting caught is something that will deter people,"" from driving drunk, Ens said. In 2017, according to MADD, there were 24 deaths and 756 injuries due to impaired driving in Manitoba. The Winnipeg police Twitter posting received immediate reaction, with the majority declaring it unconstitutional and ""a sad day for charter rights."" Starting tomorrow, officers will be able to test a breath sample of any driver, even without reasonable suspicion that the driver has alcohol in their body. Driver's who refuse to provide a sample will be subject to the criminal offence of ""refusal"".<a href=""https://t.co/y30An4ljC3"">https://t.co/y30An4ljC3</a> The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states that ""everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure."" ""Rights are rights. We should all be concerned when they're eroded (or just snatched, as in this case),"" wrote Twitter user @wpgchrish in response to the police service's tweet. Others blasted it as a lunge toward a police state and expressed concern that it could lead to racial profiling. Some worried about it being the beginning of a slippery slope leading to police being able to enter homes without reason or warrant. New Winnipeg Police March. Hail to the leader <a href=""https://t.co/0xn98nugfr"">pic.twitter.com/0xn98nugfr</a> The mandatory testing is a part of Bill C-46, which was passed by the federal government earlier this year. It allows officers to order the breath sample if a driver has been pulled over for a lawful reason, be it a check stop or a traffic infraction.   Under the old law, officers required reasonable grounds to suspect a driver was impaired before demanding a breathalyzer test.     The Winnipeg police tweet had more than 140 replies and more than 240 retweets as of Tuesday afternoon. ""Test a breath sample, even without reasonable suspicion."" Will you also be looking to knock down doors without reasonable suspicion? This is an overreach of power. If you have no reasonable cause to suspect that someone might be intoxicated, you have no business asking for them to submit a breathalyzer. This is criminalising people for the sake of it, and will erode public trust. People CBC News spoke with Tuesday afternoon had mixed thoughts on the law.   Grace Adegunju said she was worried it may create issues of racial profiling.  ""They shouldn't be able to pull over anyone without justification. And I think that that should be a normal rule,"" she said.  But Pratipal Singh said he supported it, because many accidents are caused by drug and alcohol impairment.  ""It's not just about us driving our cars,"" he said. ""It's our safety.""

223,Elizabeth Thompson,2018-05-21T08:00:00.778Z,Students launch online campaign to scrap student loan interest charges,"A group representing hundreds of thousands of students across Canada has launched an online campaign calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to make billions of dollars in student loans interest-free. In a series of Facebook ads, the Canadian Federation of Students says the federal government shouldn't be profiting from student loans and should follow the lead of five provinces that have eliminated interest charges. ""The reason why we're running this campaign is because right now in Canada, there's a student debt crisis,"" said Peyton Veitch, treasurer of the federation. ""Right now, students collectively owe $28 billion in debt to all levels of government. $19 billion of that is owed to the federal government."" In 2015/16 the Canada Student Loan program provided $2.7 billion in loans to nearly 490,000 full time post-secondary students, according to the program's annual report. In most provinces, when students apply for financial aid through their provincial program, they are automatically assessed for a Canada Student Loan. Veitch questioned why the federal government gives interest-free loans to private companies while charging recent graduates higher interest rates than most people currently pay on their mortgages. The formula for calculating student loan interest rates has not changed since 2000 – prime plus 2.5 per cent for variable rate loans and prime plus 5 per cent for fixed-rate loans. The prime rate, the rate banks charge their best customers, is currently 3.45 per cent. Variable mortgage rates at most major Canadian banks are currently around 2.4 per cent. ""A government that has been prepared to issue interest-free loans to Bombardier — a private aerospace corporation, who then turned around and rewarded its senior executives with bonuses, should also be prepared to offer interest-free loans to students who are trying to pursue the post-secondary education that's absolutely necessary in today's labour market."" However, Employment, Workforce Development and Labour Minister Patty Hajdu dismissed the call to make student loans interest-free. Her office said the government has increased funding for grants, which means that students don't have to borrow as much. ""This government wants to put a post-secondary education within reach of more Canadians than ever before,"" Hajdu said in a statement. ""So we've focused on historic increases to student grants, which never need to be paid back, as opposed to repayable loans. This has put $4,000 more in the pockets of students who need it most over the course of a four-year program."" The government has also eased rules regarding repayment, such as not requiring graduates to make repayments while they earn less than $25,000. The federation's Facebook ad campaign comes as thousands of college and university students across Canada are graduating and facing the prospect of having to start paying back thousands of dollars in student loan debt that they have racked up over the course of their studies. University students graduate with an average debt of $16,727, while college students have an average debt of $10,172, according to the Canada Student Loans Program annual report. In the case of doctoral students, the average debt at graduation is $29,000. CBC News learned about the Facebook ads after they were gathered by a Facebook ad collector built by ProPublica, an American non-profit investigative journalism organization. CBC News has partnered with ProPublica to investigate the use of political ads. According to the information picked up by the collector, the federation has asked Facebook to microtarget ads to people who list on their Facebook profiles educational institutions, for example, Lakehead University or Carleton University. They are also targeting people between the ages of 18 and 30 who live in Canada. Political ads are targeting you on Facebook. Help us find out how. The federation's Facebook ads include the slogan ""Not in Our Interest"" and highlight different aspects of the question. ""Because of student loan interest, low and middle-income students pay more to access the same education as wealthier students who can pay upfront,"" reads one. ""This year, the federal government will make about $862.2 million in revenue from the Canada Student Loans Program,"" reads another. ""They shouldn't be profiting from student debt."" ""Five provinces have eliminated interest on provincial student loans — but federal loans have one of the highest interest rates,"" says a third. Veitch said Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island have eliminated interest rates on their portion of student loans. British Columbia has announced that it will eliminate interest rates. Two members of Trudeau's own cabinet are still dealing with student debt. According to their filings with Canada's Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, Status of Women Minister Maryam Monsef has an Ontario student loan while Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen has a student line of credit and his wife has student loans with the federal and Ontario governments. While the ads say the federal government collects $862 million a year in interest payments, a number Veitch says comes from an actuarial report, the government's Public Accounts show revenues from student loan interest of $662 million in 2016/17 and $635 million the year before. The New Democratic Party's policy calls for interest on student loans to be eliminated over the course of seven years. The Conservative Party does not have a policy on the question.

224,Laura MacNaughton,2019-10-17T08:00:00.557Z,High-performance? CBD-infused drinks for athletes coming as pot edibles are legalized,"Consumers eager to get their hands on cannabis-infused edibles, extracts and topical creams are one step closer today as regulations come into effect allowing cannabis-containing products to be produced and sold in Canada. This second phase of legalization opens the door to a wave of potential business opportunities aimed not just at the recreational user, but also athletes.  Toronto-based BioSteel Sports Nutrition Inc. wants a piece of the edibles and alternative-cannabis market, estimated to be worth $2.7 billion annually, with $529 million likely to be spent on cannabis-infused beverages alone.  ""The forecasted numbers and projections are massive. For us, that's great and that's the business side of it, but it was really a natural fit,"" said John Celenza, co-founder and co-chief executive of BioSteel. BioSteel, a popular brand among high-performance and professional athletes, plans to infuse a version of their signature pink hydration drink with cannabidiol (CBD). CBD is a cannabinoid that can be derived from cannabis or hemp that Health Canada says, on its own, doesn't contain the THC component that gets you high. ""We're going to take out the amino acids and add CBD,"" said Celenza about the new version of their sport drink.  BioSteel is partnering with a Canadian cannabis producer for its products and expertise, recently signing a deal to sell a 72 per cent stake of the company to Canopy Growth. The partnership is a no-brainer to BioSteel co-founder and ex-NHL player Michael Cammalleri, who has long supported the idea of athletes using CBD as an alternative painkiller and has been using prescribed CBD himself for two years. ""CBD became something that NHL players and pro-athletes and a lot of people were turning to as a healthier alternative to the methods that they were previously using,"" said Cammalleri. But just how safe and effective is CBD at helping with pain and anxiety? McMaster University professor Stuart Phillips says there are plenty of anecdotal reports about the benefits of CBD, but he'd like to see more science backing that up. ""The research that's out there is completely in its infancy,"" said Phillips, who is the director of the McMaster Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Health Research in Hamilton. ""We know probably a lot more about THC than we do about CBD, but we know very little about either compound."" The lack of acceptance among professional sports leagues regarding athletes taking CBD doesn't bode well for companies like BioSteel, either.   Currently, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and the National Basketball Association all prohibit players from taking natural cannabinoids, including CBD, citing a risk of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination in these products, which could lead to a positive doping test.  ""We take many steps to educate our players about the risks of contamination,"" said Mike Teevan, MLB's vice-president of communications. The National Hockey League doesn't outright ban athletes from using CBD products, but rather urges ""caution when using"" to ensure consistency with applicable laws, proper labelling, and lack of contamination, NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement to CBC News. Canopy Growth admits that the hemp-derived CBD in BioSteel products would contain ""10 parts per million THC,"" an amount they say would be so minimal it wouldn't be detected on a drug test.  In the U.S., CBD products that claim to be THC-free are already widely available, despite the fact that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) classifies CBD as a controlled illegal substance. In 2018 the U.S. Farm Bill legalized hemp that contains less than 0.3 per cent THC, which explains why many hemp-derived CBD products are available south of the border.  There are more signs that the stance on CBD is changing.  The NFL and the NFL Players Association have partnered to conduct their own research on whether CBD is an effective alternative for managing pain. In 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from its prohibited list, but in a statement a WADA spokesperson wrote that ""while in theory athletes are permitted to take CBD as they wish, there are no guarantees that the product they are using does not contain trace amounts of THC.""  The statement ended by saying, ""WADA advises that athletes use extreme caution when using CBD products."" ""Clearly we need to do some good research, I think, before I would make any recommendation, particularly to professional athletes,"" cautions McMaster professor Phillips about the use of CBD. Still, BioSteel's CEO says their new line of CBD products isn't just for professional athletes, but for the active consumer as well.  ""That's how BioSteel started, right? It was a drink for pro athletes, and as it got more known, everyday people started to use it. So really it's for people that are going through aches and pains or anxieties in their everyday life,"" said Celenza.  BioSteel says they're ready to go with the products, but the earliest their CBD-infused beverages will be available to consumers would be in March, 2020. Across Canada, other cannabis edibles, extracts and topicals cannot actually be legally sold in stores or online until mid-December at the earliest. Companies are required to give Health Canada 60 days notice of their intent to sell a new product, which can be done starting today.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cbd-drink-athletes-edibles-legalized-1.5322684,[],N/A
225,Anonymous,2020-01-17T19:53:40.340Z,"Hondurans, others forming migrant caravan presently in Guatemala","More than 3,500 Central Americans had poured into Guatemala by Friday in U.S.-bound gatherings known as caravans, officials said, posing a headache for the leaders of Guatemala and Mexico amid fierce U.S. pressure to curb migration. President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the region to prevent such groups of migrants from reaching Mexico's border with the United States, and the latest exodus from Honduras that began on Wednesday has been accompanied by U.S. border agents. The migrants, some travelling in groups as small as a dozen people while others formed caravans of more than 100, said they planned to unite at the Guatemalan border city of Tecun Uman before crossing together into Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his government was monitoring the situation as the migrants approached, saying there were 4,000 jobs available on the southern border, as well as shelters and medical help. ""We are keeping an eye on everything,"" Lopez Obrador said during a regular press conference. Lopez Obrador did not say if Mexico would seek to keep the migrants in the southern part of the country. Most Central Americans who leave their countries escaping poverty and violence are eager to make their way toward the United States. Under U.S. pressure, Mexican security forces have increasingly broken up large groups as they head north. On Wednesday, Guatemala's new President Alejandro Giammattei suggested Mexico would prevent any caravans from reaching the United States. About a thousand migrants entered Guatemala on Thursday, with local officials busing some of the migrants back to the Honduran border to fill out official paperwork, said Alejandra Mena, a spokesperson for Guatemala's migration institute. ""We haven't returned people from Guatemala and we have a total of about 3,543 people who have so far crossed the border,"" Mena said. At least 600 Honduran migrants spent the night under tents in a shelter in Guatemala City on Thursday night, sleeping on mattresses. ""Now we have more experience, and we know how to treat them,"" said Father Mauro Verzeletti, director of the Migrant House shelter in Guatemala City. Migrant caravans are not a recent development to confront U.S. officials, but they've enraged Trump. He made a large caravan heading north in 2018 a centrepiece of his campaigning on behalf of Republicans during that year's midterm election, though ultimately his party lost control of the House of Representatives to the Democrats. It's unclear what will happen if the migrants reach the southern border to make an asylum claim, or are picked up by patrols attempting to cross between points of entry. The Trump administration, after a policy of family separation was met with outrage, has moved to implement policies in which increasing numbers wait outside the U.S. while their claims are pending, a process that can take years. As well, refugee advocates argue that Mexico and Guatemala do not meet the definition of safe third countries, due to their rates of violent crime. Most of the measures have been challenged in the courts, a process that is still ongoing. Guatemala's former president Jimmy Morales, with weeks left in his term, agreed last July with the U.S. government to implement measures aimed at reducing the number of asylum claims made in the United States by migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador, averting Trump's threat of economic sanctions. New leader Giammattei said a top priority would be reviewing the text of migration agreements made with the United States.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/guatemala-migrant-caravan-1.5431161,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ussc-migrants-mexico-border-1.5280892 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dc-congress-migrants-hearings-1.5209447 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.5372303/u-s-congresswoman-from-guatemala-says-it-s-absolutely-not-a-safe-3rd-country-1.5372309 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-morales-us-guatemala-asylum-restrictions-agreement-1.5227768,N/A
226,Lori Ward and Jamie Strashin,2019-02-16T01:17:06.935Z,Sex offences against minors: Investigation reveals more than 200 Canadian coaches convicted in last 20 years,"This story is the first of a three-part series by CBC News and Sports on abuse in amateur sport in Canada. Read the second story in the series. At least 222 coaches who were involved in amateur sports in Canada have been convicted of sexual offences in the past 20 years involving more than 600 victims under the age of 18, a joint investigation by CBC News and Sports reveals. And the cases of another 34 accused coaches are currently before the courts. In Ontario, for example, karate coach Satnam Rayat was charged in 2016 with sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching against a nine-year-old student. His trial is set for this summer. In B.C., basketball coach Codie Hindle is accused of sexual touching against three young players. He is expected in court for a pretrial hearing in April.   The analysis by CBC shows the charged and convicted coaches were involved in 36 different sports. ""It's pretty gut-wrenching to see the findings,"" said Lorraine Lafrenière, head of the Coaching Association of Canada. ""There is a misguided sense of security when you drop your child off at the clubhouse."" The investigation involved searching through thousands of court records and media articles, and visiting courthouses across Canada. What's emerged, for the first time, is a detailed database of sexual offences committed by amateur athletic coaches in this country. The charges include offences such as sexual assault, sexual exploitation, child luring and making or possessing child pornography. Most but not all of the victims were athletes training with the coach. In all cases, the accused was charged between 1998 and 2018, but the offences may have predated that. ""These are just the tip of the iceberg for me,"" said Olympic rower and University of Winnipeg sociology professor Sandra Kirby, who has been studying issues around sexual abuse in sports for years. Kirby says sexual abuse is a very under-reported crime and she estimates there could be thousands of other cases where no one has come forward. She says sport organizations across Canada can't ignore these findings, and there needs to be ""massive reform across the sport system"" to ensure every child who participates in sports has a safe experience. ""There are people who, even with all of the information out in the press now, simply don't get it,"" she said. ""They don't get the magnitude of the problem.""   Stories of coaches and other sports staff abusing their athletes have been front and centre in recent years. In the U.S., Dr. Larry Nassar's abuse of young athletes entrusted to his care rocked the gymnastics world to its core. Nassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, where more than 150 women and girls said he sexually abused them over a period of two decades. He was ultimately sentenced to 60 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to child pornography charges, and was sentenced to another 40 to 175 years for first-degree sexual misconduct. Here in Canada, high-profile Olympic coaches have either stood trial or been convicted of sexually abusing their pupils, including national ski coach Bertrand Charest, convicted of 37 sex-related charges, and national gymnastics coach David Brubaker, currently on trial for sexual assault. Justice Deborah Austin is expected to deliver the Brubaker verdict on Wednesday. Twenty years ago, the case of notorious junior hockey coach Graham James made national headlines and was thought to be a major wake-up call for the amateur sports world in Canada. In four separate trials between 1997 and 2015, James, a minor hockey coach in Western Canada, was convicted of abusing six of his players hundreds of times, including future NHLer Theo Fleury. The case prompted calls for organizations to implement safe sport policies, including making it easier for athletes to report abuse. But all these years later, little has actually changed and organizations are still struggling to implement effective rules to protect young athletes, experts say. Lafrenière says CBC's findings could help create more effective screening and tracking policies for coaches. ""We're at a stage now where we need to come back and say, as a system, we need to set the right safety standards in the field house, in extended travel, in social environments, in social media to make change."" FACEBOOK LIVE | CBC's Jamie Strashin and three panellists from the world of sport take your questions: And, as the data makes clear, that reform needs to occur nationwide, across all sports and all levels of competition, Kirby says. ""No sport is immune to this,"" she said. Though some sports have no former coaches in CBC's database, that doesn't necessarily mean their young athletes have been spared abuse, she said. It could simply reflect that some victims haven't come forward, or cases that were reported didn't result in charges. Hockey, which has the second highest number of participants in the country, had the highest number of charges against coaches (86). Of those, 59 were convicted and eight are still facing trials. Soccer, which has the highest number of participants, had the second highest number of people charged at 40. Of those, 27 were convicted and two coaches are currently awaiting trial. Many smaller sports saw charges against coaches as well, including five convicted in equestrian. Helmut Krohn is one of those equestrian coaches. He was charged twice for sexual crimes against young female students. In 2016, he pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation and was sentenced to 45 days in jail. In December 2018, he was found guilty of two counts of sexual exploitation of another victim and was sentenced to two years in prison and three years of probation. Lafrenière says sports should be careful not to misread the numbers. ""There's a danger in saying, 'Oh no, that's over there in hockey,' or 'No, that's over there in gymnastics or alpine.' It's about the system,"" she said. ""Predators are smart people who look for points of access. So if they walk into a clubhouse and they see that young people are left unattended … that's where they're going to go."" In the first 10 years covered by CBC's analysis, from 1998 to 2008, there were 116 charges and 87 convictions. In the following decade those numbers increased to 239 coaches charged and 148 convicted. For years, experts say, sports organizations at all levels have created anti-abuse policies without actually knowing the full scope of the problem. Kirby says this data gives sports an opportunity to be transparent with parents.   CBC contacted 35 national sports organizations and 133 provincial sports organizations and asked if they had a public list of coaches and volunteers who have been banned and/or charged or convicted of a crime. Of the 86 replies, only seven of the associations — Skate Canada, Athletics Canada, Equestrian Canada, Gymnastics Ontario, BC Soccer, BC Softball and Judo Quebec — said they publish some form of this information on their websites. Gymnastics Ontario was the only one to provide the full reason for a suspension. Hockey Canada was among the national organizations that didn't respond. Kirby stresses that transparency must go beyond sharing information about criminal convictions. Sports organizations need to make public all information on coaches who have been reprimanded or suspended, because without it parents may never know that their child is being coached by someone who could be dangerous. She says full transparency and consistent rules available to all sports organizations — big or small —  focused on prevention will hopefully lead to a reduction in the number of coaches charged criminally in the next 20 years. In a statement released after CBC published its investigation, the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Committees said they will be meeting with the minister of sport and other leaders later this week. They say they hope talks ""will focus on better harmonized mechanisms and actions to address harassment"" and abuse from the club level all the way to Team Canada. ​Watch Jamie Strashin's report on The National: Editor's Note: CBC Sports acknowledges that it has ongoing contractual agreements to produce, broadcast and stream various events with several national sport organizations. ​For readers under the age of 18, if you have questions or have ever felt uncomfortable, talk to a parent, guardian or adult you trust.

Effective March 1 a second set of eyes will review all autopsy reports completed for cases involving homicides. The family of a toddler whose death in 2009 was declared a homicide is now suing for $2 million after the findings of Dr. Michael Belenky were called into question. And the province revealed last month that 13 homicide cases handled by Dr. Evan Matshes are also being reviewed after alleged ""unreasonable conclusions"" came to light. Requiring a second pathologist to review autopsies should highlight any inconsistencies right away, said Dr. Anny Sauvageau, the province's chief medical examiner. ""And depending on what was done, was found ... we would then address the problems inside the office quicker if we were to see there was a problem with an individual or a type of case,"" she said. Dr. John Butt, who established Alberta’s medical examiner system in the 1980s, said it is unfortunate it took mistakes to prompt the additional peer review. But he applauds the changes. ""It’s a good thing, these things evolve and I think it’s the right thing to be doing,"" he said. The second pathologist will be randomly selected from within the province and will add up to a month to the process.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/all-homicide-autopsies-to-get-peer-review-1.1223094,[],N/A
228,Kendall Latimer,2019-04-09T11:00:00.332Z,Sask. documentary series sends message that addiction doesn't discriminate ,"Megan Poole opened her eyes and saw paramedics. She was strapped down and confused. She had overdosed for the first time — but not the last. It happened on her brother's birthday in January 2018. ""You think when something traumatic like that happens, that you would kind of take a step back,"" Poole said. The Regina woman wasn't fazed. ""I knew what I was doing, but for some reason I was convinced that I was invincible."" Poole's story is one of several featured in the documentary series On the Frontlines of the Addictions Crisis in Saskatchewan. The series was produced by Saskatchewan Union of Nurses (SUN) in partnership with physicians, the Regina Police Services, teachers, counsellors and families affected by addiction.  Poole had started with alcohol, then turned to stronger substances like cocaine and then oxycontin. ""The second that I turned to that thing that took my pain away — I fell in love with it."" She overdosed for the third time one month later. Poole remembers standing in the kitchen with two pills. She can't remember swallowing the second pill, but figures she must have.  ""It completely tranquilized me,"" she said. ""It was a very close call. [Paramedics] Narcaned me twice and it didn't bring me back."" How to access life-saving take-home naloxone kits in Saskatchewan At the hospital, doctors considered amputation. ""I was laying on my right side basically for the full 18 hours,"" she said. ""I ended up cutting off all the circulation and the blood flow to the right side of my arm."" She said her kidneys failed, her liver was shocked and she severely damaged her bicep muscle. She said doctors saw ""the muscle was already grey and dusky, deeming it basically dead,"" when they opened it her up in preparation for amputation. She said the risk of infection was too high, so they didn't proceed. Poole spent 21 days in the intensive care unit.  ""For the first week week and a half, I was completely in and out of consciousness."" When she woke up she felt a little ""flick"" in her arm. She's been fighting to use it ever since, as she's been fighting to stay off drugs. ""I didn't see me being able to live with this demon on my back for the rest of my life.""  Poole said the fight is worth it and now she's working to break the stigma. ""The disease is ruthless. It will stop at nothing until it successfully does the job by taking your life,"" she said. ""The disease does not care who you are,  where you came from. Age. race, sex identity, higher class, middle class, lower class, it if it wants you, it will take you."" Tracy Zambry, who is president of SUN, shared her Regina family's story in the documentary series. Her 29-year-old son Wesley had used cocaine in high school, but started using oxycontin in 2010. ""It settled him down. He felt like he could then sleep that some of his pain went away,"" she said. ""He still can't articulate to me though if it was physical pain or emotional pain."" Zambory said the family started to unravel as Wesley sunk deeper into addiction. ""It was kind of a perfect storm,"" she said, adding that her dad was diagnosed with dementia, her grandmother's health was declining and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer all around the same time. ""There was a lot of stress and I think it was Wesley might have got lost in the mix."" Wesley began injecting the drug in 2012. Zambory said his addiction grew and at one point they found a rig — a spoon, hose and needle — in their home. ""I was devastated,"" Zambory said. Wesley lost jobs, had travel to Spain disrupted by black tar heroin and had ""horrific fights with his brother"" after he moved back home. ""It became very apparent that this just could not continue."" The family intervened and begged him to get help. He decided to head east to Holland College in P.E.I. to pursue a cooking career, but that didn't help.  ""It's like any addiction if you really haven't solved it you're just going to start up where you left off,"" she said. Wesley came back to Saskatchewan in January 2018 with the help of his concerned partner. ""He would use in front of her until she said that's it, that's just I can't do that."" His partner helped him connect with a methadone clinic. ""He said Mom it's a miracle I've got my life back. I can actually function,"" she said. She said Wesley is now trying to get his feet underneath him and has chosen a career path as a financial worker, but is fearful about leaving the methadone program. Zambory said it's important to know addiction can get anyone, regardless of their background. ""People think that an addict is a certain person from a certain area of low socioeconomic means.

229,Janet Davison,2020-01-19T15:10:47.189Z,"Harry and Meghan get their freedom, but at what cost?","Hello, royal watchers. This is your biweekly dose of royal news and analysis. Reading this online? Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every other Friday. You're in or you're out. You can't be a part-time working member of the Royal Family. After 10 days of intense speculation sparked by Prince Harry and Meghan's announcement they wanted to step back as senior members of the family, some clarity emerged with the latest word Saturday from Queen Elizabeth and Buckingham Palace. And while the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have gained some freedom, they may not have received everything they wanted as they seek to forge their new path, which will include some time living in Canada. ""What's proved impossible is for them to pick and choose what they are interested in undertaking while rejecting the role of a senior member of the Royal Family,"" said Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal author and historian. They won't be using their HRH titles. They won't be doing royal duties or receiving any public funds for those duties, and are paying back the 2.4 million pounds ($4 million Cdn) spent from the Sovereign Grant to refurbish their new home at Frogmore Cottage — a situation that had become a significant point of public criticism around the couple in the U.K. They'll keep their private patronages and associations, the statement from Buckingham Palace said, and Harry and Meghan ""have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values"" of the Queen. While there had been some speculation they might continue to do some duties on behalf of Elizabeth, Saturday's announcement ruled that out. It's clear, said Harris, that it was impossible for them to be part-time members of the Royal Family. As they step back from royal duties, that will include official military appointments, a move that seems particularly poignant for Harry, given his years of service and devotion to supporting soldiers and their families. Harris said she thinks giving up the military role was all part of the process of stepping back as a senior member of the family. It may also allow Harry more flexibility to spend time outside the U.K., because there won't be the interest or requirement to be present for military events that fall at fixed times each year. The announcement also seems to suggest Harry won't have the leadership role that he was taking on for the Commonwealth, following his appointment by the Queen as a youth ambassador in 2018. As much as Saturday's announcement offered some clarity, significant questions remain, particularly around security for the couple and who would pay for that — another topic that has become a lightning rod for public comment in the past few days. ""It's clear that's still an issue,"" said Harris. Buckingham Palace said it does not comment ""on the details of security arrangements,"" and there are ""well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security."" There is also little sense from Saturday's announcement of how Harry and Meghan might gain the financial independence they have said they are seeking as they move to develop their own brand. In the short term, the power of that brand is ""quite a lot,"" said Mark Borkowski, a British public relations expert. ""How to maintain it is going to be difficult. They're going to have to rely on a lot of friends to provide them with some of the stuff gratis — homes and whatever,"" Borkowski said earlier this week. ""I'm sure they can raise a lot of money for charities. I'm sure the foundation could be powerful. But I don't think it will give them the lifestyle money, and the further they get away … they lose that royal sheen."" Saturday's announcement suggests there was some sensitivity to the criticism that had arisen, in particular around the renovations at Frogmore Cottage. ""By paying back the expenses, that will hopefully lay to rest the controversy regarding how the renovations unfolded,"" said Harris. Harris said she thinks they are eager to keep Frogmore Cottage as their residence when they are in the United Kingdom. ""There would likely have been calls for it to be reassigned if they were continuing living there, and the money was not repaid,"" she said. There is also a sense that there may have been some attempt to further manage the public chatter around Harry and Meghan, given the timing of announcement, coming early Saturday evening in the U.K. ""There may be efforts to minimize the attention on it,"" said Harris. Still, how this all works out for Harry and Meghan remains a big question. The Queen said the couple and their son, Archie, will ""always be much-loved members of my family."" But while they have gained more freedom, said Harris, the door has also been closed ""to having an expanded role in the Royal Family if their new course does not unfold as they expect."" And there remains much uncertainty about how the public will respond to all this. ""I think sympathy for Harry and Meghan going forward will depend on what they decide to do,"" said Harris. If they move toward a more celebrity lifestyle, Harris suggested, they may lose some sympathy. ""If they devote their time to charitable work … that will likely attract more popular support."" Wherever Harry and Meghan end up living while they are in Canada, they won't be the first members of the Royal Family to put down roots on this side of the Atlantic Ocean — even temporarily. The first royal resident of any significant duration arrived long before Canada's Confederation. WATCH | Why Harry and Meghan are stepping back from royal roles Prince Edward, the fourth son of King George III and the father of Queen Victoria, lived in and near Quebec City and in Halifax in the 1790s.  But the experienced military man wasn't thinking in terms of a permanent residency. Premier and prime minister 'giddy' about Harry and Meghan's possible move to B.C. AS IT HAPPENS: Baby Archie may sound more like Joe Canada than Prince Charles if Royal Family moves ""He had an extended time here, but he always knew that time would come to an end even if he reached the rank of commander in chief of the British North American forces,"" said Harris. Still, there is the sense he enjoyed his time here. ""He found the social life was much more informal and he was able to appear in public with his mistress, Julie de St. Laurent,"" said Harris. ""He found it to be quite a change when he returned to Britain and there were clear social barriers to Julie de St. Laurent being his partner in a public manner in the way she had been during his time in Canada, where she was clearly acting as a hostess."" More than a century later, another Prince Edward — the one who went on to become King Edward VIII before his abdication — bought a ranch in Alberta. And it seems he had a great fondness for the property he purchased south of Calgary in 1919, especially in the early years of his ownership. ""He wrote to his mother that this was real life and he started describing himself in his speeches as a westerner when he was in the West, and as a Canadian,"" said Harris. ""That was pioneering in many ways for a member of the Royal Family to describe themselves as a Canadian when they were in Canada."" WATCH | Could Harry and Meghan make B.C. their home? Still, Edward's ranch caused some worry back home with his father, King George V, Harris said. His concerns focused on the possibility that it might seem one dominion — Canada — was being singled out and Edward could face pressure to buy land elsewhere, such as a farm in the Australian outback or a house in South Africa. A similar pressure might arise for Harry and Meghan, Harris suggested, ""pressure not necessarily to purchase property, but to spend more time in other Commonwealth realms."" Amid the speculation about the reasons behind Harry and Meghan's decision to step back, much has been said about the coverage they have received in the British media, particularly from the tabloids. Can living part-time in Canada really insulate them from that? Not necessarily, or perhaps not completely, even if their media experience while they've been in Canada has been relatively tame in comparison.  The British tabloid press has a unique history, said Borkowski.  ""It won't take long for an ambitious freelance unit to be set up [in Canada] … feeding not just the British press but the international press. Someone's going to make a lot of money from them moving to North America."" Readers of The Royal Fascinator were eager to share a wide range of views on the events of the past week. Several were willing to welcome Harry and Meghan to Canada, but not to see their tax dollars pay for their security.  Here is a brief selection of comments and edited excerpts from messages readers sent.  ""Although I can understand Harry and Meghan not wanting to live under old world rules, would the Canadian taxpayer really have to pay for their security? They are financially very well off. And as much as they seem to be a lovely young couple with an adorable baby boy, they should be paying for their own security. We have enough going on in Canada without having to pay for wealthy runaways who supposedly want anonymity!"" — Pat King, Toronto. ""I do believe, being a royal fan/follower since I was a little girl, that Harry and Meg should be able to decide on their own how their lives should be lived and where.

The president of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association said the union's 45,000 members will walk off the job on Tuesday, Jan. 21, after negotiations with the government broke off last week and no new dates have been scheduled. Liz Stuart said the government appears to only ""do the right thing"" when it is under pressure, so teachers have little choice but to take the next step in the bargaining process. ""We have not taken this decision lightly,"" she said. ""It should go without saying that teachers would rather be in the classroom with our students. We also appreciate the difficulties that strike action present for parents and guardians."" Stuart announced the latest job action the same day the union, known as OECTA, started a work-to-rule campaign that included not participating in standardized testing, preparing report cards or participating in Ministry of Education initiatives. The latest round of talks with Premier Doug Ford's government broke down last week after just two hours, the union said. Stuart said the province's team has shown no willingness to budge on key issues such as mandatory e-learning or class sizes, or make any pledge to maintain full-day kindergarten. ""The reality is, teachers are the last line of defence when it comes to stopping this government's reckless education agenda,"" she said. ""We will not stand by and let this government continue on a path that will have such devastating long-term consequences for our students and our schools."" Meanwhile, public elementary teachers stepped up their work-to-rule campaign on Monday and are planning for rotating strikes starting next week, while public high school teachers are set to stage the latest in a series of one-day, rotating strikes on Wednesday. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario is planning rotating strikes starting Jan. 20 unless there is significant progress in contract talks. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation has staged a series of rotating strikes and have also been on a work-to-rule campaign since November. Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Saturday that teachers in the French system have also announced a work-to-rule campaign, but the union would only say it will talk about the next steps in the bargaining process at a press conference on Tuesday. All of Ontario's major teachers' unions have expressed frustration with a lack of progress in talks with the government. They have been without contracts since Aug. 31.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-oecta-1.5425273,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/elementary-teachers-job-action-ramps-up-1.5424621 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-school-education-workers-contract-1.5298027,N/A

The illness was a result of exposure to commercially available nicotine products, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Thursday. The patient, an adult, started to feel symptoms including shortness of breath and coughing in early December, Hinshaw said. As symptoms progressed, the patient went to hospital where they were treated and later released, she said at a news conference in Edmonton. Alberta Health is not releasing where the patient is from, or where he or she was treated, in the interest of protecting the patient's privacy, Hinshaw said. The Alberta case marks the 15th vaping-associated lung illness reported in the country, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. In Canada, the definition of a vaping-related severe pulmonary illness case includes shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, with or without vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. ""With only 15 cases to date in Canada, it is not a common condition but it can be very severe condition,"" Hinshaw said. ""Vaping is not without risk."" Last fall, the Alberta government launched a review of its Tobacco and Smoking Reduction Act to look at ways of addressing a rise in teen vaping. Health Minister Tyler Shandro is aware of Alberta's first case of severe vaping-related illness, he said Thursday on Twitter. Shandro said he is expecting a final report from the review shortly. ""Based on its findings, we expect to table new vaping-related legislation this spring,"" Shandro said in a tweet.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/vaping-illness-alberta-first-1.5413065,[],N/A
232,Anonymous,2019-12-22T11:25:32.166Z,Hong Kong protesters rally in support of China's Uighurs ,"Hong Kong riot police pepper sprayed protesters to disperse crowds in the heart of the city's financial district on Sunday after a largely peaceful rally in support of China's ethnic Uighurs turned chaotic. Dozens of police marched across a public square overlooking Hong Kong's harbour to face off with protesters who hurled glass bottles and rocks at them. Earlier in the afternoon more than 1,000 people had rallied calmly, waving Uighur flags and posters, as they took part in the latest demonstration in over six months of unrest. A mixed crowd of young and elderly people, dressed in black and wearing masks to shield their identities, held up signs reading ""Free Uyghur, Free Hong Kong"" and ""Fake 'autonomy' in China results in genocide."" The protest comes after midfielder Mesut Ozil of English soccer club Arsenal caused a furore in China after he criticized the country's policies toward the Muslim ethnic minority in the restive northwestern region of Xinjiang. Ozil, a German Muslim of Turkish origin, tweeted that Uighurs were ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticized both China's strong hand in Xinjiang and the relative silence of Muslims in response. ""I think basic freedom and independence should exist for all people, not just for Hong Kong,"" said a 41-year-old woman surnamed Wong who attended the protest with her husband. United Nations experts and activists say at least one million Uighurs and members of other largely Muslim minority groups have been detained in camps in Xinjiang since 2017 under a campaign that has been condemned by the United States and other countries. Beijing says it is providing vocational training to help stamp out separatism and to teach new skills. It denies any mistreatment of Uighurs. Protests in Hong Kong are now in their seventh month, albeit in a relative year-end lull. Many residents are angry at what they see as Chinese meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest. On Saturday, Hong Kong riot police swept into several shopping malls, chasing off and arresting demonstrators pressing their demands in the peak shopping weekend before Christmas. The police's heavy-handed clamp-down on demonstrations and frequent use of tear gas have incensed many protesters, whose demands include full democracy and an independent investigation into perceived police brutality. The protests, which started in June, have pushed Hong Kong's economy into recession. Retailers and businesses have been hit hard as tourists stay away amid transport disruptions. The city's Financial Secretary Paul Chan, in his blog on Sunday, said there could be a wave of business closures in the new year if market conditions do not improve. ""Many companies are now clenching their teeth and struggling to maintain their businesses,"" he said, adding that he hoped the violence would stop.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-protests-uighurs-1.5406158,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/uighur-activist-china-cables-reaction-1.5373227 https://www.cbc.ca/passionateeye/features/in-xinjiang-china-surveillance-technology-is-used-to-help-the-state-control,N/A

RCMP Cpl. Jen Clarke said it appears his death was not suspicious. She said he was reported missing in the Saint John area late last summer. His body was found on Sandy Cove Beach on Sept. 8. Police are not releasing the man's name or his cause of death. Clarke said Nova Scotia RCMP would be assisting Saint John police to determine exactly what happened.  Last week, RCMP released a reconstructed image of the man's face after working with students in a forensic reconstruction workshop at the New York Academy of Art. Clarke said the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office had already been trying to identify the man with DNA analysis, and in the end the photo didn't factor into discovering who he was. However, she said investigators were impressed with the public's response to the image of the unidentified missing man and his clothing, of which police also released photos.  ""We're very appreciative of the amount of interaction we saw online — people trying to help and lending their ideas to the post, which is great,"" she said.   ""It was really overwhelming.

234,Anonymous,2019-09-27T23:31:11.274Z,"An art dealer disappeared with $50M. 17 years later, a documentary crew found him","Vanessa Engle's new film tells the story of Michel Cohen and how he pulled off one of the biggest art cons in history before disappearing for nearly two decades. The $50 Million Art Swindle debuted on BBC earlier this week and details Cohen's arrival from France, his many failed business ventures and his eventual rise in the world of high-priced art dealing. When Cohen started trading stocks, he watched his fortune multiply and then erode. Desperate and broke, he turned to theft. ""I first clocked this story in 2001 when it was in the papers and it just struck me as an amazing story,"" Engle told Day 6 host Brent Bambury. ""I think I am a bit of a fanatical person by nature, and I just continued to do online searches looking for Michel Cohen whenever I had an idle moment."" That went on for 17 years. Eventually, her obsession turned into a fully funded project with staff and a travel budget. She hoped to find Cohen but admits it was very unlikely.  ""If I'm honest, we never really anticipated finding him because no one had ever found him,"" she said.  However unlikely, that's exactly what happened. Engle credits her colleague's resourcefulness for the team's success. ""One of my magical powers was hiring a very amazing young woman called Billie Shepherd ... she is very, very good and very dogged,"" Engle said. Shepherd tracked down court documents in the United States and Brazil and used them to create a circle of people who knew Cohen. Engle contacted all the leads, effectively getting the word out. ""They are difficult letters to write. I didn't know if I was writing to people who maybe were harbouring a fugitive or people [who] were extremely angry with him.""  Those letters led the filmmaker to Cohen. Below is part of Engle's conversation with Brent Bambury.  What was it like to finally meet him? It was his wife who responded to one of my letters. She wouldn't really talk to me on the phone so she said, ""Come and meet me in this other country,"" which I did. And I talked to his wife for a number of hours in a cafe. She told me her story, which is an amazing story, but said she didn't want to appear on camera. She, at this point, still hadn't told me where he was or even that they were still together. And then I said, ""Well, why am I here?"" ... Then suddenly this man appeared at the table … and I did a bit of a double take because I wasn't really sure it was him. And then I realized it was — and in fact he and I were both sort of overcome with shyness, because I suspect he'd been waiting years and years for someone to come in search of him, and I'd been waiting years and years to meet him. And we were both a bit overwhelmed. How big was Michel Cohen in the New York and Los Angeles art scene? He had an extraordinary lifestyle. We went [and] filmed in his house in Malibu, which is the most incredible house on the cliff in Point Dume overlooking the ocean. It's an iconic [and] very beautiful house ... I've never been in a house like it. It's quite amazing. So he was living in that house. They had horses that they bought for tens of thousands of dollars. They had a lot of staff and he had a habit of buying and trading in extremely expensive cars. So he was living the high life. No question. How did he steal more than $50 million from art collectors? He sold paintings that were not his to sell. Art that had high prices ... Monet, Picasso, Matisse, Chagall. He would take them on consignment from art galleries and sell them to his clients and either trouser the money or trouser the paintings.  After he disappears he is arrested in Brazil. What happened there? He lived in Brazil for two years and then he was arrested. Interpol caught up with him and he was arrested and imprisoned in Rio. The way he tells it in the film is that he noticed the ambulance that took sick prisoners to hospital had broken down, that he spied this through the window of his cell. And so he had the idea that if he feigned illness he would be taken to hospital and it wouldn't be in an ambulance. And indeed he was taken to [hospital] in a private car belonging to a prison guard and he was not in handcuffs, even though the prison guards had guns. And at a traffic light in Rio's very congested traffic system, he jumped out of the car and ran for his life. What I would say is — and this is not in the film — I mean, we allow him to tell that story in the film in this extraordinary, grandiose way. What I actually also know is that a prison guard was convicted of helping him to escape, and I don't think it's far-fetched to imagine that some money must have changed hands. But Michel does not acknowledge that. He pretends that it was some extraordinary, miraculous act that came about through his own agency. There are some seriously angry people out there; they lost a lot of money. Do you think anything will happen for them now that your film has pulled back the curtain on Michel Cohen's story? I think the reason he felt safe in taking part in the documentary is because he is in a country where he is beyond the reach of U.S. law enforcement. And yet he doesn't have money ... so there's no point in anyone coming after him because a civil suit wouldn't get them any money at all, and the FBI can't get him because he's out of their reach. Did he show remorse for what he did? Well I suppose, as well as being an extraordinary story of this huge swindle, the film is as much as anything a character study. He's a very, very complicated character and a fascinating character. There is a certain point in the film where there's a little flicker of remorse, but more than anything he feels that his actions were in some way justifiable. And whether that's because he's had the best part of 20 years to think about it … [and] managed to construct a narrative in his mind that somehow justifies and defends his actions, or whether he always did that — I suspect he maybe always did that.

As a result, the kettle campaign will lose 12 days of fundraising.  The organization said they will also miss ""Walmart Canada's Fill the Kettle Day"" on Dec. 21, when Walmart Canada matches the donations made by people to the Salvation Army, to a maximum of $100,000.  ""To express how vital this kettle is to our fundraising efforts, in 2018, Walmart North Kettle brought in $12,650.75,"" the Salvation Army said in a statement. ""And over half that amount, $6,600 came in the last two weeks leading up to Christmas.""  Walmart Canada said in a statement that it is doing everything it can to re-open the store but needs to ensure the location is safe. The company says there is no specific target date at this point.  Walmart Canada said it will match donations on Dec. 21 and ensure it donates at least as much as what was raised last year.  Now Salvation Army volunteers will be set up at the North Canadian Tire in Regina.  Grace Brown has been volunteering with the Salvation army for about 50 years.

The Tire Recycling Atlantic Canada Corporation plant caught fire on Dec. 20. Since then, firefighters have been throwing sand on the flames to bury the fire. The cause of the fire remains unknown. Officials don't know how many tires burned. The company processes about one million tires each year. Thermal imaging from EMO shows the fire is still smouldering underground. ""We're sure there's still a lot of heat down there,"" Downey said. ""The fire may be out, but the tires are still hot.""  There's no way of telling how much is still burning underground, Downey said.  Even though the flames are extinguished, air quality and water advisories remain in place for Minto and surrounding areas.

237,"Karissa Donkin, Jacques Poitras",2019-11-04T14:48:22.396Z,Joi Scientific technology NB Power poured millions into doesn't work,"A Florida-based hydrogen company that received millions of public dollars from New Brunswickers has told shareholders that its technology doesn't work as previously described, CBC News has learned. NB Power paid Joi Scientific $13 million Cdn to license a technology that claims to be able to efficiently generate hydrogen gas from seawater to generate electricity on demand, something that would be a major scientific breakthrough.  Of the payment, $6.7 million came from taxpayers via the province's Regional Development Corporation. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas said earlier this year that the other half of the licensing fee came from a fund for research and development that is part of the utility's regular annual budget.  One of the company's patents claims it can generate hydrogen at 200 per cent efficiency. For one watt of input energy, the patent says two watts of energy in the form of hydrogen gas are produced. ""We've seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,""  Thomas told CBC News in May.  But this past summer, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy revealed to shareholders that Joi had been calculating power incorrectly. And, according to a former Joi Scientific employee, the efficiency of the technology isn't anywhere near what was advertised. Since June, the company has been using a new method to do its power calculations, Kennedy said in a conference call with shareholders, according to a record obtained by CBC News.  ""The results have been both consistent and disappointing,"" Kennedy told shareholders on the call. ""We've come to learn that the power measurements coming into our circuitry and going all the way back to the wall fundamentally show our current Hydrogen 2.0 technology has poor system efficiencies."" Kennedy told shareholders the company was in ""low cash"" and only had funding until the end of August. ""We're now seeking new funding based upon our new understanding of the system efficiency, realizing that it will have a significant impact on the company's valuation,"" he said. Kennedy mentioned a technology audit in his call with shareholders. ""Since June, [chief science officer Dr. Adam Wexler] and the technical team have focused on conducting a thorough technology audit and investigation into the current state of the art of our Hydrogen 2.0 technology,"" Kennedy said on the call. The findings of the audit haven't been made public, but CBC News has requested a copy from NB Power. The public utility declined an interview request for Thomas to talk about the future of the technology it has licensed. ""We have no comment at this time,"" NB Power spokesperson Marc Belliveau wrote in an email on Thursday. According to one former Joi Scientific employee, the claim of 200 per cent efficiency is ""impossible."" At best, the former employee said, the company could report 20 per cent efficiency. ""If you speak to any chemist worth their salt, they'll know that hydrogen from seawater is going to be very, very difficult,"" the former employee said. ""So how they got people on board, I'm not sure."" CBC News is calling the former employee ""Alex"" to protect their identity. Not only was it ""not possible,"" but Alex said the company's technology ""really wasn't even able to be demonstrated."" ""It never matched up with what they were trying to claim."" For Alex, a turning point came when reading the company's patents. Alex noticed some of the patents cited Stanley Meyer, a discredited U.S. inventor who claimed to have come up with a car powered on water. ""A lot of those [Meyer] patents kind of were very similar to what we had, and that's when it really became real to me that we weren't really doing the right thing,"" Alex said. Alex described the moment as ""a red flag."" ""I mean, the web page that I found [details about Meyer] on had Bigfoot and other very pseudo-scientific things on there,"" Alex said. Back in the spring, both Kennedy and Thomas talked about developing a prototype that could demonstrate the technology in New Brunswick. It was originally planned for 2018 and then pushed back to 2020, at the earliest. We'd like to be in a position, within a year or 18 months, to demonstrate to the skeptics that this can work,"" Thomas said in May. But Alex believes this was never realistic because ""it was never a real proven mechanism to begin with."" For weeks, CBC News called and emailed Joi Scientific and its executives, trying to reach someone to ask questions about the status of the company and its technology, but those requests were not successful. The menu that used to play when you called the company's phone line — 209-PURE-JOI — disappeared. An employee with the public relations agency that previously helped set up an interview with Kennedy said in a September email that ""we no longer have any engagement with Joi Scientific."" But a spokesperson for NB Power said the company was still ""operational."" So CBC News travelled to Florida to try to speak to Joi Scientific executives. A reporter asked to speak to someone from Joi Scientific at the company's Merritt Island headquarters, tucked into the Space Life Sciences Lab in an area locals call the Space Coast. Joi Scientific chief financial officer Kurt Frahn came out to meet the reporter. But he refused to answer any questions about the state of the technology, saying the company is private and doesn't speak to the media. CBC News also went to Kennedy's Miami Beach condo building to ask to speak with him. Through his concierge, Kennedy said, ""We're not interested."" In an email later that day, Joi Scientific's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, said the company wouldn't be available for interviews. ""As for our status, we are continuing to work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power,"" Harris wrote in an email. Asked again on Wednesday for an interview, Harris wrote, ""We are unable to discuss our technology due to non-disclosure agreements."" With the future of the company and its technology in doubt, Alex said Joi Scientific has cut down on staffing and lab space. Records obtained by CBC News through access to information show NB Power opened its own lab in Florida to work with Joi Scientific. The utility spent more than $74,000 on costs associated with the lab between Jan. 1, 2018, and May 15, 2019.  It's not clear whether NB Power is still operating a lab in Florida. In May, the utility's chief financial officer, Darren Murphy, told the Energy and Utilities Board that the $13 million licensing fee was ""a small amount"" compared to NB Power's costs if it didn't find an alternative fuel source for its Belledune generating station. The federal government's climate plan requires Belledune to phase out coal by 2030. Murphy told the EUB the utility recognizes that such spending ""will not always turn out with a positive outcome, and there will be some need to invest some amount of money that ultimately may not pan out."" He also told the EUB he couldn't say whether Joi was financially viable. Energy and Resource Development Minister Mike Holland learned about issues with Joi Scientific's technology from CBC News's reporting. He said he'd received briefings from NB Power about Joi Scientific, but that was not part of it. He said he's looking for more information from NB Power. ""I don't feel the need to enter into any kind of knee-jerk reaction,"" Holland told reporters on Thursday. ""Money that's spent is money that's spent. I'm looking at where we're going from here, and I am not interested in talking about any projects that aren't going to deliver results."" Alex said he believes that hydrogen ""attracts a lot of the muddying between what's real science and what isn't"" because most people don't understand how it works. ""Because people don't have that level of technical understanding, they don't have those levels of scientific background, it makes it easy to kind of talk around the subject or navigate through the subject with scientific-sounding terminology, scientific-sounding explanations that don't really pan out."" Alex decided to speak out for NB Power ratepayers. ""I think people have the right to know where, how their money's being spent.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-technology-update-1.5340245,[],N/A

Stephen said most people are wearing masks and eye protection.  They are keeping their kids indoors, to protect them from the ash.  ""We are quite concerned about their health though, for sure."" An added concern is access to suitable food for their 10-month-old daughter, Gabrielle. Stephen said she has a dietary condition, which means there are many foods she can't eat. The family brought their own food on the trip with them, but never expected they would be there so long. They've been able to find food locally, but the situation is stressful, Stephen said.  ""We're really trying to get back home to get her diet back on track here, for her health.""  Stephen said the conditions in the community where his family is staying are ""pretty stable,"" but he worries things could get worse before they are able to leave. The volcano continued to send out plumes of ash throughout the week. ""We are getting, you know, daily reports from the news that there could be a catastrophic eruption with this volcano,"" Stephen said.  ""We're living our daily lives here, but there's always that, you know, that stress in the back of our minds that you know something worse could happen, and we'd be stuck here for much much longer.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bell-family-stuck-in-philippines-1.5431468,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/volcano-philippines-evacuations-taal-1.5429720 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-westjet-charlottetown-calgary-jan-2020-1.5430670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-program-seniors-chours-jan-2020-1.5431114,N/A
239,Katerina Georgieva,2019-12-05T10:00:00.967Z,Students in southwestern Ontario are singing 'O Canada' in Ojibway,"While most schools across the country begin their days with the singing of the national anthem in English or French, some students in Southwestern Ontario are learning the anthem a different way.  At McNaughton Avenue Public School in Chatham, Ont., students have been singing O Canada in the Ojibway language — and it all started in Beth Gellner's Grade 2 classroom.  ""We took a look at the national anthem to see, what's the difference in thinking?"" she explained. After participating in an in-depth Indigenous training course, which included field trips to nearby First Nations as well as studying the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Gellner was determined to fold that into her teaching on a daily basis.  That's when she decided to teach her students how to sing the national anthem in Ojibway. For help, she turned to Gretchen Sands-Gamble, the elementary Indigenous education special projects teacher with the Lambton Kent District School Board (LKDSB), who is from Walpole Island First Nation. Sands-Gamble explained that the Ojibway translation has a different meaning when compared to the English and French versions of the anthem. ""When you read the lyrics as they're translated from Ojibway to English, you will notice that there is a lot of focus on loving the land and loving creation and honouring all of creation,"" she said.  ""And that was something that I made sure to talk about with the students ... that world view that all of creation is important and that we as Indigenous people recognize that."" The learning process for the kids included creating drawings based on the discussions around the meaning of the anthem.  ""There's lots of hearts ... because it talks of love,"" Gellner explained.  ""And lots of mountains because it talks of the North."" Making the experience even more personal for Sands-Gamble, the version of O Canada that she's been using to teach the students is from an old recording of the late Ellen Sands from Walpole Island First Nation, who is a distant relative of hers. She says she found the recording on an old cassette tape at her parents' house years ago.   In addition to listening to the music and teaching the students the anthem, Sands-Gamble also brought in a hand-made drum which the students sang along with. She also had them talk about promises that they could make to the land, like taking care of the water, not littering, picking up garbage and not taking more than they need. ""It was wonderful."" Gellner said. ""I wouldn't have done it without her."" And the experience resonated with students. ""I like it a lot because it's a new language for me,"" said Grade 2 student Abbey Killingsworth. Classmate Eden Hessel said she enjoyed learning something that was ""different."" ""My favourite part is 'Naaniibwida miigwechiiwendandaa,' and that means, 'Stand up, let us say thank you,'"" she said. While it all started with the Grade 2 students, the Ojibway language version of the anthem is now spreading throughout the school.  Prior to Gellner's decision to teach her students, the school had only ever played the anthem in English and French. She explained that's because the school doesn't have a large number of First Nations students, but added that the anthem is still important to the region.  ""People around here — this is their territory — speak Ojibway. So we should have it."" Gellner even formed a choir made up of some of her former students in upper grades, and taught them the anthem as well.  They then put together a video of the choir singing the anthem in Ojibway. That recording is now being used during morning video announcements throughout the school, on rotation.  Sands-Gamble said hearing the anthem in Ojibway means a lot to her, as well as to others from nearby First Nations.  ""It's so important and empowering for students to hear their language and their stories and perspectives shared in the school."" McNaughton Ave. Public School isn't the only school turning to Indigenous versions of O Canada, however. Sands-Gamble has already been getting calls from other teachers throughout the region to help them learn the anthem in Ojibway as well.  Furthermore, since she started working with the board last year, she's distributed the Ellen Sands recording of the anthem to schools across the LKDSB for them to play if they so choose.  Sands-Gamble added that public schools in Ridgetown, Ont. have been singing the anthem in the Lenaapé language too. ""I think that all the schools are starting to catch on to say, this has value,"" she said.  Meanwhile, some schools that are part of the St. Clair Catholic School Board in the same part of the province also play the anthem in Ojibway, though there's no formal system of rotation. Some schools in the region with large Indigenous populations — like Wallaceburg District Secondary School near Walpole Island First Nation — have been playing an Ojibway-language version of the anthem for years. Indigenous students at Wallaceburg Secondary said it means a lot to them to hear that version of anthem.  ""It makes me feel like they're not forgetting about our culture and who we are as people,"" said Grade 11 student Tymmiecka Johnson-Greenbird. ""We speak that language too,"" said Savannah Byerly, a Grade 9 student at Wallaceburg Secondary.  ""I think that's really nice of them, to just consider us."" At McNaughton Avenue, Gellner said the days the kids get to sing the national anthem in Ojibway are their favourites.  ""If I mess up, the kids are on me,"" she said.  ""'No Madame, it's Ojibway today. Ojibway is the best!'"" Gellner said this is ultimately her training in action.  ""It really makes me happy that I can do that and that I'm bringing this in and ... I'm going to continue to bring things in that are different.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/students-southwestern-ontario-singing-o-canada-ojibwe-1.5384227,[],N/A
240,"Jorge Barrera, Lynette Fortune",2019-03-04T09:00:00.976Z,Police hunted for secret church archives during probe of abuse allegations at St. Anne's residential school,"When OPP Det. Greg Delguidice was preparing to look into widespread allegations of physical and sexual abuse by priests, nuns and staff at St. Anne's Indian Residential School in northern Ontario, he did some homework first. As part of the investigation 25 years ago, Delguidice studied up on the Roman Catholic Church's canon law and learned of archives held by dioceses that contain records of sensitive information about priests.  ""I know that the Catholic Church also keeps a secret archive, and matters of temporal affairs, as they're so-called, are supposed to be kept secret and hidden away,"" Delguidice said in an interview with The Fifth Estate's Gillian Findlay.  ""Any allegations that would have been made would have been, in my view, probably kept in secret archives somewhere.""  But when Delguidice confronted Bishop Emeritus Jules Leguerrier, who had been St. Anne's principal from 1944 to 1975, about the ""secret archives,"" he got nowhere.  Delguidice said he challenged Leguerrier after a search of the Moosonee diocese in 1994.  ""I spoke back and forth with him for about 10 minutes on the matter,"" said Delguidice, ""and basically said, I know you're supposed to tell me that you don't have secret archives, but you're supposed to have secret archives.""  Delguidice said Leguerrier responded saying, ""No, no. There's nothing like that.""  The OPP executed several other search warrants during the investigation, including at the Fort Albany Mission House, the Oblates offices in Montreal and Ottawa, along with a Sisters of Charity building in Ottawa.  None of the searches unearthed a secret archive, said Delguidice.  ""Outside of the one reference to the electric chair in one of the historical codexes, there were no allegations that were evident in any of the records that we found."" Delguidice said he could only go so far in a search. ""I wasn't about to start tearing down the walls in the diocese building to try and find something that may or may not have been there.""   Delguidice said he concluded during the investigation that the abuse at St. Anne's was systemic and committed openly.  ""I mean, if the principal of the school is going around publicly whipping people for insubordination of any kind, surely to God they knew what was going on.""  Which is why he searched for secret archives.  ""The code of the canon law says that they'll keep all records of everything that happens every day, much like police officers do with their notebooks,"" he said.  But he came up empty.  Leguerrier maintained a wall of denial in the face of the OPP investigation until his death in 1995.  Delguidice said the OPP was preparing to charge him with assault for whipping a girl 10 times and bloodying her nose in December 1950.  ""By the time the charge phase came around, he was dead,"" Delguidice said.  Leguerrier was named more than 400 times in interviews with the OPP and in evidence submitted by survivors during the residential school compensation hearings, known as the Independent Assessment Process, which produced person of interest reports on individuals accused of abuse.  Another Oblate priest who worked at St. Anne's, Father Arthur Lavoie, was named in more than 300 complaints of physical and sexual abuse, according to his person of interest report.    One survivor testified that Lavoie sexually assaulted him using holy water as a lubricant. The survivor said he was raped between 20 to 25 times by Lavoie over three years.    Lavoie died in 1991.  While Leguerrier maintained there were no archives, that position is rejected by experts who say that all Catholic Church dioceses and orders kept secret archives.  Thomas Doyle, a former Dominican priest and tribunal judge with the Archdiocese of Chicago, said Leguerrier lied to Delguidice when he denied the existence of the secret archive.  ""That's a lie. They do know,"" said Doyle, who has been called as an expert witness more than 500 times in civil cases around the world on behalf of Catholic Church abuse victims.  Doyle, who wrote a 1985 report warning that the Catholic Church faced a child sex abuse crisis, said all dioceses and orders follow canon law that dates back to about the 10th century. And they all keep a secret archive accessible only by the bishop.  He said the secret archive was originally conceived to keep things like records of ""secret marriages"" or ""secret ordinations to the priesthood"" in areas where the Catholic Church was persecuted.  ""It's part and parcel with the structure of the Catholic Church.""  The secret archives are now playing a central role in the global sex abuse scandal that has engulfed the Catholic Church.  In August 2018, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro released a grand jury report based on files obtained from the secret archives that revealed more 300 priests abused more than 1,000 children in the state over 70 years.  But in Canada, there has been no acknowledgment or discovery of secret Catholic Church archives.  The Catholic Church was required to turn over all records related to residential schools as part of the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement finalized in 2006.  The records were transferred to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was created by the settlement agreement to probe the history of residential schools. However, none of the documents provided by the Catholic Church to the TRC resembles what was found in the secret archives of the Pennsylvania dioceses.   Doyle said that the Catholic Church can't be trusted to willingly turn over all records and must be forced to do so through the muscle of law enforcement.  ""You're not going to get this information voluntarily. You have to take it,"" said Doyle. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Quebec said in a statement sent to The Fifth Estate that they complied with the requirements of the settlement agreement. ""One aspect of our participation in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a sharing of our documentation on residential schools, including St. Anne's in Fort Albany,"" said the statement.  The statement said the documents are now in the hands of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation in Winnipeg.  Among the records turned over by the Oblates to the TRC were the personnel files for Leguerrier and Lavoie.  The files contained newspaper clippings about an OPP citation given to Lavoie and the announcement of Leguerrier's appointment as Vicar Apostolic of James Bay.  Ry Moran, executive director of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, which is the repository for all historical residential school files gathered by the TRC, said the Leguerrier and Lavoie files contained little of value.  ""The information within these files are largely complimentary and do not contain any objective assessments or evaluations,"" said Moran.  Tom McMahon, former general counsel for the TRC, said the document production from the Catholic Church was ""appalling.""  McMahon said of the about 88 separate Catholic Church entities that were signatories to the settlement agreement, very few actually turned over records. He said most of the records came from more ""corporate level"" archives. ""We have no ability to know how thorough the record disclosure was,"" he said. ""We know that they fought to limit the definitions of relevance where no other party engaged in the same kind of fight."" McMahon said the TRC did not receive any records on the existence of secret archives. ""I suspect records that related to child abuse and such would wind up in in Rome, in the Vatican, and may not necessarily be held within individual parishes, but that is a guess on my part,"" he said.   Some residential school survivors are still calling on the Catholic Church to hand over all its residential school-related documents.  St. Anne's residential school survivor Evelyn Korkmaz called for the release of all the church's residential school files during a Feb. 20 media conference on the eve of Pope Francis's Vatican summit on the Catholic Church's global sex abuse crisis.  ""I would also like [Pope Francis] to release these documents of abuse and let us rewrite the Canadian history, the true Canadian history,"" said Korkmaz, who spoke at the media conference organized by the group Ending Clergy Abuse.    The TRC report found that 68 per cent of the compensation claims came from survivors who attended Catholic Church-run schools.  Some of the patterns outlined in the TRC report — priests leaving a trail of abuse, a convicted child abuser recommended to head residential schools, a bishop charged with rape — are familiar to Boston attorney Mitchell Garabedian.  In 2002, Garabedian obtained a $10-million settlement for 86 people abused by Father John Geoghan of the Boston Archdiocese.  His work was featured in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigation and the Oscar-winning film Spotlight that examined clergy sex abuse and the coverup of it in the Boston archdiocese.  Garabedian said it took him years to get the secret files, which proved pivotal to his case because of the details they contained.  ""They talk about accusations, naming the priest, naming the victim, naming the victim's parents, where the abuse took place, whether the priest was in a home for a treatment centre,"" said Garabedian. ""It is really quite a bit of information and it is all ugly, evil and criminal.""  The repercussions from the discovery of the secret archive are still felt today, he said. ""It was what eventually led to providing the truth as to the clergy sexual abuse coverup and clergy sexual abuse itself and having Cardinal [Bernard] Law removed from the diocese,"" said Garabedian.   ""It triggered many victims from around the world to come forward."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/archives-st-anne-s-residential-school-abuse-allegations-1.5039150,[],N/A
241,Janyce McGregor,2017-08-03T09:26:30.539Z,New Chinese baby formula plant to buy Canadian milk — but at what price?,"A $225-million investment from a leading Chinese dairy processor is set to launch Canada back into the export game at a time when several of its major competitors are threatening a trade challenge over Canadian dairy prices. Feihe International's infant formula plant, now under construction in Kingston, Ont., plans to manufacture up to 60,000 tonnes of dry infant food annually, using milk from Canadian farms. About 85 per cent of the baby formula will be shipped back to China to feed an anticipated baby boom, as the country's one-child policy phases out. ""It was a signal that the Canadian dairy industry is open for business, that other countries want to come to do business in our industry,"" said Graham Lloyd, the general manager of the Dairy Farmers of Ontario. Open for business, but not everyone agrees the price they're going to charge is fair. The stakes are high. Canada's dairy industry is bracing for more competition when the EU trade deal takes hold this September. Canada is under pressure from the U.S. and others to open its tightly regulated market even more in upcoming trade negotiations.  The new plant creates jobs. The demand for milk will rise. But it's good news for another reason.  Feihe will separate cream from the skim milk it uses for formula. Other processors need it. ""Right now we have an overwhelming demand for cream and butterfat, in fact an unprecedented demand for it,"" Lloyd said.  That's the win-win situation the Canadian Dairy Commission envisioned when it set out to attract a new formula maker. It's been several decades since Canada courted new export markets for dairy. World Trade Organization changes in the early '90s dramatically limited what supply-managed agriculture sectors could ship. But as consumers rediscovered a taste for real butter and cream, Canada needed more uses for non-fat milk. Selling skim milk powder internationally is ""not a great market,"" said CDC spokesperson Chantal Paul. ""It was also clear, given what was happening at the WTO, that eventually we would not be able to do subsidized exports of skim milk powder."" Documents obtained by CBC News under Access to Information lay out the CDC's Chinese courtship, dating back to April 2016. CEO Jacques Laforge and his team travelled to China. They also hosted multiple Chinese visitors, touring potential sites in Quebec and Ontario. The CDC opened doors for Feihe, connecting it with food inspection and health regulators as well as provincial counterparts. ""We did a lot of hand-holding,"" Paul said. In today's precarious global dairy market, any country would envy a foreign investment like this. But it's the pricing offered to this new business that may prove controversial. Canada is already under fire internationally for ""class seven,"" a new dairy price category rolling out with what the industry calls its ""ingredient strategy."" The stable, often higher prices maintained for Canada's farmers were problematic for processors competing internationally. Canada's industry wanted to kill the incentive to use lower-cost diafiltered or ultrafiltered milk from the U.S. Because diafiltered milk is a new product not covered under current trade rules, it comes in duty-free.  Facts on the ground suggest the strategy is working. Imports of U.S. ingredients dropped. Donald Trump wasn't amused.  When U.S. agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue visited Toronto in June, he called class seven a ""very unfair, underhanded circumvention"" of WTO rules. Other major dairy producers — New Zealand, Australia and the European Union — agree and threatened a trade challenge last fall. So, what price will the Chinese plant pay for its milk? Lloyd from the Dairy Farmers of Ontario told CBC News that ""class seven"" pricing applies. ""They had a choice to go to any country in the world and they chose Canada because of the ability for us to supply the milk and it's known to be of the highest-quality — safe, reliable milk,"" he said. ""We're always surprised at how other countries are concerned about our system.""  Far from flooding markets, Canada is actually a net importer of dairy, he said. The U.S. has a half-billion dollar trade surplus with Canada. ""I don't anticipate a challenge,"" Lloyd said. ""We're satisfied that it complies with all of our trading obligations."" There hasn't been a lot of publicity about this deal. Feihe declined an invitation to be interviewed by CBC News. While a CDC spokesperson answered questions over the telephone, its CEO declined to be interviewed. A document obtained by CBC News under Access to Information shows that a confidentiality agreement was signed between the company and CDC in Ottawa last September — the same week Chinese Premier Li Keqiang met Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and announced exploratory trade talks. A later document doesn't mention this signing. Another letter from CEO Laforge to Ontario government ministers ahead of Li's visit suggested the Feihe plant would be among the Canada-China partnerships highlighted by the two leaders. But when the day came, the Feihe plant wasn't on the list of agreements the Canadian government publicized. The documents shed some light on how much taxpayers are contributing to the deal. Feihe International is a corporation registered in the Cayman Islands. Its new Canadian subsidiary is incorporated as Canada Royal Milk, so it can access the same government funding available to domestic processors. Feihe has been approved for two federal programs: the milk access for growth program, which allows it to buy milk, and a matching investment fund, which offers non-repayable contributions to companies that innovate. The dollar amount wasn't specified in the non-redacted portions of the documents. The city of Kingston isn't allowed to offer financial incentives to attract manufacturing. But large-scale food processing investments in Ontario can receive grants averaging between 10 and 15 per cent of the eligible costs of the total investment ($225 million in this case).  Another letter in the Access to Information release flags a discrepancy between what the Ontario government offered as a grant, $13.4 million, and what the Chinese expected to receive, which is nearly double that amount. The documents don't show if or how this was resolved.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-trade-1.4228502,[],N/A
242,Catharine Tunney,2019-12-11T13:04:15.217Z,"Canada signs revised North American trade deal, clearing way for ratification ","Canada has signed a new agreement updating the North American free trade agreement with Mexico and the United States, clearing the way for the contentious pact's long-awaited ratification. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland travelled to Mexico City for the signing ceremony today following a last-minute flurry of conversations between the three countries to address lingering issues with the deal. ""This has been a long arduous and, at times, fraught negotiation. We made it to the finish line because we learned how to work together,"" said Freeland during her remarks. ""Today Canada, the United States and Mexico have agreed to improvements of the new NAFTA that strengthen state-to-state dispute settlement, labour protection, environmental protection, intellectual property, the automotive rules of origin, and will help to keep the most advanced medicines affordable for Canadians.""  Speaking to reporters after the official signing ceremony, Freeland said the amended deal was good for the whole country. But she singled out Quebec's aluminum industry as one that will benefit. The revised deal requires that 70 per cent of the aluminum in all North American cars come from NAFTA countries, with Quebec being the primary producer of the metal within the three countries.  ""These amendments will make the new NAFTA even better,"" Freeland said. ""All three countries found a way to work productively and collaboratively together for the common prosperity of all of our people. And we achieved together a win, win, win, outcome."" Freeland said that every single one of the last-minute amendments that were agreed upon are in Canada's national interest.  The Canadian government released ""a summary of revised outcomes"" late Tuesday, but the official full text that Freeland signed on Canada's behalf in Mexico City has not yet been released. After months of delays, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed the renegotiated deal on Tuesday, saying progress has been made on the Democrats' main areas of concerns: workers' rights, the environment and prescription drug prices. At a media conference Tuesday morning, the California Democrat called the revised trade deal ""infinitely better"" than the original text. ""This is a day we've all been working to, and working for on the path to yes,"" said Pelosi. ""There is no question, of course, that this trade agreement is much better than NAFTA, but in terms of our work here, it is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration."" Freeland signed the updated agreement — known in Canada as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, or CUSMA — alongside U.S. President Donald Trump's trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and Mexico's undersecretary for North America, Jesús Seade. The leaders of the three countries signed the agreement over a year ago in a well-publicized event on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Argentina. But the deal still had to be ratified by all three players, and congressional Democrats in Washington had been unwilling to move forward until now. Lighthizer presented Seade with proposed changes on Saturday. The next day, Mexican senators met to consider the new text and signalled their approval. During his speech in Mexico City, Lighthizer called the amended deal the ""best trade agreement in history."" ""You know that the U.S. and President Trump viewed the old NAFTA as being a flawed agreement. It clearly was an agreement that needed to be upgraded in very important ways,"" he said. ""It's nothing short of a miracle that we have all come together. I think that's a testament to how good the agreement is."" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement today praising the deal and crediting Trump's leadership for getting it done. ""Today the Trump Administration has reached a deal with House Democrats on the USMCA, the biggest and best trade agreement in the history of the world,"" she said. ""This agreement, which was negotiated over a year ago, rebalances trade in North America and is historically strong on manufacturing, agriculture, labour, services, digital trade, IP, environment, and much more."" According to a release from Richard Neal, Democratic congressman and chair of the U.S. House Ways and Means committee, the final tweaks to the deal close enforcement loopholes and bring in ""new mechanisms and resources to ensure that the U.S. Government effectively monitors compliance."" The Democrats also pointed to their work in removing some provisions on prescription drug prices. Neal said the changes they made, such as the clarification of provisions on patents, will help to make needed drugs more affordable. In Ottawa, Health Minister Patty Hajdu called changes to the pharmaceutical section an improvement. ""I think this is good news for Canadians. It allows us to keep control of a segment of the pharmaceutical industry in Canada that's very important to Canadians, and so I'm looking forward to speaking with Minister Freeland about some of the details,"" she said. Neal didn't say when the new deal will be tabled in the U.S., but Pelosi added they're hoping to get things in motion before the end of the congressional session on Dec. 20. Canada also has yet to ratify the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Trudeau government introduced an implementation bill in the previous Parliament, but it did not pass before this fall's election. Pelosi, surrounded by a team of Democrats, announced her support for the deal the same day they introduced articles of impeachment against Trump.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-cusma-usmca-trade-freeland-pelosi-trump-1.5390452,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-monday-democrats-1.5389384 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jesus-seade-cusma-trade-deal-1.5377944,N/A
243,Jackson Weaver,2019-12-09T22:09:49.504Z,The biggest snubs and surprises of the 2020 Golden Globe nominations,"There were more than a few surprises in the nomination list for the 2020 Golden Globes — and not all of them positive. While Netflix's resounding success signalled a changing of the guard when it comes to the types of projects recognized, some of the films and series left off the list spoke more loudly to fans. Women were once again ignored in the best director field, other wildly popular shows were completely shut out and some virtually unknown films were honoured above more well-known ones. Here's a breakdown of some of those snubs and surprises from the nominations list, as well as a look at why some fans are upset. Despite a large crop of successful movies directed by women this year, the Golden Globes didn't give a nod to any of them. Like last year, the best director nominations were given to only men: Bong Joon-ho for Parasite, Sam Mendes for 1917, Todd Phillips for Joker, Martin Scorsese for The Irishman, and Quentin Tarantino for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Greta Gerwig, who was also previously denied a best director nod for her 2017 film Lady Bird, is potentially the most notable exception for Little Women, though there were also complaints that Lulu Wang (The Farewell), Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood), Lorene Scafaria (Hustlers) and others weren't recognized. Lulu Wang<br>Mati Diop<br>Greta Gerwig<br>Olivia Wilde <br>Lorene Scafaria<br>Marielle Heller<br>Melina Matsoukas<br>Chinonye Chukwu<br>Céline Sciamma<br><br>Made films this year that reached people and touched them. <br><br>That’s our awards. <br>No one can take that away. It's not an entirely new phenomenon: In the 77-year history of the Golden Globes, only five women have ever been nominated for best director, and only one — Barbra Streisand in 1984 for Yentl — has won. Despite months-long buzz and persistent ad campaigns, voters didn't appear to enjoy Cats, the star-studded Andrew Lloyd Webber remake. With a cast that includes Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift rendered as cats with ""digital fur technology,"" the film was not considered for any performance or technical awards. That didn't equal a complete shutout: they did receive a best original song nomination for Beautiful Ghosts, written by Swift for the movie. I woke up today to the news that Beautiful Ghosts is nominated for a Golden Globe - it’s so cool that one of the most fun, fulfilling creative experiences I’ve ever had is being honored in this way by the HFPA. <a href=""https://t.co/f8Ypo3b9VW"">pic.twitter.com/f8Ypo3b9VW</a> There was similarly little love for Canadian sitcom Schitt's Creek. Despite the series running its sixth and final season this year, it earned no nominations either in the outstanding comedy series category or for its stars, including Eugene Levy or Catherine O'Hara. Though ignored by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group of journalists who vote for the Globes, it is up for five awards for the 25th Annual Critics' Choice Awards. For that ceremony, both Levy and O'Hara are in the running for best comedy actor and actress awards respectively, while Dan Levy and Annie Murphy are among the nominees for best supporting actor and actress in a comedy series. The nominations also loudly announced the arrival of a new moment in film and television: the streaming era. Netflix dominated the list with a total of 34 nominations, with the most going to Noah Bambach's Marriage Story. The family drama led the pack with six nominations, more than any other film, while Netflix's The Irishman scored five.  Dolemite is My Name and The Two Popes — also Netflix productions — found significant success as well. The Two Popes is nominated for best motion picture, best actor (Jonathan Pryce) and best supporting actor (Anthony Hopkins) in the drama category, along with best screenplay, while Dolemite is nominated for best motion picture and best actor (Eddie Murphy) in the musical or comedy category. Competing streaming service Amazon gained two best television series nominations (Fleabag and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) and best foreign language motion picture (Les Misérables), while Apple entered the awards field for the first time with their TV drama series The Morning Show earning three nominations, marking the first time a streaming service has been nominated in its launch year. Amid the popularity of films produced by streaming houses, smaller traditional productions seem to have suffered. Shia LaBeouf's intensely personal Honey Boy — which he both wrote and starred in — received no nominations, and neither did The Peanut Butter Falcon, which he starred in. At the same time, indie powerhouse A24 received only two nominations (for The Farewell), despite releasing The Lighthouse, Uncut Gems, Waves, Midsommar and The Last Black Man in San Francisco in the eligible period. The little-known Where'd You Go, Bernadette may have opened and closed with a whimper and garnered mostly mediocre reviews, but scored a best actress nomination (musical or comedy) for its star Cate Blanchett. Blanchett is no stranger to the Globes; this will be the 10th nomination for the Australian actress, who currently has three wins. The film, based on the 2012 novel of the same name, had a budget of roughly $18 million US, but only managed to make around $10 million at the box office. When it comes to TV, Chernobyl, The Crown and Unbelievable unsurprisingly cleaned up, each earning four nominations. What surprised fans was Ava DuVernay's When They See Us failed to earn a single one, despite earning 16 Emmy nods — and two wins. WHEN THEY SEE US is trending nationally. A good thing.

244,Michael Spratt,2019-06-11T10:00:10.235Z,Ford's cuts to legal aid will end up costing Ontario way more than they save,"Ontario has made deep cuts to the legal aid system. Deep cuts — to the tune of $133 million — that mean that many impoverished and marginalized Ontarians will now face prosecution, conviction, and the possibility of jail time without the assistance of a lawyer. They include a 70-year-old woman with no criminal record who lives on a meager pension. She had too much to drink one night and got into a fight with her abusive partner. The police were called and now the Crown wants to brand her a criminal. And man on disability who only has one lung and uses an oxygen tank. He was charged with failing to provide a breath sample because he could not blow enough air into the breathalyzer. Prosecutors want to give him a criminal record and ban him from driving.  These are real people – I met with both of them last week. They were both denied legal aid and can't afford a lawyer. Stories like this are only the tip of the iceberg. Under Premier Doug Ford, our courts risk becoming factories of waste and injustice. Perhaps Ford thinks that a fight with the poorest and most vulnerable Ontarians – because that is who depends on the legal aid – will be an easy victory. It is easier, after all, to punch down. But this is one fight where there can be no winner. Ford's cuts are not just financially reckless, but will also result in wrongful convictions, as well as serious criminals escaping justice. Ontario will see immigration unfairness, vulnerable tenants left without any meaningful recourse to hold predatory landlords to account, and the shuttering of community legal clinics. Back in April, the Ontario government slashed funding to Legal Aid Ontario (LAO) by 30 per cent. To make matters worse, the $133 million cut took effect immediately – there was no advanced notice – despite the fact that LAO's 2019 budget had already been finalized. And on top of it all, the province directed LAO that no provincial money can be used to cover immigration and refugee law, putting the onus on the federal government to cover the cost. So, immigrants and refugees, many of whom have escaped desperate and dangerous circumstances will now face a hopeless situation in Canada. Many refugees don't speak English and don't have a sophisticated understanding of Canada's legal system. Most live in poverty. And now they will not have access to a lawyer through the province's legal aid system.  Legal Aid funding cut nearly 30% in Ontario budget Legal Aid Ontario will stop accepting new immigration, refugee cases following cuts It's unclear exactly how these cuts will manifest on the ground level, but already legal aid clinics are grappling with the threat of closure, and it is likely there will be changes to types of charges eligible for coverage. More people will therefore be forced to represent themselves.  Unrepresented litigants devour justice system resources. Their cases take longer to wind their way through the bureaucratic court system and cost more to prosecute. So, a dollar saved through legal aid cuts will consume more resources at the end of the day. A pretty bad investment. And clogging court resources with slow-moving unrepresented litigants might mean more charges thrown out of court due to unconstitutional delay. Thank you, Doug Ford. Unrepresented accused are also more likely to be steamrolled in our courts. You see, our justice system is adversarial and only functions if the adversaries – the prosecution and the defense – are equally matched.  An impoverished, marginalized, or unsophisticated self-represented litigant stands no chance against the well-funded state. With odds stacked against them, many unrepresented accused are coerced into pleading guilty, even when they are not. Because of Ford, there will be more wrongful convictions. When the stark reality of his cuts was discussed on talk radio back in April, it seemed to get under Ford's thin skin. After almost ""hitting three telephone poles,"" Ford called in to defend himself. At the end of that impromptu call Ford said that, ""if anyone needs support on legal aid, feel free to call my office. I will guarantee you that you will have legal aid.""     Ford made his personal guarantee more than 50 days ago. Since then, he has not responded to emails, faxes, or text messages about how people who have been denied legal aid can take him up on his promise. Because he was never serious. Maybe Ford thought his reckless cuts to the legal aid system would go unnoticed. But lawyers, judges, and the vast majority of Ontarians have taken notice, and most are opposed Ford's slash-and-burn philosophy. Ford may not care about those in need, but he sure seems to care about his own political skin. So maybe, just maybe, there is still time for Ford to reverse course. Because there are never any winners in a war against a fair justice system. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

245,Anonymous,2020-01-16T06:17:03.930Z,'Today's been a doozy': Salt flies off store shelves as Vancouver deals with snowy sidewalks,"With more snow on the way for Vancouver, the city is asking for patience and local hardware store workers say those who haven't bought salt yet better start shoveling. Bags of salt have flown off store shelves as residents try to stay on top of keeping sidewalks and driveways clear. On Wednesday morning, there was a lineup of people hoping to get their hands on the hot commodity at Home Hardware in Davie Village, said store assistant Ty Campbell. ""It was gone in seconds. The second it came in, it was gone,"" Campbell said. ""We managed to get a few extra bags in, and the second they came in, they left again. ""Today's been a doozy."" The Home Hardware on Commercial Drive also can't keep up with demand. Employee Tim Stockley said they sold around 400 bags of salt over the past two days. Both Stockley and Campbell say they don't know when they'll have more salt in stock — highway closures have stalled deliveries. In the meantime, it may be tempting to use alternatives to salt, but Campbell wouldn't recommend it. ""I know some people have been using kitty litter to actually get out, if their car is stuck,"" he said. ""Kitty litter is a clay, so the second the snow starts to melt, you're going to have a bigger issue of having clay everywhere."" Sand can help with traction but won't melt the ice, Stockley noted.  The best way to keep sidewalks from turning into a ""slippery, slidey hazard"" is to bust out the shovel, he said. ""The sidewalks and roadways, especially at the ends of the sidewalks where it dips down a bit, make sure those are cleared as best as possible,"" he said. Even shovels might be hard to come by at this point. At West Coast Janitorial Supplies, regional manager Phil Nowak said he's sold 460 bags of ice melter so far and can hardly keep shovels in stock.  ""Come and buy it now because once they're gone it's going to be hard to get them again,"" he said.  Up to five centimetres of snowfall is expected in Metro Vancouver by Wednesday evening, with up to 10 centimetres on the North Shore and in Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge.  In January 2017, an unusual cold snap gripped Vancouver for almost a month, prompting the city to offer free salt at several firehalls. Residents swarmed the halls and the city had to restrict salt rations to one bucket per person. On Tuesday, Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said that won't be happening again. Hundreds of staff are currently focusing on clearing 1,500 kilometres of major routes, the city said in a statement. Kennedy said he's satisfied with the city's response to the sudden winter weather, but anyone with concerns can call 311 for help.  ""We've had an all-hands-on-deck approach that I think has been working effectively,"" he said. ""Of course people are going to be frustrated. Vancouver is not a snow city. We get snow for a week, it's going to be inconvenient."" And while residents might be having trouble finding salt, Kennedy said the city is well-prepared.  ""As far as I'm concerned, at this point we have adequate stockpiles of salt to get through this ... snowmageddon.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/snowy-sidewalks-salt-vancouver-1.5428785,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-south-coast-winter-storm-round-two-1.5428021 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/road-salt-sidewalk-at-how-much-to-use-1.5019166,N/A
246,Vassy Kapelos,2019-12-08T12:00:00.330Z,Will the spirit of collaboration take hold in this Parliament?,"This article is part of the Minority Report newsletter, which is your weekly tip-sheet from CBC News to help you navigate the parliamentary waters of a minority government. Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox every Sunday. Full disclaimer. I love this time of year. Christmas is coming. People are in a social mood, the drinks are flowing and there's a general, and enjoyable, uptick in the feeling of goodwill that people have for one another. It's even like that on Parliament Hill. Behind the scenes, there are a ton of holiday get-togethers and MPs greet each other jovially in the halls of Parliament, sending best wishes to one other's families (I'm not kidding, I've witnessed it).  Normally though, the goodwill has dissipated by the time MPs return to Ottawa in January and the session begins in earnest. Will this time be different?  The rhetoric certainly indicates it could be. Just listen to what party leaders said following the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons. Their speeches were replete with references to the C-word: COLLABORATION. Over and over, Canadians heard their political leaders promise to have received the message they were sent in the election: Voters want them to work together for the betterment of our country.  Lest you think I'm Pollyanna — I do have a few doubts about whether that will happen. First, there are the personalities involved. Remember the campaign? Dude, it was bitter. It's hard to cast that aside and I'm not sure anyone feels inclined to. Especially in the case of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer.  I remember interviewing the prime minister a few years ago, about six months after Scheer became leader of the Tories. My final question in the interview was to ask him — in the holiday spirit — what are Scheer's best qualities. You would have thought I asked him how it feels to have an appendix removed with a rusty spoon. After a spell, Trudeau said: ""he's a nice enough guy"" and quickly changed the subject.  Scheer's not exactly gushing about his love for Trudeau either. Think back to his opening salvo in the English-language debate, when the Conservative leader called the prime minister a phoney and a fraud. That kind of language really makes you believe in his willingness to collaborate: #amiright? There's more evidence the holiday spirit might not take hold too fervently. Just a few short hours after the post-Speaker speeches were delivered, the big one happened; the speech from the throne. Right after, both Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh came out swinging, with Scheer saying he was disappointed and Singh saying the speech was full of empty promises. They both had genuine reasons for dismay, but all that post-speaker talk of getting along appeared to have evaporated with the three taps of the Usher's Black Rod. Take the speech itself. Sure, it threw the opposition a few bones on parental leave, tax benefits and money laundering, but the majority of the areas singled out by the government as having potential for collaboration were focused on policy areas that help ensure the Liberals a path to re-election. The Liberals, it seems, can collaborate on ideas with the opposition on areas of policy aimed at voters the Liberals want to win back — primarily in Ontario and Quebec.  And that's their right —  but it's also a clear, and not unexpected, signal that we shouldn't expect some sort of altruistic discarding of partisanship, on anybody's part.  In the end, collaboration will probably come through on policies that can produce benefits for more than one political party. Action on climate change, tax cuts, and health care are some examples that come to mind.  That's what happened in the past, and as a result, minority governments did some productive stuff. This country's 12 previous minority Parliaments introduced universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, the Canadian flag, and legalized gay marriage. I'm excited to see what this Parliament does — and how collaborative it may, or may not, be. We'll get our first look this week, when MPs take their seats in the House of Commons.  This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter. In this week's issue, Éric Grenier looks at what happens to the minority math if parties abstain from voting on key bills. Plus, the Power Panel gives its advice on what the parties should be doing in the week ahead, and we profile new Liberal MP Lenore Zann.

247,Anonymous,2019-08-21T16:11:48.735Z,"Canadian-made Ebola vaccine could have saved more lives if research was funded earlier, microbiologist says","Read Story Transcript In 2005, microbiologist Steven Jones was part of a medical team in Angola, which was in the midst of an outbreak of Marburg, Ebola's sister virus. The team had samples of an experimental vaccine, developed by Jones and researchers in Winnipeg to treat Ebola and Marburg, with them. But clinical tests weren't yet complete, so they couldn't use it on infected patients, even though preliminary research had shown it to be effective as early as 2003, Jones says. That restriction sparked a tense confrontation with a military doctor. ""He begged us to use it and we had to tell him no. And it was an extremely difficult conversation, because nothing else had been working,"" Jones, associate provost of health at the University of Saskatchewan Health Sciences, told The Current's guest host Matt Galloway. The vaccine, also known as VSV-ZEBOV, is currently being used to combat an Ebola outbreak in Congo, which has killed at least 1,900 people in the last year. But Jones believes it could have been used to save more lives if governments and pharmaceutical companies committed to greater funding and support years earlier. The 2005 Marburg outbreak in Angola killed 329 people, with a nearly 90 per cent case fatality rate of those infected. Jones believes that if he were able to use the vials of the vaccine they had on hand, they might have saved ""at least half"" of the lives lost. But he recognizes the need for meticulous testing and research to ensure a new vaccine is proven safe to use on humans. That process, however, takes a lot of money and the political will to keep that money flowing, he says, adding it has been coined the ""valley of death: where bright ideas go to die."" Jones and his team requested $6 million from Canada's CBRNE Research and Technology Initiative (CIRT) to develop vaccines for Marburg and Ebola, but only received $2 million in 2006, specifically for the Ebola vaccine. It wouldn't last through the series of required clinical trials. ""We were not funded to do the clinical trials, because those start to get more expensive,"" he said. ""At the time, I thought the decision was wrong. I still think the decision was wrong, but I understand why it was made."" Jones said members of the Canadian government, including then-chief public health officer David Butler Jones, supported his team's work ""vigorously."" But the disease's impact, which was seen largely overseas, did not make the government's list of long-term funding priorities, he says. ""On behalf of the government, there are multiple problems, which they're trying to solve. And it's a question of: 'Which one do we want to invest taxpayers' money in?'""  In 2014, the Canadian government pledged $30 million in aid and shipped 800 vials of VSV-ZEBOV to the World Health Organization in Geneva. At the time, West Africa was in the midst of the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, which claimed more than 11,000 lives by its end in 2016. By 2010, the Canadian government had invested at least $5.3 million developing the vaccine, according to PBS Frontline.  But Jones and his team were still looking for a pharmaceutical company to take over its manufacturing. Similar financial considerations led to roadblocks when seeking funds from pharmaceutical companies, who he described as ""responsible to their shareholders, unfortunately, not to patients or the government."" Only Newlink, a small Iowa-based firm, expressed enough interest to license the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. In 2014, Newlink licensed it to pharmaceutical giant Merck, which signed an agreement with the Gavi Vaccine Alliance in 2016 to produce 300,000 doses for a future outbreak. Those doses are being used to combat the Ebola outbreak in Congo today. ""We were eventually successful, I guess. It just took too long,"" said Jones. Written by Jonathan Ore with files from Reuters.

249,"Jennie Russell, Charles Rusnell",2020-01-17T18:58:14.664Z,Alberta chief medical examiner Dr. Elizabeth Brooks-Lim resigns,"Alberta's chief medical examiner has resigned, the third departure from that position in five years. In a statement released Thursday, Dr. Elizabeth Brooks-Lim said it was a ""personal decision"" to leave the job and she is looking forward to the next chapter in her career.  ""I am confident that a strong transition team is in place, and that staff will continue to provide a high level of service to Albertans,"" she said in a statement sent to CBC News.  The statement doesn't indicate when exactly Brooks-Lim will leave, but in another statement the ministry thanked her for ""affording us the time to appoint an acting chief medical examiner during the recruitment period."" In September, CBC News broadcast video that showed a body being dragged along the floor of a refrigerated semi-trailer outside the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Alberta (OCME) in Edmonton. Brooks-Lim had ordered the trailer's use as temporary storage in response to a sudden influx of bodies.  Storage of bodies in rented trailer leads to probe of medical examiner's space shortage Brooks-Lim was appointed chief medical examiner in December 2016 following a string of controversies involving the troubled office. Her predecessor, Dr. Jeffery Gofton, quit after less than 18 months on the job and returned to his native United States. Gofton assumed the post from Dr. Anny Sauvageau, who is suing Alberta Justice for more than $5 million, alleging her contract, which expired at the end of 2014, was not renewed after she stood up to political interference in the office's operation. In a 2016 report, Alberta's Public Interest Commissioner concluded Sauvageau had been treated unfairly by Justice officials who had, in part, used complaints they knew were unsubstantiated to justify not renewing her contract. The report said records showed there was even an attempt to solicit complaints and comments about Sauvageau from both inside and outside the department. The commissioner dismissed Sauvageau's allegations of political interference, however, saying there was insufficient evidence for a finding of wrongdoing. When former NDP Justice Minister Kathleen Ganley appointed Brooks-Lim to the position, Ganley said it would ""maintain stability in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner."" Brooks-Lim had been serving as acting chief medical examiner. Brooks-Lim was previously deputy chief medical examiner in Edmonton, assistant chief medical examiner in Calgary and Edmonton, and a forensic pathologist and coroner in Saskatchewan. She was a forensic pathologist in England and a clinical lecturer in forensic medicine and pathology in Scotland. The Alberta government's public salary disclosure shows Brooks-Lim received nearly $404,000 in total compensation in 2018. Brooks-Lim was directly involved in a controversy in September that critics called a clear lack of respect to decedents.  CBC News revealed the OCME was storing an influx of bodies on the floor of a rented, refrigerated semi-trailer — visible from a nearby public street — as the office grappled with a shortage of storage space. Internal emails show a staff member had previously raised concerns with Brooks-Lim about the propriety of storing bodies in a trailer, saying families likely would not find the practice acceptable.  In response, Brooks-Lim told the employee: ""The floor is clean, the bodies will be in body bags and the families do not need to be informed of the storage procedures."" CBC News recorded video of a funeral home attendant dragging one of the bodies, sheathed in a white body bag, along the floor of the trailer.  After the story aired, Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer directed his ministry to begin an internal investigation. But the ministry refuses to say when the investigation would be completed or if it would be publicly released.  CBC News subsequently learned the Alberta Justice investigation into the incident was also trying to determine who had leaked that email exchange. The family of the person in the body bag learned about the dragging incident from the funeral home manager and Brooks-Lim, who both personally apologized. Raymond Pizzey, the brother of the deceased man, Bryce Sather, said the family was distraught over his body's mistreatment. Pizzey is now suing the funeral home for significant emotional distress. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is entangled in yet another scandal after a six-month investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate revealed senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of medical examiner Dr. Evan Matshes in Calgary a decade ago. Matshes declined to speak with The Fifth Estate but in a statement he said he stands by his work.  ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent,"" Matshes wrote.

Taha's wife and children, 3 and 7, will arrive in Montreal on Monday, two days ahead of his scheduled surgery. ""Taha's family will finally be able to be united with Taha to stay beside him during his treatment. and foremost, to see him before he undergoes an extremely critical and invasive operation,"" immigration consultant Rami Alsaqqa said in a statement. ""We were extremely happy to receive the good news."" Taha, a stateless Palestinian who fled Hezbollah in Lebanon last year, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer days after crossing the border from New York to Quebec in December. His family was initially denied temporary visas to travel to be with Taha during his treatment, as they could not prove they could financially support themselves while in Canada, or that they would return to Lebanon when their visas expired. ""I am alone. There is no family, no friends for me here,"" Taha, 36, told As It Happens guest host Helen Mann during an emotional interview in early May. ""We pray every night that we can see each other and be a family together again."" Taha's doctors and attorney appealed directly to Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen, who has the discretion to issue temporary resident permits to any inadmissible foreign national if it is deemed ""justified in the circumstances."" The family learned Saturday that their request was approved. A spokesperson for the minister's office said individual cases can't be discussed. Taha's story left an impact on CBC readers and listeners. After his interview with As It Happens aired in May, several people wrote in to express their support for the refugee claimant, and one Montrealer offered to be his friend and provide companionship during his treatment. ""Thanks to the tens of thousands of Canadian who stood beside Taha by showing their sympathy and support, and to everyone who supported us during these critical times,"" Alsaqqa's statement reads. His story has also drawn the ire of those who worry about the stress that border jumping puts on Canadian services.  In 2017, RCMP officers apprehended 20,593 asylum seekers between official border checkpoints. More than 90 per cent of those crossings happened in Quebec. The federal government had a backlog of 48,974 refugee claims in in March alone, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada website. The Toronto Sun's Mark Bonokoski decried Taha for what he characterized as jumping the queue to receive medical treatment. ""His story, while tragic, highlights the profoundly problematic nature of the Trudeau Liberal government's open door policy toward refugee claimants,"" Bonokoski wrote.   Reached by As It Happens on Monday, Taha declined to do another on-air interview, but expressed his gratitude to the Canadians who have supported him during this difficult time.  Written by Sheena Goodyear with files from Kevin Robertson.

251,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old started Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago and since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, covering a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When Burke was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died as the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaning off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into the driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. He was a mess and he got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.  ""Like 'How can I help? How can I move this forward? Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke — no relation to Matt — was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years, from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his life and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month ago and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing on the podcast was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example — that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died Matt was in shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said. ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does, is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at a time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person, ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recent guest on the podcast. McPhee said listening to Matt and his guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence to take his turn at the microphone. When McPhee was younger he struggled with his mental health, and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they can be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizing a traumatic story, to ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listeners walk away with is that mental health issues are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, Matt does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

252,"Jennie Russell, Charles Rusnell",2015-02-06T23:11:00.786Z,"Dr. Anny Sauvageau, former chief medical examiner, sues Alberta Justice","Alberta's former chief medical examiner has launched a $5-million wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Alberta Justice, Justice Minister Jonathan Denis and four senior government bureaucrats. In a statement of claim filed Tuesday, Dr. Anny Sauvageau makes sensational allegations of political interference in the operations of the medical examiner's office. The most controversial allegation is that Alberta Justice negotiated a costly new body transportation contract without her approval in order to appease the Alberta Funeral Services Association and curry political favour in rural ridings. She also claims she was ordered not to fire an employee, even though human resources recommended the worker be let go. Sauvageau alleges that Alberta Justice officials ignored financial analysis, which found the new body transportation contract was not cost effective, as well as a litany of documented complaints about the existing body transportation service. The complaints included: In September, CBC News obtained documents showing Sauvageau had repeatedly complained to Alberta Justice deputy minister Tim Grant about what she called ""regular political and bureaucratic interference in all aspects of the death investigation system."" The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner investigates the cause and manner of sudden or unexplained deaths, including: The office also oversees the transportation of bodies from accidents and crime scenes. The office derives its authority from the Fatality Inquiries Act.   Denis has publicly denied there was evidence to support an investigation into her allegations. Sauvageau alleges in her lawsuit that senior Alberta Justice officials retaliated by reneging on a promise to renew her contract, then fabricated performance issues to justify their decision. The lawsuit details several promises, both written and verbal, Sauvageau claims were made to her about renewing her contract for a five-year term. Sauvageau became chief medical examiner on July 1, 2011, and her last day was Dec. 31, 2014. ​Sauvageau is seeking a total of $5.15 million in the lawsuit, which names Alberta Justice, Denis, Alberta Justice deputy ministers Grant and Kim Armstrong, and assistant deputy ministers Maryann Everett and Donavon Young as defendants. No statement of defence has been filed and none of the allegations contained in the lawsuit have been proven in court. Sauvageau says in the lawsuit she opposed the new contract because it was too costly. She claims she pointed out that the chief medical examiner's office would need to spend an additional $3 million over three years to meet requests made by the Funeral Services Association. The lawsuit claims that when Sauvageau objected, Everett told her, ""You think too much of the taxpayers."" The lawsuit alleges Sauvageau's concerns were overruled and Alberta Justice prepared the new contract after meetings, from which she was excluded, between the department and the Funeral Services Association. Sauvageau claims she sent Premier Jim Prentice a briefing note that described her objections to the new contract, laid out the documented problems with the body transportation service, and detailed political interference in the operations of her office. The next day, the lawsuit claims, Alberta Justice deputy minister Tim Grant told Sauvageau her contract would not be renewed. Sauvageau alleges Grant did not provide a reason for the decision. Sauvageau also claims in the lawsuit she was told not to fire a member of her staff because the employee might be related to a senior staff member of then-premier Dave Hancock. The lawsuit alleges that human resources had recommended the employee be fired. The employee had reported that a colleague was going to come into the office with a gun and kill everyone, but an investigation by HR determined the complaint was ""malicious."" The lawsuit alleges Everett told Sauvageau that Grant ""was forbidding the firing of the employee because it was feared she might be related to George Samoil, Hancock's deputy chief of staff, operations. It is not clear from the lawsuit documents whether Samoil, who now works for Premier Jim Prentice, would have had any knowledge of the alleged interference. As CBC News reported in September, internal documents show that last May, former deputy ministers Peter Watson and Steve MacDonald asked for special treatment by the chief medical examiner's office in relation to a specific case. Sauvageau's lawsuit alleges Watson ""pressured the death investigator to modify the policies and procedures with respect to body viewing,"" which she alleges is a violation of the Fatality Inquiries Act. At the time, Watson was the deputy minister of executive council, the most powerful bureaucrat in the provincial government. He is now chairman of the federal National Energy Board. The lawsuit alleges Watson called the chief medical examiner's office on behalf of a close relative of a former cabinet minister. Sauvageau claims MacDonald, then the deputy minister of advanced education, called to request information on the autopsy findings and to ensure the body would soon be released to the family. CBC News has confirmed the deceased was Shazmin Khan, 19. Sources told CBC News that she is a relative of current Service Alberta Minister Stephen Khan. In an emailed statement Friday, Khan's press secretary said Khan is not related to Shazmin Khan and the minister said he did not intervene in the case.  If you have information about this story, or anything else you think is newsworthy, contact us in confidence at cbcinvestigates@cbc.ca.

253,Colin McPhail,2020-01-08T02:24:49.602Z,Cardy denies report suggesting New Brunswick is scrapping French immersion program,"Education Minister Dominic Cardy has denied a report the New Brunswick government is considering abandoning the provincial French immersion program. A headline published Tuesday evening on the website of the Telegraph-Journal, the provincial newspaper, stated, ""Province plans to scrap French immersion program."" When asked to clarify, Cardy repudiated the report. ""The headline saying we're scrapping French immersion is simply, straight up inaccurate,"" Cardy told CBC News. The minister said, however, the government is developing a pilot project to test alternative approaches to French second language training in the province. The project will be rolled out in a dozen anglophone schools in September 2020. Cardy said the pilot is in the early design stages but didn't offer further information, saying he would share those details when ready. Cardy said his government has publicly discussed changes to the French immersion program, among many other reforms, in the green paper on education that was published last fall. ""Nothing beyond that is in the works right now,"" he said. People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin was quoted in the Telegraph-Journal article as saying he had been speaking with Cardy and Premier Blaine Higgs ""for the past year"" about a plan to do away with the program, adding he was ""thrilled"" at the prospect. Cardy said Austin's comments were ""inaccurate"" and ""irresponsible."" ""To say there's some plan which hasn't been shared with the public to get rid of French immersion is simply untrue,"" Cardy said. ""There are certainly going to be absolutely no secret closed-door decisions or discussions with people in other parties on issues as important as this."" Neither Austin nor an Alliance spokesperson responded to a request for comment Tuesday night. The Progressive Conservative government has been critical of the existing program and its poor performance levels.

""Usually these things take a little word of mouth,"" said Mike Redmond, who manages the staff at the centre. ""Generally it starts [as] a bit of a trickle, but right off the bat we were very, very busy in our first couple of days."" The space at 211 Euston St. is meant to bring together government and community services — such as employment, financial assistance counselling, food and housing — and make them more accessible to Islanders struggling with issues including homelessness, poverty or mental health. It is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week. It also serves as a warming centre and a place where people can do their laundry, have a shower or access a telephone and computer. ""It's met the expectations and needs of the community straight away,"" said Redmond, who is also residential manager at the men's homeless shelter Bedford MacDonald House. Both men and women have used the facility for stays ranging from 15 minutes to two hours, Redmond said. About 70 people in all have passed through to take advantage of advice on housing and transportation, or just to get out of poor weather during the 16 centimetres of snow that fell on the city Sunday. ""There [were] a lot of people here at 8 a.m.,"" Redmond said. ""There's not a lot of things available on a Sunday morning, so being able to have the facility open allows us the chance to get people out of the cold, a warm cup of coffee, do some laundry and generally just to be warm."" Redmond said there is sufficient staffing for the number of people so far, with two staff members on hand from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. A further 10 to 15 people are there for shorter amounts of time, including representatives from the Mi'kmaq Confederacy, the John Howard Society and the Canadian Mental Health Association.

Utilities Commission (BCUC).  B.C. Attorney General David Eby has directed a delay to the public auto insurer's application until February, in order to allow time for two sets of planned reforms, according to a statement issued Thursday. ""We will not ask ICBC to put forward a 2020 rate application based on an incomplete financial picture,"" said Eby. ""Instead, we will wait until that work is complete to ensure any rate changes are based on the actual costs anticipated in the year ahead."" In February 2018, the province tried to stem ICBC's financial bleeding, in part, by introducing caps on the number of expert witnesses testifying in injury lawsuits. A recent court decision struck down the caps. But instead of appealing the decision, the B.C. government opted instead to legislate the changes. Those changes made to B.C.'s Evidence Act limit the number of expert reports but also include a window of discretion that will allow judges to decide whether additional experts are needed in some cases. Eby said the province is also working on reforms in the tort system that it believes will help reduce costs and have a positive impact on rate changes.

257,Bridgette Watson,2020-01-03T21:05:57.865Z,"Conservation officers should wear body cameras, says group upset by number of bears killed in B.C. ","A B.C. environmental group wants greater scrutiny of provincial conservation officers who kill bears and cougars while on the job. On Jan. 1, Pacific Wild sent an open letter to Environment Minister George Heyman calling on the government to make independent oversight a priority, and asking for all officers to be outfitted with body cameras while in the field. According to provincial statistics, the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has killed 4,341 black bears and 162 grizzly bears in the past eight years. In 2019, 542 black bears and 26 grizzlies were killed. The letter comes after the ministry issued a media release on Dec. 20 in which Heyman is quoted saying no officer relishes the thought of having to put down an animal, which is always a last resort for public safety. ""The minister has stated in the press release that killing wildlife is always the last resort and that's categorically untrue,"" said Bryce Casavant, a spokesperson for Pacific Wild.   ""In many cases that's not the situation and wildlife is killed for other reasons such as officers' opinion or belief that the animal was unlikely to survive on its own,"" he said. Casavant, a former conservation officer who was suspended after refusing to kill two bear cubs in Port Hardy in 2015, said there is currently no review process when an officer discharges a service weapon and this should change.  ""We need to ensure that our officers are accountable for discharging their service weapons in the course of their duties,"" he said. The letter asks for the Conservation Officer Service to make independent oversight a priority in 2020 and to have all field officers outfitted with body cameras no later than April 1. According to Annie Booth, ecosystems science and management professor at the University of Northern British Columbia, black bears have been responsible for 69 recorded fatalities in North America in the last 120 years ""compared to the large number killed by people."" Booth said black bears are not very predatory and are lured into populated areas by fruit trees and garbage where they are killed as a last resort.  ""There needs to be a lot more legislation and fines put around people who put out nuisance objects that attract bears into a difficult situation,"" said Booth. ""You really need to cut the problem at the source."" Booth said it is difficult to second-guess the actions of conservation officers who are on the front lines, and she sees value in putting cameras on them. ""It provides the public with some assurances that a discharge of a firearm is being reviewed,"" said Booth, adding she would prefer to see the Conservation Officer Service establish clear standards that say when an officer can, or cannot, euthanize a bear. In a statement, the Ministry of Environment said conservation officers responded to more than 20,000 calls in 2019 related to conflicts with bears. The data does not include December because numbers for that month have yet to be calculated. Government statistics show officers attended approximately 2,500 of those calls in person. Of those calls where an officer attended, 542 black bears were killed and a dozen were moved to another location. ""Conservation officers are dedicated to protecting and preserving wildlife and always consider all options before euthanizing an animal,"" said the ministry. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/conservation-officers-should-wear-body-cameras-says-group-upset-by-number-of-bears-killed-in-b-c-1.5413611,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bryce-casavant-who-refused-to-kill-bear-cubs-removed-from-conservation-service-1.3207486 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bears-penticton-1.5336709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/port-moody-bear-patrol-1.5305183,N/A

""Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family, while remaining a valued part of my family.'' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex spent the holidays at a secluded beachfront villa near Victoria, where they were seen exploring the community. ""And the fact that they felt comfortable here speaks to us as a society and that gives us a reason to pat ourselves on our back,'' Horgan said. ""That we are good and kind people who don't want to intrude in the lives of famous people. We're excited when we see them but leave them be."" ""He took ""comfort'' watching the response of residents of Vancouver Island who ""bumped"" into the family but largely left them alone, Horgan said. ""The paparazzi weren't here. You, as a media group, left them alone,'' he said. ""You talked to people who bumped into them on the trail and it was a curiosity and a bit of a delight for British Columbians to say, 'oh good, they came here because they felt safe.''' He hasn't ""given a lot of thought'' to the costs of the family putting down roots in the province, if B.C. is where they choose to spend their time in Canada, he said. ""I'm sure there are people working on that right now,'' he said. ""And I may have more to say on that should the royals choose to put down roots in British Columbia.'' The Prime Minister's Office wouldn't comment on potential costs of the couple living in Canada. In Toronto, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said there had been no discussions about who would cover the couple's security costs. Horgan joked he may be able to find some work for the couple, should the family choose to settle down in Victoria. ""'I'm sure I could find something for Harry to do,'' he said with a smile. ""The film industry is booming in British Columbia so I'm sure Meghan could get on with one of the great — maybe Riverdale — who knows,'' Horgan said with a laugh. ""She'd be good.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-and-prime-minister-giddy-about-harry-and-meghan-s-possible-move-to-b-c-1.5425727,[],N/A

Thousands of supporters of the series — based on Lucy Maud Montgomery's Prince Edward Island-set classic Anne of Green Gables — have flooded social media since news spread of the show's demise on Monday.  The third season finale aired in Canada on CBC-TV on Sunday. Season three is slated to debut for international viewers via Netflix on Jan. 3. Following the immediate online outcry after Monday's cancellation announcement, fans in Canada, the U.S., the U.K. and beyond organized a midday ""trending party"" Tuesday via hashtags like #SaveAnneWithAnE and #RenewAnneWithAnE.  <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/RenewAnneWithAnE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#RenewAnneWithAnE</a> - 2 Million <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAnneWithAnE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveAnneWithAnE</a> - 817.4K<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAnnewithAnne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveAnnewithAnne</a> - 681.9K<br>TOTAL - 3.499.300 Million tweets <a href=""https://t.co/bkDbOUdMH6"">pic.twitter.com/bkDbOUdMH6</a> The cancellation also spawned a Change.org petition calling for the show to be renewed for a fourth season, with more than 29,000 supporters as of Wednesday morning.  SAVE ANNE WITH AN E SO BASH CAN FIND OUT ABOUT GILBERT AND ANNE!!!!!!!! <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAnneWithAnnE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveAnneWithAnnE</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SAVEANNEWITHANE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SAVEANNEWITHANE</a> <a href=""https://t.co/k7i3rMsRca"">pic.twitter.com/k7i3rMsRca</a> TREND <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAnneWithAnnE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveAnneWithAnnE</a><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/renewannewithane?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#renewannewithane</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveAnneWithAnE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveAnneWithAnE</a> SO MOODY CAN STOP HYPERVENTILATING <a href=""https://t.co/trjTTWZbNb"">pic.twitter.com/trjTTWZbNb</a> Since its debut in spring 2017, Anne with an E has reimagined the coming-of-age story of feisty orphan Anne Shirley through a more modern lens.  Created by Moira Walley-Beckett and Miranda de Pencier, the show's broad range of storylines and diverse cast built a strong community of devotees. It also nabbed back-to-back best drama series trophies at the Canadian Screen Awards as well as acting honours for star Amybeth McNulty and veteran performers Geraldine James and R.H.

For instance, police sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, outer space political thriller The Expanse and rebooted family sitcom One Day at a Time all found new homes after sustained fan campaigns following their cancellations.  It's also not unheard of for a passionate fanbase to be rewarded with a feature film farewell (Firefly, Veronica Mars, Carmilla and Sense8 are just a few examples) — and it's a possibility that has apparently crossed Walley-Beckett's mind as well. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly about the show's cancellation on Monday, she noted that she'd ""love to write an [Anne With An E] finale feature film.""  However, that kind of feature film project for the show isn't on CBC's radar, said Sally Catto, general manager of programming for CBC English Television.  ""It's not something we've had discussions about at this time,"" she said on Tuesday.  According to Catto, cancelling Anne With An E was a difficult decision made jointly by the Canadian public broadcaster and Netflix, with one main factor being that the show didn't register enough of an audience boost in the 25-54 age range. ""They unfortunately didn't lift enough,"" Catto explained. ""They just weren't reaching our specific target."" Still, the passionate outpouring this week from Anne With An E fans hasn't surprised her.

260,Anonymous,2019-09-04T19:52:42.779Z,NRA slams Walmart for cracking down on gun and ammo sales,"The U.S. National Rifle Association lashed out at Walmart late Tuesday, criticizing the retail giant for discontinuing sales of some gun ammunition products and requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms in its stores. ""It is shameful to see Walmart succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America's fundamental freedoms,"" the NRA said in a release. Walmart won praise from gun control advocates for its statement Tuesday announcing a decision to curb sales of some guns and ammunition, as well as to discourage open carrying of weapons in store by shoppers. Walmart's announcement comes just days after a mass shooting claimed seven lives in Odessa, Texas, and follows two other back-to-back shootings last month, one of them at a Walmart store. On Aug. 3, a gunman entered a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and killed 22 people with a type of firearm that the retailer already bans the sale of. It was the deadliest shooting in Walmart's history. A second unrelated shooting that same day in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people. ""It is shameful to see <a href=""https://twitter.com/Walmart?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Walmart</a> succumb to the pressure of the anti-gun elites. Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America’s fundamental freedoms."" <br><br>Read <a href=""https://twitter.com/NRA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NRA</a>'s statement on Walmart's decision here: <a href=""https://t.co/bmwAS9o0KP"">pic.twitter.com/bmwAS9o0KP</a> A few days before that, two Walmart workers were killed by another worker at a store in Southaven, Miss. The Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter said it will stop selling handgun ammunition as well as short-barrel rifle ammunition, such as the .223 calibre and 5.56 calibre used in military style weapons, after it runs out of its current inventory. That in turn will reduce Walmart's market share of ammunition from around 20 per cent to a range of about six to nine per cent, according to a memo from company chief executive Doug McMillon. Walmart will also discontinue handgun sales in Alaska. The company stopped selling handguns in the mid-1990s in every state except Alaska. The latest move marks its complete exit from that business and allows it to focus on hunting rifles and related ammunition only. Supporters of stricter gun laws say that as the nation's largest retailer, Walmart will have an outsized influence on the gun debate, sending a strong message to Congress as well as other corporations to take action. ""Walmart deserves enormous credit for joining the strong and growing majority of Americans who know that we have too many guns in our country and they are too easy to get,"" said Igor Volsky, executive director and founder of Guns Down America, in a statement.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nra-walmart-1.5269970,[],N/A

262,Jackie McKay,2019-12-02T20:45:25.693Z,Education minister says all parties fairly consulted on controversial education bill,"Nunavut's education minister says his department properly consulted partners on Bill 25, the Act to Amend the Education Act and the Inuit Language Protection Act.  David Joanasie was questioned by the standing committee on Bill 25 yesterday, on the last day of public hearings.  ""As a department it was our expectation that our partners would openly tell us what they wanted to see in the bill when we consulted with them,"" said Joanasie, in his opening statement to the committee.  He said the submissions given to the standing committee by the presenting organizations ""differ dramatically"" from the ones received by his office. As a result, Joanasie said his department didn't have the opportunity to have the proposals reflected in the bill.  Bill 25 has been widely criticised since it was first introduced in June. The most vocal critic of the bill has been Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated (NTI). During the hearing NTI president, Aluki Kotierk, told the committee that the organization should have been part of writing the bill.  Thomas Ahlfors, legislative council for the Government of Nunavut offered legal clarification for Joanasie. Ahlfors told the committee that if the partners had been apart of the drafting of the legislation it would have significantly delayed the bill.  ""I would assume this bill would have been delayed by at least a year if we had done that,"" Ahlfors said.  Ahlfors said that was because the specialized legal expertise needed to draft legislation is not currently possessed by any of the partners who wanted to participate.  Joanasie also told the committee that he believes there has only been two other pieces of legislation that have been co-developed between parties.  Questioning this week focused on the government's deadline to have Inuktitut language arts classes in all grades by 2039.  The committee and presenting partners were looking for assurance from Joanasie that the bill would ensure fully bilingual education in Nunavut.  Joanasie referred to a timeline accompanying the bill that includes detailed roll out targets for bilingual curriculum, assessment, resources and training. He stressed that 2039 was only a deadline, and the department plans to make the school system bilingual sooner.  He also said the provision in Bill 25 that forces the legislature to review the education act every five years will allow the department to address working challenges.  However, Joanasie is calling for Nunavummiut to ""step up to the plate"" in order to recruit the language expertise needed to have a fully bilingual system.  ""We need of course more bilingual Inuit teachers, as well as the curriculum that we need to develop in the Inuit language,"" said Joanasie.  He told the committee that over the next 20 years the Nunavut Teacher Education Program (NTEP) will produce over 500 Inuktitut speaking teachers.   However, the Nunavut Teachers' Association told the committee this week that they lose half of their NTEP graduates within five years because the program is not properly preparing them for the realities of the job.  Joanasie said the bill has a 10-year teacher recruitment and retention plan. He told the committee the plan will outline the department's role in supporting potential teachers and connecting them to training through the NTEP program.  The standing committee will now come up with recommendations on the bill.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bill-25-nunavut-education-1.5377738,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-groups-decry-changes-education-language-act-1.5375222 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-education-bill-french-language-1.5359960,N/A
263,Brian Higgins,2020-01-22T10:00:00.510Z,More untreatable waste expected at Charlottetown sewage plant,"Staff at Charlottetown's sewage treatment plant are bracing for trouble when waste water from Stratford begins to arrive. The amount of stuff that shouldn't be there — mostly disposable wipes and cloth rags  — will likely increase, according to the plant superintendent. ""We fill one dumpster a week,"" said Steven Stewart. ""That could go to three when it all gets going."" The city will have a new screening facility up and running in a couple of weeks to help deal with the gunk. It's part of $12 million in upgrades undertaken to handle increased waste at the Charlottetown plant. The new screening facility will be housed in a separate building on the plant's waterfront property on Riverside Drive. The new, finer screen will replace a decades-old machine that currently sifts all manner of items out of the sewage that flows from the homes of Charlottetown residents. ""This looks like somebody's Calvin Kleins,"" said Stewart, as he used a pitch fork and gloved hands to pick through a knotted wad of cloth and elastic that turned up in the pipes in recent days. The name of the designer-label undergarment was clearly visible. Over the years, staff have removed many curious items: an animal horn, bones, children's toys, cash. A pair of crinkled $5 bills are kept in the plant as examples of what can turn up. One worker told CBC he once found a $50 bill.  And a set of dentures.  Staff estimate they remove a ""five gallon bucket"" of untreatable items from pumping equipment every day. It takes valuable time, and puts staff at risk, according to Stewart. ""You get syringes. Sometimes we have razor blades,"" said Stewart. ""It's a hazard to employees because on a daily basis we have to go in and unplug these things from our pumps. ""Don't put anything in the toilet that isn't toilet paper or number one or number two."" Despite the ongoing problems, city residents are ""quite conscientous,"" according to Charlottetown's sewer and water manager. ""People have educated themselves,"" said Richard MacEwen. ""Island Waste Management does a great job of explaining how the waste-handling system works and people have embraced it."" The advent of disposable wipes has created a new challenge in recent years, according to MacEwen. ""They're not flushable,"" said MacEwen. Cooking oil and grease also clog pipes and should not be poured down kitchen drains. The city of Summerside says it's having trouble with people flushing mop heads.

264,Anonymous,2019-10-16T14:06:14.203Z,Chinese snooping tech spreads to countries vulnerable to abuse,"When hundreds of video cameras with the power to identify and track individuals started appearing in the streets of Belgrade as part of a major surveillance project, some protesters began having second thoughts about joining anti-government demonstrations in the Serbian capital. Local authorities assert the system, created by Chinese telecommunications company Huawei, helps reduce crime in the city of two million. Critics contend it erodes personal freedoms, makes political opponents vulnerable to retribution and even exposes the country's citizens to snooping by the Chinese government. The cameras, equipped with facial recognition technology, are being rolled out across hundreds of cities around the world, particularly in poorer countries with weak track records on human rights where Beijing has increased its influence through big business deals. With the United States claiming that Chinese state authorities can get backdoor access to Huawei data, the aggressive rollout is raising concerns about the privacy of millions of people in countries with little power to stand up to China. ""The system can be used to trail political opponents, monitor regime critics at any moment, which is completely against the law,"" said Serbia's former commissioner for personal data protection, Rodoljub Sabic. Groups opposed to Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic say police are leaking video of protests to pro-government media, which publish the images, along with the identities of participants. Vucic himself has boasted the police have the capability to count ""each head"" at anti-government gatherings. During a recent rally, protesters climbed up a pole and covered a camera lens with duct tape scrawled with the word ""censored."" Serbian police deny any such abuse of the Huawei system, which will eventually encompass 1,000 cameras in 800 locations throughout Belgrade. Huawei said in a statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations"" in Serbia and anywhere else it does business. While facial recognition technology is being adopted in many countries, spurring debate over the balance between privacy and safety, the Huawei system has gained extra attention due to accusations that Chinese laws requiring companies to assist in national intelligence work give authorities access to its data. As a result, some countries are reconsidering using Huawei technology, particularly the superfast 5G networks that are being rolled out later this year. Still, Huawei, which denies accusations of any Chinese government control, has had no trouble finding customers eager to install its so-called Safe Cities technology, particularly among countries that China has brought closer into its diplomatic and economic orbit. Besides Serbia, that list includes Turkey, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Angola, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kenya and Uganda, as well as a few liberal democracies like Germany, France and Italy. The system is used in some 230 cities, exposing tens of millions of people to its screening. In a promotional brochure, Huawei says its video surveillance technology can scan over long distances to detect ""abnormal behaviour"" such as loitering, track the movement of cars and people, calculate crowd size and send alerts to a command centre if it detects something suspicious. Local authorities can then act upon the information they receive. In one case advertised on its website, the company says a suspect in a hit-and-run accident in Belgrade was later discovered in China with the help of face recognition data shared by the Serbian police with their Chinese counterparts. In view of the cybersecurity accusations levelled by the U.S. and international rights groups against Huawei, the relationship between China and countries that use the company's technology is coming under renewed scrutiny. China's influence in Serbia, a European Union candidate that Beijing views as a gateway to the continent, has significantly expanded in recent years through Beijing's global Belt and Road investment programs. The populist Serbian regime has been keen to develop closer ties and the country's fragile democracy allows China's economic interests to grow relatively unchecked, without raising too many questions about human rights, environmental standards or transparency. China's state investment bank has granted billions of dollars in easy-term loans to build coal-powered plants, roads, railroads and bridges. Chinese police officers even help patrol the streets of Belgrade, a security presence officially billed as assisting the growing number of Chinese tourists who visit the city. It's a similar story in Uganda, where China has invested heavily in infrastructure like highways and a hydropower dam on the Nile. When longtime President Yoweri Museveni launched a $167 million Cdn project to install Huawei facial recognition systems a year ago, he said the cameras were ""eyes, ears and a nose"" to fight rampant street crime in the sprawling capital, Kampala. Opposition activists say the real goal is to deter street protesters against an increasingly unpopular government. ""The cameras are politically motivated,"" said Joel Ssenyonyi, a spokesman for the musician and activist known as Bobi Wine who has emerged as a powerful challenger to Museveni. ""They are not doing this for security. The focus for them is hunting down political opponents."" In neighbouring Kenya, the government has also renewed its focus on public safety after a spate of extremist attacks. It has been pushing to register people digitally, including by recording DNA, iris and facial data. To do so, it turned to China, which helped finance the installation of surveillance cameras in Kenya as far back as 2012. The Kenyan government wants to pool into one database all the information from public and private CCTV cameras, including those with facial recognition technology, a move that activists warn would vastly expand its surveillance powers in a country that does not have comprehensive data protection laws. A growing number of countries are following China's lead in deploying artificial intelligence to track citizens, according to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The group says at least 75 countries are actively using AI tools such as facial recognition for surveillance — and Huawei has sold its systems in 50 of those countries, giving it a far wider reach than competitors such as Japan-based NEC and U.S.-based IBM. ""It's very unclear what safeguards are being put in place,"" said Steven Feldstein, a Carnegie Endowment fellow who authored a report on the issue. ""Where are images being stored? How long are they being stored for? What kind of accountability procedures will there be? What type of operations will be linked to these surveillance cameras?"" Huawei said in an emailed statement that it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations in our countries of business. This is the most fundamental principle of our business operations. We are dedicated to bringing people better connectivity, eliminating digital gaps, and promoting the sustainable development of our societies and economies."" In Belgrade's bustling downtown Republic Square, high-tech video cameras are pointed in all directions from an office building as pedestrians hurry about their everyday business. With public authorities disclosing little about how the cameras work, a rights group has set up a tent to ask pedestrians whether they know they are being watched. ""We don't want to be in some kind of Big Brother society,"" said rights activist Ivana Markulic. ""We are asking: Where are the cameras, where are they hidden, how much did we pay for them and what's going to happen with information collected after this surveillance?""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/chinese-snooping-tech-1.5322428,[],N/A
265,Mike Crawley,2020-01-20T14:00:17.452Z,Why the Ford government isn't stopping teachers' strikes with back-to-work legislation just yet,"More than one million students across Ontario face a day of cancelled school in the coming week because of teachers' strikes, but the government of Premier Doug Ford is not using legislation to stop the walkouts — at least not yet.  Legislating teachers back to work is ""the last step,"" Ford said this week when he took questions from reporters at Queen's Park. ""What we really want to do is get a deal.""  How much labour disruption would it take for the government to legislate an end to the strikes? When I asked Education Minister Stephen Lecce, he said that's not his focus right now, and said negotiated agreements are the ""best option for all the parties.""   What neither Progressive Conservative politician mentioned: imposing back-to-work legislation now would not likely stand up in court. To defend such legislation, the government must persuade a court that its actions have a ""pressing and substantial purpose."" That's the legal test established by the Supreme Court of Canada to justify violating the right to free collective bargaining enshrined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A day of school lost here and there to rotating strikes almost certainly doesn't meet that bar, according to legal experts.  ""There's a difference between a pressing and substantial purpose and an inconvenience to the public,"" said Kevin Banks, director of Queen's University's Centre for Law in the Contemporary Workplace.  ""If the government's reasons [for back-to-work legislation] have to do with inconvenience, then it may well be too early,"" Banks said in an interview. ""If things get to the point where the school year is in jeopardy, I suspect that there's a good chance a court would say, 'Yes, that is a pressing and substantial purpose.'""  This is one of the key reasons why Ontario teachers unions are strategically choosing to hold one-day strikes. They fear a full-blown indefinite walkout would soon prompt the government to reach for the hammer of back-to-work legislation. The unions figure these short, rotating work stoppages are their best bet to dissuade the government from making such a move, or to win a legal battle if it comes to that.  Most recently in post-secondary education, it took weeks of strikes rather than days before previous Ontario governments resorted to legislation.  The 2018 strike at York University lasted two months before Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government introduced a back-to-work bill. It died when Queen's Park was dissolved for the election campaign, then the new Ford government moved to end the strike with its first piece of legislation.  In 2017, a faculty strike closed the province's 24 colleges, cancelling courses for hundreds of thousands of students for five weeks before the Wynne government legislated an end to the dispute. That back-to-work bill might not have withstood a legal challenge had the government brought it in sooner, Minister of Advanced Education Deb Matthews told reporters at the time.  ""You have to have a very, very good rationale, that the academic year [must be] in jeopardy,"" Matthews said, explaining that the Supreme Court set a ""very high bar.""  In the 1990s in Ontario, it typically took about five weeks into an education strike before an arm's-length body called the Education Relations Commission ruled that a labour dispute was putting the school year in jeopardy, giving the government the political go-ahead for back-to-work legislation. Mike Harris's Progressive Conservative government pre-empted that process in 1998, moving to legislate when some 200,000 students in eight boards had been out of class because of labour disputes for just two weeks at the beginning of the school year.   In 1997, the Harris government tried to use the courts to stop a province-wide strike just as it began.  A judge declined to give the province the emergency injunction it sought. A two-week strike ensued, ending when teachers returned to work voluntarily.  If the Ford government eventually chooses back-to-work legislation, it faces another key strategic decision: how to determine the terms of the contract? Does the government impose a contract or send the dispute to binding arbitration?   An arbitrator might give the teachers a contract that exceeds what the government wants to spend, either in a wage increase or class size provisions, issues at the centre of the current round of stalled negotiations.  An imposed contract would itself undoubtedly face a legal challenge. The government would again have to prove it is  meeting that legal test of a ""pressing and substantial purpose"" to justify violating the right to free collective bargaining.  Its likely argument: the province is in a serious fiscal imbalance and can't afford to give the teachers what they're asking for.  ""I'm not entirely sure that that argument would fly, but it's at least a plausible argument,"" said Banks.  It's an argument that will be put to the test in an upcoming legal challenge against the government's three-year cap on public sector wage increases at one per cent annually. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/etfo-public-teachers-strike-1.5427368 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-oecta-1.5425273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-teachers-unions-update-1.5429134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-french-teacher-work-to-rule-1.5428910,N/A
266,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:37:32.284Z,P.E.I. Lung Association targets adults in battle against youth vaping,"The P.E.I. Lung Association has launched a new toolkit to help parents, teachers and coaches talk to young people about vaping. The association, in partnership with the Home and School Federation and Sport P.E.I., has created a toolkit with different modules for teachers, parents and families, and coaches. ""We're trying to work with adult influencers that are in the youths' lives to get this information out to them,"" said Julia Hartley, the association's co-ordinator. Hartley said the P.E.I. organization decided to target adults because Health Canada already has an anti-vaping campaign aimed at youth and because surveys had shown them that many adults have misconceptions about vaping. The toolkit covers what vaping is, why it's popular with youth and how to have a conversation about it with young people. The information was still crafted with children in mind — focus groups this fall in Charlottetown and Stratford with youth ages 12 to 14 showed they wanted to hear personal stories from other youth, which is reflected in the material. ""We were trying to meet the kids where they're at and see the kinds of issues that would resonate with them,"" Hartley said. ""Often children aren't as affected by something that might happen to them in 20 years, but when they see someone else that's their age with an issue ... resulting directly from vaping, then I think that that's something that might connect with them a little better."" Aside from the toolkit, the association is lobbying for P.E.I. to follow in the footsteps of Nova Scotia, which is banning the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and juices as of April 1.  The non-profit group Smoke Free Nova Scotia recently conducted a survey that showed 95 per cent of youth who vape in Nova Scotia said they prefer flavoured juices, and more than 48 per cent said they would quit if flavours were banned. The only types of e-cigarettes and juice that will be available in Nova Scotia after the ban comes into effect are bland and tobacco. Hartley said the association wants the same rules in P.E.I.

He was arrested in September 2017 after police were called to the McKay home for a welfare check. Officers testified that they found Jason covered in blood as Jenny's body lay cold in the kitchen.  Dr. Thambirajah Balachandra, a forensic pathologist, testified Friday as the first week of the trial-by-judge came to an end at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench.  He confirmed a knife was still in Jenny's chest when he received her body for examination at the Pasqua Hospital. The medical expert said Jenny was stabbed 11 times to varying levels of severity in the chest after she died.   Balachandra concluded that she died because of blood loss brought on by injuries to her neck, particularly a stab wound that punctured her jugular and a cut wound across her lower neck.  ""The weapon moved transversely across the neck, multiple times,"" Balachandra said, describing the cut.  Balachandra was based in Regina on locum when he examined Jenny but he works in Edmonton and was testifying at court via video connection. Emotions intensified in the already tense courtroom when the camera fixed on the doctor panned down slightly, revealing a photograph of Jenny's wounded face and body on the screen.  The doctor found ""defensive"" wounds on her hands, multiple stab wounds to the neck, a stab wound to the stomach and another to her left thigh. Jenny's body also showed multiple abrasions and superficial cuts.  Balachandra said it was difficult to determine the exact time of death or how long it took for death to occur, while under cross examination by defence lawyer Thomas Hynes. However, he said that after Jenny suffered the wounds to the neck she could have died ""after five minutes."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074,[],N/A

269,Robert Jones,2020-01-16T09:50:25.154Z,Expert says true smart meter value won't emerge until after they're approved,"NB Power's application to buy and deploy advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has been handicapped into presenting only a fraction of the benefits the devices can deliver, a hearing was told Wednesday. An expert said the Energy and Utilities Board should look beyond NB Power's limited business case in deciding on the technology, which includes smart meters.  ""One of the challenges inherent in assessing the value of AMI metering infrastructure is that only a portion of future benefits may be known at the time of initial investment,"" said Philippe Dunsky, a Montreal based energy expert hired by NB Power to testify about potential ""unquantified benefits"" of smart meters. ""Many of those (AMI) services and capabilities are difficult to quantify"" he added. ""Some are not yet even known and I would argue probably most are not yet known."" As an example Dunsky said if NB Power uses smart meters in the future to introduce different prices for electricity at different times of the day it could nudge enough power consumption away from expensive peak hours in the winter to save itself $52 million over 15 years. But that potential saving is not included in NB Power's business case for smart meters because so called ""time-varying rates"" have not yet been approved in New Brunswick. ""This is a classic catch 22,"" said Dunsky.    ""NB Power cannot propose a specific rate design until it knows what metering infrastructure it is working with and the EUB is reluctant to account for benefits for a rate design not yet proposed."" ""While valued at zero in the business case I would encourage the EUB to give this benefit - with $52 million in potential rate payer savings in play, due consideration."" NB Power is in front of the Energy and Utilities Board seeking permission to spend $92 million to buy 360,000 smart meters and deploy them with most of its customer base. But it has been limited to presenting ""quantified benefits"" of the switch in its business case to try and win approval, like money it will save on meter reading and other efficiencies. On that narrow basis it has claimed the meters will generate a net benefit to the utility of $31.1 million over 15 years but the hearing has been chipping away at that number. Dunsky prepared a report suggesting there are at least 13 lucrative but currently unquantified benefits - like time varying rates - NB Power is prevented from counting.  He said that is making the case for smart meters seem less financially attractive than it really is. Two years ago in its decision to reject NB Power's first application for smart meters the EUB explained it had decided against including possible future benefits of smart meters in its evaluation. ""The Board acknowledges that there may be a number of non-quantifiable benefits that AMI would accrue to ratepayers and the utility,"" read the decision. ""For the purposes of this application, however, the Board does not consider non-quantifiable benefits as a factor that would overcome a negative business case.""  Under questioning from EUB lawyer Ellen Desmond, Dunsky acknowledged some of his examples were being given without evidence the hearing could look at and evaluate including a claim that a combination of time varying rates and expanding electric vehicle sales and charging would save NB Power another $51 million if smart meters were approved. ""Is there anything on the record that would allow interveners to test that ($51 million) evaluation,"" asked Desmond ""Could you point us to something where we could look at the details of that calculation, or anything of that nature?"" ""I can't point to something that's currently in the record,"" said Dunsky, ""I apologise. I put it in there.  I probably shouldn't have."" Despite the EUB's ruling two years ago that unquantified benefits did not count in its decision on smart meters the issue has again become a significant matter of discussion. Scott Stoll, a lawyer representing New Brunswick's municipal utilities has been asking witnesses whether, in a close call, the EUB should take potential but unquantified benefits into consideration.   And in its opening statement of the hearing NB Power made it a point to mention them prominently. ""Our business case is built on quantified benefits;"" said senior NB Power vice president Lori Clark. ""However, we also noted the many non-quantified benefits that make AMI a worthy investment.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-catch-22-1.5428720,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meters-eub-hearings-1.5427258 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meters-eub-hearings-1.5425284,N/A
270,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:18:38.451Z,Quebec to comply with ruling that struck down assisted death provisions ,"The Quebec government will comply with a court ruling striking down parts of its medical aid in dying legislation, the province's health and justice ministers announced Tuesday. The province will allow a provision stating those seeking a medically assisted death must be ""at the end of life'' to simply disappear from its legislation, the ministers said, without making any further amendments to the proposed law. The decision means more people will qualify for a medically assisted death, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said, reminding reporters that patients will still have to meet the law's five other criteria to qualify. ""They have a choice,'' McCann said. ""That's the spirit in which we made the decision — the self-determination that a human being who has met all those five criteria ... will have a choice.'' Last September, Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and a section the Quebec law that states people must ""be at the end of life,'' which prevented access to medical assistance in dying for some. The case was brought by two Quebec residents — Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon — who did not meet the criteria and had their requests for assisted death turned down by doctors. Both suffer from incurable degenerative diseases, and lawyers argued the condition that a person's natural death be ''reasonably foreseeable'' before they can receive medical assistance in dying was overly strict. Gladu suffers from post-polio syndrome and medication no longer helps alleviate her pain, the court heard. Doctors gave her about two to three years to live due to her pulmonary condition. Truchon has cerebral palsy. Three of his four limbs were not functional at birth, and he just lost the use of the fourth, but he could continue to live for many more years. The two launched a legal action against the federal and provincial governments, claiming their right to life, liberty and security — guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms — was infringed. Baudouin suspended the application of her judgment until March 11 to give federal and provincial legislators six months to modify the laws, while granting exemptions to Gladu and Truchon to seek medical aid in dying during this period if they satisfied other legal conditions. Neither the federal or provincial governments appealed the decision, although the federal government has not yet announced exactly what it intends to do. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly. The government launched public consultations on the issue. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel said her federal counterpart, David Lametti, is expected to brief provincial ministers this week in Victoria, B.C. ""Theoretically, as long as the federal criteria exists, it applies, so it's in effect until March 12,'' LeBel said, adding it's unclear if the federal government will seek an extension. The chair of the commission that oversees end-of-life care in the province is confident that despite the change in wording, there won't be a flood of people lining up for medical assistance in dying. ""The commission is not afraid that on March 12, the demand will increase tremendously,'' said Dr. Michel Bureau said. ""That's not what we believe.'' But LeBel said the time was right for Quebec to make its announcement, noting the province is about to embark on consultations to broaden the criteria on Jan. 27. ""We've taken our decision so it was the time to announce it,'' LeBel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890,N/A
271,Terry Roberts,2020-01-23T10:29:03.089Z,"With St. John's funeral business at a standstill in wake of blizzard, families struggle to say goodbye","Dozens of funerals have been put on hold in St. John's and area because of the extended state of emergency, and that's putting added stress on families trying to say goodbye to loved ones, and those who take care of the dead. ""People are going to have to be patient. Wait their turn, basically, is what it's come down to,"" said John Anderson, who manages Caul's Funeral Homes. ""It's very difficult. I feel for them. But that's the reality of this state of emergency at this time,"" added Father Cecil Critch, a Roman Catholic clergyman at the Basilica of St. John the Baptist. There hasn't been a memorial service at Caul's since Thursday, the day before a record-breaking blizzard delivered a massive amount of snow and punishing winds to much of eastern Newfoundland. St. John's implemented a state of emergency as the storm intensified, forcing businesses to close and vehicles off the streets. While restrictions have slowly been lifted, funeral homes remain closed. Churches are also closed, and most cemeteries — buried in a thick blanket of snow — are not expected to be ready to accept burials until next week. ""It's going to take us two to three days to clear it out,"" said Gordon Holden, who manages five cemeteries on behalf of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's. And when cemeteries are finally reopened, said Holden, it will be difficult to find burial plots because most grave markers are buried under the snow. ""We're going to have to start digging,"" said Holden. There's an unprecedented backlog of funerals at Caul's. Every wake room is filled. Bodies are lined up in the embalming room. ""We have 20 people in the building right now — that could be an urn or a person. That's quite a number of people awaiting services to take place. I've never seen it like this before. Never,"" said Anderson. Anderson knows of at least two cases of people dying during the height of the storm, and not being removed from their homes for up to 48 hours. One way to correct this in the future is to allow funeral homes to collect bodies during a state of emergency, with assistance from the city or other authorities, said Anderson. Some remains have been at the funeral home for a week, and services have been repeatedly rescheduled, only to be cancelled again, he said. So the home has stopped making any plans, until the all-clear comes from the city. Considering the snow-clogged condition of the streets, he agrees, it would not be wise to allow funeral homes to resume normal operations. ""If we had the general public here today, Lemarchant Road would just be filled. It wouldn't be fair to the neighbourhood,"" he said. So while the focus since Friday's storm has been on the living, it clearly hasn't been easy either for those who take care of the dead.

272,Anonymous,2020-01-23T02:46:45.716Z,Death toll from new coronavirus outbreak in China reaches 17,"The death toll from China's new respiratory virus in Hubei province has risen to 17 and the total number of confirmed cases has risen further, state television reported on Wednesday, citing the provincial government. The number of new cases has risen sharply in China, the centre of the outbreak. According to Chinese state television, there were more than 570 confirmed cases as of Wednesday. China discouraged public gatherings in Hubei province, where the virus emerged last month, and tightened containment measures in hospitals, while the World Health Organization (WHO) was due to hold an emergency meeting to determine whether the outbreak constituted a global health emergency. ""There has already been human-to-human transmission and infection of medical workers,"" Li said at a news conference with health experts. ""Evidence has shown that the disease has been transmitted through the respiratory tract and there is the possibility of viral mutation."" The illness comes from a newly identified type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people. Symptoms of the virus, which can cause pneumonia, include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can be passed from person to person. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. WATCH: 'Very high' probability that Canada will see coronavirus, says Toronto respirologist Hong Kong quarantined a 39-year-old man on Wednesday after the city's first preliminary positive result in a test for the new flu-like coronavirus found in an outbreak in central mainland China, authorities said. The tourist from Wuhan came to Hong Kong on Tuesday via high-speed rail from nearby Shenzhen and was detected as having fever at the border. He was in stable condition in an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, Health Minister Sophia Chan said. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, that the rapid flow of people across the Hong Kong border makes the city highly vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak.  ""The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control,"" the National Health Commission vice-minister told reporters. There was evidence that the virus was being spread through ""respiratory transmission,"" Li said. And, the director-general of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said virus was adapting and mutating, underscoring the challenges for health authorities. The Chinese government has provided updates on the number of cases in a bid to head off panic, as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel at home and abroad for Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week. Gao said officials are working on the assumption that the outbreak resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating. Mutations can make the virus spread faster or make people sicker. Thailand authorities Wednesday confirmed four cases, a Thai national and three Chinese visitors. Japan, South Korea, the United States and Taiwan have all reported one case each. All of the illnesses were of people from Wuhan or who recently had traveled there. ""The situation is under control here,"" Thailand Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, saying there are no reports of the infection spreading to others. ""We checked all of them: taxi drivers, people who wheeled the wheelchairs for the patients, doctors and nurses who worked around them."" Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is a semi-autonomous Chinese city, reported one case Wednesday. WATCH: Emerging disease specialist optimistic that coronavirus can be contained   Travel agencies that organize trips to North Korea say the country has banned foreign tourists because of the outbreak. Most tourists to North Korea are either Chinese or travel to the country through neighbouring China. North Korea also closed its borders in 2003 during the SARS scare. Other countries have also stepped up screening measures for travellers from China, especially those arriving from Wuhan. Worries have been heightened by the coming of the Lunar New Year holiday rush. U.S. officials said they will begin screening travellers coming from Wuhan at three major airports — New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. While in Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News that it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the last 14 days.  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. Officials said it was too early to compare the new virus with SARS or MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, in terms of how lethal it might be. They attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring. Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said ""the disease will continue to develop. It has developed different features compared with the early stage, and the prevention and precautionary measures need to change accordingly."" WATCH: Should Canadians be worried about the coronavirus? Dr. David Heymann, who headed WHO's global response to SARS in 2003, said the new virus appears dangerous to older people with other health conditions, but doesn't look nearly as infectious as SARS. ""It looks like it doesn't transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,"" he said. ""That was not the case with SARS."" Health officials confirmed earlier this week that the disease can be spread between humans after finding two infected people in Guangdong province in southern China who had not been to Wuhan. Fifteen medical workers also tested positive for the virus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has said. Fourteen of them, one doctor and 13 nurses, were infected by a patient who had been hospitalized for neurosurgery but also had the coronavirus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/as-wuhan-virus-spreads-fears-about-pandemic-readiness-1.5435286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494,N/A
273,Anonymous,2020-01-18T20:06:31.262Z,"More than 150 injured after police, protesters clash in Lebanon's capital","Police fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in Lebanon's capital Saturday to disperse thousands of protesters amid some of the worst rioting since demonstrations against the country's ruling elite erupted three months ago. More than 150 people were injured. The violence began when some protesters started throwing stones at police deployed near the parliament building while others removed street signs and metal barriers and hurled them at security forces. Protesters also threw firecrackers at police. The clashes took place with the backdrop of a rapidly worsening financial crisis and an ongoing impasse over the formation of a new government after the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in late October. Lebanon has witnessed three months of protests against the political elite who have ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. The protesters blame politicians for widespread corruption and mismanagement in a country that has accumulated one of the largest debt ratios in the world. The protesters had called for a demonstration Saturday afternoon with the theme ""we will not pay the price"" in reference to debt that stands at about $87 billion ($114 billion Cdn), or more than 150 per cent of GDP. As rioting took place in central Beirut, thousands of other protesters arrived later from three different parts of the city to join the demonstration. They were later dispersed and chased by police into nearby Martyrs Square, which has been a centre for protests. Lebanon's Internal Security Forces called on all peaceful protesters to ""immediately leave the area of riots for their own safety."" It added that some policemen who were taken for treatment at hospitals were attacked by protesters inside the medical centres. As clashes continued, some two dozen men believed to be parliament guards attacked the protesters' tents in Martyrs Square, setting them on fire. A gas cylinder inside one of the tents blew up. The fire spread quickly and charred a nearby shop. The bells of nearby St. George Cathedral began to toll in an apparent call for calm, while loudspeakers at the adjacent blue-domed Muhammad Al-Amin mosque called for night prayers. Later in the evening, hundreds of protesters chanting ""Revolution"" chased a contingent of riot police near the entrance of the mosque, forcing them to withdraw. Inside the mosque, several men were treated for gas inhalation and some families were said to be hiding inside. ""We call on the security forces to be merciful with women and children inside the mosque,"" a statement blared through the mosque's loudspeakers. President Michel Aoun called on security forces to protect peaceful protesters and work on restoring calm in downtown Beirut and to protect public and private property. He asked the ministers of defence and interior and heads of security agencies to act. ""The confrontations, fires and acts of sabotage in central Beirut are crazy, suspicious and rejected. They threaten civil peace and warn of grave consequences,"" tweeted Hariri, the caretaker prime minister, who lives nearby. He called those behind the riots ""outlaws"" and called on police and armed forces to protect Beirut. The Lebanese Red Cross said it took 65 people to hospitals and treated 100 others on the spot, calling on people to donate blood. As the clashes continued, more ambulances were seen rushing to the area and evacuating the injured. Late on Saturday most of the protesters were forced out of the area by police firing tear gas and sometimes rubber bullets. Still, security remained tight as more reinforcements arrived. Panic and anger gripped the public as they watched their local currency, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummet, losing more than 60 per cent of its value in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and foreign inflows dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most of its basic goods. Meanwhile, banks have imposed informal capital controls, limiting withdrawal of dollars and foreign transfers. Earlier this week, protesters carried out acts of vandalism in a main commercial area in Beirut targeting mostly private banks. Adding to the crisis, Lebanon has been without a government since Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned Oct. 29, meeting a key demand of the protesters. Prime minister-designate Hassan Diab had been expected to announce an 18-member cabinet on Friday, but last minute disputes among political factions scuttled his latest attempt.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-protests-1.5431739,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371,N/A

""AI is certainly very good [at] enhancing vast amounts of data, so for example, recognizing one face in a million different faces, or collecting data on people's habits and then recognizing patterns,"" said Dautenhahn, director of the social and intelligent robotics research lab at the University of Waterloo. ""What machines are not very good at is common sense and general intelligence, so for example machines lack compassion, they lack empathy."" Dautenhahn said those common sense decisions are vital for politicians ""because they are dealing with incomplete information, they have to make quick decisions, they have to make predictions."" ""That's what people are very good at and it is because we are human beings,"" she said. Istvan argued that decisions based on emotion can lead to ""total chaos."" ""That's why we want pure reason, pure statistical analysis,"" he said. He told Lynch that ""even if the picture is incomplete, a statistical analysis of that would make a much better decision than something that comes out with emotions."" ""Frankly, the last thing I want is [U.S. President Donald] Trump to be emotional as he's making decisions with the military and things like that."" Istvan said the qualities needed for leadership could eventually be programmed into robots, but Dautenhahn warned that the people programming them could unwittingly introduce their own biases. ""I would certainly not vote for a robot because ... there's no such thing as pure rational decision-making,"" she said. Dautenhahn acknowledged that humans make mistakes, but perhaps robotics could be used to help us make better-informed decisions, rather than just making them for us. ""I think humans are pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good in what they're doing, and they can certainly be complemented by AI, in areas where the AI is very good."" Written by Padraig Moran.

Minister Adrian Dix and Dr. Bonnie Henry issued a joint statement saying there have been no cases of illness caused by the coronavirus in Canada and the risk to British Columbians is considered low. However, they said, health-care workers have been asked to be vigilant and take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms following the outbreak first identified in China. The BC Centre for Disease Control has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, which is different from the SARS outbreak in late 2002, when there was no similar test. Public health teams have also implemented screening for early detection of infections for travellers arriving in airports. Dix and Henry said quarantine officers are available at Vancouver International Airport to co-ordinate response, and Richmond Hospital infection control practitioners are ready to respond should there be a need to investigate. Health-care workers who suspect an instance of coronavirus are asked to report it to their local medical health officers immediately. ""Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811,"" the joint statement said. ""We encourage anyone travelling to or from China to visit the federal source of destination-specific travel information that provides important advice to help travellers make informed decisions and travel safely while abroad."" Most cases of the illness have been reported in Wuhan and other cities in China, with smaller numbers reported in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Thailand. The first case in the United States was reported Tuesday in Washington state, where a resident had recently returned from travel to Wuhan.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-coronavirus-screening-test-airports-1.5436045,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,N/A
277,Andie Bulman,2020-01-23T14:57:11.141Z,Bartering in the blizzard: How a neighbourhood managed before the stores reopened,"We'll always remember this storm.  Stories of how we tunneled through snowdrifts to free our neighbours, and collectively heralded Baby Snow as our once and future king, will be swapped for years. For me, the most significant lesson learned is that bartering and sharing are alive and well.  Like most of us, I barely left my house on Friday. I made one trek outdoors (I live in the Georgestown neighbourhood, not far from the downtown core), but mostly draped myself in blankets, played Scrabble, and prayed to the Netflix gods that we wouldn't lose power. Saturday came and our power flickered back on. I thanked the Netflix gods and the Light and Power B'ys. Then I turned on the radio. The state of emergency was already a day in effect. Roads were carless, stores were closed. The mayor warned that this could continue for at least a few days. My supplies had held up pretty good, but I made a few critical errors — most notably, I was already low on butter. I reached out to the world via Facebook. Beehak (a talented pastry chef) responded! She would be happy to trade a cup of butter for two eggs. We met halfway down Barnes Road and made the swap. It felt like something that would have happened in the 1930s. Later that day, I baked several blueberry crisps and bartered one for ground coffee and buttermilk (I wanted to make waffles). I also gave a blueberry crisp to my next-door neighbours. They had lent me snowshoes, so I could venture downtown into the carless snowglobe world. The trade seemed more than fair. I'm a creature who consumes tons of butter and after an afternoon of baking, I was low again. I emptied out my liquor cabinet and swapped vodka for more butter. Later in the day, I traded tonic water and limes for chips and tea bags.  Each time I left my house, I carried a backpack and shovel.  I stopped at neighbours' houses and pitched in along the way. The neighbourhood was alive. People were trading supplies, digging out fire hydrants, and helping each other out. I passed several bonfires, impromptu snowboarding trails and really gorgeous snow forts. I was constantly offered beer in exchange for my labour, which seemed especially generous considering what a hot commodity beer is in the barter system. I've been trying to do a dry January, so I declined each time. In one neighbourhood, a big Victorian house had set up a hot chocolate booth and from all over weary shovels stopped for a break. The snow was brutal, but compassion and sharing matched it tit for tat. Our own car was buried in a seven-foot drift. Friends, my husband and I tackled it for two hours and took a break. When I returned to my car, someone had blown it out completely. I could have kissed them — or at least given them a high five. By late Saturday, Mark Wilson, organic farmer and man about town, set up a Facebook Group called Stone Soup. It was/is a place where people could swap supplies or ask for help if their food ran out during the state of emergency. Some folks offered to trek across the city in skis to deliver toilet paper. Others baked bread and knocked on doors. I hope Mark keeps the site up, because it almost stands as a monument to both human kindness and the lack of food security we have in this province.  By Sunday, I had settled into my state of emergency routine. Shovel something for someone, catch up on missed work and emails, go for a walk and trade my supplies for other supplies, keep an eye on Stone Soup in case someone needed something that I had, and then read or play video games with my dog and husband.  Monday night, we had a neighbourhood cookout, something we haven't done before. Circular Road was like another world, never seen anything like it. Here's what it was like yesterday when ever a plow couldn't make it through the street <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/nHKZdxnYbf"">pic.twitter.com/nHKZdxnYbf</a> Luke and Nina opened up their home and carved out some snow seats in their front lawn. Others baked treats, emptied out their freezers, and dragged over their barbecues. We had a celeriac, apple and moose sausage dish; carrot ginger soup; leek and potato soup; Jim Lahey's famous no-knead bread, ribs, moose chili, nachos and more blueberry crumble. Everyone brought their babies. The good cheer was palatable. I broke my resolution of having a dry January and had a glass of prosecco. After all of the bartering and kindness, sharing a drink with my neighbours had never seemed so important.

278,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-07T23:39:58.722Z,New pilot for P.E.I. school lunch program adds private contractors into the mix,"What P.E.I.'s new school lunch program will look like will be decided based on the outcomes of two separate pilot projects to start later this month and run until the end of the current school year, the province's standing committee on education and economic growth was told Tuesday. John Cummings, executive director of educational services with the P.E.I Department of Education and Lifelong Learning, said one pilot will see existing food service vendors at three schools offer healthy lunch options. École Pierre-Chiasson in Deblois, West Kent Elementary in Charlottetown and Montague High School will take part in that pilot. Another pilot involving the Kinkora family of schools will see the kitchen at Kinkora High used as a food distribution hub. Two staff with the Public Schools Branch will prepare meals and deliver them to nearby Amherst Cove Consolidated and Somerset Consolidated schools. Initially, the province had planned on using only the ""hub model,"" with school board staff preparing and distributing meals, but Education Minister Brad Trivers told the committee ""we want to make sure that vendors get a chance to get in there and provide the food, and we don't eliminate them from the process."" But MLAs from all sides questioned whether for-profit companies like Chartwells, which will be involved in the pilot program at Montague High, can meet the program's objectives of providing healthy meals using local ingredients at a cost per student of just $5. ""I think there's definitely challenges,"" said Health Minister James Aylward, referring to his own background in the food service and hospitality industries. ""I'm completely supportive of the program, but there's definitely challenges."" Liberal MLA Heath MacDonald suggested the province tap into growing revenues to completely fund the program for all students — using the government hub model — for one year. ""We spend money on all kinds of other things,"" he said. ""Let's take a look at this, make it work and then decipher what's the best route going forward."" Cummings said both pilots would include a grant component to enable students with financial challenges to participate. Addressing concerns from Liberal MLA Sonny Gallant, Cummings said the grants will be ""invisible"" so that ""there would be no distinguishing"" whether students paid or didn't pay, although he said the process would vary from school-to-school and the specific details have yet to be worked out. Cummings said contractors participating in the program could also receive grants to allow them to meet the requirement of offering healthy meals at a cost of $5. He said those contractors will also be allowed to continue to offer their existing menu options, although those options will eventually have to meet the criteria of a new healthy food policy currently under development by the Public Schools Branch. Another detail Cummings said hadn't been worked out yet is how food providers will be encouraged to use local ingredients in their meal options. Over the coming months, Cummings said a non-profit organization will be formed to implement and oversee the school lunch program. He said that organization would be able to accept donations from the public and corporations. Facing questions from the Green Party as to whether his department is fully prepared for the launch, Trivers reiterated government's commitment to have the program at all Island schools in the fall of 2020. ""This is a priority for the government, you might even go as far to say it's a flagship project, because this is about the wellness of our population,"" Trivers told the committee. ""We're going to make sure it's successful.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-lunch-program-1.5418313,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-edibles-sales-on-target-1.5417540 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bannister-disgraceful-conduct-1.4611014,N/A
279,Alexander Panetta,2019-12-19T13:03:23.172Z,What makes Trump's impeachment so unusual,"Two factors help explain why Donald Trump felt emboldened to deliver the most strangely celebratory reaction to becoming the third president ever impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives. Both were on display Wednesday. Taken together, they reveal why he might feel free to bask in short-term invincibility, knowing that Republicans will not — under any currently imaginable circumstance — vote to oust him from office whenever the impeachment process moves to the Senate, which they control. He jubilantly read out the news, at a rally Wednesday in Michigan, that his party had stuck with him. Yes, he'd been impeached, but not a single House Republican voted for it. ""Wow,"" Trump said, to cheers in Battle Creek, Mich. ""We didn't lose one Republican vote."" Watch Trump brush off impeachment at a Michigan rally: So unlike Bill Clinton, who, under pressure from his own party, made a contrite public appearance after his 1998 impeachment, Trump reacted with a speech mocking his opponents as ""crooked Hillary"" and ""Pocahontas,"" referring to Hillary Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, respectively. He also ridiculed the family name of presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as hard to pronounce, joked that a recently deceased congressman might be suffering in hell and celebrated his firing of former FBI director James Comey. What a different scene it was 1,000 kilometres away in Washington, D.C. With a thud of the gavel, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the impeachment vote as official — then shot a withering stare at members of her party who appeared to begin cheering. They quickly stopped clapping. Democrats were determined to cast this as a solemn affair, the reprimand of a president for apparently soliciting foreign dirt against an election opponent and for then obstructing congressional investigations. Watch the moment Trump gets impeached: But in Trump-era Washington, seemingly not even the most sacred civic ceremony remains entirely solemn.  Not even the impeachment of a president. In a unique event in U.S. history, Trump now appears poised to become the first president ever to get impeached and then seek re-election as the nominee of a major party. Andrew Johnson was rejected by the Democrats after his 1868 impeachment, Bill Clinton was halfway through his final term when he was impeached and Richard Nixon quit before being pushed out in 1974. For 2020, Republicans have made it clear that, barring some unforeseen shocker, he'll be their nominee. One reason for their fealty is personal. The other invokes principle. And examples of both these reasons resonated in the congressional precinct during Wednesday's debate. For a personal example of what happens when members of Trump's party turn on him, one former Republican voter shared an anecdote while standing on a sidewalk outside the U.S. Capitol building. Ethan Cusey said he remains a conservative and supports causes like gun rights, but he abandoned his old party after it nominated Trump. On Wednesday, he took a train into D.C. from his home in Reston, Va., and, for several hours, stood on a corner outside the Capitol holding a sign, ""Honk 4 Impeach."" That political stance has come at a cost. ""I lost a lot of friends,"" said Cusey, a 22-year-old studying audio-video engineering. ""Lost a lot of people I used to admire.… The more people rationalized [in support of Trump], the more people gave up what made them respectable people."" When asked if the experience has been isolating, he noted, cheerfully, that many cars were honking in support as they passed him on Constitution Avenue. Inside the Capitol, it's been lonely for other Republicans who oppose Trump; they've either been driven out of Congress or, in the case of Justin Amash, out of the Republican Party as pariahs.  Amash now sits as an Independent and his vote was the closest thing to a Republican vote for impeachment in the House of Representatives. The other development that explained congressional Republicans' loyalty to Trump unfolded in a courtroom Wednesday.  Trump has delivered on his chief promise to conservatives: to create a more right-wing judiciary, as his administration nominates judges at a dizzying pace.  It just so happened that Republicans celebrated as one Trump-appointed judge played a clinching role Wednesday in a 2-1 decision where a circuit court struck down a key element of Barack Obama's landmark health law. The court did the administration another favour: it delayed the effect of the decision until after next year's election, so Trump won't have to deal with the complex, politically fraught issue of health reform in a campaign year. Back inside the impeachment vote, Democrats chastised their Republican colleagues for betraying their higher oath to the country. Pelosi kicked off the 11-hour debate by standing next to a poster with a U.S. flag, inscribed with a line from the Pledge of Allegiance. She quoted George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, and warned that Trump's behaviour would threaten America's ability to hold free and fair elections without the foreign interference so feared by the founding generation. ""Our founders' vision of the republic is under threat,"" Pelosi said. ""Today is a national civics lesson — though a sad one."" When he entered the chamber several hours later, Adam Schiff, one of the Democrats leading the process, quoted another founder. Speaking in the dimly lit House, which was four-fifths empty at that moment, Schiff said Trump was the kind of demagogue Alexander Hamilton warned about. ""If what we're talking about is not impeachable, then nothing is impeachable,"" Schiff said. He predicted that Republicans would someday rue their obeisance to Trump. It's safe to say they aren't there yet. Republicans responded with their own founding-father quotes, citing Hamilton on the danger of a partisan impeachment: ""Mob rule,"" is how Republican Gregory Murphy described impeachment. So if the voters are to decide Trump's fate in next year's election, what do the polls say? His approval ratings have budged a point here and there, but remain locked where they were on Sept. 24, the day Democrats announced impeachment proceedings. Some surveys even show him performing better than usual. As for impeachment, different polling aggregators reach nearly identical conclusions: that the country is deadlocked, with support and opposition to Trump's removal from office within a single percentage point of each other. Support for impeachment may have even dipped a bit. One possible reason for that, beyond the rock-solid wall of defence around Trump in conservative media, is advertising. Steven Passwaiter, who heads the political monitoring unit at the media-intelligence group Kantar Media, said 80 per cent of spending on televised impeachment ads is happening in 15 key congressional districts. And he said Republicans are outspending the Democrats at a margin exceeding 3 to 1. Republicans are using the occasion to stoke the passions of the president's 2016 voters in advance of the 2020 vote.  Nearly every Republican who spoke on the House floor described the process as an attempt to steal the votes of 63 million Americans who backed Trump in 2016. One even called for a moment of silence in the Congress on Wednesday for those 63 million Americans. They likened the impeachment to Christ's crucifixion. Trump emphasized that message of group martyrdom at his rally in Michigan.  The president told the crowd, speaking of impeachment, ""Anything to get rid of us. Not me,"" he said, motioning as if hugging the crowd. ""Us."" Pelosi is playing coy about when she might send the impeachment articles to the Senate, saying she wants to know if it plans to conduct an impartial trial. That impartial trial doesn't sound likely. But Democrats predict Republicans will pay someday for their behaviour — if not in a Senate trial, and if not in next year's election, then eventually, and then with their reputation for all of history. ""Our children are watching. No president ever wants to be impeached. Whether Donald Trump leaves in one month, one year, or five years, this impeachment is permanent,"" California Democrat Ted Lieu told the House chamber.  ""It will follow him around for the rest of his life and history books will record it. And people will know why we impeached. It's all very simple: No one is above the law."" Watch Pelosi discuss Trump's impeachment: After about four hours protesting outside in the cold Wednesday, Cusey left the Capitol.  As he was leaving, news of the Republican win in the Obamacare case landed. Asked whether these kinds of conservative victories made it worth swallowing his pride and re-entering the Republican fold to embrace Trump, he brushed off the idea. ""Mussolini made the trains run on time,"" Cusey said. ""But Italy would have been much better off without him regardless."" What's the point of having a conservative court, he asked, if future presidents can just ignore their obligations under the law. Republicans brushed off these dire warnings. Trump said his foes would carry their vote as an eternal mark of shame. He tweeted about 50 times about impeachment Wednesday, Then he flew to a rally — all this despite his office insisting he was too busy working to pay attention to impeachment.   ""I don't know about you but I'm having a great time,"" the president told the Michigan crowd. ""It's crazy.""  And the crowd chanted, ""Four more years.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-house-vote-analysis-1.5401650,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/scannable-trump-impeachment-vote-1.5401967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-attacks-democrats-following-impeachment-vote-1.5401907 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-house-wednesday-1.5400411 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/what-will-history-say-about-the-trump-impeachment-1.5400734 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-what-s-next-2020-election-1.5384753 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/pelosi-impeachment-profile-1.5398154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-process-history-1.5296386 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-donald-trump-impeachment-senate-trial-1.5394531 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-nixon-comparison-1.5351756,N/A
280,Christine Rankin,2020-01-22T15:12:41.047Z,Hamilton and Niagara hospitals are consistently running over capacity,"Hamilton General Hospital exceeded its total capacity almost every single day for acute care within the first six months of last year— 172 days total out of the 181 day stretch.  While the General rates as one of the most crowded in the province, for the first half of 2019, most Hamilton hospitals and select hospitals in Niagara were regularly overcrowded and operating at over 100 per cent capacity for acute care.  Data obtained by CBC News through a Freedom of Information request reveals that the problem of hallway medicine has become increasingly common across the province, as sites regularly exceed their capacities. Out of 169 acute care hospital sites across Ontario, Hamilton General Hospital is the fourth most frequently filled beyond capacity. It's just seven overcrowded days behind Mackenzie Health's Richmond Hill hospital, which was over capacity for all but two days of the six-month period.  At the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, the average admitted patient waited 46 hours in the ER before getting a bed on a ward in November, the most recent month for which statistics are available. Hamilton Health Science's McMaster location and St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton were similarly filled beyond capacity for acute care— the McMaster site ran at or above 100 per cent capacity for 113 days, while St. Joseph's ran at or above capacity for 139.  ""We've got warning signs going off all over the province and the situation just isn't viable,"" said Anthony Dale, chief executive of the Ontario Hospital Association.  ""All across the province you have hospitals at extremely high levels of occupancy,"" said Dale in an interview with CBC News. ""What we're seeing is that it's no longer just during the flu season but it's all year round."" The chronic nature of the overcrowding ""is simply not sustainable, not for patients, not for people who work in hospitals,"" said Dale.  Winnie Doyle, the executive vice-president of clinical operations and chief nurse at Hamilton's St. Joseph's Healthcare, said that the concept of operating beyond capacity isn't a new one.  ""Over capacity in acute care hospitals and in mental health and addictions is a very long standing issue where throughout the year, we'll have spikes in demand"" she said. ""So it's not a new issue. I would say it's a more persistent issue than it perhaps was around 10 years ago.""  She added that the hospital works hard through programs that allow in-home care and constant work with community groups to make space at the hospital. And when the hospital does get overcrowded, they open up other areas like day rooms or double up hospital rooms to ensure patients aren't in hallways. While the Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Centre has most of its days listed as ""under review"" in the data viewed by CBC, all 50 days reported so far exceeded the limit, with most punching in at over 120 per cent capacity.  Shortages of care outside hospitals also contribute to the overcrowding. One out of six hospital beds is occupied by a patient who doesn't need to be in hospital, but cannot be safely discharged home — a phenomenon known as ""alternate level of care"" (ALC).  Some main causes are lengthy waits for long-term care spaces, and a lack of available home or continuing care. While the number of ALC patients remained static between 3,500 and 4,000 for the first half of the 2010s, it grew over the past five years, exceeding 5,300 in September 2019, according to figures from the Ontario Hospital Association.  The pattern of overcrowding extends across the Brant-Hamilton- Niagara-Haldimand region, with eight hospitals sites out of 14 averaging at over 100 per cent capacity for acute care. Five of them surpassed the 120 per cent capacity mark at least once.  Niagara Health's Greater Niagara General Hospital is tied with Peterborough Regional Health Centre for having the second most over capacity days in the six months — 176 in total.  In a statement, Niagara Health also confirmed that its occupancy rate continued to average at 104 per cent for the last half of 2019.  They said while there are ""multiple contributing factors"" to hospital capacity, one quarter of the patients in their acute care beds ""no longer need hospital care and could be safely discharged with appropriate supports."" To combat the problem, they're focusing on helping patients learn to safely manage their chronic conditions at home to keep people out of the hospital. They say one of their programs that gives people support for 60 days after their discharge has shown ""great reductions in emergency department visits, hospital re-admissions, and days spent in hospital.""  Another program supported by the Ministry of Health connects patients to a team of people who will provide in-home care up to 16 weeks.    But other categories of care are also overwhelmed in the region — while Niagara's St. Catharines General Hospital operated at 99.5 per cent capacity for acute care, it regularly ran over capacity for mental health care, spending 152 days over capacity with four of these over 120 per cent.  NDP leader and MPP for Hamilton Centre Andrea Horwath said that the numbers aren't surprising and reflect what people ""already know"" — that hallway medicine is ""getting worse"" and that hospital staff are run off their feet.  During the 2018 provincial election, the Progressive Conservative government's campaign promised to tackle and end hallway health care.  Hamilton will be among the first cities to undergo the provincial government's overhaul of the health care system and implement a ""health team"", which the city said would, at least in some part, address hallway healthcare.  The Ontario Hospital Association's 2020 budget recommendations call for a 4.85 per cent funding increase to $922 million to ""maintain access to care."" It also says that Ontario spends less per capita on hospitals than any other provincial government. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-hallway-medicine-healthcare-over-capacity-1.5434572,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-health-team-ontario-1.5373917 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-civic-etobicoke-general-hallway-health-care-1.5339511,N/A
281,Dan Ralph,2020-01-23T19:22:24.808Z,CFL to stage league's 1st regular-season game in Halifax,"Brett Lauther will be returning home this summer. The CFL announced Thursday it will hold a regular-season game in Halifax in July. The Toronto Argonauts will host the Saskatchewan Roughriders on July 25 at Huskies Stadium at Saint Mary's University. It will be a homecoming for Lauther, the Riders kicker and Saint Mary's alumnus who hails from Truro. N.S. And with Regina hosting the Grey Cup in November, Lauther has another big reason to look forward to the 2020 season. ""It's going to be surreal,"" Lauther said. ""Getting to come home and be with family and friends who've kind of followed me on this journey and getting to play in my own back yard is going to be something I'll never forget. ""My first (CFL) game was in Moncton and I thought it couldn't get better than that so I kind of feel pretty spoiled right now."" Saskatchewan, under first-year head coach Craig Dickenson, finished atop the West Division with a 13-5 record before losing 20-13 to the eventual Grey Cup-champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the division final. Toronto (4-14) missed the CFL playoffs for a second straight year. The Argos have a new head coach in Ryan Dinwiddie, a former quarterbacks coach with the Calgary Stampeders. Lauther, 29, made his CFL debut Sept. 21, 2013 with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats when they dropped a 28-26 decision to the Montreal Alouettes before 15,123 spectators at Moncton Stadium. The CFL staged an exhibition game at Huskies Stadium in 2005 as 11,148 watched Toronto and Hamilton battle to a 16-16 tie. A three-day festival will precede the game in what the CFL says will mark its biggest Touchdown Atlantic ever. ""Our league belongs to Canadians from coast-to-coast-to-coast — and for one fabulous weekend this July, the east coast will be its capital,"" CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. ""We are bringing the football and the fun. ""We're inviting everyone in Atlantic Canada to join the party, and everyone in the rest of the country to come for the game and stay for a vacation."" The CFL said roughly 6,000 temporary seats will be installed at Huskies Stadium to boost capacity for the game to 10,000. The previous four Touchdown Atlantic games were held in Moncton, N.B. Last year, Montreal defeated Toronto 28-22 before 10,126 spectators at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium. ""We've got that loyal fanbase that just loves it and giving up that game is tough for them, especially doing it two years in a row,"" said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. ""But we've all been asked to have that greater vision. ""One of the most important pieces of the puzzle when you look at our growth and where we're going is a team in Atlantic Canada. To me, truly uniting us from coast to coast is a significant sacrifice for our season-ticket holder but it's a small sacrifice as we look at the vision of the league and where we're trying to go."" Schooners Sports and Entertainment (SSE), a group trying to secure a CFL expansion franchise for Halifax, is again sponsoring the game. It did so also last year. ""The game here in 2005 had over 10,000 fans and I think having a regular-season game is super exciting,"" said Bruce Bowser, a founder and owner of SSE. ""We've been promoting Saskatchewan as a sort of a role model for what football in Atlantic Canada could look like with the fans, fanbase and enthusiasm they have around the team. ""Atlantic Canadians seeing Roughriders fans and Riderville here is going to really be inspiring."" Last month, Halifax Regional Municipality voted in favour of providing a one-time $20-million contribution to a proposed CFL-friendly stadium so long as it was located at a site other than Shannon Park. SSE had settled on a six- to eight-hectare site at Shannon Park, a surplus military site in north-end Dartmouth, for $110-million stadium. But a report suggested the site lacks transportation options to get spectators to and from the venue and would need millions of dollars in infrastructure investment. Ambrosie has remained bullish on Halifax becoming the league's 10th franchise. But he has stated repeatedly it's contingent on a suitable stadium being built in the largest city in Atlantic Canada. ""It's a slow process, a lot slower than what I'm used to as an entrepreneur,"" Bowser said. ""We're now out looking at other sites, we're working very closely with the league and some of the teams to bring in their areas of expertise in buildings and team operations and management so we put the right plans together."" Tickets will go on sale at the end of next month. Although prices weren't announced, Ambrosie stressed the game will be affordable with an average ticket price of approximately $50. For Lauther, a 10th team in the CFL would only reinforce what he's continually told people across the league about the Maritimes. ""I'd like showing off where I'm from,"" he said. ""I always try to tell my teammates coaches and everyone else, how awesome it is out here and what it's like. ""No one really has a chance to come out . . . but for me to be able to come back and at least play a couple games each year where friends and family could come see would be so special.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-to-stage-league-s-1st-regular-season-game-in-halifax-1.5436219,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/atlantic-schooners-cfl-franchise-halifax-hfx-wanderers-fc-1.5262867 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grey-cup-rescued-kenora-hotel-fire-1.5432185,N/A
282,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:59:09.204Z,China confirms human-to-human transmission of new coronavirus,"Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed in an outbreak of a new coronavirus, the head of a Chinese government expert team said Monday, as the total number of cases more than tripled and the virus spread to other cities in China. Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the health commission team investigating the outbreak, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members, state media said. Human-to-human transmission — spread from close contact, some such as among family members — could make the virus spread more quickly and widely, if it spreads easily. The outbreak is believed to have started from people who picked it up at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China.  Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for identifying cases. Four have died. The official Chinese Xinhua News Agency reported that as of 6 p.m. local time on Jan. 20, a total of 224 cases of the new coronavirus infection were reported in China, including 217 confirmed cases: There are also seven suspected cases: two in Sichuan, one in Yunnan Province, two in Shanghai, one in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and one in Shandong Province. In a statement posted on its official Weibo social media account, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed, with pneumonia with one other suspected case. Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added. If health-care workers were not exposed at the seafood market but from an encounter with a patient then that's a signal, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer.  It emphasizes the importance of standard infection prevention and control precautions, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. World Health Organization director general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will convene an emergency committee on what it calls the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The committee will meet on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it. Declaring a global health emergency can bring more international attention and aid. WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas in 2016 and the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital, said Monday the key questions about the virus include: ""This may be more widespread in China than it was earlier believed,"" Bogoch said. Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Zhong said the two people in Guangdong had not been to Wuhan but fell ill after family members had returned from the city, the China Daily said. The outbreak has put other countries on alert as millions of Chinese travel for Lunar New Year. Authorities in Thailand and in Japan have already identified at least three cases, all involving recent travel from China. South Korea reported its first case Monday, when a 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan tested positive for the new coronavirus one day after arriving at Seoul's Incheon airport. The woman has been isolated at a state-run hospital in Incheon city, just west of Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia and three U.S. airports have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China. Bogoch said informing travellers to Canada is important so if anyone coming from China comes down with a respiratory illness knows where to go and what to do to seek care.  Chinese authorities published the genetic sequence of the virus. At Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, scientists have developed a test for the virus, Tam said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035,N/A
283,Anonymous,2020-01-10T19:30:49.997Z,Boeing documents show workers had 737 Max concerns they hid from FAA,"Boeing employees raised doubts among themselves about the safety of the 737 Max, hid problems from federal regulators and ridiculed those responsible for designing and overseeing the jetliner, according to a damning batch of emails and texts released nearly a year after the aircraft was grounded over two catastrophic crashes. The documents, made public Thursday by Boeing at the urging of Congress, are likely to fuel allegations the vaunted aircraft manufacturer put speed and cost savings ahead of safety in rolling out the Max. Boeing has been wracked by turmoil since the twin disasters and is still struggling to get the plane back in the air. Last month, it fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. In the 117 pages of internal messages, Boeing employees talked about misleading regulators about problems with the company's flight simulators. which are used to develop aircraft and then train pilots on the new equipment. In one exchange, an employee told a colleague he or she wouldn't let family members ride on a 737 Max. The colleague agreed. In a message chain from May 2018, an employee wrote: ""I still haven't been forgiven by God for covering up (what) I did last year."" It was not clear exactly what the coverup involved. The documents contain redactions and are full of Boeing jargon. The employees' names were removed. Employees also groused about Boeing's senior management, the company's selection of low-cost suppliers, wasting money, and the Max. ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys,"" one employee wrote. In response, Boeing said that it is confident the flight simulators work properly but that the conversations raise questions about the company's dealings with the Federal Aviation Administration in getting the machines certified. It said it is considering disciplinary action against some employees: ""These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable."" FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said that the simulator mentioned in the documents has been checked three times in the past six months, and ""any potential safety deficiencies identified in the documents have been addressed."" The Max has been grounded worldwide since March, after two crashes five months apart — one involving Indonesia's Lion Air, the other an Ethiopian Airlines flight — killed 346 people. Investigators believe the crashes were caused when the jetliners' brand-new automated flight-control software mistakenly pushed the planes' noses down. Boeing is still working to fix the flight-control software and other systems on the Max and persuade regulators to let it fly again. The work has taken much longer than Boeing expected, and it is unclear when the plane will return to the skies. A lawmaker leading one of the congressional investigations into Boeing called the messages ""incredibly damning."" ""They paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally,"" said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., chairman of the House Transportation Committee. DeFazio said the documents detail ""some of the earliest and most fundamental errors in the decisions that went into the fatally flawed aircraft."" In one email message, an employee who apparently is a test pilot wrote that he crashed the first few times he flew the Max in simulator testing. The email was written in May 2015, nearly two years before the FAA approved the Max for flight in March 2017. ""You get decent at it after 3-4 tries, but the first few are ugly,"" the employee wrote. In a 2015 message, a chief technical pilot said Boeing would push back hard against requirements that pilots undergo simulator training before flying the Max. One of the plane's biggest selling points, as Boeing saw it, was that 737 pilots could easily switch to the new jet with only a small amount of computer-based training, saving airlines money. Critics have said the FAA should have required simulator training so pilots knew how to handle malfunctions with the new flight-control software, known as MCAS. Initially Boeing didn't disclose to airlines and pilots that the software was on the planes. ""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG (existing 737s) to MAX. Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement,"" the chief technical pilot wrote in a March 2017 message. Another employee, in November 2014, made clear that the plane did things that pilots didn't expect, and it was hidden from the FAA. ""We don't want to indicate to the FAA that our design conflicts with pilot expectations (esp since the pilot responses are naive and our design has been vetted in a number of demos),"" one employee wrote. After the plane was flying, one airline asked Boeing for simulator training for its pilots. As Boeing tried to put that in place, it struggled to get the simulators to work. In a May 2018, an unidentified test pilot wrote that he would have to struggle to defend the simulators to the FAA the following week. The emails add to the growing body of evidence that Boeing misled the FAA and its airline customers. In October, Boeing turned over messages in which a former senior test pilot, Mark Forkner, told a co-worker in 2016 that the MCAS was ""egregious"" and ""running rampant"" when he tested it in a flight simulator. ""So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),"" wrote Forkner, then Boeing's chief technical pilot for the 737. The grounding of the Max will cost the company billions in compensation to the families of those killed in the crashes and to airlines that cancelled thousands of flights. Last month, Boeing decided to suspend production of the plane in mid-January, a decision that is rippling out through its vast network of suppliers. The CEO was ousted after alienating regulators, Boeing's airline customers and the crash victims' families with his handling of the disaster and his overly optimistic predictions for when the plane might fly again. Boeing's current chairman, David Calhoun, will try to right the company when he takes over as CEO on Monday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-1.5422623,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/regulators-revised-boeing-737-max-software-documentation-1.5351212 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-suspends-737-production-1.5398419 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-chief-executive-officer-737-max-1.5406828 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-documents-1.5408272,N/A
284,Anonymous,2020-01-18T21:03:10.123Z,"After breaking Grey Cup, Winnipeg Blue Bombers find redemption after player saves trophy from burning hotel","A fire that threatened an 11-storey Kenora, Ont., hotel Friday afternoon nearly took another victim as it spread across the bottom of the building: the Grey Cup. City of Kenora fire Chief Todd Skene said crews didn't realize until after the blaze at the Clarion Lakeside Inn was under control that the Canadian Football League championship trophy was on the premises. ""We don't find out about that stuff until a little bit later. We're busy dealing with the scene and everything else that's going on at the time,"" he said. Skene said that when the building was evacuated a Winnipeg Blue Bombers player carried the trophy out to his vehicle. ""The Grey Cup is safe,"" Skene said. Bombers spokesperson Darren Cameron confirmed that a few community relations staff members and Bombers fullback John Rush were in the hotel with the Grey Cup when the fire started and that everyone — and the trophy — got out safely. The incident comes a few months after the Bombers brought the cup home broken after winning the CFL championship in Calgary. Skene said the cup was touring the city, which is about 50 kilometres from the Manitoba border, to give Kenora fans a chance to see the trophy. The Bombers ended a decades-long championship drought in November. Skene said now that the fire has been put out, he hopes the cup will be brought back one more time for the fire crews. ""Maybe it'll come back, and maybe we can get some pictures here in Kenora with it,"" said Skene. ""That would be nice."" Skene said crews responded to the call of a fire around 3:15 p.m. CT Friday. When they arrived at the hotel, heavy smoke was already billowing out. Flames had spread across the underside of the building and started moving up its sides. A car in the parking lot also caught fire, he said. Skene said crews had eight trucks and 30 firefighters rolling in from all three of the city's fire stations. Winds of about 50 km/h on Friday helped fan the fire and made it spread quickly, creating a challenge for firefighters. ""I am very, very proud of our crew,"" Skene said. ""They got there quickly, and were in action quickly. I know they're quite proud of the job they did on their end, and being able to limit the damage based on what we were facing at the beginning."" He said the 30 or so people staying at the hotel were moved to a nearby community centre to stay warm and are now staying in other hotels. The fire was declared under control around 6:30 p.m., and crews stayed on scene until about 9 p.m. ""Everybody got out. That's the main thing, right?"" said Skene. ""Human life is the major thing, and despite the temperatures and the blowing snow and the high winds … everybody is safe."" Skene said no cause or damage estimate of the fire have been determined. He said it will be a few days before power is restored to the hotel, which had its natural gas shut off and was flooded by a sprinkler.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grey-cup-rescued-kenora-hotel-fire-1.5432185,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/smoke-clarion-lake-inn-kenora-1.5431945 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/blue-bombers-grey-cup-winnipeg-airport-1.5372696 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/blue-bomber-bighill-apology-wendy-williams-1.5425714,N/A

Public Library Service. It's part of a goal to make ""libraries and collections as accessible and inclusive as possible,"" he said. ""This is something we thought would be a great addition to our collection."" Island libraries already offer an array of accessible options such as audio books and large-print books for people with vision problems. MacLeod said adding these books for people with dementia made sense because, for some, ""books are their lifeline. ""Our goal across the board is just that seniors be able to enjoy life and live with dignity and enjoy the things they like to do as long as possible,"" MacLeod said. He said the initiative allows people with dementia to enjoy books that are actually written for adults instead of children, and there are a lot of people happy to see the books in the library. ""It's something a lot of people had not realized was a thing, and I was definitely one of those people for sure. There are so many positive health and wellness benefits to reading,"" MacLeod said. The books are available at all 26 P.E.I. libraries and some community care facilities, MacLeod said. The Alzheimer Society of P.E.I. was not involved in this project, but the CEO of the organization said the benefit of these books is immeasurable for those living with Alzheimer's.

286,John Paul Tasker,2017-05-16T19:55:27.465Z,'It's been an amazing experience': Rona Ambrose set to leave federal politics,"Interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose is leaving federal politics and will step down from her seat when the House of Commons breaks for summer recess. The Washington-based Wilson Center announced Tuesday morning that Ambrose will join its Canada Institute as a visiting Global Fellow on Canada-U.S. trade issues. A release from the non-partisan institute said Ambrose will work out of its D.C. office. The Edmonton MP confirmed her departure from politics during a breakfast speech Tuesday in Ottawa, where she focused on the state of the Conservative Party she will hand over to a new leader at its convention on May 27.  ""I feel a little lighter this morning,"" she said. ""It's been an amazing experience."" Ambrose informed the party of her decision on Friday. The news was first reported Monday by iPolitics. She will resign her seat in the House of Commons after the spring sitting of Parliament ends in June. In her morning speech, Ambrose said she was ""incredibly optimistic"" about her party's future, highlighting how the leadership race set a new record for membership sales over the last year as people joined to vote. ""We have clearly shown that Justin Trudeau can be beaten in 2019,"" she said. In highlighting her party's recent accomplishments, Ambrose paid particular attention to the role of strong women in her caucus. She also paid tribute to her spouse, J.P. Veitch, for supporting her role and hosting many official events at Stornoway, the official residence of the leader of the Opposition. ""We had a lot of fun,"" she said. Ambrose was first elected to the House of Commons during the 2004 election, easily besting her Liberal opponent in the Edmonton-area riding. ""It was daunting, it was intimidating, but it was also exhilarating,"" Ambrose said after her first round in question period as a rookie MP. ""I asked our question period co-ordinator, [former Conservative MP] Jason Kenney, 'Well, what happens, this is my first day of question period practice, what happens if you ask the question, and they answer it, and they give you what you want?' And I think everyone just sort of laughed at me and said to me that doesn't usually happen."" Ambrose was immediately appointed to cabinet after former prime minister Stephen Harper secured a minority government in the 2006 campaign. She would go on to hold eight different cabinet posts in the Harper government, including as minister of Environment, Health and Public Works, before the Conservatives were defeated in October 2015. She then set her sights on becoming the party's interim leader and beat out a number other contenders for the leadership following a preferential ballot vote. In a post on Facebook, Harper expressed his ""deep gratitude"" to Ambrose. ""As prime minister, I had the privilege of appointing Rona to some of the most complex and challenging cabinet portfolios in government,"" Harper wrote. ""Yet despite a heavy workload, Rona always retained her warm and charming manner and down to earth Alberta humour."" ""Rona has been a passionate and articulate advocate for the rights of women and girls. As minister for the Status of Women, Rona sponsored a resolution at the United Nations recognizing Oct. 11 as International Day of the Girl,"" Harper said. ""This effort to enhance awareness of gender equality, equal access to education, health care, and protection from violence for all girls around the globe stands as a lasting testament to Rona's efforts."" Ambrose set a different tone for the party shortly after taking over from Harper, including pledging full support for an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. ""I ran into the new Justice Minister [Jody Wilson-Raybould] and I told her about my passion for ending violence against women. I told her, anything I can do to help her on the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women, I will be there. This is an absolutely nonpartisan issue, it should never be political,"" Ambrose told CBC News in an interview shortly after taking over her new post. Ambrose also backed the removal of the long-standing same-sex marriage ban from official Tory policy ahead of the party's convention in Vancouver last year. ""The Conservative Party welcomes all conservatives, regardless of sexual orientation. If you believe in smaller government, lower taxes, balanced budgets and individual freedom, we want you in our party,"" Ambrose said at the time. Conservative delegates voted to strike the definition of marriage in the party's official policy document in May. ""There's no doubt she was the right person, at the right time, for this party,"" Ontario Conservative MP Larry Miller said. ""I am surprised to hear [she's leaving] … We were totally caught off guard. But I think Rona and J.P. want their lives back."" ""We've been so fortunate,"" added Ontario Conservative MP Bev Shipley, referring to Ambrose's interim leadership. ""She's brought a human element to it, she's brought humour to it, she's brought the real Conservative party to the forefront."" Before entering politics, Ambrose was a women's advocate, working with organizations to end violence against women, including the Status of Women Action Group, the Victoria Sexual Assault and Sexual Abuse Crisis Centre, and the Edmonton Women's Shelter. To that end, Ambrose introduced a private member's bill this winter that would require anyone who wanted to be considered for a judicial appointment to undergo comprehensive training in sexual assault law. Bill C-337 would also require the Canadian Judicial Council to report on continuing education courses in matters related to sexual assault law and change the Criminal Code to make courts provide written decisions in sexual assault cases. The opposition NDP and, ultimately, the Liberal government threw their support behind Ambrose's legislation, which passed a vote at third reading Monday and now heads to the Senate. Ambrose set out to rebuild the party after its 2015 defeat, spending time in Atlantic Canada, where the party was decimated by the Liberals. She also sought to rebuild the party's fundraising war chest. According to financial returns filed with Elections Canada for the first quarter of 2017, the Conservative Party pulled in $5.3 million from almost 42,500 donors, compared with just $2.8 million from 31,812 donors who gave to the Liberals. ""I think Rona's got a great legacy with the party. She's maintained our party in the polls. I've really grown to like her, and I think a lot of people around the country admire the job that she did,"" Ontario Conservative MP Ben Lobb said. ""She's done an incredible job of being neutral in our leadership contest,"" Manitoba Conservative MP Ted Falk added, speaking of the race to replace Harper as permanent leader. ""She's a real team leader.""   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rona-ambrose-conservative-mp-1.4116233,[],N/A
287,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-21T22:47:56.106Z,'I won't be swayed': P.E.I. to ban flavoured vape juice,"Consultations are underway for regulating vaping product sales on P.E.I., but Health Minister James Aylward says he has made up his mind on one thing. Flavoured vape juice will be banned in the province. ""We did it with flavoured tobacco, we're going to do it with flavoured vaping as well,"" Aylward told CBC's Island Morning. ""I won't be swayed."" The health minister has made the decision in the face of opposition from Imperial Tobacco and the Atlantic Convenience Stores Association. In a news release, Imperial Tobacco urged governments in Canada to be certain vaping regulations were based on science. ""This is an extremely complex issue for which governments need to talk to scientists and doctors who understand the issue and not get swayed by the dramatized headlines,"" said Eric Gagnon, head of corporate and regulatory affairs at Imperial Tobacco Canada. ""If politicians and regulators allow themselves to be influenced by fear instead of facts, the biggest losers will be the millions of adult smokers across Canada who want an alternative to smoking."" In a release, the Vaping Industry Trade Association said it's calling upon ""all levels of government to formally acknowledge the thousands of Canadian vapers who quit smoking by vaping."" The organization said it wants government to carefully consider how proposed policies negatively affect adults who rely on vaping products to remain smoke-free. Shamus Kelly, owner of Eastern Vapes in Charlottetown, said banning flavoured vaping products won't get them out of the hands of Island youth. ""They're pushing everybody to the black market. They are going to get their hands on it, no matter what,"" Kelly said. ""But now it's not going to be professionally-tested, lab-tested stuff. It's going to be black market products that, who know what's in them, right? And they're going to get them that way.""  Kelly said up to 80 per cent of his business is selling flavoured vapes so he expects the decision to affect his bottom line.  Julia Hartley, with the P.E.I. Lung Association, said there's evidence to show that youth between the ages of 18 and 24 are particularly drawn to flavoured vaping products.  ""We have data showing that almost 100 per cent of youth prefer flavoured products and also data showing that half of these kids would quit vaping if, you know, the flavours were taken away. That's all the evidence we need,"" she said.  Aylward said he was alarmed by news from P.E.I.'s Public Schools Branch that vaping is starting as early as Grade 4. He believes banning flavoured vapes will discourage young people. ""Trying to protect our population, particularly our youth, that's the number one thing that I think about every day,"" he said. Consultations on regulations will go on about another week, said Aylward, and he expects to have draft regulations by early March, and those could be in force as soon as the end of that month. Aylward said there is still a role for the federal government in regulation when it comes to online sales and limiting the amount of nicotine in products. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-flavoured-vaping-banned-1.5434281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-flavours-canadian-vaping-association-1.5367882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-bill-deagle-1.5365964 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-partners-medical-society-doctor-recruitment-2020-1.5433244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,N/A

The detail is noted by Justice Frank Edwards in followup comments to his ruling last week that Richard Maidment is entitled to his wife's life insurance, which totals $200,000 plus interest. Maidment, 42, who also uses the surname McNeil, killed Sarabeth Forbes on April 18, 2017, in the home they shared in Gardiner Mines, N.S. He was found not criminally responsible in December 2017. Two years earlier, Forbes named Maidment as beneficiary to her life insurance and her son as a contingent. In granting the money to Maidment — and not to the couple's 12-year-old son, who is now being raised by his grandmother — Edwards noted Maidment doesn't benefit from a crime because he didn't commit a crime and is not a criminal. Last week, a law professor noted there is precedent for provincial governments to intervene in such cases, under the province's Civil Forfeiture Act. In additional written comments released Monday, Edwards noted the court notified the province's attorney general of the claim for the life insurance, made by Maidment's mother on his behalf. Edwards said in a letter dated Aug. 6, 2019, a solicitor of the civil forfeiture unit of the Justice Department wrote that ""the province of Nova Scotia will not be participating in this matter."" After the unit was advised that Forbes's mother, Emeline Forbes, had filed an counter application for the insurance money on behalf of the couple's son, a lawyer for the department advised the court that it ""does not have an interest in the proceedings."" Edward noted that because the province did not intervene in the case, ""My decision did not deal with provisions of the Civil Forfeiture Act."" The Justice Department declined an interview request. But in a statement, spokesperson Barbara MacLean noted the Civil Forfeiture Act only allows for forfeiture of property — including money — to the province, and not to third parties.  ""To clarify, this means when applying the act under any circumstances, forfeited money would go into the general revenue of the province, and would not be able to be given to a third party."" MacLean declined to comment further, as it is a ""private legal matter.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/richard-maidment-life-insurance-nova-scotia-justice-department-1.5434765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mayann-francis-racial-profiling-santina-rao-arrest-1.5434509 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/maritimes-natural-gas-pipeline-commits-200m-in-case-of-mishap-1.5434396 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cliff-jumper-logan-latulippe-glace-bay-1.5433339 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841,N/A
289,Janet Davison,2020-01-14T18:29:34.081Z,Why a 'curious interest' and questions of money loom over Harry and Meghan coming to Canada,"Prince Harry and Meghan clearly want to come to Canada — and senior members of the Royal Family gave their wish their blessing at their Sandringham summit on Monday. But how Canadians feel about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spending part of their time here as they step back from their senior roles in the Royal Family is more nuanced. ""I'd say there's a curious interest to some degree as to how this will unfold, that certainly Harry and Meghan's enthusiasm about Canada is well-received,"" said Carolyn Harris, a longtime royal observer and Toronto-based author and historian. ""There are many who have commented that Harry and Meghan — as Harry is unlikely to succeed to the throne — should be able to live life on their own terms, provided they will be indeed be financially independent."" While some Canadians may welcome Harry and Meghan, others may feel great indifference. ""People who support the Crown, most of them will think this is nice,"" said John Fraser, author of The Secret of the Crown: Canada's Affair with Royalty, and founding president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada. ""The idea of members of the Royal Family actually having some domicile in a Commonwealth country, to me, is wonderful. It suggests the possibility — especially if the Queen goes along with the idea — that Harry and Meghan can be special Commonwealth ambassadors or supporters."" Others who are often less interested in the Crown, he suggests, will ""think they are leeches on the body politic."" But whatever interest there is among Canadians could be tempered by one very tricky topic: money. ""I think any support for Harry and Meghan would be negatively affected if the couple were seen as making use of public funds in Canada for their security while they live a private life,"" Harris said.Chenoa Paccagnan, of Invermere, B.C., echoed a similar sentiment. ""I love my royals, but I am not interested in paying for long-term security or maintenance if they choose to spend increased time in Canada,"" Paccagnan wrote in an email to CBC's Royal Fascinator newsletter over the weekend. Others looked at the financial aspects differently. Bill Kostiuk, of Alliston, Ont., said it would be ""an honour and a privilege"" to have Harry and Meghan living in Canada. ""They do so much for charitable organizations and they seem to inspire the younger generation in a very positive way,"" he said in an email to the Fascinator. ""Thousands of immigrants come into Canada and no one questions who's going to pay for what and what they will do for income. I wish people could get off the gossip train and let this couple and their young child try to have a life together without all the finger-pointing."" WATCH: Expert Robert Lacey says Harry and Meghan might follow the Obamas' example managing their finances: Harry and Meghan's seismic announcement last week that they wanted to step back included mention that they want to become financially independent. And in a statement Monday, Queen Elizabeth said Harry and Meghan ""have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives."" But what exactly that means remains unclear. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Monday the federal government hasn't decided if Ottawa would help cover security costs associated with a move to Canada by the sixth in line to the throne and his wife. Watch: Harry and Meghan should expect a 'stampede' of offers There's little doubt security for such a high-profile couple will carry a hefty price tag. ""The question of security is a serious issue,"" said Fraser. ""Whether they are here or anywhere, they are major public figures who need protection,"" he said. ""At the moment, unless something is being worked out with the Canadian government, they don't have any official status here other than the respect there is — and also the lack of respect — for members of the Royal Family."" A statement from Her Majesty The Queen. <a href=""https://t.co/IVSyfeojqk"">https://t.co/IVSyfeojqk</a> Fraser said the cost for security would probably have to be covered privately. ""I don't think it should be a Canadian government cost,"" he said. Christine Richardson, of Uxbridge, Ont., said in an email to The Royal Fascinator that she can understand why Harry and Meghan may want to step back, but feels ""very strongly they can't have their cake and eat it, too."" ""Independence means what it says, and from a financial perspective, it should not cost Canadians anything (i.e. for security) if they live here part-time. Also, they should have to pay income tax relating to money made in Canada, just like the rest of us."" Taxation poses significant unknowns around Harry and Meghan's plans, and would depend on numerous issues. ""If Harry spends enough time in Canada to become classed a Canadian resident, then he would start to become liable to Canadian taxes,"" Craig Prescott, director of the Centre for Parliament and Public Law at the University of Winchester in southern England, said via email. ""With Meghan, she is still a U.S. citizen and so is liable to U.S. taxation on her worldwide income (as U.S. taxation operates on citizenship rather than residency — only Eritrea and Myanmar do the same). There are reliefs and exemptions to this, but they appear to be relatively limited."" Under U.K. tax rules, Prescott said, if overseas tax is paid on overseas income, then you can claim relief to avoid being taxed twice. WATCH | U.K. PM Boris Johnson says he's a 'massive fan' of the Royal Family: ""How this operates will depend on any double tax treaty between the U.K. and that country. The U.K. has a double tax treaty with the U.S. and Canada,"" he said. While much remains unknown about how Harry and Meghan's part-time residency will unfold, Fraser said a lot of that will be answered ""just by them taking up residence here of some sort, whatever it is."" The only people he can see being really upset by the move are the British tabloids that ""love either praising them or damning them."" WATCH | Canada undecided on covering Harry and Meghan's security costs: Fraser expects there will be some ""fervent following"" of Harry and Meghan for a little while. ""But I think they have a fair chance of having a more normal life over here, whatever a normal life is, a private life, than they do in the U.K.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-romance-prince-harry-meghan-markle-photos-pictures-1.5117068 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-rift-meeting-harry-william-statement-1.5424586,N/A
290,Catharine Tunney,2019-04-10T21:49:50.390Z,"CSIS dealing with right-wing extremism 'more and more,' says spy chief","The head of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service says his agency is ""more and more preoccupied"" with the threat of violent right-wing extremism and white supremacists. CSIS Director David Vigneault told a Senate committee earlier today that his agency is very troubled by ""the number of ultra right-wing extremists"" active in Canada, citing the 2017 firearm attack on a Quebec City mosque and a 2018 vehicle-ramming attack in Toronto. ""We are seeing people using the methods of the terrorists to cause harm, and here I refer to the attack in Toronto by someone invoking the philosophy of the involuntary celibates,"" said Vigneault in a rare public appearance. ""What was striking is that the philosophy was one thing — the person wanted to cause harm and fear in the population — but he used a technique that had been perfected by terrorists."" Police allege 26-year-old Alek Minassian, of Richmond Hill, Ont., drove a van down a stretch of Yonge Street in Toronto on April 23, 2018, killing ten. He faces 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. After the attack, a Facebook post attributed to Minassian started circulating online; it indicated he may have identified as an 'incel', or 'involuntarily celibate' man. The term 'incel' has been associated with some particularly misogynistic online hate speech. Alexandre Bissonnette, 29, was sentenced to life in prison for killing six people in a gun attack on a Quebec City mosque in 2017. He won't be eligible for parole for 40 years. Vigneault was answering a question from Conservative Senator Victor Oh regarding the greatest threats to Canada's national security. Vigneault said the main threat concern for intelligence and law enforcement in Canada continues to be violent extremism, often tied to religious beliefs. ""Traditionally, in the last number of years we've seen that form of extremism leading to violence being people invoking religion, Islam,"" he said. The CSIS chief said another concern growing in importance for his agency is the very credible prospect of foreign interference in the upcoming federal election. ""All of these threats are underpinned by ... very significant progress on the technology side. People who have ill intent are using advances in technology, communications, encryption to hide their activities,"" he said. Vigneault went before the Senate's national security and defence committee today to take questions regarding Bill C-59, the government's national security omnibus bill. The issue of white supremacy as a security threat came up at another Senate committee hearing a day earlier. While questioning Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, Conservative Sen. Leo Housakos went after her claim that white supremacy is one of the biggest risks facing Western democracies. ""You have said that white supremacy is one of the agents that you think are of the biggest risk to our Western democracies, and with all due respect minister, I think that flies in the face of reality over the last two decades,"" he said. Freeland said she ""absolutely"" believes white supremacist activity poses a danger to Canadians. ""I think they are a grave and real threat here in Canada and they are a grave threat in many other countries around the world,"" she said. ""I absolutely believe we need to name that threat. We need to be aware of it and we need to work hard to find ways to protect our societies and our people from it. ""And I would add, senator, that of course Islamic extremist terrorism is and has been a great threat. And Canada and Canadian men and women in uniform have gone out and fought that threat, when there have been terrorist attacks motivated by Islamic extremism."" The next day, Housakos pushed back on Twitter. ""My point remains, contrary to the attempted smears by you and your colleagues, on [Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer] no Western, democratic politician condones extremism of any kind, including white supremacy. Extremism in all forms is a threat to our way of life, not just one or the other,"" he tweeted. ""This is just another attempt by you and your government to further divide Canadians and pitting us against each other, all for your own political gain. And that's disgusting."" When asked about Housakos's remarks, Scheer said he has spoken to the senator and he clarified his remarks.  ""I 100 per cent denounce anyone who promotes racist ideology and promotes white nationalism or any type of extremism. I do believe it's a threat in Canada,"" he told reporters. ""It is pathetic and disgusting that Liberals are inflaming these threats to divide Canadians and score cheap points.""

Grace Kucey, spokeswoman for Interior Health, said that over the course of two days, paramedics brought 43 people to Penticton Regional Hospital from the festival grounds. ""The majority of presentations to the hospital have been drug and alcohol related,"" she told CBC News on Sunday. Paramedics brought 26 people from the festival site to the emergency room in the 24 hours from 7 a.m. Saturday to 7 a.m. Sunday, Kucey said.  That number tops the 17 transfers counted in the previous 24-hour period — a number that includes two people who RCMP said were in critical condition, and a 24-year-old woman from Alberta who died from a suspected overdose. Penticton RCMP became extremely concerned Saturday after learning of the dozen or more people who had already been treated in hospital for drug interactions, and issued a public plea for festivalgoers to use caution. ""Police are asking all Boonstock attendees to refrain from ingesting unknown substances and to ensure that they remain hydrated in the hot, dry, dusty conditions of the event grounds,"" Const. Kris Clark said. Police also warned on Twitter that dehydration greatly increases the risks of drug and alcohol overdoses. Interior Health​ said that despite the sudden surge of new patients in Penticton, hospital staff members are coping. ""The hospital is managing patient load very well,"" Kucey said. ""The access to the medical mobile unit, which is on site, will be used if needed, but currently the hospital is managing well."" The festival, which is in its final day and comes to an end in the early hours of Monday morning, was predicted to draw 8,000 people to the festival grounds, near the north shore of Skaha Lake.

292,Anonymous,2020-01-21T22:00:00.898Z,"Uncleared parking spots, snowbanks affecting some Charlottetown businesses","While the doors are open at Liquid Gold in downtown Charlottetown, the olive oil shop's manager says it can be difficult to get customers through the door on snowy days. Catherine Greer said she's become used to hearing complaints from customers who say they're frustrated by limited parking options because of snowbanks and piles of snow in spots that are otherwise vacant.  ""Customers have to climb over snowbanks when they park because they can't, like it's not cleared out. And they're starting to complain,"" Greer said. Two days after the weekend's snowfall, Greer said she's glad to see the spots in front of her store on Queen Street cleared.  On days when the parking spots are snow-covered, she said she sees about half as many customers coming through the door. Around the corner on Water Street, parking is also very limited. It's something Jennifer Ridgway, owner of Moonsnail Soapworks and Nature Store, is also used to.  ""It's reduced to probably about a half or a third of what it normally is. They've cleared one spot across the street for handicapped parking, but everything else is choked with snow,"" she said. ""They do tend to leave certain streets for last. And I guess Water Street, in my experience down here for almost 20 years, it's been one of the last that they clean out, for sure —  the parking spaces, anyway."" After a storm, Ridgway said she sometimes doesn't bother opening her doors in the morning hours to give the city a chance to clear the snow.  The city said it does its best to remove snow as quickly as possible. There are about 250 kilometres of city streets that need to be plowed. And that, along with plowing sidewalks, takes priority before moving on to snow hauling, said Scott Adams, manager of the city's public works. From time to time, he said, the department does hear from local business owners.  ""We do appreciate their understanding,"" he said. ""They do understand the complexity of it, and we do try our best to get the parking spaces cleaned up."" He said the city currently has six plows, five loaders and 13 sidewalk machines.  ""When we do snow removal, so that's all the removing all the snowbanks from around the meters and all that, we need trucks. We don't have the trucks in our fleet,"" Adams said. ""We have to hire contractor trucks. And if we can't get it done early, if we can't predict when the snow's going to be done, it's hard to schedule those trucks to come in.""  While she still has customers coming in, Ridgway said a harsh winter certainly has an effect on her bottom line. ""We're going to get the people who are making an effort to see us, but it has to be people who are mobile and can, you know, walk and maybe climb over a snowbank, you know, to make it in,"" she said.  The city said most metered parking spaces are now cleared downtown, and the crews are now moving outward to secondary streets.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cold-island-winter-keeping-people-from-shopping-spending-money-1.5050687 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775,N/A
293,Verity Stevenson,2020-01-07T17:10:13.232Z,Health professionals calling for long-term solutions with ERs running at double capacity across Quebec,"For most of the holidays, the emergency room in the Laurentians hospital where Dr. Simon-Pierre Landry works has been operating at nearly twice its capacity.  Last Sunday, Landry came in on one of his few days off, and most of the rest of the staff at Hôpital Laurentien in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts have been working overtime, too. ""We know that every year after Christmas, the emergency room will be super busy,"" Landry said. ""We don't have a real plan in place."" The problem is not just in the Laurentians. Emergency rooms are running beyond capacity across Quebec, and health care professionals and patient advocates say the government needs to come up with long-term solutions.  ""It's almost all year long that we're in a state of overwork now,"" Landry said. Last weekend, nurses fed up with being exhausted held spontaneous sit-ins at two hospitals in Montreal's east end. They had been ordered to work double shifts — something their union says has become an all-too-frequent occurrence, especially during holiday periods. ""They often fall back on means that simply push the problem to later,"" said Denis Cloutier, the president of the union representing nurses in eastern Montreal.  Emergency room nurses are exhausted ""because their employer makes them do consecutive 16-hour shifts on a regular basis,"" said Cloutier. The long hours and chronic staff shortages create a vicious cycle, putting more pressure on whoever is left in the ER, Cloutier said. As a result, those nurses often end up on sick leave, or they transfer to less-demanding departments — or they leave the health care industry altogether, he said. ""It's becoming chronic and worrisome,"" Cloutier said. ""We need to find a way to respond to the reality of emergency [rooms]."" Two sit-ins took place at Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont on separate shifts Sunday, while a third was at Santa Cabrini Hospital. When asked whether the nurses who participated would face consequences, Hugo Vitullo, the deputy director of professional services for the regional health agency overseeing Montreal's east end, the CIUSSS de l'Est-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, said ""we're looking into that with our HR staff."" Hospital officials later determined that no disciplinary will actions taken against those nurses. Vitullo said the CIUSSS did everything it could to plan for the holiday rush.  ""We have to have double the people to work, and that's a very difficult situation,"" he said. He said the agency has had to make up for staff calling in sick, as well.  Nurses that worked the shifts before the sit-ins were asked to work a double shift, and some ambulances were redirected to other hospitals in the city.  Nurses at Maisonneuve-Rosemont staged a sit-in over the long hours they were being made to work just last October, and there have been similar protests across Quebec. The provincial labour federation representing most Quebec nurses, the Fédération interprofessionnelle de la santé du Québec (FIQ), has said workers' health and mandatory overtime will be major issues in the coming round of negotiations. The nurses' current contract expires at the end of March. Vitullo said hospitals' emergency rooms are also crowded by cold and flu patients who should be going elsewhere.  ""I guess it's a reflex from the population, but some people should change that reflex,"" he said.  Landry, the ER physician in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, said it's unrealistic to expect people to change their ways.  ""Patients are worried and anxious,"" he said. ""They will show up to the emergency room whether we like it or not. This is why we need to have better co-ordination."" Landry, who also runs a clinic in nearby Mont-Tremblant, said the government needs to give hospitals power to create partnerships with local clinics, so patients who don't need immediate treatment can be directed to those clinics. He says the government's current solution — a winter clinic program — has not served its intended purpose of relieving pressure on emergency rooms because it is poorly designed. The program allows certain clinics to stay open longer in the winter for patients afflicted with infections like the cold or flu, who often clog ERs at this time of year.  But another government program provides subsidies to clinics to registered patients, Landry said, and clinics that take on other patients as part of the winter clinic program could end up losing some of that subsidy. ""Not a lot of clinics and not a lot of physicians have signed into that program,"" he said.  For now, Landry said, the crush of patients waiting for care at the hospital emergency room in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts-des-Monts is letting up, and staff are beginning to breath sighs of relief.

294,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:31:40.422Z,N.S. advocate of medically assisted death calls for amendments to federal law,"The head of a Nova Scotia charity that advocates for access to medically assisted death is calling for nationwide amendments to the Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) law. Sheilia Sperry, the head of the Nova Scotia chapter of Dying with Dignity, said late-stage consent and the criterion that a death be reasonably foreseeable must be removed from the law. ""How do you tell what's reasonably foreseeable? As someone said yesterday to me, once we're born, our death is reasonably foreseeable,"" Sperry told CBC's Information Morning in an interview Wednesday. In June 2016, Bill C-14 made it legal for terminally ill patients to access medically assisted death. Since then, more than 6,700 Canadians have used MAID to control when and how they died. But last September, the Superior Court of Quebec found it unconstitutional to limit MAID to only people who are already dying or have a ""reasonable foreseeability of natural death,"" according to the federal Criminal Code. The ruling will come into effect in Quebec on March 11, but Sperry said if the federal government doesn't adjust Bill C-14, then the rest of Canada will be ""out of step."" Since the court ruling, Justice Minister David Lametti has said the government is updating legislation across the country. On Jan. 13, the Department of Justice launched a two-week online survey asking Canadians to weigh in on how far to extend access to medically assisted dying. Sperry said the survey is a step in the right direction. She hopes the removal of the late-stage consent rule will be an outcome, which she's calling ""Audrey's Amendment."" Audrey Parker of Halifax chose to die on Nov. 1, 2018, after suffering from terminal cancer. She was approved for MAID and made a video that was released posthumously, which called for the removal of the late-stage consent requirement. In the video, Parker said she wanted to make it to Christmas, but was worried she'd become incompetent and would no longer be able to consent. Sperry said Audrey's Amendment would allow people to live until their chosen death date, even if they lose mental capacity or aren't conscious to consent. She said once a person is approved for MAID, that should be enough. ""It's highly, highly unlikely, after all the discussion, all the review, that anybody would change their mind,"" Sperry said. ""And certainly if somebody did, the doctor is not going to go through with the procedure."" Sperry is hoping the changes are addressed after the survey is completed and by the time the law in Quebec is established on March 11.

Staffing ratios at the Restigouche Hospital Centre reached a level that Vitalité describes as a ""danger"" one-third of the time in October, the most recent month for which statistics have been made available. When staffing hits a ""danger"" level, the hospital isn't completing the majority of nursing care, and patients who have severe mental health issues don't receive any therapy. That means those patients won't make any gains in terms of their treatment plans, according to a document produced by Vitalité. ""At that point, the staff is really not engaged in any way in helping the patients,"" ombud Charles Murray said on Wednesday. ""They're really engaged in kind of a survival mode of making sure that people get enough food to eat and that incidents don't break out."" The hospital achieved a staffing level described as ""normal"" three per cent of the time in October, figures show. It reached a ""minimal"" level of staffing, where patients also don't receive any therapy, 36 per cent of the time. In September, staffing was at the ""danger"" level 36 per cent of the time. ""Despite all the current efforts, for the majority of team days, the [Restigouche Hospital Centre] is not able to ensure the optimal quality of clinical services given, and for nearly a third of these team days, the safety of clients is an important issue,"" the document says in French. Team days is a metric used by Vitalité to determine whether it's meeting staffing requirements, according to Murray. It accounts for a number of different shifts worked by care professionals in different units across the hospital. Vitalité's CEO says the health authority did another staffing analysis that shows the hospital has enough staff to ensure patient safety. That analysis hasn't been made public. He admitted it's concerning that patients frequently aren't receiving therapy. ""We're not where we want to be, that's for sure,"" Lanteigne said. ""We know that we have a plan, we're seeing some results here."" Lanteigne cited the hospital's decision to close 40 of its 140 beds, shutting down a unit most recently in November, as proof that patients are safe. ""There's significantly less people at the hospital than there were in August,"" he said. He also said staff are using physical force less often on patients who trigger ""Code White"" responses. The code is called when patients are harming themselves or others. In a scathing report released last week, Murray highlighted understaffing as being at the root of chronic problems that resulted in patients at Restigouche being ""mistreated"" and given ""inadequate care."" In at least one case, the ombud believes the gaps at the hospital ""may have resulted in the premature death of a patient"" in 2018. He recommended the hospital shrink its mandate and called for an external review of what's going on at Restigouche. The provincial government hired George Weber, a mental health care consultant, to review the facility and Murray's report. Murray disagrees that Restigouche is safe. He said staff have been working in an environment where they don't feel safe. ""When we speak to them, that's why they seem so stressed and overworked and emotional,"" he said.  While closing units has likely helped somewhat, Murray is skeptical that staffing ratios have improved significantly since October. ""To now say that everything is under control and it's all fine speaks to one of two things, in my opinion,"" Murray said. ""Either a very dramatic turnaround, without the addition of additional psychiatric help. Or the fact that the internal information flows inside the network just aren't reliable.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/restigouche-staffing-ratios-1.5018422,[],N/A
297,Éric Grenier,2020-01-16T09:00:00.232Z,Conservative leadership fee makes this the most expensive race ever — but is it worth the price?,"The race to lead the Conservative Party is now the most expensive piece of political real estate this country has ever seen — with an entrance fee higher than any other in the history of Canadian party leadership contests. But is the job being overvalued? The Conservatives have set the entrance fee for the race to replace Andrew Scheer at $200,000, along with a refundable compliance deposit of $100,000. That non-refundable portion is substantially higher than the $50,000 required in the last leadership race in 2017. It's also much higher than the fees for every other leadership race held by other parties at both the federal and provincial levels. The only other leadership race to feature a six-figure entrance fee was the Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership contest won by Doug Ford in 2018. That fee was $100,000 — and it was quite a prize. The PCs were considered a shoo-in to win the provincial election scheduled for only a few months later, which did end in defeat for Kathleen Wynne's unpopular Liberal government. The 2009 federal Liberal leadership race — which ended up with Michael Ignatieff as leader — set the entry fee at $90,000. A slew of other races have had entrance fees of $75,000, including the ongoing contest to choose the next leader of the Ontario Liberal Party. The 2003 and 2013 federal Liberal leadership races also set the entry fee at $75,000, as did the 2015 Ontario PC leadership race and the contest that chose Jason Kenney as the leader of the United Conservative Party in 2017. Kenney was elected premier of Alberta in 2019. Choosing to drop that kind of money on a run for the leadership of the Liberal Party when it was mired in opposition was a leap of faith. It paid off for Justin Trudeau, though; two years after winning the leadership, he led the Liberals from third party status to a majority government in 2015. But the 2003 contest was to replace Jean Chrétien, the sitting prime minister. In 1993, it cost just $10,000 (refundable) to get into the PC leadership race. The winner of that one got to move into Brian Mulroney's office. There is no similar guarantee that the next leader of the Conservative Party will be the next prime minister. In fact, the history suggests the odds might be against whoever replaces Andrew Scheer. The French saying ""jamais deux sans trois"" seems to apply to Canadian federal politics: parties or prime ministers with two consecutive election victories on the scoreboard have, more often than not, won a third as well. Of twelve attempts by parties or prime ministers to win a third consecutive election, eight have been successful. That includes cases like Pierre Trudeau's string of three election wins between 1968 and 1974, which came after two wins by the Liberals under his predecessor Lester Pearson. Those who tried and failed include Kim Campbell, who attempted to win a third consecutive PC victory in 1993 after Mulroney's departure. The record is even better for party leaders who both brought their party to power and sought a third consecutive win. It's been tried seven times and ended in failure just once. Those are good historical odds for Justin Trudeau, less so for his future opponent. None of this takes into account the context of individual elections, of course. But even that can be misleading. Pierre Trudeau looked hobbled and vulnerable after being reduced to a minority government in 1972 — but his party won a majority government again two years later. By 1976, after 13 years of Liberal government under two prime ministers, the PCs might have thought their next leader would have a decent shot of winning — and he did, as Joe Clark showed (briefly) in 1979. But the cost of entry for the 1976 PC leadership race that chose Clark was just $500 — a ""good-faith deposit"" that would be returned to the candidate after it was over. Post-election polls suggest that the Conservatives still have some work to do to defeat the Liberals. The latest survey from Léger put the Conservatives three points back of the Liberals in national voting intentions (the polling firm had the two parties tied going into election day). The poll suggests that a change of leader might have a minimal impact on the party's fortunes. Léger asked Canadians who they would vote for with a few different hypothetical leaders at the helm of the Conservative Party. Rona Ambrose and Peter MacKay (who confirmed Wednesday that he's running) both turned that three-point deficit into a one-point advantage — no better than Scheer's losing performance in October. Jean Charest had no impact at the national level, keeping the Conservatives three points back of the Liberals (though he did boost the party's support in Quebec). It all points to a longer-term problem for the Conservatives, who haven't won an election since 2011. The party captured 32 per cent of the vote in the 2015 election and 34 per cent in 2019. With the exception of a few short-lived ups and downs in the polls, the party has been stuck somewhere around 33 per cent support for nearly eight years. The Conservatives have a big caucus in the House of Commons and a formidable fundraising machine. They have a dedicated and deep-pocketed base. That makes the leadership a prize worth winning. But whoever wins the Conservative leadership on June 27 takes over a party in a nearly decade-old rut — a high-priced fixer-upper that might need more than a new coat of paint.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mackay-tweets-leadership-1.5427544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A
298,Michael Gorman,2020-01-21T19:41:58.663Z,Premier reaffirms no new effluent will enter Boat Harbour after January,"Pictou Landing First Nation Chief Andrea Paul is expressing concern that although Boat Harbour will stop receiving effluent from Northern Pulp at the end of January, it will still be several months before the former tidal estuary is completely closed to all materials from the mill. Paul issued a news release Tuesday saying she has not agreed to allow the Pictou County, N.S., treatment facility to continue to be used after Jan. 31. She takes particular issue with the company's plan to run its power boiler to provide heat at the site while winterizing the mill, a move that would mean water would flow through the system and into Boat Harbour as late as April. ""We were not consulted about it,"" Paul said in the news release. She could not be reached for an interview. In her release, Paul said the community is disappointed. ""We were expecting a complete shutdown of the Boat Harbour treatment facility,"" she said. ""Northern Pulp could have started draining the pipes weeks ago in order to complete the work before Jan. 31 and avoid the need to heat the mill after that."" Last month, Premier Stephen McNeil rejected calls from the mill to extend the legislated deadline for the company's use of Boat Harbour to treat its effluent. On Tuesday, McNeil said the government is dealing with the situation as it exists, while continuing to keep the promise enshrined in the Boat Harbour Act. ""There will be no new effluent going into Boat Harbour as of the 31st of January. Our commitment has been met to [the Pictou Landing First Nation] and we'll continue to work with them,"" he said. ""Here's where we are,"" McNeil added. ""The reality of it is, we also have an issue and that's that pipe. So we couldn't do anything with the pipe until [Jan. 31]."" Running water through the boiler means the pipe connecting the mill to Boat Harbour, which the province owns and is responsible for, will be flushed and cleaned, allowing it to be disconnected and permanently removed by the end of April, said McNeil. In the meantime, he's expecting a detailed plan from the company within the week about how they will deal with other issues on the mill site, such as leachate and the capping of manhole covers on the property that receive runoff water, which flows into Boat Harbour. As those details continue to be worked out, people who work in the woods and other industries connected to the forestry are on watch for what all of it means for them. The province's forestry transition team has made several funding announcements to assist with silviculture work and retraining, but removing the industry's largest player all but guarantees some operators won't be able to remain viable for the long term. Already, companies from other provinces are advertising job fairs. Josh Molnar operates Molnar Welding in Lantz, N.S., a fabrication and repair shop that specializes in work for sawmills, and employs 25 people. They've been in business for about 45 years. Molnar, the third generation of his family to run the business, said he's watching closely to see what happens with sawmills around the province. If they reach the point where they have nowhere to send chips, it will have a direct effect on his own business. He's hoping that new markets for those chips come about quickly, such as for district heating or biomass for electricity. As much as some people in the industry would like to see Northern Pulp keep operating, Molnar said the immediate focus right now must be on finding new markets and ways to keep the sector viable. ""[Sawmills] need time, they need a solution to get rid of their products so that they can invest for the future,"" he said. It would also mean a future for the 25 people at Molnar Welding and other businesses like them.

299,Anonymous,2019-12-19T12:59:02.173Z,Former Quebec premier Jean Charest considering run for Conservative leadership,"Jean Charest is thinking about running to replace Andrew Scheer as federal Conservative Party leader, according to sources close to the former Quebec premier. Those sources told Radio-Canada, CBC's French language service, that Charest is consulting with his family. Charest hadn't seriously considered a leadership run until several caucus members and former MPs reached out and urged him to do so, according to sources. The sources said Charest is being drawn toward the leadership race by his focus on a number of issues facing the country right now, including national unity, the environment and Canada's place on the international stage. Charest served as a minister in Brian Mulroney's cabinet and later served as leader of the federal Progressive Conservatives when they were down to just two seats in the 1990s. He left the federal scene in 1998 to join the Quebec Liberal Party, eventually serving as premier between 2003 and 2012. If Charest does formally enter the ring, he'd be a controversial candidate. For years now, Quebec's anti-corruption squad, known as UPAC, has been investigating the Quebec Liberal Party's financing during the Charest period. Sources told Radio-Canada Charest is aware of the pall that investigation could cast over his candidacy, but maintains he did nothing wrong. The next step in the leadership contest is for the Conservative Party's National Council to form a leadership election organizing committee, which will decide on the rules, procedures, process and timelines for the contest. After weeks of beating back criticism over his election performance, Scheer announced last week he will step down as leader once a successor is chosen.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-conservative-leadership-1.5401053,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/o-toole-leadership-conservative-race-1.5395856 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-scheer-ranks-1.5394087,N/A

""I'm here to announce the Canada Strong Campaign, a national campaign to raise, hopefully, $1.5 million for the families of the victims — all Canadian victims all across the country,"" Mohamad Fakih, president of Paramount Fine Foods and founder of the Fakih Foundation said at the launch in Toronto. ""They leave behind spouses, colleagues and friends who need your support during this life-altering period. If there was ever a time, the time is now for all of us to come together and support one another."" Fakih called on Canadians to find it in their hearts to donate, and also to help by sharing the campaign with everyone they know. ""Let's all stand together united in ensuring that those we lost are never forgotten and that their families and friends feel Canada's embrace,"" he said. Fakih said he wants the families and friends of the victims to know that he recognizes it's not always easy to accept financial help. But he also assured them, ""You are not accepting any help from strangers. We are one family, one big family, a Canadian family."" The campaign will be overseen by a charitable fund that also raised money for the families of victims of the Toronto van attack. ""We will ensure that this initiative is very well governed and managed with full transparency and accountability,"" Fakih said. ""I will take care personally of all the expenses and costs of the campaign and I will make sure, along [with] all our partners, that 100 per cent of the money donated will be given to the victims' families and friends,"" Fakih said. Mayor John Tory took part in Monday's campaign launch, and he too encouraged Canadians and companies to step forward with donations.

Returning to his home in Alaska from a family trip to Montana last July, the 54-year-old pulled over to the side of the Alaska Highway in Yukon, about 100 kilometres north of the border with B.C.  Albertsen was getting ready to close his eyes when a pickup slowly passed and stopped a little farther up the road. A tall, skinny man got out. He appeared to be holding a long gun. To Albertsen's unease, the truck started to pull away and the man walked toward the trees, where he assumed a hunting position and slowly began approaching his vehicle.  As the gunman neared, the same pickup truck returned and began slowly blocking Albertsen's exit.  ""At that point I realized that this feels like an ambush,"" Albertsen told CBC News. WATCH | Ken Albertsen recounts his close call ""There's a guy approaching the back of my vehicle with a long gun, there's someone pulling around in the front. If I don't take action immediately, I'm going to get blocked in."" Albertsen, a photographer who lives in Palmer, Alaska, is a key witness named in recently unsealed court documents detailing last summer's Canada-wide manhunt for admitted killers Kam McLeod and Bryer Schmegelsky. The RCMP documents, obtained by CBC News, describe the injuries of the three victims, items found at crime scenes and behind-the-scenes details of cross-agency efforts to bring the two young men to justice. The bodies of McLeod, 19, and Schmegelsky, who would have turned 19 on Aug. 4, were discovered on Aug. 7 near the Nelson River in northern Manitoba.  RCMP found the pair after an intense 15-day search which began with the seemingly random killings of Australian Lucas Fowler, American Chynna Deese and University of British Columbia lecturer Leonard Dyck. Fowler and Deese were shot on July 14 or 15 at the side of the Alaska Highway near Liard Hot Springs in northern B.C. Dyck's body was found four days later in a highway pullout near Dease Lake, about 500 kilometres to the southwest. McLeod and Schmegelsky admitted responsibility for the three killings in videos left behind on a digital camera, police say. But on the night of July 17, Albertsen had no idea the two young men from Port Alberni, B.C., had started a killing spree on remote sections of highways in the north of the province.  It was just before midnight, dusk on a midsummer evening. The light was disappearing but Albertsen had good visibility from the pullout where he had parked perpendicular to the highway, facing the road, to get some sleep. He had just crawled into the backseat and taken his jeans off to lie down, when he saw the pickup pulling in. The vehicle slowed down, slower than walking speed.  Two men were inside; police would later confirm that Albertsen's descriptions of them matched those of McLeod and Schmegelsky.  Albertsen says the passenger door of the pickup truck opened to let out the man with the gun. He remembers thinking it was strange to see the vehicle pull away after letting the passenger out. The gunman then crept toward the treeline in a way Albertsen and court documents describe as ""stalking behaviour'""or a ""hunting stance."" He then walked slowly from tree to tree toward Albertsen's vehicle, holding the rifle or shotgun in ""a low-ready position."" ""His left hand is on the forearm of the gun, his right hand is on the stock close to the trigger. He's carrying the long gun in a position that would enable him to wing it up and use it readily,"" said Albertsen. ""By this point I'm paying attention, I don't know I'm under threat, but I'm paying attention."" When the truck returned and pulled into an angle that would cut him off, Albertsen says he knew he had to act. ""I leaped over the backseat, in my underwear, started up the truck, put it in gear and roared out of there,"" he said. Albertsen says he tried to look at the man behind the wheel but the driver covered his face as he sped by.  He drove another three or four hours, full of adrenaline after the encounter.  ""I honestly believe I was protected by God,"" he said.  Albertsen admits he hadn't listened to the news for a few days but after returning to Alaska and seeing local news reports about a Canada-wide manhunt, he called the RCMP. By this stage, McLeod and Schmegelsky had also killed 64-year-old Dyck. Albertsen made a statement to the RCMP on July 21. On July 23, the RCMP named the pair as suspects.  Months after that midsummer night, Albertsen finds it difficult to pass through the area. He thinks about the victims and how close he came.

302,"Stephanie Hogan, Benjamin Blum",2020-01-26T04:07:31.983Z,What we know (and don't know) about the new coronavirus outbreak,"The recently identified coronavirus — which has infected more than 1,900 people and left dozens dead in China — has spread beyond its starting point in the central Chinese province of Wuhan to impact other parts of Asia as well as Europe and North America. Canada confirmed its first presumed case on Saturday after health officials in Ontario announced that a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to China had become infected. There have also been cases reported in France, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and Malaysia, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, with most involving people from Wuhan or those who had recently travelled there. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that it's too soon to consider the coronavirus identified in China as an international health emergency — but it could develop into one, the organization's chief said. Here is what we know — and what we don't know — about the virus.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases — such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS was the coronavirus that originated in China in late 2002, and which eventually killed 44 people in Canada and infected more than 400 before the outbreak in China was declared by the WHO to be ""under control"" on Apr. 28, 2004.  The WHO's China office was first informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec. 31, 2019. The cases were all detected in Wuhan City. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the probable cause by Chinese authorities Jan. 7. The WHO reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they pass from animals to humans. But some, like this newly identified strain, can pass directly between humans. Earlier this week, China confirmed there has been human-to-human transmission of the virus. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members. According to the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., coronaviruses are most commonly spread by coughing or sneezing; close personal contact, such as shaking hands; or touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.  The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs. According to the WHO, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. The Canadian government urged travellers on Thursday to ""exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws,"" a notice that is one level below an official travel advisory. Watch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discusses the virus: The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) deems the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan as low. But it has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions, such as avoiding large crowds and high-risk areas such as farms and slaughterhouses, and avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of a coronavirus, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing. PHAC has signs at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, advising travellers from affected areas of the world to inform border services staff of any flu-like symptoms.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. A CDC spokesperson later said the agency is seeking emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow states to use its diagnostic test for the outbreak. Earlier this week, the agency said it expected to see more cases in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago after having already started screening people coming on direct flights from Wuhan at New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. WATCH | How Canadian researchers test for coronavirus: The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people, and there is no vaccine yet for the virus. Analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring. Dr. Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in China, said the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.  ""Even if [cases] are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,"" Galea said. Chinese authorities have moved to lock down multiple cities — including Wuhan, where the train station and airport were shut down and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. In Beijing, officials cancelled major events indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations in the capital. Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world — even in deadly epidemics — because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. The effectiveness of such measures is also unclear. Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. Watch: Tedros explains why the new coronavirus is not a global emergency yet: To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people [Wuhan] is new to science. - Gauden Galea, WHO representative in China. This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person-to-person transmission.  - Dr. Jeremy Farrar, infectious disease specialist. We don't know enough to know whether we should be worried … If this is a virus that can sustain itself in humans now — is transmitted from person to person and lives in humans — then the Lunar New Year travel will spread it faster in China, no doubt. If this is a virus that is not sustainable in human populations, if it doesn't transmit well enough, then the Lunar New Year means we'll see new cases, it will create a lot of concern, but it won't cause problems.  - Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto WATCH: Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital speaks to CBC News about the new coronavirus outbreak. The one piece of good news we have here is that this is possibly not as virulent a virus as SARS and won't result in as many deaths, but almost all the other news we have at the moment is unfortunately bad news … Fourteen medical staff infected from the first 200 cases is quite a high number.

303,Robert Jones,2020-01-17T12:33:26.210Z,"NB Power rate used to justify smart meters 'low,' says expert","Questions about whether NB Power has padded the business case supporting its proposed purchase of smart meters continue to dog the utility at Energy and Utilities Board hearings. A U.S. expert hired by NB Power to independently evaluate the reasonableness of its smart meter plan said he found a key interest rate input used by the utility to calculate costs of its project — known as a discount rate — to be ""low"" ""A lower discount rate will increase a positive result,"" said Erik Gilbert in explaining the significance of the issue Gilbert, a Colorado-based energy consultant, testified at hearings into NB Power's smart meter plan Wednesday and Thursday and said the utility supplied his company with a discount rate of 5.25 per cent to calculate the interest cost of money that will be invested in the smart meter project. The rate was below what was used by other utilities undertaking similar projects Gilbert investigated, but he said it was not unbelievably low and he assumed, wrongly, it was a rate generally used by NB Power in its other capital planning. ""Typically when we do one of these benefit cost analyses, we obtain this rate, directly from the utility finance folks,"" said Gilbert.    ""And as long as that rate is  being broadly used in say an IRP (integrated resource plan) or in other  proceedings, long range planning and so on, then we  consider it reasonable."". EUB lawyer Ellen Desmond asked Gilbert if he had investigated why the rate was selected or if he looked into whether NB Power typically uses the 5.25 per cent rate.  He hadn't. ""I did not personally review the IRP,"" he said  ""Every utility has different discount rates and different factors. And so we didn't consider the 5.25 to be an outlier, it was just low.""    NB Power's most recent integrated resource plan, which was updated in 2017 and is on file in a separate EUB matter,  states the company generally uses a discount rate of 5.9 per cent ""for all present value analysis."" Gilbert's own work showed that Nova Scotia Power recently used a discount rate of 6.96 per cent in its own smart meter application in 2017 and BC Hydro used a discount rate of eight per cent. According to Gilbert's report every one per cent swing in the discount rate used in NB Power's smart meter plan would add or subtract about $7 million in net benefits, depending if it was moved higher or lower. ""It is important. It is an important factor yes,"" said Gilbert. Although hired by NB Power, Gilbert said he was asked to evaluate the company's application, not support it, and he was free to criticize any faults he found.   He said overall he found the business case professional and reasonable and ""on the balance"" built using conservative assumptions. ""We were retained to do an independent and impartial review of NB Power's business case and their benefit cost analysis, and that is how I view the role,"" said Gilbert. ""To provide input to the Board, expert opinion to the Board, and the evidence that we have introduced as an impartial expert and to help the Board make an appropriate decision for New Brunswick.""   NB Power has insisted from the start of hearings that it used conservative estimates and assumptions in building its business case that smart meters will generate a $31.1 million net benefit over 15 years. But interveners, especially EUB lawyer Ellen Desmond, have been chipping away at that number.   In addition to questions about the discount rate, interveners earlier raised questions about $4.7 million in benefits NB Power has claimed in its business case will flow from replacing inefficient older meters that undercount electricity consumption with newer, more accurate smart meters.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-rate-meters-1.5430140,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-catch-22-1.5428720 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meters-eub-hearings-1.5427258,N/A

Front-line jobs will be protected, Ford said, as the province consolidates 14 local health integration networks (LHINs), Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario and several other agencies into a new organization called Ontario Health. ""You know who's going to lose their jobs, unfortunately, are the people in the LHINs — the CEOs that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars, the big silos they have there, the big executives, presidents and vice-presidents making outrageous amounts of money,"" Ford said. ""We're going to take that money and put it to the front lines."" When Health Minister Christine Elliott announced the health system transformation last month, background materials portrayed some management and administrative work at the agencies as ""duplicative,"" which Elliott said referred to administrative functions. But she wouldn't say if there would be job losses. During last year's election campaign, Ford often promised that under his government not a single job would be lost, as he looks for ways to trim a multi-billion-dollar deficit. But in recent weeks his government and ministers have amended that promise, adding the phrase ""front-line."" ""So far we've made these efficiencies and not one person has lost their job,"" Ford said Wednesday. Ontario's ombudsman has said that some workers in the provincial Child and Youth Advocate's office will lose their jobs when his office assumes its duties this spring.

Kidsability, an autism service provider in the Waterloo region, said it is laying off eight therapists and one social worker as a result of the government's changes to how it funds autism therapy. Regional service providers will no longer be directly funded by the government, rather, families will be given money directly to spend in a variety of possible ways. Families say the annual caps of $20,000 for treatment for children under six, and $5,000 for children six to 18, will only pay for a fraction of what many kids need, as intensive therapy can cost up to $80,000 per year.

The four-person board of the community's Ten Thousand Villages shop unanimously approved the closure at its Dec. 10 meeting for multiple reasons, including declining sales. ""It's sad to see it go,"" store manager Sarah Wall told CBC Radio Noon host Marjorie Dowhos on Wednesday. ""It has been a fixture in the community. But I think we can be really proud of the work we've done."" People in the town, about 100 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg, have been surprised and shocked to hear about the closure, Wall said, ""and everyone is sad to see it go."" Wall said the employees who work at the store, located in the Altona Mall, are disappointed, but they knew about the sales numbers so they were prepared. The Ten Thousand Villages store in Altona originally opened in 1972 as part of Canada's first Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) Thrift Store. When the store was later rebranded, it became the first Ten Thousand Villages location in the country. As of the end of the 2018-19 fiscal year, there were 24 stores in Canada, according to the organization's latest annual report, where crafts and other items produced by artisans in developing countries are sold. Manitoba Ten Thousand Villages locations actually combined for the second-most retail sales in Canada, the 2018-19 annual report says. But sales have been declining across the country since at least fiscal 2016-17. ""Growing sales, clearing out excess aging inventory and managing the size of our operating losses will be key themes against which the success of fiscal 2020 will be assessed,"" Brent Zorgdrager, interim CEO of Ten Thousand Villages Canada, said in the latest report. The Altona store's last day is expected to be Dec. 31, Wall said. It will be the 11th Canadian location to shut down since 2014. Wall believes the community is losing an opportunity to support artisans from developing countries ""and just a little piece of history as well."" Wall hopes to sell everything in the store before it shuts down. Whatever is left over will go to the Mennonite Central Committee, she said. The Ten Thousand Villages chain's origins stretch back to 1946, according to the organization's website. Edna Ruth Byler, an American MCC worker, had visited volunteers in Puerto Rico who were teaching sewing classes to help improve the lives of women living in poverty. When she returned to her home in Pennsylvania, she filled her car with their embroidery and started selling pieces at churches, parties and sewing circles.

The agency said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the declaration to improve the response to the outbreak by allowing local governments to draw on a special Quick Response Fund. It said the Philippines has recorded 146,062 cases of dengue from January through July 20 this year, 98 per cent more than during the same period in 2018. It said the outbreak caused 622 deaths. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection found in tropical countries worldwide. It can cause joint pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash, and can cause breathing problems, hemorrhaging and organ failure in severe cases. While there is no specific treatment for the illness, medical care to maintain a person's fluid levels is seen as critical. The Department of Health said that starting Tuesday, it was conducting a campaign to focus on finding and destroying mosquito breeding sites, which is a primary means of containing dengue.

The slide came on the first trading day of a holiday-shortened week in the U.S. and followed losses in global markets amid deepening concerns that the new coronavirus spreading in the world's second-largest economy could hurt tourism and ultimately economic growth and corporate profits. Canada's main stock index fell for the first time in seven sessions on concerns about the outbreak. The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 25.11 points at 17,572.28. Six people have died, and 291 have been infected in China, just as the country was preparing for its peak travel season over the Lunar New Year travel. A U.S. citizen who recently returned from China was diagnosed with the new virus in the Seattle area, making the United States the fifth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. ""From an investment standpoint, the risk with any virus is in the scope of its economic impact, and the mere fact that this has spread from China overnight to the U.S. so quickly reinforces the idea that the negative fallout could be global rather than local,"" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research for FTSE Russell. Asian stocks closed sharply lower. European markets also fell. Within the S&P 500, stocks of U.S. companies that cater to Chinese tourists had some of the biggest losses, along with general travel companies, such as casinos and airlines. Industrial, financial and energy companies were among those that declined. Those losses outweighed gains in defensive sector stocks, including real estate, utilities and household goods makers. Traders also shifted money into U.S. government bonds, sending yields lower. Investors are looking at playbooks for past outbreaks, such as SARS in 2002-2003, where airlines, railways and other transportation companies saw their stocks slide the most, followed by retailers and hospitality companies, according to strategists at Jefferies. Headlines about the spreading coronavirus have given investors an excuse to take profits following the market's recent record-setting run. The three major U.S. stock indexes were coming off all-time highs set Friday. The S&P 500 hasn't had a single-day drop of more than 1 per cent since October. ""Investors have shown a lot of optimism, and that might make some a little bit skittish,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. ""Valuations are elevated. In this sort of environment, I don't think it takes much of a headline to trigger a reaction."" Tuesday's drop for the index follows a strong run. Fears of a possible recession have faded, and investors expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, and the S&P 500 has risen in 13 of the last 15 weeks. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 152.06 points at 29,196.04. The S&P 500 index was down 8.83 points at 3,320.79, while the Nasdaq composite was down 18.13 points at 9,370.81.

313,Perlita Stroh,2019-11-06T17:20:28.465Z,Why Rainer Hoess is making sure the atrocities his Nazi grandfather perpetrated are never forgotten,"Rainer Hoess was 15 years old when he realized his family had secrets — enormous, dark secrets. A young boy in Germany at the time, he was on a school trip to the Dachau Concentration Camp when he stumbled across informational placards talking about a Nazi officer with the same last name as his. The officer wasn't just a rank-and-file Nazi. He was Rudolf Hoess, commandant of the Auschwitz death camp for five years. ""He was a million-mass-murderer in the Second World War, without regret or remorse in any way,"" says Hoess, who was in Toronto speaking to high school students as part of Holocaust Education Week. ""I think it's so strong and powerful for him to speak to so many people about such a sad experience,"" says Sibyl Martasna, a student who heard Hoess' presentation at Northern Secondary School in Toronto. It was Hoess' grandfather who ordered the use of Zyklon B gas to increase the number of people who could be executed at Auschwitz, with that number reaching as high as 2,000 killed each day. In all, more than one million people, mostly Jews, were murdered at Auschwitz during Rudolf Hoess' tenure. He eventually was captured and admitted to his crimes at the Nuremberg Trials after the Second World War, and was hanged at Auschwitz. ""I grew up with the understanding that my family had lived through the terrors of the Nazi occupation in the Netherlands,"" his grandson says. ""Nothing in these stories prepared me for the weight of our true experience at Auschwitz."" As a teen, after confronting his father with the stark discovery about his grandfather, Rainer Hoess says he was met with more denials. He did his own research, and eventually understood the truth. He left home and cut all ties with his family. Since then, he has dedicated his adult life to talking about his family's past, and supporting holocaust survivors in an attempt to combat hate in all its forms. ""Right now, I'm 54 years old and I'm still in the process of separating myself from the family, it's a long-lasting process,"" says Rainer Hoess, who has no idea if his father is even still alive. ""These are the steps in my life I took to get out of the shadow of my grandfather … I found my way to deal with it is to go to schools and talk, around 80 to 100 schools a year."" In addition to speaking to students, Hoess started a website called Footsteps to create awareness about his family's past. The stories he has uncovered are chilling. His father, Hans-Juergen Hoess, was one of Rudolf Hoess' five children and lived on the grounds of Auschwitz with his family while his father ran the camp. The family had a vegetable garden outside their home, and Rainer Hoess recounts how his grandmother would warn the children to rinse anything before eating it to ensure the ashes were washed off — they were the human ashes from the crematoria overlooking their home. Rainer also found rings belonging to his grandfather, made from the gold fillings of hundreds of Jewish prisoners. He tells these stories over and over to groups of people in the hopes that they understand the horrors of the past and do not allow them to be repeated. He says that's what keeps fuelling his life's work. ""The point is to prevent something like that ever happening again,"" he says. ""We live in a really brutal and cruel world. I mean, just look at what happened in Pittsburgh or right now in Germany ... everywhere where crimes are committed against Jews, Muslims, homosexuals, it's hate,"" he says. Organizers who brought him to speak in Toronto understood the message would carry a lot of weight coming from the descendant of a figure like Rudolf Hoess. ""I think for Jews to tell the message of combating hate and anti-Semitism is really important, but I think coming from somebody with that family background, somebody who was raised by people who were essentially Nazis — that's really compelling for students to hear, it makes it very real,"" says Dara Solomon, of the Sarah and Chaim Neuberger Holocaust Education Centre. Ace Chou, another student from Northern Secondary School, was clearly affected by Hoess' talk. ""I think it's really brave of him, and it is definitely necessary for people to learn about the history,"" he says. Hoess has gone further than just speaking to students. He has visited Auschwitz more than 30 times, taking groups back to see his grandfather's former home there and the camp he ran. He has made personal contact with more than 70 holocaust survivors and created close relationships with many of them. One, Eva Mozes Kor, even adopted him as her own son before she passed away last year. And, in 2013, he wrote his family's story in a book titled The Heritage of the Kommandant: On being part of a terrible family, to make sure future generations don't forget the horrors of the past. ""An obsession really became a passion for me with this work,"" says Hoess. ""As long as I can, I will do this work — as long as my feet go one in front of the other.""

Spooling gear on the starboard trawl winch took off on its own. The winch is used to retrieve heavy gear and nets deployed to gather ocean climate data and fish stocks on board the B.C.-based vessel. The coast guard said the damaged part will be replaced and the winch repaired when the ship heads into planned maintenance next month. At the time of the malfunction, no personnel was in the vicinity, spokesperson Benoit Mayrand wrote in an email to CBC News. An official with the Union of Canadian Transportation Employees said the malfunction occurred in the middle of the night during a patrol last November. ""The shipyard is aware of the issue and is taking responsibility and will complete the repairs under warranty,"" Mayrand said. Franklin was the first large ship built under Canada's national shipbuilding strategy and it was delivered last June. Seaspan Shipyard in Vancouver was awarded the contract to build three offshore fisheries science vessels in a $687-million project. CCGS Jacques Cartier, which will be based in Halifax, was turned over to the coast guard last November. The third vessel, the John Cabot, is expected to be delivered this summer and will be based in St. John's. Seaspan said the sophisticated software and systems on its vessels are tested and approved by independent third parties before delivery. ""As with all large, complex systems, it is not uncommon for minor software anomalies to occur. These are addressed in routine maintenance windows. This is a minor issue isolated to the Sir John Franklin,"" spokesperson Amy MacLeod wrote in an email to CBC. Last March, Franklin struck a breakwater as it was returning from its first week of sea trials. To ensure the ship met its June delivery date, the rudder and propeller were removed from the third offshore science vessel, the John Cabot, and installed on Franklin. ""There are no delays to the delivery of the CCGS John Cabot due to the breakwater incident and no financial implications for the Government of Canada,"" Mayrand said. No parts were needed from the Cabot to repair the Franklin starboard trawl winch. In 2018, CBC News revealed portions of the Franklin hull were re-welded after an inspection uncovered a series of defective joints.

315,Anonymous,2020-01-19T18:31:22.128Z,Hitting the road at -50 C? This Yukon elder has some tips ,"Yukon's been gripped by brutal cold for the last couple of weeks and it has made getting around not just a hassle — but potentially dangerous. A highway breakdown can quickly become a struggle to survive, waiting for help at –50 C. Just ask the poor folks who drove off the road last week and then set their vehicle on fire to stay warm. Mary Maje, a Kaska elder from Ross River, and her husband Ted Charlie also had vehicle trouble this week, on a remote, empty road. But Maje said they were well-prepared — so it ended up being no big deal. Here are some of Maje's tips for staying safe on a frigid road trip. Maje and Charlie were headed to Watson Lake on Monday when a belt on their truck broke. They were still about an hour's drive from Watson Lake, on the Campbell Highway — and they didn't have the spare part. It was about –46 C, Maje says. Her daughter was also on that lonely road, though, and travelling a little ways ahead. When she noticed that Maje and Charlie were no longer following, she turned back — reaching them about an hour later.  Maje and Charlie left their truck to return the next day with a new belt. ""Make sure you contact someone to your destination, and always travel in pairs,"" Maje said. ""Have all the necessities for cold weather,"" she advised. When they broke down this week, they managed to quickly get a fire going while they waited. They had everything they needed in their truck — cut wood, kindling and firestarter, and a chainsaw kept warm inside the vehicle. ""We kept putting wood on that fire,"" she said. ""We didn't even get cold."" Here's what else she carries with her: That may sound like a lot to haul around, but it's about survival, she says.  Besides, she says, ""you're not really packing it on your back!"" This wasn't the first time Maje was forced into survival mode at roadside. ""Oh no, we've broken down before at –50 — we did the same then,"" she said. ""We had our kids with us. We had them all bundled up and they were warm."" That time, they were stuck long enough to set up a wall tent with a small woodstove, and cover the ground with brush. They stayed relatively comfortable because they had everything they needed, and then some. ""When you have kids traveling with you, you have to be more prepared,"" she says. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-road-trip-cold-tips-1.5431375,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-trappers-resuce-ross-river-1.5428201 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-vehicle-set-fire-cold-1.5428598,N/A
316,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2020-01-21T01:21:32.472Z,Accused in hit-and-run death of Brady Francis told police he thought he hit a deer,"The day after Brady Francis was found dead, Maurice Johnson told police he initially thought he had struck a deer in Saint-Charles the night before, his hit-and-run trial heard Monday. But after hearing media reports about a man being killed along Saint-Charles South Road, Johnson began to wonder if he had hit him, testified RCMP Const. Natasha Grimard-​​​​​​Bélisle, who took his statement. The Moncton Court of Queen's Bench also saw security video of Johnson and his wife buying a pint of vodka and a case of 24 beer from the Co-Op in Saint-Louis-de-Kent the afternoon Francis was killed. But Johnson told police he wasn't drinking that night and Cpl. Guillaume Larose testified he found no evidence Johnson had consumed alcohol. The body of Francis, 22, of Elsipogtog First Nation, was found on Feb. 24, 2018, at around 9:40 p.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles, has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. The trial, which is being held in French at Johnson's request, is scheduled to continue on Tuesday morning. Grimard-​​​​​​Bélisle testified she was dispatched to Johnson's home on Feb. 25, 2018, after his wife called 911. Johnson told the officer he and his wife drove out to their camp the night before hoping to see some friends, but nobody was there and they were getting tired, so they decided to head home. The couple were talking, and Johnson said when he turned his head to look at his wife for a split second he hit what he believed to be a deer, Grimard-​​​​​​Bélisle told the court. Johnson described it as being a blur, but about four feet high. He said he was driving about 85 kilometres an hour, possibly 95 km/h, and didn't have time to brake because it happened too fast, said Grimard-​​​​​​Bélisle. About three weeks later, Johnson was arrested at his home. On Monday, the court watched part of the videotaped statement he gave to the RCMP at the Richibucto detachment on March 15, 2018. In the video, Johnson is wearing a short-sleeved camouflaged shirt, jeans and white socks, and sitting with his arms and legs crossed. Cpl. Nicholas Potvin, of the major crime unit in Moncton, asks him in French how he and his family are doing. ""It's not easy,"" Johnson replies in French. ""This is a young person. This is an accident,"" he says, then pauses, rubs his eye, and looks down at the ground. Family and friends of Francis, who do not speak French, followed the proceedings from an adjacent courtroom where a volunteer from the Mi'kmaq community provided translation for them. Francis's mother Jessica Perley has said the volunteer is doing her best, but still can't understand everything being said. ""We're getting bits and parts and then we're piecing it together and we're asking other people that may be sitting in the actual courtroom,"" Perley has said. ""So it's frustrating."" Still, the family is grateful to the volunteer, she has stressed. Francis's parents and advocates had pushed for the province to provide simultaneous interpretation of the trial, but Justice Minister Andrea Anderson-Mason said in December 2018 none would be provided. A department spokesperson has said the family was welcome to co-ordinate its own interpretation in the adjacent courtroom, which is serving as an overflow room and has a live video feed of the proceedings. In the video, Potvin asks Johnson if he hit the young man and fled the scene. Johnson repeats what he told the other officer. He was talking to his wife while driving, turned his head to look at her for a brief moment and when he turned back, all of a sudden, something was on the road in front of his truck. ""I thought it was a deer."" Johnson says he looked behind them and couldn't see anything on the road so he thought the animal was safe and had run away. ""If I thought it had been a person, I would have stopped,"" he tells the officer. Johnson says he and his wife didn't discuss the matter any further that night. When they got home, he watched some TV, got undressed and went to bed, he said. His videotaped statement was originally scheduled to be viewed last week but had to be adjourned after Crown prosecutor Pierre Gionet discovered it had not been properly edited. Portions of the tape were supposed to be removed because the judge had deemed the content inadmissible. Gionet advised the court he plans to continue playing the videotaped statement on Tuesday. It is between four and five hours in total, he said. The Crown has three more witnesses to call and expects to wrap up its case by end of day Wednesday, said Gionet, then defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux will begin presenting his case. Earlier Monday, the court heard from the surprise witness who came forward last week in the nearly two-year-old case. Rodney Stever wasn't asked and never said in court what prompted him to contact police about that night. But he testified he was driving on Saint-Charles South Road to his mother's house on Feb. 24, 2018, when he came across a dark-coloured SUV blocking the road, about 275 metres from the Saint-Charles store. A woman told him there was an accident up ahead, emergency crews had been called and he couldn't pass, he said. So he pulled his beige 2010 Ford Ranger pickup truck into the driveway of a mini home on the left side of the road and turned back. The Crown prosecutor showed Stever a photograph of a truck. Stever said it was the same colour, make and year as his truck, but the rims were different. The truck in the photograph also appeared to be in mint condition compared to his, which had a black rust paint around the bottom front and around the wheels. ""You can tell that truck from my truck no problem,"" he said. The relevance of Stever's testimony to the case was not immediately made clear to the court. Last week, the court saw security video from the Saint-Charles store of the victim walking on Saint-Charles South Road on the night he was killed and a tan vehicle passing by shortly afterward. Under cross-examination, Stever said he wasn't sure what time he was driving in the area but estimated it was between 8 p.m. and midnight. He said he no longer has the truck, which was sold through a junkyard and crushed. Johnson owned a grey 2003 GMC Sierra, the trial has heard. Last Friday, the court heard from a collision reconstructionist who testified he had no doubt Francis was struck by a vehicle, and the damage to Johnson's truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck, but he could not say whether the damage occurred on the day Francis was killed. The trial began last Monday and has heard from 29 witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31. Justice Denise LeBlanc is presiding.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-6-brady-francis-trial-1.5432117,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brady-francis-maurice-johnson-hit-and-run-reconstructionist-1.5430142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brady-francis-maurice-johnson-hit-and-run-trial-reconstructionist-1.5428487,N/A
317,Clare Hennig,2020-01-18T06:58:47.527Z,"Summer, winter, M+S: This is what you need to know about your tires when it snows","Chaos reigns on the roads whenever snow hits the Lower Mainland. Cars slip and slide in the streets like a puppy on ice skates. The less trustworthy rides end up in the ditch or are abandoned at the bottom of the slightest snow-covered incline — yes, the Lions Gate Bridge is a bit of a hill — and hazard lights blink more furiously than the flurries coming down.  And so comes the perennial question of tires.   B.C. Attorney General David Eby was asked this week, after a series of snowstorms led to a spike of 18,000 dial-a-claim calls to ICBC, whether the province would consider making winter tires mandatory across B.C.  ""It's certainly something I'll be asking ICBC about, following some of what I saw on the road over the last couple of days, and I'm sure many British Columbians would nod along with that idea,"" Eby said. Under the current rules, drivers in most of Metro Vancouver and along the southeast coast of Vancouver Island can legally get away with using summer tires.  Winter tires are required on most highways in B.C. from Oct. 1 until the end of either March or April, depending on the route.  This is a summer tire: It's got a smooth tread and is meant to stick to dry pavement in reasonably warm conditions. This is perfectly legal, though not advised, in most of Metro Vancouver any time of the year. Just don't try using it to get up to one of the ski hills, though.  This is an all-season tire, rated M+S for mud and snow: These can be used on many winter highways, but they aren't technically winter tires.  Once the temperature drops below about 7 C, the rubber becomes harder and doesn't grab as well. These tires have the M+S symbol on the side.  And this is a winter-rated tire: The deep tread and rubber is designed to work in icy weather. These tires have a little snowflake within a three-peaked mountain mark. And this is an Aston Martin sports car stuck in the snow: All-wheel drive and four-wheel drive vehicles are better at accelerating in the snow and getting out of a tight spot when stuck. But when it comes to stopping, it doesn't make much difference.  Hey Vancouver. 4x4 isn't impervious to ice. ❄ <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/vancouversnowstorm2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#vancouversnowstorm2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/R7Ez8Gicp8"">pic.twitter.com/R7Ez8Gicp8</a> An all-wheel drive car with M+S tires driving a mellow 30 km/h will take about 10 metres to come to a complete stop. A full rated winter-tire would shorten that. ""[And that] may be the difference between a collision and not a collision,"" said Kurtis Strelau, the regional general manager for Young Drivers of Canada. Watch the video below to learn the difference between tires: Of course, it doesn't matter what kind of tires are on your car if they're worn out. Check the wear bars. Or do the ""toonie test."" If the tread is as deep as the bear's paws, great. If the tread doesn't cover the silver part of the coin, buy a new set. ""It's not worth your life, or that of somebody else, if your car loses control and it's because of your tires,"" Strelau said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/summer-winter-m-s-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-your-tires-when-it-snows-1.5432005,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/icbc-call-spike-snow-1.5430356 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-weather-winter-storm-1.5430589 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/first-responder-snow-day-1.5428812,N/A

""The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry [of] Health are currently examining changes to the application process, including not allowing a change of name where an offender has been convicted of committing specific sexual offences,"" Justice Minister Don Morgan said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.  In 2018, the Ministry of Justice first mulled over the idea of having people applying for name changes undergo a criminal record check.  Sask. considering criminal record checks when applying for name change ""In the interest of public safety, offenders that prey on the most vulnerable in our society should not be able to change their name to avoid public disclosure and scrutiny."" That proposal is getting discussed again amid reports about a man convicted of sexually assaulting a minor and committing child pornography offences in the United States. The man has allegedly settled in Regina — and changed his name.  David Donald Shumey, 76, changed his name to David Donald Stryker and lives in the city, as listed in the Saskatchewan Gazette and reported by the Regina Leader-Post on Tuesday.  Saskatchewan's Ministry of Justice was unaware that Stryker had re-entered Canada and had listed an address in Regina.  ""The Government of Saskatchewan is very concerned about the situation raised where an offender who has been convicted of committing sexual offences has changed their name,"" Morgan's statement read.  The man was living in the U.S. as an illegal immigrant from Canada, according to stories published by the Las Vegas Sun Newspaper in 1999.  ""David Donald Shumey was given the 20-years-to-life sentence Thursday after he tried to place the blame on the girl's parents for leaving her with him at a low-income downtown apartment complex,"" the  Las Vegas Sun article read.   He ""plea-bargained his 88-count child pornography and sexual assault case down to one count of sexual assault of a minor and two charges of using a minor in the production of pornography."" A plea bargain was struck in order to save the victim and a potential jury from a trial, the Las Vegas Sun reporter wrote.  Furthermore, he reported that the man, ""who has eight aliases, admitted he has a ""weakness"" and gave in to impulses while baby-sitting the girl. The girl was reportedly 7 and 8 years old at the time.  According to the Las Vegas Sun, the abuse wasn't discovered until a maintenance man discovered an album of child porn hidden in a vent at the downtown motel where Stryker (then Shumey) was living.  A spokesperson for the Regina Police Service said Tuesday that officers ""are looking into the possibility of this person's presence in the community.""  Sask. considering criminal record checks when applying for name change 4 ways police are fighting the 'dramatic' increase in child sexual abuse online In 2018, two Saskatchewan men who had served time for child pornography charges were thrust back into the public eye because they had changed their names.  One man, Gabriel Michael Fisher (formerly known as Kevin Daniel Hudec) was charged again with making child pornography and accessing it — after his name change.  One month later, Justin William Pasloski — formerly named Justin Gerard Gryba — was thrown back into the spotlight when it was discovered he had changed his name. He had been convicted in 2016 of making child pornography and sentenced to two years less a day.  If a person wants to change their name in Saskatchewan they have to be a resident of the province, must be 18 or older and must be entitled to be in Canada. If there is a name change, such as in the cases of Fisher and Pasloski, the offender has seven days to notify the authorities. If they do not, they face potential penalization including fines and jail time.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/david-donald-stryker-moves-to-regina-1.5418126,[],N/A
319,Travis Kingdon,2020-01-23T10:00:00.526Z,How P.E.I. could help with an increased demand for beef,"The Maritime Beef Council says demand for beef is going up, and P.E.I. might be able to help meet that demand. ""We're actually seeing increased demand for beef regionally, nationally and internationally as well,"" said Brad McCallum, with the Maritime Beef Council and managing director of the Nova Scotia Cattle Producers. But the number of cattle available in the Atlantic region has fallen from 63,700 in 2007 to 42,300 in 2016.   As far back as 2003, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, had a significant impact on the regional herd, McCallum said, and numbers haven't rebounded.  ""As we went through into the early- to mid-2010s we actually saw historically-high market prices,"" McCallum said. ""A lot of the industry participants at that time actually saw that as an opportunity to liquidate their herds and gain maximum value back out of their animals and their farms.""  Russ Mallard, president of Atlantic Beef Products, said that as producers retire, many haven't had a plan to keep their farm going, adding to the shortage of supply in the region.  Meanwhile, the company is expanding and needs more than 15,000 animals to fill the demand, Mallard said. That's a need of 300 per week. ""We know that we get every animal we can locally from the three Maritime provinces, and we find ourselves going to Quebec quite regularly.""   The cattle industry goes hand in hand with the potato industry on P.E.I., McCallum said.  ""Having a rotation within the potato crop allows for the production of grains and also allows for the production of forage, which can be then used to feed cattle,"" McCallum said, adding cattle also produce manure for farmers.  McCallum also said there is some unused capacity in feedlots. ""There are also some that would be sitting empty ... that could be brought back into production,"" McCallum said. ""There's a lot of infrastructure that already exists, it's about maximizing that infrastructure."" With Atlantic Beef Products — the major processor in the region — on P.E.I., McCallum said it makes logistical and financial sense for the animals to be shipped to feedlots here. In order to address the deficit, the beef council is working on educating producers to make them more efficient.  McCallum said he thinks that producers have a role to play in bringing stability to the market.  ""One of the big things that we want to see is producers being more engaged with themselves ... more engaged with the next person down the production chain and then ultimately with the processor and the consumer,"" he said.  ""It's all about knowing what that consumer wants and producing for their requirements and without knowing that, it's really hard to predict, it's really hard to know if you're going to be profitable."" Mallard said given the volatility of the industry, he thinks more of a guarantee, like those that exist in other markets, could help attract people to the industry. ""Price insurance — and that basically gives the producer an advance knowledge of what they'll get for their beef six months out,"" he said. ""And that involves a contract and securing beef futures and it's available pretty widely in Western Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-cows-needed-atlantic-products-1.5436510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dairy-farmers-feed-concerns-1.5353731 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-company-certified-sustainable-1.5238512 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932,N/A
320,Michael Gorman,2020-01-23T13:18:23.983Z,N.S. remains committed to Lahey Report as province's forestry industry is in limbo,"Nova Scotia's forestry minister says he remains committed to implementing the Lahey Report on forestry practices, even as the industry is in the midst of significant challenges. Iain Rankin had previously said he hoped a new forest management guide, a key part of the report by University of King's College president Bill Lahey, would be ready by the end of last December. But that process was delayed when it was announced Northern Pulp would be shutting down its Pictou County, N.S., operation after failing to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment facility. On Thursday, the company announced in a news release it had begun issuing lay-off notices to 90 non-union salaried employees at the pulp mill. The earliest layoffs will take effect on Jan. 31. Rankin said he expects the advisory committee working on the new guide to meet by the end of February. He said he wanted to give the industry time to focus right now on the necessary transition efforts as a result of the pending closure at Northern Pulp. ""We wanted to put a high priority on that, making sure people were taken care of working in the forestry industry, but we are absolutely committed to adopting the Lahey Report and ecological forestry,"" he said. The minister said he remains optimistic the new guide can be completed early this year. Work on other aspects of the report's recommendations, which call for a more ecological approach to forestry and a reduction in clear cutting on Crown land, remains on track, said Rankin. ""I know a lot of people are waiting for the guide, but in fairness to industry, there has been some significant change in their lives,"" he said. ""I still believe that we can have significant progress by the end of this fiscal year when we'll be evaluated [by Lahey on our progress on achieving the recommendations]."" Rankin is also keeping tabs on efforts to transition an industry that's about to lose its most important player. Part of that process is finding new markets for low-grade wood chips and finding them soon, as rumours swirl about the viability of some sawmills in the province. The minister said time is the biggest challenge right now. Port Hawkesbury Paper has agreed to take more chips and Rankin said Nova Scotia Power could also take more for biomass energy. Still, finding a home for the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chips Northern Pulp used to purchase each year won't be easy. Although some industry members are pushing for an expanded use of chips at Brooklyn Energy near Liverpool, Rankin said there are a variety of considerations for such a move. ""We want to make sure that we're doing what's right for [power] ratepayers, what's right for the environment, what's right for all involved, but specific to that piece, that's owned by Nova Scotia Power and they'll make that determination,"" he said. Access to fibre is also an important consideration for sawmills and Rankin said he's heard from some outfits that want access to some of Northern Pulp's Crown land allocations once the company stops operating. ""I think quite rightly they're looking out to make sure that they have at least the amount of fibre allocation that they had through the Northern Pulp licensing,"" he said. ""So we're considering all options when it comes to the sawmills that had those exchange agreements in the central region."" As efforts continue to try to cushion the blow of Northern Pulp's closure to the industry, Rankin promised ""a number of initiatives"" that would be announced soon to help people in the industry and ensure that a workforce remains in the province for whenever new options and opportunities become available.

These types of temperature milestones are the norm now; every month it seems another record is set, and every year we reach another global warming milestone.  In fact, the hottest years on record have all occurred since 2005, according to the report.  But scientists say rising heat is about more than just numbers; behind those statistics are consequences for people, their livelihoods and our delicate ecosystems. Climate change is costing cities as they try to adapt and mitigate. Farmers are facing increasing challenges, which can lead to consumers paying more for food. Extreme weather disasters are on the rise in Canada and costing insurance companies, leading to higher premiums. People are dying in heat waves which are set to become more frequent as the planet warms; and hurricanes are stalling, meaning more people are in danger for longer periods of time.  ""In my line of work, we do track the numbers and we do try to quantify the behaviour of the climate system, but ultimately what really matters is where it intersects and impacts with the people we love and the things we do,"" said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). In our normal, day-to-day lives, the effects of a warming planet may not be so evident to most Canadians. But to some, it's all too real. The most dramatic changes are found in the north. The region is warming almost three times faster than the planet as a whole, resulting in record-low sea ice levels in the Arctic and melting permafrost. These occurrences have consequences. They're taking a toll on ecosystems — and on the people who have called the cold, icy area home for centuries. Inuit are losing their homes. They are losing their way of life. They are falling through the rapidly thinning ice while hunting. The warming is also affecting the mental health of people who had cherished longer winters and persistent cold. To people who have long relied on the consistency of the cold north, the change is all too real. Farmers are also particularly vulnerable to climate change. ""Some people who work in weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture … are seeing [climate change] on an annual basis, and they're seeing [it] through greater extremes, and they're also seeing it in the greater variability, the wild swings,"" said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.  Phillips' annual list of Canada's top ten weather stories cited the terrible farming season in the Prairies in 2019. The weather went from dry before the planting season even began for many, to too wet from June to August, followed by an early snowfall at the start of harvest time in September. This meant a lot of crops remained unharvested. John Guelly, chair of the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said the 2019 growing season was ""the harvest from hell.""  Guelly, who has been a farmer for the past 30 years just northwest of Edmonton, plants canola, wheat and barley, with 1,000 acres of crops.  ""In our particular region, where I farm, it's actually been the fourth really lousy harvest season we've had in a row,"" he said. ""It's definitely taking its toll on people."" But not all the challenges have been the same. In 2018, smoke from the B.C. fires reduced sunlight, for example. And with climate change forecast to create drier conditions in some regions, this may be a sign of things to come. ""If you'd asked a farmer before Christmas what they wanted for Christmas, it was 'Can the growing season be normal next year?'"" Guelly said. "" What's normal anymore? We're not sure."" The fires raging in Australia are just a recent example of the challenges a continuously warming Earth will present. To date, 28 people have died, including two firemen, and millions of animals are thought to have perished.  Then there are hurricanes. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian sat almost immovable above Abaco Island in the Bahamas for more almost 24 hours, killing at least 70 people. Heat waves killed an estimated 1,500 people in France in 2019. The good news is this is far below the 2003 heat wave that killed an estimated 30,000 across Europe, with 14,000 in France alone. And here at home, a heat wave killed 66 people in Montreal in 2018. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international humanitarian medical organization, believes places like South Asia and the Pacific region, the Middle East, the Sahelian Belt, and Southern Africa are particularly at risk. Carol Devine, a humanitarian advisor at MSF focusing on human health and climate change, said she's concerned about what the future holds.  ""Vulnerable people tend to become more vulnerable, and climate change exacerbates health issues,"" she said.  ""Climate-sensitive diseases — that concerns us,"" said added. ""All these pieces interconnect somehow: climate-sensitive diseases, water and food insecurity, malnutrition related to drought or micronutrients or salinity coming into crops."" She's seen certain diseases move into areas that hadn't faced them before, leaving some local doctors unable to adequately treat patients. ""There are already so many vulnerabilities, so what's to come?"" she said. While not all weather events are a result of climate change, climate change can exacerbate them. It upsets a delicately balanced Earth system. And scientists are getting better at teasing out weather from the changing climate, improving attribution.  But, without curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the future contains a lot of upheaval and big impacts on people's lives. ""No area will be immune from it,"" Phillips said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-2019-1.5427586,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ice-free-arctic-1.5291966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/blackrock-investment-climate-change-1.5426465,N/A

324,Kerry Campbell,2019-06-11T22:00:00.098Z,"Medical society, government discuss changes to doctor recruitment on P.E.I.","It's an issue that all four political parties agreed on in the recent P.E.I. election — the province needs to change its approach to physician recruitment, and doctors themselves need to play a more active role in recruiting their peers. And while the group that represents Island doctors has referred to a looming ""crisis"" with regard to the number of doctors working in the province, both the Medical Society of P.E.I. and government say talks about a new recruitment model are in ""early days."" President of the medical society Dr. David Bannon suggested a new recruitment model might involve ""a complete contracting to the Medical Society of Prince Edward Island to take responsibility for doing recruiting,"" or see the society working ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" with government staff currently involved in physician recruitment. Referring to a medical society survey of Island doctors that found more than half are planning to leave, retire, or scale back their practices over the next five years, Bannon said, ""I don't like to overuse the word crisis, but I think that is equivalent to an incredible challenge."" ""Half of our workforce is going to diminish within five years.… The recruitment process probably needs to be overhauled because of the challenges we're looking at."" P.E.I.'s new Minister of Health and Wellness James Aylward said based on early discussions with the society he's ""extremely optimistic that this collaborative approach is going to bear fruit."" But he said no specific plan has been identified to give doctors a more active role in recruiting colleagues to fill positions on P.E.I. ""Right now everything's on the table to be honest,"" Aylward said, acknowledging approaches could involve providing information packages for doctors to use in recruitment efforts, or offering financial incentives to doctors who help fill positions. As of Tuesday, there were 13,586 people registered on the province's patient registry waiting to be assigned a new family doctor. That's equivalent to roughly one of every 11 Island residents. Aylward said the province has recruited 13 new doctors so far in 2019 and four of those have already arrived and started practising. But he said government hasn't yet fulfilled one commitment made by the Progressive Conservatives during the spring election campaign: to increase the number of positions for family doctors on P.E.I. According to government the current complement is 94 full-time equivalent positions. The PCs promised to increase that to 100. ""That's something we're reviewing right now. There's a process that needs to go through,"" Aylward said. According to that process, a body known as the physician resource planning committee makes recommendations to the minister on the number of family doctors and specialists P.E.I. should have, as well as where those positions should be located. The committee includes representatives from Health PEI and the Medical Society of P.E.I. ""We know that there's a need already"" for more family doctors, Aylward said. ""We just have to look at the patient registry."" But Aylward said there was no timeline as to when the committee might deliver a recommendation on new positions for family doctors. The medical society says the province needs to move beyond filling doctor vacancies and come up with a plan that outlines what physicians and services will be required five or 10 years into the future. ""We've never had a comprehensive physician resource plan that looked at what our critical needs are in the system, not just physician workforce, but also what's the appropriate menu of services?"" said Bannon. ""Currently we're trapped in a situation where we're always just trying to fill vacancies. We're always trying to keep up with the same services and respond to those crises. We need to get ahead of it and find a plan that's going to work for Islanders going forward."" Aylward said government will start on that work by looking at succession planning, based on the medical society's concerns about the number of doctors planning to retire. ""We really need to drill down there and identify how soon doctors are retiring, what areas they're retiring from and then make sure that we're allocating the proper resources to the proper areas all across Prince Edward Island,"" said Aylward.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/doctor-recruitment-pei-medical-society-1.5170929,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-doctors-mental-health-1.5135098 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-emergency-room-doctors-shortage-1.5151962 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-doctors-leaving-56-per-cent-1.5091244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-political-leader-family-doctors-1.5093806 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-summerside-harbour-dredging-1.5170751 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-montague-impaired-car-hit-house-1.5170881,N/A
325,"Stephanie Hogan, Benjamin Blum",2020-01-26T04:07:31.983Z,What we know (and don't know) about the new coronavirus outbreak,"The recently identified coronavirus — which has infected more than 1,900 people and left dozens dead in China — has spread beyond its starting point in the central Chinese province of Wuhan to impact other parts of Asia as well as Europe and North America. Canada confirmed its first presumed case on Saturday after health officials in Ontario announced that a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to China had become infected. There have also been cases reported in France, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and Malaysia, as well as Hong Kong and Macao, with most involving people from Wuhan or those who had recently travelled there. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that it's too soon to consider the coronavirus identified in China as an international health emergency — but it could develop into one, the organization's chief said. Here is what we know — and what we don't know — about the virus.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases — such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS was the coronavirus that originated in China in late 2002, and which eventually killed 44 people in Canada and infected more than 400 before the outbreak in China was declared by the WHO to be ""under control"" on Apr. 28, 2004.  The WHO's China office was first informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec. 31, 2019. The cases were all detected in Wuhan City. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the probable cause by Chinese authorities Jan. 7. The WHO reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they pass from animals to humans. But some, like this newly identified strain, can pass directly between humans. Earlier this week, China confirmed there has been human-to-human transmission of the virus. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members. According to the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., coronaviruses are most commonly spread by coughing or sneezing; close personal contact, such as shaking hands; or touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.  The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs. According to the WHO, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. The Canadian government urged travellers on Thursday to ""exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws,"" a notice that is one level below an official travel advisory. Watch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discusses the virus: The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) deems the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan as low. But it has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions, such as avoiding large crowds and high-risk areas such as farms and slaughterhouses, and avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of a coronavirus, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing. PHAC has signs at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, advising travellers from affected areas of the world to inform border services staff of any flu-like symptoms.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. A CDC spokesperson later said the agency is seeking emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow states to use its diagnostic test for the outbreak. Earlier this week, the agency said it expected to see more cases in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago after having already started screening people coming on direct flights from Wuhan at New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. WATCH | How Canadian researchers test for coronavirus: The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people, and there is no vaccine yet for the virus. Analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring. Dr. Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in China, said the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.  ""Even if [cases] are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,"" Galea said. Chinese authorities have moved to lock down multiple cities — including Wuhan, where the train station and airport were shut down and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. In Beijing, officials cancelled major events indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations in the capital. Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world — even in deadly epidemics — because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. The effectiveness of such measures is also unclear. Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. Watch: Tedros explains why the new coronavirus is not a global emergency yet: To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people [Wuhan] is new to science. - Gauden Galea, WHO representative in China. This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person-to-person transmission.  - Dr. Jeremy Farrar, infectious disease specialist. We don't know enough to know whether we should be worried … If this is a virus that can sustain itself in humans now — is transmitted from person to person and lives in humans — then the Lunar New Year travel will spread it faster in China, no doubt. If this is a virus that is not sustainable in human populations, if it doesn't transmit well enough, then the Lunar New Year means we'll see new cases, it will create a lot of concern, but it won't cause problems.  - Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto WATCH: Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital speaks to CBC News about the new coronavirus outbreak. The one piece of good news we have here is that this is possibly not as virulent a virus as SARS and won't result in as many deaths, but almost all the other news we have at the moment is unfortunately bad news … Fourteen medical staff infected from the first 200 cases is quite a high number. But on the other hand, the medical staff are in very close contact with the patients there, they're in the hospital wards and so on. And therefore, they're at greater risk than the general public.  - Dr. Derek Gatherer, Lancaster University",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473 https://www.cbc.ca/news/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5437217 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115,N/A

A fifth deployment of firefighting experts from B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Yukon took off from the Vancouver International Airport on Monday evening, bound for Melbourne.  Once the group touches down, they will be assigned to specific wildfires. Gary Horsman, a wildfire officer from Kamloops, B.C., who will be the group's main liaison on the ground, says Canada is just returning the favour to Australia. ""In 2017 and 2018 [during B.C.'s record-setting wildfire seasons], we had a number of Australians working here and we would have struggled without them,"" Horsman said.  ""The fact that they are reaching out for international assistance would tell you that it's a very serious situation."" The two countries have a history of collaborating to fight fires and, in the past, the transition to being one team has been smooth, said Horsman.  ""The fuel types are different down there but the tactics and strategy used to manage fires are very similar,"" he said.  ""When the people from Australia came here, they integrated into our system pretty seamlessly and we're hoping it's the same when we go down there."" Horsman estimates there are currently more than 70 Canadian firefighters in Australia.  ""Most of the people who are going are more senior staff who typically work on large fires,"" Horsman said.  The wildfires have so far scorched 60,000 square kilometres across Australia's southeast. The fires have killed at least 24 people and destroyed nearly 2,000 homes.  ""They have a very high fire load right now and they're looking for some support so we've been called to go out and help wherever we can,"" said Jesse Earon, an Albertan member of the team heading to Australia.  ""We're returning the favour.""

327,Anonymous,2020-01-17T22:58:29.082Z,"Trump responds to Iran's supreme leader, says he should be 'very careful with his words'","U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be very careful about what he says after Khamenei harshly criticized the United States in a Friday prayers sermon in Tehran. ""The so-called 'Supreme Leader' of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!"" Khamenei struck a defiant tone in his first Friday sermon in Tehran in eight years, calling Trump a ""clown"" who only pretends to support the Iranian people but will ""push a poisonous dagger"" into their backs. Khamenei said the mass funerals for Iran's top general, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike earlier this month, show the Iranian people support the Islamic Republic despite its recent trials. He said the ""cowardly"" killing of Qassem Soleimani had taken out the most effective commander in the battle against ISIS. In response, Iran launched a barrage of ballistic missiles targeting U.S. troops in Iraq, without causing serious injuries. Khamenei said the strike had dealt a ""blow to America's image"" as a superpower. In part of the sermon delivered in Arabic, he said the ""real punishment"" would be in forcing the U.S. to withdraw from the Middle East. As Iran's Revolutionary Guard braced for an American counterattack that never came, it mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport, killing all 176 passengers, including 57 Canadians and dozens of others bound for Canada. Authorities concealed their role in the tragedy for three days, initially blaming the crash on a technical problem. Their admission of responsibility triggered days of street protests, which security forces dispersed with live ammunition and tear gas. Khamenei called the shootdown of the plane a ""bitter accident"" that saddened Iran as much as it made its enemies happy. He said Iran's enemies had seized on the crash to question the Islamic Republic, the Revolutionary Guard and the armed forces. He also lashed out at Western countries, saying they are too weak to ""bring Iranians to their knees."" He said Britain, France and Germany, which this week triggered a dispute mechanism to try to bring Iran back into compliance with the unravelling 2015 nuclear agreement, were ""contemptible"" governments and ""servants"" of the United States. He said Iran was willing to negotiate, but not with the United States. Khamenei has held the country's top office since 1989 and has the final say on all major decisions. The 80-year-old leader openly wept at the funeral of Soleimani and vowed ""harsh retaliation"" against the United States. Thousands of people attended the Friday prayers, occasionally interrupting his speech by chanting ""God is greatest"" and ""Death to America."" Tensions between Iran and the United States have steadily escalated since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which had imposed restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. The U.S. has since imposed crippling sanctions on Iran, including its vital oil and gas industry, pushing the country into an economic crisis that has ignited several waves of sporadic, leaderless protests. Trump has openly encouraged the protesters — even tweeting in Farsi — hoping that the protests and the sanctions will bring about fundamental change in a longtime adversary. After Soleimani was killed, Iran announced it would no longer be bound by the limitations in the nuclear agreement. European countries that have been trying to salvage the deal responded earlier this week by invoking a dispute mechanism that could result in even more sanctions. Khamenei was always skeptical of the nuclear agreement, arguing the United States could not be trusted. But he allowed President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, to conclude the agreement with President Barack Obama. Since Trump's withdrawal, he has repeatedly said there can be no negotiations with the United States. Khamenei last delivered a Friday sermon in February 2012, when he called Israel a ""cancerous tumour"" and vowed to support anyone confronting it. He also warned against any U.S. strikes on Iran over its nuclear program, saying the U.S. would be damaged ""10 times over.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-oman-meeting-1.5430504 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-uranium-enrichmant-nuclear-deal-1.5428896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-justice-crash-ukranian-arrests-1.5426809,N/A

She teaches English at Cathedral High School, one of the 35 schools in the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board on strike Tuesday in the province-wide Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) protest amid stalled negotiations with the Ford government. ""My boys are 11 and eight-years-old, they go to elementary school and they're upset to be home today, they love to go to school, so it's hard,"" she says. ""It's important their future comes first."" She and dozens of teachers, dressed in snug coats, toques and gloves, quietly shuffled on the sidewalk around Cathedral in small groups with baby blue signs and flags with messages like ""class size matters."" Along Wentworth Street North, King Street East and Wilson Street drivers in cars, vans and transport trucks honked their horns in noisy support of Hamilton's striking teachers. Staff responded with whistles, waves, whoops and hollers. Joe Cappadocia, an English teacher at the school for 22 years, says the main issues revolve around growing class sizes and more e-learning, which teachers say will cause students grief. ""Our teachers' learning conditions are your students' learning conditions, in that if you have a student in a class with 30, 35, 40 students, they're not going to get the service they deserve,"" he says.  He and other teachers say the provincial government hasn't been bargaining, with teachers claiming the talks with the OECTA broke down early last week. ""Please come to the table, we want to work with you, we want to reach a deal, we want to get back in our classrooms because we love what we do,' Trofimencoff says. ""Doug Ford, please come back to the table. Use your common sense."" Premier Doug Ford and Education Minister Stephen Lecce say compensation is the primary sticking point.  Last November, the PCs passed a bill that caps public sector yearly wage increases at one per cent for the next three years. Multiple unions have launched legal challenges to the legislation.  Ford said last week he has no intention of reconsidering the wage increase limit.  Lecce said the strikes have ""imposed hardship on parents in this province."" ""We owe it to the students of this province to not withdraw services from them and ensure there is a continuum of learning,"" he told reporters Monday afternoon.  ""I think kids are clearly paying the price because of the continuous, union-led escalation."" But Mark Dineen, who teaches English, philosophy and sociology at Cathedral, also points to previous OSAP cuts, which he says have hurt local students. ""In the heart of downtown Hamilton, we're in one of the code red areas and we have kids as smart as any kids anywhere but with the cuts to OSAP, some of them are going to have a hard time going to university or college,"" he says. ""Grade 12 students applying right now aren't sure they'll be able to afford to go."" One parent and child greeted Cathedral teachers with cookies, thanking them for their efforts. Mario Fidanza retired from the school four years ago after teaching math for 36 years, but also showed up to pour hot coffee for his former colleagues, some of whom were his former students. ""There are people in the public who don't support them, but where do you drop your kids off? They're lost without teachers,"" he told CBC News. And he also has a message for the province. ""Spend a couple days in the schools, in the shoes of a teacher, and then you might have a different opinion,"" Findanza says. The Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario also plan to hold a one-day strike on Thursday, which will affect teachers in Niagara public schools.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/catholic-school-strikes-hamilton-1.5434486,[],N/A

330,Katherine Steinhoff,2019-08-19T08:00:00.796Z,"Like you, I never thought the opioid crisis would knock at my door. Then it came for my son","My introduction to the opioid crisis began at a distance.  I watched the overdose death toll rise in British Columbia, which seemed to be the epicentre of the trouble, and then in other provinces. The crisis got perceptibly closer to home about two and a half years ago, when two local teenagers in Ottawa fatally overdosed. Shortly after, it got near enough to stab me in the heart. On February 25, 2017, my 24-year-old son Simon died of an accidental opioid overdose. I made him coffee that morning and put it on a small table beside the couch in the basement where he had spent the night. He never got a chance to drink that coffee — or live a full life, as we somehow expect our children to do. For the record, I had not seen this catastrophe coming. I didn't think my son was likely to use opioids, let alone fatally overdose. However, the risk to young adults was obviously on my mind due to the nearby teen fatalities, because I texted Simon the day before he died to say ""Thank you for not ODing on opioids.""  Yeah, I know. This was a strange and stupid thing to write, for so many reasons, and it haunts me. I suppose it was my clumsy way of raising a few issues. I had hoped to talk to my son about the poor teens, but I never got the chance. And now my life has been upended by this crisis. My heart broken. Like so many others. Opioid crisis spreads beyond Canada and U.S. to Europe, OECD says Naloxone distribution questions need answers amid Canada's opioid crisis As with others who suffer this kind of loss, I also wonder how I got here. What happened? My family doesn't know much about what Simon was doing that fateful night. However, we have reason to believe it was his first time taking opioids. We also think he was self-medicating.  Simon suffered from anxiety and depression. He had been on anti-anxiety medication for about eight years and in counselling for a few months. My partner and I were happy that our son was finally seeking additional help for his mental health issues, but we later learned he was also being treated for a cocaine dependency. You should know: I hesitate to mention the cocaine because I suspect it will mean a number of you will draw less-than-kind conclusions about my son. Many people see those with drug addictions as weak, less than, and not worthy of our compassion.  Drug users know people judge them. They understand there is a stigma attached to what they do, and so, they often hide it from us. Sadly, this means that many of our loved ones end up dying alone in basements, as Simon did, without the help of family, friends and life-saving medications such as Naloxone.  ""Not my loved ones,"" you might be thinking, and I hope you're right. It's certainly easier to believe, as I once did, that the opioid crisis is some far-off threat, like a flood or fire in another province. The reality is that it may be bigger and closer than many of us want to admit. As then-Health Minister Jane Philpott noted back in 2017, the opioid death toll is worse than the body count from any infectious epidemic since the Spanish flu, which killed about 50,000 people in Canada about a century ago. It is higher than at the peak of the AIDS pandemic in 1995 and significantly greater than the 44 lives lost during the 2003 SARS contagion. On average, someone dies from an opioid-related overdose every two hours. Put another way, 12 people in our country die each day. On a yearly basis, the numbers are staggering and on the rise. There were 4,460 opioid-related deaths in 2018, 360 more than in 2017 and 1,443 more than in 2016. The total for the last three years alone is almost 11,600, which suggests we are well on our way to hitting the halfway mark for Spanish flu losses in another three years or so. With a crisis of this magnitude, you would expect an all-hands-on-deck response from governments. But most politicians, with a few exceptions, seem to be sleepwalking through this nightmare. One — Ontario Premier Doug Ford — has even made matters worse by pulling funding from a number of the safe consumption sites, which demonstrably save lives.  If our elected leaders have been slow to act or have acted badly, it isn't because they are baffled about potential solutions. They know that Portugal has dramatically reduced overdose fatalities by decriminalizing all drug use and adopting policies that treat addiction like a public health challenge, rather than a shameful criminal condition. They also know that legal regulation could provide a safer drug supply and reduce the mortality rate. And yet many of our elected representatives have been reluctant to consider — or even discuss — these measures. To my mind, it seems like politicians are afraid to upset those who think, erroneously, that it is coddling and enabling to treat drug users with anything short of criminal punishment. These politicians don't want to be seen as ""soft"" or ""weak,"" even though the solutions are right there. I get it. No politician likes to upset voters.  How Europe's heroin capital solved its overdose crisis As opioid crisis rages, former Hamilton drug user launches overdose support group But isn't saving lives more important than pandering to the electorate? Shouldn't we at least have an adult conversation about how to better tackle the largest public health emergency of our lifetime?  The opioid crisis should be a major issue in the upcoming federal election, and it will say something dire about political parties and voters if it is not.  Dr. Thomas Kerr from the BC Centre on Substance Use put it starkly in an interview with the Globe and Mail earlier this year: ""To continue to accept the rate of death that's occurring now is, I think, immoral, and people will look back on us and judge us harshly for our inaction."" It's fair comment. Our inaction is an epic failure. And I often wonder what it's going to take to overcome our inertia and indifference. I fear the answer is many more deaths, including dreadful possibilities for plenty of us. Please trust me when I tell you that you don't want to let this disaster come knocking. You don't want it getting any closer than it already is. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

331,Anonymous,2019-12-19T12:16:19.691Z,"NDP questions P3s after North Battleford, Yellowknife hospitals use same contractor, have similar issues","The provincial opposition wants more information on the Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford after problems have been uncovered at a hospital in Yellowknife with links to the facility. CBC News reported in October that there were serious problems, including water leaks and mould issues, at Stanton Territorial Hospital in Yellowknife. Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford has also been plagued with issues, including needing a roof replacement and issues with the building's drinking water system — which was deemed unsafe to drink due to high levels of lead or copper. Both facilities are public-private partnership projects (sometimes called P3s) once headed up by British company Carillion PLC, which had the contract to maintain both hospitals for 30 years. In 2018, Carillion went into liquidation and the contracts were picked up by other companies. NDP health critic Vicki Mowat said it's concerning to see another facility linked to Carillion having issues. ""We see the same contractor being involved in the process, sort of the same timeline we're looking at here,"" said Mowat. In October, a third-party audit of the Saskatchewan hospital project was triggered. A request for proposals on the audit was sent out last week. Mowat said the opposition has been receiving information on the North Battleford facility through people who work there. ""We've been sort of relying on rumours,"" she said. ""People speaking out quietly because they're afraid of what the repercussions will be for their employment."" SNC-Lavalin was eventually chosen to take over as the facility manager of Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford. In Yellowknife, a company called Dexterra took over the project. The Saskatchewan hospital project was built by a group called Access Prairies Partnership (APP), a coalition that included Graham Design Partners, Gracorp Capital Advisors and WSP Canada. Mowat also criticized the P3 process, calling for a Sask.-first procurement plan be brought in. ""I think there's a responsibility to the public of the province when we have local companies involved,"" said Mowat. ""When we look at the quality and the responsibility and the the accountability of having local folks involved."" SaskBuilds said that since creating the new Single Procurement Service in April, it has been involved in awarding over 250 procurements valued at over $148 million.  ""It is also important to remember that public procurement is subject to various interprovincial, national and international trade agreements, and that shutting out suppliers from outside Saskatchewan would most likely be viewed as a trade violation,"" said spokesperson Lisa Danyluk. The third-party construction audit will review the quality of materials, equipment, labour and workmanship used during building. It's expected to be completed sometime in the spring. As well, a process review will look at whether the project adhered to terms in the agreement and use those lessons to apply to future major projects. While costs for any repairs for the building will be absorbed by APP, Mowat said problems at the Saskatchewan hospital have been very disruptive to clients and staff. ""[The hospital] isn't fully open,"" she said. ""We aren't accepting new patients. There are patients who have been displaced. And when you think about the types of vulnerable people in that hospital, there is a huge cost to those patients and their families having to relocate them."" The Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford formally opened to patients in March and cost $407 million. In November, 67 per cent of the Saskatchewan Hospital's non-secure units were occupied, with the 24-bed admissions unit not in use.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/ndp-problems-north-battleford-hospital-carillion-1.5401197,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/stanton-nwt-hospital-mould-patient-risk-1.5340165 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/roof-replacement-sask-hospital-north-battleford-1.5147542 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/cupe-concerns-saska-hospital-1.5354293,N/A
332,Nicole Mortillaro,2017-08-24T15:55:27.983Z,Telescope captures most detailed image of any star beyond the sun,"Astronomers have imaged the surface and atmosphere of a star that lies 550 light-years from Earth. It is the most detailed image of a star other than our own sun. Antares is a red supergiant — about 700 times larger than our sun — that lies in the southern constellation of Scorpius. The star is in its death throes and shedding material into space. Eventually, it will explode as a brilliant supernova and will shine brightly in our night sky. Red supergiants — stars that are more than 10 times more massive than the sun — are the largest stars in our universe, though they don't live long. Using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at the Paranal Observatory in Chile, astronomers were able to map the star's surface and measure the motions of its surface material, giving them better insight into how the gases around a red supergiant move. The telescope is a combination of four moveable, 1.8-metre telescopes that collect images taken in near-infrared wavelengths. What they found was disorder. ""Antares is losing material not in a smooth or ordered way,"" lead author of the paper published in the journal Nature, Keiichi Ohnaka, told CBC News. ""But the velocity maps show that it's very clumpy and turbulent and random. We don't know what the mechanism is behind this turbulent motion."" The image shows two brighter regions, which astronomers believe may be an area that has exposed the warmer gas below the surface of Antares. They believe that some clumps are energetic enough that they move faster and eventually escape the star. But the mapping doesn't answer all their questions. ""We still don't know what is really pushing the material, but at least we know how it's losing it,"" Ohnaka said. Now that the astronomers have shown that they are able to image distant stars (for the VLTI, they must be bright and somewhat large), they hope to move toward uncovering the mechanisms that drive the expulsion of gas in these dying stars, as it's so poorly understood. ""What we see is just a mess, chaos,"" Ohnaka said. This is what interests him the most and something he looks forward to exploring in depth. Betelgeuse, a star in the constellation Orion with a radius 1,400 times that of our sun, is another red supergiant that is a ticking time bomb. While there's debate over exactly when it'll happen, it's anticipated that it will go supernova within a few thousand years, the blink of an eye in astronomical terms.  Astronomers first produced an image of it in 2009. This June, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile produced the highest resolution photograph ever. If either of these stars goes supernova, they pose no threat to Earth.  Ohnaka said that they already have their next target: R Doradus, a star located in the constellation Dorado in the southern hemisphere. Unlike Antares, this star is similar to our own sun, which is too small to explode as a supernova. Instead, it will swell and turn into a red giant (not supergiant) and then expel most of its gases into space until it is a mere shell of its former self, a white dwarf. ""This new technique opens a new window to observe stars, like we observe the sun,"" Ohnaka said.     ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/telescope-best-image-star-antares-1.4259308,[],N/A

But the newly elected Ontario MP insists that won't hold him back in the Conservative leadership race. ""Let's say you had someone who had the cabinet experience ... but they're kind of boring and their ideas are same-old, versus someone who has bold ideas and is more engaging,"" he said. ""I would say the playing field would be almost level at that point."" The Belleville, Ont.-area MP is the second member of Conservative caucus to announce he's running for the leadership; MP Marilyn Gladu is also running. And while they haven't officially announced, both Erin O'Toole and Pierre Poilievre are organizing leadership campaigns and are expected to make their bids official in the coming days. Businessman Rick Peterson announced Wednesday he would make another attempt for the party leadership. He finished 12th in a 14-person race in 2017. Former interim leader Rona Ambrose, meanwhile, put an end to speculation about her interest in the job today, confirming in a Facebook post that she will not run. Sloan, a lawyer and former small business owner, said he has a list of ""30, 40 bold ideas on anything conceivable that I've been able to come up with,"" including tax cuts and poverty among seniors. But he said he won't reveal any of them until the leadership campaign is officially underway. Sloan said he identifies as a social conservative — but doesn't want to typecast himself as the race's designated so-con candidate. ""I'm not running specially to only make a point on those areas, although I am a social conservative and I have opinions,"" he said. Still, Sloan argues there's a legal vacuum on abortion in Canada and Canadians deserve to see the issue debated by their representatives. The Conservative Party's constitution doesn't allow a Conservative government to bring forward a bill on abortion, he said — so any change would have to come from an individual MP putting forward a private member's bill. ""Bring on the discussion, bring on the debate,"" he said. Unlike many members of the Conservative caucus, Sloan said that while he favours balanced budgets, a return to balance would not be his priority as Conservative leader. ""I'm more of a 'build the right structure and things will take care of themselves' [candidate],"" he said. The right tax cuts and economic policy would create an economy robust enough to drive the federal budget toward balance, he said. ""I got into politics for one reason, and that is to make the Conservative party the dominant force in the country,"" he said, adding the party can't rely on being Canadians' first alternative ""when the Liberals mess up."" That can be achieved, he said, if the Conservatives have ""bold platforms on everything.""

He did agree to answer one question from CBC News in French; he stumbled during his response, then laughed and described it as ""vaguely intelligible."" Sloan said he considers himself ""officially"" in the race, although he's still completing the paperwork and collecting the members' signatures required by the party. The Conservative Party's first deadline — when candidates have to come up with $25,000 and 1,000 signatures from party members — is Feb 27. Sloan insisted he's in for the long haul.

336,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2019-05-21T21:46:56.202Z,Snow crab industry gets $2M to find ways to reduce right whale entanglements,"The snow crab industry in northern New Brunswick is getting more than $2 million over three years to implement a series of initiatives designed to reduce the risk of endangered North Atlantic right whales becoming entangled in fishing gear. The Acadian Crabbers' Association will research and test technologies, such as breakaway gear and ropeless buoys, the federal and New Brunswick governments announced on Tuesday in Shippagan. Hydrophones will also be used to help track the whales. ""It is imperative to balance preservation of this endangered species with the social, cultural and economic importance of the snow crab fishery in this region,"" provincial Tourism, Heritage and Culture Minister Robert Gauvin said in a statement, on behalf of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Minister Ross Wetmore. ""Many families and communities depend on the snow crab fishery for employment. Co-existence with minimal impact to the North Atlantic right whale population must be achieved."" The announcement comes just two months after the Marine Stewardship Council extended the suspension of its ""sustainable"" fishing certification for New Brunswick crab products by another year. Although there were no reported deaths of North Atlantic right whales in the Gulf of St. Lawrence last year after the federal government implemented widespread fishing closures and shipping-speed limits, three whales were found entangled in snow crab gear. There are only about 411 North Atlantic right whales left in the world, the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium estimated last fall. Researchers have reported seeing at least seven calves off the southern U.S. coast, where the mammals spend their winters before coming to Canada, compared to zero last year, buoying hope about the endangered species' survival. But for the snow crab industry to be recertified, it must show scientific evidence that its fishing activities will not hurt whale recovery efforts. The council suspended the industry's certification last year after 12 right whales were found dead in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2017. Necropsies on seven of those whales found at least two of the deaths were linked to entanglements, while four died from trauma consistent with vessel collisions. Robert Haché, executive director of the Acadian Crabbers' Association, could not immediately be reached for comment. The three-year project was approved for funding in April 2018, but formally announced on Tuesday. Fishermen began testing ropeless traps last year using two different methods — one based on acoustic release and another that uses an inflatable buoy. Both use sonar to track and communicate with the traps. Traditional crab traps or pots are loaded with bait and lowered to the ocean floor with a rope and buoy attached to mark their location on the surface. Right whales tend to spend a lot of time at the surface — coming up to breathe, feed and socialize, so this slack line creates a risk of entanglement, officials have said. The Association des Pêcheurs Professionnels Crabiers Acadiens and the New Brunswick Crabiers du Nord-Est will support the Acadian Crabbers' Association with developing and testing the new technologies. The initiatives will also help raise awareness among harvesters about the impact of fishing gear, officials said. ""It is imperative to be able to adapt to change to ensure the healthy sustainability of our industry, respect for our marine environment and also to protect the jobs generated by the fishing industry,"" said Acadie-Bathurst MP Serge Cormier, who attended the announcement on behalf of federal Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Fisheries and Oceans Canada announced a season-long area closure for snow crab and lobster fisheries in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, effective April 28. The so-called static zone is about 63 per cent smaller than last year. It covers the area where the highest concentration of whales was observed during the peak of the 2018 fishing season. If a right whale is seen in waters between 10 and 20 fathoms, harvesters will be required to move their gear and fish in waters less than 10 fathoms. If a right what is seen in waters less than 10 fathoms, a temporary closure would effectively close the area to the shoreline. The Fisheries Department also reintroduced mandatory speed restrictions for vessels 20 metres or longer to a maximum of 10 knots when travelling in the western gulf. The funding for the initiatives announced Tuesday comes from the Atlantic Fisheries Fund, which is jointly funded by Ottawa and the region's provincial governments. It was established in 2017 to help the seafood sector transition to meet growing market demands for products that are high quality and sustainably sourced. The fund will invest more than $400 million in projects over the seven-year life of the program to support Canada's fish and seafood sector.  Applications are accepted from the commercial fisheries and aquaculture industry, Indigenous groups, universities and academia and industry associations and organizations, including research institutions.

338,Anonymous,2019-07-25T20:09:34.583Z,Tapeworm in coyotes that can cause fatal tumours in people 'has spread all over Alberta',"The European strain of a tiny tapeworm that can make people seriously ill and even kill them is now common in wildlife throughout Alberta, Calgary researchers say. The research was published in a letter in the New England Journal of Medicine. The research, led by the University of Calgary's faculty of veterinary medicine,  found that the parasitic tapeworm called Echinococcus multilocularis is now prevalent in Western Canada, after being first spotted there in 2012 and long common in Europe. The first human case in Canada of a tumour-like disease caused by the tapeworm, human alveolar echinococcosis (AE), was diagnosed in 2013. Dr. Claudia Klein, one of the study's authors, said her lab now has DNA samples from most of the 14 people in Canada who have been diagnosed to date with the potentially fatal parasite. ""If you're exposed to the tapeworm eggs, you can become infected with it,"" she said. ""The problem is, you won't really notice for years later that you're infected, and then your liver will be infiltrated by tumour-like lesions from that tapeworm."" If the disease isn't discovered and treated, the mortality rate is 90 per cent, Klein said. ""So for humans, it's a very serious condition.""  Klein said experts had assumed until recently that cases of AE were not showing up in North America because the strain of tapeworm on this continent is not as virulent to people. ""But the story has really changed dramatically over the past five years,"" she said.  Klein says her lab is now finding, overwhelming, the European strain when researchers examine coyote feces and rodent livers. ""So, that was a very surprising finding,"" she said. Klein collaborated on the research with Dr. Alessandro Massolo, who was teaching wildlife health ecology at the U of C and is now at the University of Pisa in Italy, and with Dr. Kinga Kowalewska-Grochowska of the University of Alberta.  It's believed the strain has been arriving in Canada in dogs that are brought over from Europe, and in foxes that were imported decades ago for hunting. Infected foxes and coyotes shed the tapeworm's eggs in their feces, which are eaten by small rodents such as deer mice and voles. In those animals, which are considered intermediate hosts, the eggs become larvae that form in large cysts. The cysts eventually kill the rodent or render it vulnerable to prey. If those preying animals are coyotes or foxes, the larvae they ingest become adult tapeworms, closing the circle. Dogs can get the parasite in turn through contact with infected coyote or fox feces or by eating infected dead rodents. The worms can be passed on to people on fruit, by handling contaminated soil or through an infected dog's fur, which can be contaminated with worm eggs too small to see. The human form of the disease develops slowly over several years and causes multiplying lesions in the body, usually in the liver. ""This evidence is the smoking gun that these AE cases are locally acquired, and they are caused by an invasive strain coming from Europe that has spread all over Alberta,"" said co-author Dr. Alessandro Massolo.

340,Anonymous,2019-11-24T18:25:39.357Z,'No excitement at all' as oilpatch interest wanes for drilling rights auctions,"A key indicator of future oil and gas drilling activity in Western Canada is sliding lower as the industry deals with a lack of pipeline capacity, Alberta oil production curtailments and difficulty accessing capital markets. Sales of Crown drilling rights — needed to allow energy exploration on land where mineral rights are held by the province — have fallen off dramatically in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan this year. ""When drilling rights are going well, it tends to mean somebody has found either a good reservoir or a good way to produce a known reservoir and so you get a lot of excitement,"" said Richard Masson, an executive fellow with the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary. ""This says to me, there's no excitement at all right now. People are doing little bits of infill land buying but there's nothing that looks like a very prospective play that would excite the industry and excite new capital to come in."" In Alberta, which produces about 80 per cent of Canada's oil and about 70 per cent of its natural gas, twice monthly auctions are on track for a record low with two sales left to go in 2019. Through 11 months, the province has raised $100 million by selling rights on 616,000 hectares. The current low mark was set in 2016, when $137 million was paid for the rights to drill on 937,000 hectares, the lowest since the auction system was adopted in 1977. The high was in 2011, when a bidding frenzy for lands for the Duvernay underground oil-bearing formation resulted in $3.5 billion spent to buy rights on 4.1 million hectares. In British Columbia, land auctions have delivered $64 million so far this year, down from $173 million last year but ahead of $18 million and $15 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The record high year was 2008, when $2.66 billion was spent. In Saskatchewan, sales of drilling rights have raised about $22 million in five auctions, down from $51 million in six auctions last year. The province's record year was also 2008, when it raised $1.1 billion. Industry insiders say the declines are mainly due to the lack of new pipeline capacity to allow more oil and gas production, and the resulting loss of confidence by investors that has starved the sector of debt and equity funding. Production limits in Alberta imposed by the government to better align supply with pipeline capacity are another overhang on activity. ""The mood is very cautious. People are feeling very beat up,"" said Grant Fagerheim, CEO of Whitecap Resources Inc., in an interview. At Whitecap, as with many other mid-sized Calgary producers, using scarce dollars to buy land for future drilling and then spending more on the exploration required to retain the lease is way down on the priority list, he said, below maintaining a dividend, reducing debt and buying back shares. ""Companies just don't have budget to acquire new lands. Nobody is exploring for new plays or new ideas, or very few people are,"" said Brad Hayes, a geologist and president of Petrel Robertson Consulting in Calgary. Drilling rights auction prices fell sharply after global oil prices bottomed out in 2016, which convinced some bargain hunters to nominate land and make bids in hopes there would be a bounce back, he said. But conditions haven't improved. The trend to lower interest in drilling rights auctions is welcomed by environmentalists like Keith Stewart of Greenpeace Canada, who said in an email it is a sign that the ""era of ever-growing demand for oil"" is over. In B.C., much of the prime land has been snapped up by producers, leaving less to be nominated for auction, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources who asked not to be identified. He said some land is not available for development because of government processes around caribou recovery and land and environment planning assessments in northeastern B.C. The Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors recently predicted just nine more wells will be drilled in Canada in 2020 compared with this year, taking the total number to 4,905, less than half the 11,226 wells drilled in 2014. Meanwhile, the S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index, which tracks share values of major Canadian oil and gas producers, has fallen by about 15 per cent over the past year, reflecting investor distaste for the sector. But Whitecap's Fagerheim says there's hope for the industry if Canada can get pipelines built, a task he says will require concerted effort from everyone involved to educate the rest of Canada on the virtues of the oilpatch. ""I think it's as simple as that. Make commitments, live by those commitments. Remove those delays and the regulatory processes that inhibit us from getting our products to market. ""And I think we can get the enthusiasm back.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/crown-drilling-rights-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-oil-1.5371524,[],N/A
341,Shane Magee,2019-10-10T08:00:00.577Z,"Moncton issues $213M in building permits, nearly beating 2017 record","Moncton's skyline is riddled with a multitude of cranes, a reflection of the growing activity in the municipal planning department.  The city has issued $213 million in building permits over the first nine months of the year, just shy of the record-setting $215 million for the same time period in 2017. ""Certainly the City of Moncton has been building momentum in the area of commercial activity over the last four years — in fact the past four years have been some of our most successful,"" said Kevin Silliker, Moncton's director of economic development.  Downtown, two hotels are rising a block apart. Farther down Main Street, a mixed-use six-storey building is underway on former CN railway land. On St. George Street, an apartment building is replacing a former gas station. But work is underway in many parts of the city, from industrial parks to residential areas like the north end where a new YMCA is underway. Building permits, required when constructing or changing a structure, are traditionally used as an indicator of a community's economic growth.  City staff have told council two per cent growth in the tax base would still leave the city with a deficit of $324,000 next year. Staff have warned that means no additional spending if the city wants to avoid cutting services or raising taxes. If the assessed value of property in the city increases closer to 2.5 or three per cent, the projected deficit turns into a surplus, presentations to city council have shown. ""The more commercial and or residential activity we have, the better financial position the city of Moncton will be in,"" Silliker said. The figures also are a hopeful sign for the city's finances. The city makes revenue off permits. But new construction tends to increase the city's tax base, which leads to more revenue from property taxes.  The city has also expanded a downtown development incentive program seeking to lure more investment. Several of the large projects that broke ground this year were approved to use that system, including Tannery Place South and a new hotel on Highfield Street.  In June, Westmount Developments Inc. president Vaughn MacLellan celebrated the start of construction of the  46-apartment building with ground floor commercial along Vaughan Harvey Boulevard. MacLellan also announced a second, similar building would start at the site next spring.  MacLellan said the the Avenir Centre, which opened a year ago, is helping drive growth.  ""With the completion of the centre and what's now happening around it, I think it's clearly evident the centre is a strategic investment and an anchor for revitalizing and transforming the downtown and creating an urban core critical for the city's future economic success,"" MacLellan said.  The city hoped the project would result in $108 million in new downtown assessment by 2023. Silliker said so far, there's been about $72 million.  Silliker said investments reflect low office and apartment vacancy rates. He said permits have been issued this year for 13 apartment buildings.  The latest quarter — July, August and September — saw several large permits issued: The figures the city released this week account for the first nine months of the year. The 12-month total for 2018 was $222.6 million, $243.4 million in 2017 and $241 million in 2016 — a year that included the Avenir Centre. The lowest recent year was $123 million in 2014. Silliker said this year's overall total may beat a previous record if a permit is issued for a project on Cameron Street. Council has green-lit plans to expand a building on the corner of Cameron and Gordon and convert it from office space to residential. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-construction-permits-development-1.5315065,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-rail-history-redevelopment-1.5164794 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-council-downtown-development-1.4949560 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-greater-moncton-riverview-dieppe-1.5093986,N/A
342,Anonymous,2019-12-31T12:33:03.321Z,"Firearms instructor, 71, took out gunman at Texas church service, officials say","Alarms went off in Jack Wilson's head the moment a man wearing a hat, long coat and wig walked into a Texas church for Sunday services. By the time the man approached a communion server and pulled out a shotgun, Wilson and another security volunteer were already reaching for their own guns. The attacker shot the other volunteer, Richard White, and then the server, Anton ""Tony"" Wallace, sending congregants scrambling for cover. The gunman was heading toward the front of the sanctuary as Wilson searched for a clear line of fire. ""I didn't have a clear window because I had members that were jumping, going chaotic,"" said Wilson, a 71-year-old firearms instructor who has also been a reserve sheriff's deputy. ""They were standing up. I had to wait about half a second, a second, to get my shot. I fired one round. The subject went down."" Wilson's single shot quickly ended the attack that killed Wallace, 64, and White, 67, at the West Freeway Church of Christ in the Fort Worth-area town of White Settlement. He said the entire confrontation was over in no more than six seconds. More than 240 congregants were in the church at the time. ""The only clear shot I had was his head because I still had people in the pews that were not all the way down as low as they could. That was my one shot,"" Wilson said Monday from his home in nearby Granbury. As Wilson approached the fallen attacker, he noticed five or six other members of the volunteer security team he had trained with their guns drawn. Wilson said they had their eyes on the man since he arrived. During the service, White and Wilson had stationed themselves at the back of the church, watching him. The Texas Department of Public Safety on Monday identified the attacker as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43. His motive is under investigation. Speaking outside the church Monday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said authorities ""can't prevent mental illness from occurring, and we can't prevent every crazy person from pulling a gun. But we can be prepared like this church was."" Britt Farmer, senior minister of the church, said, ""We lost two great men today, but it could have been a lot worse."" Wilson described the attacker's gun as a short-barrelled 12-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip. Shotguns with barrels less than 18 inches long are restricted under U.S. federal law and can be legally owned in Texas only if they are registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. After the shooting, Texas officials in hailing the state's gun laws, including a measure enacted this year that affirmed the right of licensed handgun holders to carry a weapon in places of worship, unless the facility bans them. U.S. President Donald Trump also tweeted his appreciation for the state's gun legislation Monday night, saying, ""Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"" That law was passed in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in Texas history, which was also at a church. In the 2017 massacre at First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, a man who opened fire on a Sunday morning congregation killed more than two dozen people. He later killed himself. Isabel Arreola told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that she sat near the gunman and she had never seen him before the service. She said he appeared to be wearing a disguise and he made her uncomfortable. ""I was so surprised because I did not know that so many in the church were armed,"" she said. Sunday's shooting was the second attack on a religious gathering in the U.S. in less than 24 hours. On Saturday night, a man stabbed five people as they celebrated Hanukkah in an Orthodox Jewish community north of New York City. Wallace's daughter, Tiffany Wallace, told Dallas TV station KXAS that her father was a deacon at the church. ""I ran toward my dad, and the last thing I remember is him asking for oxygen. And I was just holding him, telling him I loved him and that he was going to make it,"" Wallace said. ""You just wonder why? How can someone so evil, the devil, step into the church and do this,"" she said. White's daughter-in-law, Misty York White, called him a hero on Facebook: ""You stood up against evil and sacrificed your life. Many lives were saved because of your actions. You have always been a hero to us but the whole world is seeing you as a hero now. We love you, we miss you, we are heartbroken."" The FBI was working to determine the shooter's motive. Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas office, Matthew DeSarno, said the assailant was ""relatively transient"" but had roots in the area. Paxton said Monday that the shooter appeared to be ""more of a loner."" ""I don't think he had a lot of connections to very many people,"" he said. Investigators searched Kinnunen's home in River Oaks, a small nearby city where police said the department's only contact with the suspected gunman was a couple of traffic citations. But Kinnunen appeared to have more serious brushes in other jurisdictions. He was arrested in 2009 on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in Fort Worth and in 2013 for theft, according to Tarrant County court records. He was arrested in 2016 in New Jersey after police allegedly found him with a 12-gauge shotgun and rounds wrapped in plastic in the area of an oil refinery, according to the Central New Jersey Home News in East Brunswick. It was not immediately clear how those charges were resolved. In a 2009 affidavit requesting a court-appointed attorney, Kinnunen listed having a wife and was living with four children, according to court records. He told the court he was self-employed in landscaping and irrigation work. White Settlement's website says it was named by local Native Americans in the 1800s for white families then settling in the area. City leaders who worried that the name detracted from the city's image proposed renaming it in 2005, but voters overwhelmingly rejected the idea. Wilson said the church started the security team about 18 months ago after they moved to a new building and became concerned about crime in the area. Wilson has been a firearms instructor since 1995, spent six years in the Army National Guard and was a Hood County reserve deputy. He said some of the security team members he trained were at first even afraid to touch a firearm. ""We were aware that it could happen. Most team members there didn't feel like it would happen, but we were prepared if it did,"" he said. Wilson said the congregation is a close-knit group. ""I don't feel like I killed a human. I killed an evil,"" he said. ""That's how I'm coping with the situation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/texas-church-parishioners-kill-man-1.5410404,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/texas-church-shooting-1.4388516 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-mass-shootings-2019-1.5409771 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ny-hannukah-stabbing-suspect-1.5410480,N/A
343,Jason Proctor,2020-01-22T00:41:16.174Z,Judge questions defence logic as Meng Wanzhou extradition hearing continues,"Questions about loss, risk, fraud and the implications of sanctions violations filled a B.C. courtroom Tuesday as lawyers for Meng Wanzhou wrapped up their attempts to convince a judge not to extradite the Huawei executive to the United States. Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes quizzed defence lawyer Eric Gottardi about the logic behind his argument that Meng's alleged offence wouldn't be considered a crime in Canada. Holmes is tasked with deciding whether charges against the 47-year-old chief financial officer meet the bar of so-called double criminality necessary to extradite someone from one country to another. Meng is charged with fraud in relation to an allegation she put foreign banks at risk of loss and prosecution by lying about Huawei's ownership of a hidden subsidiary accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Move that same set of circumstances to Canada, Gottardi told Holmes, and there would be no crime because Canadians have rejected economic sanctions. But Holmes didn't seem so sure, asking Gottardi whether someone could in fact be prosecuted domestically for lying in Canada, over the phone, to someone in another country who then lost money as a result. The defence lawyer struggled for an answer, noting that the imagined scenarios were adding fiction to an exercise that already requires a judge to ponder a hypothetical scenario by transposing the facts of a case to Canada. ""It's difficult to respond to your question,"" he said at one point before ultimately returning to the fundamental argument underlying the case at hand. ""It's sanction breaking. It's in inducing a U.S. bank to breach domestic laws. That's what the Americans are upset about. That's what underlies these offences."" Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018 on a stopover from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina. She faces charges of bank fraud in the United States. She has been living under house arrest in a multimillion-dollar Vancouver home since last December, when she was released on $10 million bail pending the outcome of the extradition battle. Meng's case has already fractured Canada-China relations, after Beijing detained two Canadians and restricted imports in moves widely seen as retaliation for Meng's arrest. The Crown is expected to begin its arguments on Wednesday, asking Holmes to consider the ""essence"" of the allegations against Meng as the judge ponders the question of double criminality. In written arguments filed in advance of the hearing, prosecutors say that a fraud charge against Meng could be made on either side of the border, because she allegedly made a misrepresentation to HSBC, which risked loss as a result. The Crown's arguments also touch on the questions that Holmes put to Gottardi — suggesting that she could still think about the impact of U.S. sanctions without having to consider Canada's position on Iran. HSBC could have been subject to millions of dollars in fines because of a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States in relation to sanctions violations against other countries. ""The sanctions context is useful only to aid in identifying the resulting harm flowing from [Meng's] alleged lie,"" the Crown wrote in a filing in advance of the hearing. Defence lawyer Scott Fenton concluded the defence's case by arguing — essentially — that the case for fraud couldn't be made because all the fraud involved stemmed from sanctions violations. He said that all the potential losses in the case come from ""legal"" risk of fines or prosecution for offences that don't exist in Canada. Fenton also noted that if banks are ""innocent dupes"" of a misrepresentation then they would have done nothing wrong, and if they haven't done their due diligence, they would be at fault — not just Meng. The lawyer also rejected the notion a Canadian bank could risk its reputation by financing a sanctions-breaking client. ""There is nothing wrong with a company in Canada transacting in dollars in Iran. In fact, our government supports it. Promotes it,"" Fenton said. ""There can't be reputational harm to a Canadian branch of a bank for doing the very things that our government has said are not only entirely lawful but encourages them to do."" If the judge decides the legal test of double criminality has not been met, Meng will be free to leave Canada, though she'll still have to stay out of the United States to avoid the charges. If the judge finds there is double criminality, the hearing will proceed to a second phase. That phase, scheduled for June, will consider defence allegations that Meng's rights were violated during her arrest in December 2018.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,N/A
344,Anonymous,2020-01-17T23:00:00.271Z,'Stop this investigation': Jean Charest's lawyer says former premier steered clear of corruption,"Jean Charest's lawyer says the former Liberal premier is innocent of any wrongdoing when it comes to political financing — and it is high time for Quebec's anti-corruption squad to end a six-year investigation that has not led to charges against Charest's friend, Marc Bibeau, or anyone else. Michel Massicotte told Radio-Canada that aside from the fact his client is a friend of Bibeau's — something Charest has never disavowed — nothing in newly released documents pertaining to that UPAC investigation call into question Charest's integrity. Massicotte's comments come a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a request for a publication ban filed by lawyers for Bibeau, a one-time top fundraiser for the Quebec Liberal Party. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, a trove of information from the investigation, known as Operation Mâchurer, is now public. The documents include general warrants and witness statements, and they detail why, in 2016, UPAC wanted to conduct secret searches of the offices of companies owned by Bibeau. The revelations come just as Charest is mulling over making a bid to lead the Conservative Party of Canada, and the former premier wants to clear the air. ""We discussed it, and given what's been out there in the public sphere — not just yesterday, but for a very long time — it looked to us to be necessary to address this issue,"" Massicotte told Radio-Canada's Isabelle Richer in an interview Friday. Even though Charest was head of the Liberal party, he had nothing to do with Bibeau's fundraising practices, Massicotte said.  Massicotte said if some companies contributed illegally to election funds, Charest was not aware of it. ""To support a practice, you have to be aware that practice exists,"" said Massicotte. He said Charest knew Bibeau was involved in the PLQ's so-called ""sectoral funding""  — a term used to describe soliciting companies to ask staff to make political contributions. Massicotte conceded that it's been demonstrated companies did, in fact, contribute illegally to the Liberal Party's electoral coffers — but he maintained that had nothing to do with how sectoral funding actually worked. ""It wasn't up to the firm to give money, it was up to each person individually,"" he explained. ""There was no twisting of arms, either."" In any event, even if businesses did make illegal political contributions to the PLQ, ""Mr. Charest knew nothing about it,"" he said. Operation Mâchurer's goal was to establish a link between illegal political financing and the awarding of public contracts by Charest's Liberal government. ""We have always said, to whoever wanted to hear it, that we are innocent as far as any of this goes,"" Massicotte said. He pointed out that Charest has already explained all this, in great detail, in a 300-page declaration to lawyers for the Charbonneau commission, who interviewed him in 2014. The former premier also spoke to UPAC investigators on two separate occasions, before Operation Mâchurer was even launched, more than five years ago. Operation Mâchurer has found nothing new, he said. ""Stop this investigation,"" he said. ""Stop saying we are hiding something, or whatever. We have offered our full co-operation, but this co-operation does not seem to have been reciprocated."" Massicotte said he believes investigators leaked the now-public documents out of frustration, in an effort to create a ""trial by media"" scenario because there is no evidence of any crime.  However, opposition parties are not ready to let Charest off the hook. ""If Operation Mâchurer is not over, it's because Mr. Charest's friend dragged the proceedings all the way to the Supreme Court,"" said Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, the co-spokesperson for Québec Solidaire, in a news release, accusing the former provincial Liberal leader of showing contempt for the public. ""Now that Mr. Charest wants to run for the Conservative Party leadership, he's complaining about how long it's taking and he wants it to stop?"" ""The Charbonneau commission exposed the illegal financing schemes of the Liberals during the Charest era. He is the prime suspect in this case, "" said Nadeau-Dubois. ""Just because Jean Charest's lawyer asks that an investigation be stopped does not mean we should listen to him,"" said the acting head of the Parti Québécois, Pascal Bérubé. He said there are still many unanswered questions. ""Several individuals and companies claimed that they had been asked for large amounts of money,"" Bérubé said. ""Who asked them for money, and for whose benefit? That's the most important question.""

345,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:13:02.451Z,Judges reserve decision in William Sandeson's appeal of murder case,"A panel of judges in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal has reserved its decision in the case of convicted killer William Sandeson, who's trying to get a new trial for the August 2015 killing of Taylor Samson in Halifax. On the final day of a two-day hearing, the judges peppered a Crown lawyer Tuesday morning with questions about the conduct of a private detective described as a ""traitor"" by a lawyer for Sandeson. Samson, a Dalhousie University student, was killed in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. The hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway yesterday in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer, Ian Smith, asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes live blogged from court. Smith focused much of his arguments on Bruce Webb, a retired RCMP sergeant who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment. Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe. The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of Webb's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb. MacLellan said Arnold found Sandeson's fair trial rights were not infringed upon because the witnesses' evidence would have come out even without Webb having spoken to police. She also noted Arnold determined that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. Judges on the three-member Court of Appeal panel spent much of yesterday afternoon and this morning asking MacLellan about Webb's actions. Justice David Farrar questioned Arnold's characterization of Webb ""merely"" telling the police to requestion the witnesses when describing the impact of his actions. ""This is a breach of a duty that Webb had to his client … and it's during the trial process,"" said Farrar. MacLellan reiterated that Arnold found police did not do anything wrong in their handling of Webb's information. She said he considered Sandeson's right to a fair trial against the defence's request for a mistrial. She noted a mistrial is a ""remedy of last resort,"" and a particularly undesirable one seven weeks into a trial.  ""Other less drastic remedies have to be considered,"" said MacLellan. ""The trial judge is in the best position to determine in the circumstances of what has happened here if a mistrial is the best remedy."" Smith also argued that a search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant was not lawful, because there were no ""exigent circumstances"" that justified their actions. But MacLellan argued the situation was urgent, as at that point it was a case of suspected kidnapping and therefore an ongoing concern. She noted Sandeson's first statement to police, which he gave voluntarily, raised concerns with police when they compared his answers to his text messages and found out he had lied about meeting Samson that night. He said police searched Sandeson's apartment because they believed it was the last place Samson had been seen. Smith also claimed that Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officers' aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. MacLellan noted that kidnapping is ""not a bloodless crime,"" and that the investigation was at that point still a kidnapping. She said the phrasing of the officers' questions — such as, ""Why won't you help him, Will?'"" — suggested Samson was still alive. ""It shows that they're very sincere in their belief that this is still a kidnapping and it's nothing more than a hunch, or serious fear, that Samson is dead,"" said MacLellan. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years. In his closing arguments, Smith said a new trial would allow Sandeson to apply for a stay of proceedings. If that remedy wasn't available to him, Smith said Sandeson could apply to have certain evidence excluded from a new trial, such as the evidence from Blades and McCabe.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-snowmobile-crash-new-ross-lunenburg-county-1.5434326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-provincial-park-development-golf-eastern-shore-1.5433792 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/prince-andrew-high-school-name-change-online-forum-1.5433374 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-outbreak-province-sexually-transmitted-infection-1.5433651,N/A

347,Don Pittis,2014-06-11T10:28:44.051Z,Fighting the corporate tax tricks that lead to inequality,"Being a willing taxpayer sometimes feels like being the only chump at the table who didn't forget his wallet. But the official charged with making sure giant corporations actually pay the taxes they are supposed to pay says that's all going to change in two years.  It's about time. When the banks started collapsing, who stepped in? When the car companies went broke, who bailed them out? Well it was the humble wage slaves like you paying their taxes, that's who. Of course, now that the crisis is over and companies like Apple, Google, Starbucks and Canada's Cameco are doing well, they are pouring money back into the kitty. Right? Well of course they aren't.  That's because there's a multibillion-dollar global business in fixing it so the ones making out like bandits pay as little tax as possible. Many as little as zero. As my colleagues at CBC Radio's The Sunday Edition have pointed out, it's not a secret. And it's completely legal. But that may be about to change.  With inequality the new watchword, it is important to note that failing to pay your share of tax, whether you are a corporation or an individual, is making the problem worse. Saint-Amans insists he has the money and the clout to push his reforms through in two years. ""Why?"" asks Saint-Amans. ""Because it's political. When you have political support you find the technical solutions."" All of the OECD and G20 countries are on side, he says. The story Saint-Amans tells is one of governments that feel cheated as they watch their tax base erode. Governments have encouraged investment with low corporate taxes, but then those same corporations played tricks to avoid paying even that. ""Effective tax rates are very low, much lower than the [official] corporate tax rates,"" Saint-Amans tells Enright.  The schemes he describes, with the benign name ""tax planning,"" are varied and imaginative. The tricks include transferring ownership of ""intangibles"" like brands and lucrative patents to low-tax jurisdictions, allowing companies to shift profits from higher tax countries ostensibly to pay the rent due on those brands and patents. Another scheme takes advantage of national laws meant to protect companies from ""double taxation"" where the same profit is taxed twice. Clever tax experts have devised ways to turn that into what Saint-Amans calls ""double non-taxation"" where tax isn't paid anywhere.  Saint-Amans says he is confident his initiative, called the BEPS (base erosion and profit shifting) plan, will work. His plan involves ""fundamental changes to the international tax standards … based on three core principles: coherence, substance, and transparency,"" and is already making a difference. He says companies are paying attention.  ""They know that this is happening. There is no way out for them,"" Saint-Amans says. ""Therefore they try to participate, to contribute, so that we do the right thing.""    ""Do the right thing?"" Is this part of a new corporate morality? The ""integrity [that] can't be bought and … can't be regulated"" that Bank of England governor Mark Carney talked about last week?  Maybe. But morality doesn't happen without moral suasion. And we should never forget the power of money. Money talks. If the BEPS plan succeeds we will know something important has changed.  But in the meantime, we should all be reminded that the celebration of corporate freedom and untrammelled wealth has gone a couple of steps too far. Instead, maybe governments should realize that it is better that the little guys get a bigger slice of the pie. At least they pay their taxes.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fighting-the-corporate-tax-tricks-that-lead-to-inequality-1.2666148,[],N/A

And RCMP Cpl. Michel Lanteigne reiterated for the Moncton courtroom that the damage to the front of Maurice Johnson's pickup truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck. But Lanteigne acknowledged he could not say whether the damage to the accused's truck occurred on Feb. 24, 2018, the night Francis was killed. The body of the 22-year-old from Elsipogtog First Nation was found on Saint-Charles South Road in Saint-Charles, about 100 kilometres north of Moncton. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles, has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. The trial is scheduled to resume on Monday morning. Defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux was set to begin his cross-examination of Lanteigne on Thursday afternoon, but requested an adjournment after learning a new witness had come forward in the nearly two-year-old case. The unnamed person contacted the RCMP, the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench heard. No other details were released at the time and the matter was not discussed in court on Friday. Lanteigne told the court his examination of Johnson's truck determined a person hit the hood, based on the damage. Lemieux asked if the damage could be consistent with an animal being struck. Lanteigne replied animals often go under a vehicle and no evidence was found underneath Johnson's truck. On Thursday, Lanteigne also told the court he found no hair from an animal on the vehicle. Earlier Friday, the court heard from Lea Ighedosa, the former owner and operator of the Saint-Charles gas bar and store the night Francis was killed. She testified she met with RCMP Const. Ricky LeBlond the afternoon after Francis was killed to review the footage from the store's security camera. A segment of the video, which was played in court, shows Francis walking eastbound on the road in front of the gas station at around 9:30 p.m. — likely the last images of him alive. Shortly after, a vehicle, possibly a pickup truck, drives by, heading in the same direction. Security video from Josée Poirier was also submitted into evidence Friday. She and her fiancé are good friends with Francis' family, she told the court. When she heard about the accident, she visited her mother and stepfather, who live on Saint-Charles South Road, to review their security camera footage. Poirier copied about three hours of video — between 9 p.m. and midnight — and gave it to police. She did not watch all of the video and she did not edit or change it in any way, she said. The trial began, which began on Monday, has heard from 24 witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.

349,Sarah MacMillan,2019-10-07T23:00:00.448Z,New app-only taxi company starts up in Charlottetown,"If you want to book a ride with P.E.I. Online Taxi, there's no dispatcher you can call. The new taxi company in Charlottetown does all bookings through an app, which allows customers to track their ride in real-time on a map. The system looks a lot like popular ride-booking apps like Uber and Lyft — but despite appearances, P.E.I. Online Taxi is a licensed taxi stand, and is aiming to offer the convenience of an app, without disrupting the taxi industry. ""Unfortunately small towns and cities, they cannot absorb ride-sharing,"" said owner and director Osama Abdoh. ""It's a very fragile market.""  Many in Charlottetown have had the experience of being unable to book a taxi during peak hours, particularly late at night. Abdoh said tracking cars through an app makes the experience more convenient for customers. ""You don't need to wait, you don't need to do multiple calls, different companies,"" Abdoh said. ""Which is fair enough. It's not the fault of any existing … taxi company. It's just the fact they're overwhelmed with the demand.""  Abdoh has hired several full-time drivers, and hopes to hire more as his business ramps up. For driver Mike Fitzpatrick, the ability for passengers to know when their ride will show up, and to offer feedback through the app, was part of the appeal.  ""I was attracted to their system, which I think will make the industry better, you know as far as professionalism and accountability."" There have been calls on P.E.I. to allow ride-booking on the Island — systems that don't follow all the same rules as a taxi stand.  The minister of transportation has said he supports bringing ride-booking to P.E.I., and the province said it is doing research to determine what legislative changes would be needed in order to make that happen. But like many taxi owners, Abdoh worries allowing ride-booking without limits would hurt cab companies and full-time drivers — by flooding the market. He would, however, like to see the province and the city ease the requirements for obtaining a taxi operator licence, in order to make it less costly. Down the road, he would like to hire additional part-time drivers to help meet the demand during the busiest times.  ""The market should see a full coverage during peak hours, as well as low hours, equally.

351,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:13:02.451Z,Judges reserve decision in William Sandeson's appeal of murder case,"A panel of judges in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal has reserved its decision in the case of convicted killer William Sandeson, who's trying to get a new trial for the August 2015 killing of Taylor Samson in Halifax. On the final day of a two-day hearing, the judges peppered a Crown lawyer Tuesday morning with questions about the conduct of a private detective described as a ""traitor"" by a lawyer for Sandeson. Samson, a Dalhousie University student, was killed in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. The hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway yesterday in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer, Ian Smith, asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes live blogged from court. Smith focused much of his arguments on Bruce Webb, a retired RCMP sergeant who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment. Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe. The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of Webb's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb. MacLellan said Arnold found Sandeson's fair trial rights were not infringed upon because the witnesses' evidence would have come out even without Webb having spoken to police. She also noted Arnold determined that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. Judges on the three-member Court of Appeal panel spent much of yesterday afternoon and this morning asking MacLellan about Webb's actions. Justice David Farrar questioned Arnold's characterization of Webb ""merely"" telling the police to requestion the witnesses when describing the impact of his actions. ""This is a breach of a duty that Webb had to his client … and it's during the trial process,"" said Farrar. MacLellan reiterated that Arnold found police did not do anything wrong in their handling of Webb's information. She said he considered Sandeson's right to a fair trial against the defence's request for a mistrial. She noted a mistrial is a ""remedy of last resort,"" and a particularly undesirable one seven weeks into a trial.  ""Other less drastic remedies have to be considered,"" said MacLellan. ""The trial judge is in the best position to determine in the circumstances of what has happened here if a mistrial is the best remedy."" Smith also argued that a search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant was not lawful, because there were no ""exigent circumstances"" that justified their actions.

352,Paul Withers,2019-12-18T10:00:00.481Z,Fish boom prompts energy conglomerate to spend $14.5M to bury subsea cables,"It's a fish story no one saw coming, at least not Halifax-based energy conglomerate Emera. The parent company of Nova Scotia Power disclosed this week to the Utility and Review Board that it spent almost $14,492,000 this summer to bury its Maritime Link cables lying on the floor of the Cabot Strait between Newfoundland and Cape Breton. The cables were protected because an unprecedented explosion in the redfish population in the Gulf of St Lawrence is about to trigger a corresponding boom in bottom trawling in the area. Also known as ocean perch, redfish were not on anyone's radar when the $1.5-billion Maritime Link was designed and built to carry Muskrat Falls hydroelectricity from Newfoundland to Nova Scotia. The two 200-kilovolt electrical submarine cables spanning the Cabot Strait are the longest in North America. They are each 170 kilometres long and weigh 5,500 tonnes. Nova Scotia Power customers are paying for the Maritime Link in return for a minimum of 20 per cent of the electricity generated by Muskrat Falls over 35 years. The electricity is supposed to start flowing through the Maritime Link in mid-2020. In August, the company buried 59 kilometres of subsea cables one metre below the bottom at depths of 400 metres. ""These cables had not been previously trenched due to the absence of fishing activities at those depths when the cables were originally installed,"" spokesperson Jeff Myrick wrote in an email to CBC News in October. Ratepayers will get the bill next year. Until now, the company had declined to release costs relating to protecting the Maritime Link. The bill will be presented to regulators when the company applies to recover Maritime Link costs from Nova Scotia Power ratepayers in 2020. Myrick said the company was acting after consultation with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. After years of overfishing in the 1980s and early 1990s, redfish quotas were slashed and a moratorium imposed on some redfish. Confusingly, there are actually two redfish species in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. But very strong recent year classes, that have coincided with warming waters in the gulf, have produced redfish in massive numbers. There is now believed to be three-million tonnes of redfish in the Gulf of St Lawrence. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is expected to increase quotas in the coming years and the fishing industry is gearing up in a big way. Earlier this month, Scotia Harvest announced it will begin construction of a new $14-million fish plant in Digby next spring in part to process increased redfish catches.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/emera-subsidiary-spent-14m-on-submarine-electrical-cables-1.5400204,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/natural-resources-protected-land-golf-course-development-1.5397821 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-ring-rescue-international-interest-1.5399636 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/inverness-county-local-sewage-treatment-plant-complaints-1.5399958 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-crash-bayers-road-connaught-avenue-1.5400156 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/4-nova-scotia-rcmp-vehicles-damaged-2-people-arrested-1.5399739,N/A
353,Amanda Parris,2019-01-18T19:15:39.103Z,The stories this hair could tell: How Coco Framboise is celebrating Black women's beauty and lives,"I have these childhood memories of my mum doing my hair. Early in the morning while I was half asleep, she would often begin braiding my hair for school. Sometimes she'd do three big braids, other times an array of smaller single plaits. Cornrows were applied for special occasions. Multi-coloured clips and baubles would be used as adornments. These are memories that have grown in significance over the years as I reflect on the sacredness of the ritual, the intimacy of the process and also the artistry that it invited. In a way, my hair was a canvas for my mother to experiment and apply her own aesthetic and creativity.  These memories are part of why Afro-Dite: HairLoom caught my interest. (The performance is happening Friday evening at the Art Gallery of Ontario.)  Conceptualized by the multidisciplinary artist and burlesque performer Nikola Steer (a.k.a. Coco Framboise), it is a poetic contemplation of Black hair and its meaning. Occurring inside the Mickalene Thomas: Femmes Noire exhibition where Black women are centered in grand, luxurious, larger than life portraits, Steer's mother will join her onstage to braid her hair. While braiding, she will weave in textures and textiles from Steer's life as well as items that Steer has gathered from other Black women. Each item came to Steer with a story about its meaning and significance. A soundtrack of these stories and voices accompanies the performance.  It's an interesting time to present HairLoom. Just last year, a teacher with the Ontario Peel District school board made headlines when she posted a photo on her Instagram mocking the braids of a young Black student. Three years earlier a Black student was allegedly sent home because her natural hair was deemed ""too poofy"" and ""unprofessional"" by the school's principal.  Here in Canada, Black hair has often been the flashpoint for a larger and deeper conversation around anti-Black racism and the way colonialism has seeped into our very understanding of beauty. Crafting a space for Black women's hair in a public gallery and illustrating the ways it can bring us together through intimate and intergenerational connection becomes — in this climate — a healing and defiant tribute. It also makes me think back to my own childhood memories with even more reverence.  HairLoom is the third part of Coco Framboise's Afro-Dite series. I spoke with her on the phone earlier this week about the project, the memories that inspired this edition and how her performance fits into a larger discourse around Black women's hair.  Tell me about Afro-Dite: HairLoom.  This piece nods back to my childhood hairdos of wearing a few big braids that my mother would put into my hair. I had the idea sort of bouncing around in my head, and when I heard that the AGO was going to do a Mickalene Thomas exhibit, I boldly reached out to them to consider me for auxiliary programming.  I had seen Mickalene's work in March for the first time in Seattle when I was taken to an exhibit called Figuring History at the Seattle Art Museum. I was so transfixed by seeing women who looked something like me, but presented in multiple rooms of an enormous scale. Not only was it wonderful to see these women rhinestoned but also that material is very familiar to me in my work as a burlesque artist. Many of us are encrusted in rhinestones — our costumes. I ended up responding to that work and doing my second Afro-Dite piece last July. It featured a rhinestone afro.  Could you tell me a little bit about the concept behind the Afro-Dite series?  The first piece was Afro-Dite Black Betty. I presented at the Toronto Burlesque Festival in 2017. And that piece involved using three versions of the song ""Black Betty"" starting with a gritty early version that was in a blues style. The second version was the very popular rock version by Ram Jam that a lot of people think of as being the original, and then a third version that was done in electro swing style, and they stitched these three versions together.  My piece involved walking out on stage with a giant golden sparkly afro pick with a fist as the handle and I danced my way through these three versions and shifted the piece from being a cute, benign, burlesque cabaret number into something that was becoming more and more defiant and celebratory as I went along. And at the end of that piece, I invited a number of other performers of colour who were nearby and in the wings at the time, and asked them if they would mind holding space with me, fists up.  They did, and the audience then joined me in that moment of focus. It was a really poignant piece at the time because there was — and frankly there always is — so much going on in the media with people of colour encountering law enforcement.  In my artistic life, in my burlesque life in particular, I think I've been a Black person that a lot of people are really comfortable with. And I'm the kind of person who can slide into a lot of spaces that some other Black people have had more challenge accessing. And I wanted to take a moment to just drive the point home that I've been Black the entire time.  And while there are some pros for people being comfortable with me, and I ultimately do want people to be comfortable with who I am, I also want them to see that I do have a point of view on these things and I have lived experience with some oppression.  So is that a thread that runs through the entire Afro-Dite series?  Yes. It is a series about Black beauty and Black lives.  Tell me about the community stories that we'll be hearing during the performance.  The first piece that I received, the individual is multiracial and the textile comes from a romper that was made by that person's white grandmother with whom this person was very close as a small child.  This was a favourite romper and the grandmother allowed the child to choose the fabric. It's yellow, bright yellow fabric with green cute alligator characters on it. Over time, this grandmother started to vocalize a lot more feelings about what Black women can and cannot do with their hair or should or should not do, including bleaching it blonde. And this person — as they grew and as their hair became more kinky and as they started to identify as a person of colour and include that in their multi-layered identity — grandmother was starting to feel more challenged and tensions started to grow in this relationship.  This grandmother is described as coming from a small town and being a Trump supporter, and even though this person will still be loved as grandmother, that relationship is very strained. This person felt that grandmother was still kind of focused on the grandchild that had been there but didn't have space for the adult that this artist had become. And I thought that was sad but an important story to tell.  Has your mom ever performed with you?  No, this is the first time.  Is she nervous?  Yes, she's nervous! I was very surprised to hear that today. We had a big team meeting and my mother arrived to do the first test braid and she mentioned being quite nervous and I was pretty surprised by that. But then also delighted to see how quickly she braided them. She thought that perhaps she'd be rusty. She hadn't done it in many, many years. But then boom — it was done.  When you were a child, how did you feel about your braids?  At the time I think I was pretty neutral to them. You know, that's just my hair. When you're a little kid you don't have necessarily very many points of reference. You know these are your parents. This is your house. This is your life. This is your hair.  As I grew, and as I started to develop crushes on people at school, then it started to become more of a thing because I started to think about what other people were thinking of me. I remember being really uncomfortable going to school, having a crush and it also being winter and I had to put a toque on. My hair was in a number of big braids that were anchored with baubles, these round ornaments in the hair. So putting a toque on, on top of that, all you could see were these knobbly bits. It wasn't what my Caucasian friends had when they put on their winter hats. So I felt awkward and strange. I didn't hate them, but I just — I remember starting to wish that I could have input on what the hairstyle was. But that wasn't really the dynamic. It was just, you know, my mother said sit down and so I sat down. You don't talk back. That was the dynamic. You do as you're told, and I did.  Black women's hair has become such a huge part of public discourse. Is there anything that you hope that this performance will add to that conversation?  I know that there is a lot of discussion or a lot of passionate feelings about what should or shouldn't happen with this hair that we have. Some people think that the hair should just stay natural as it grows out of the head. Some people don't realize how many different hair types there are.   For me, I treat it as sculpture medium. I do put relaxer in my hair. And I do that not to fit in with any particular beauty standard — I'm not trying to, you know, make all my curls go away. I don't hate my curls. I love my hair. But I also really like the opportunity to play with it, to make sculpture to express myself.  I am aware of pressures and judgements about my choice to do that with my hair. I think that it's important to leave space for a variety of experiences. Different people feel different ways about hair. Different people feel different ways about connection to culture and legacy. We need to leave space for that variety of experiences. Sometimes I wish that there was a little bit more ease about that.  But with this piece, it's not just the hair that I'm thinking about — I'm thinking about how we all are connected to each other. I feel very honoured to have these stories in my hair. There are pieces that connect to loved ones lost. There are pieces that connect to business and prosperity. There are pieces that connect to people's spirituality, their sense of worship and altar. There are so many different kinds of pieces in this hair and it's heavy. Heavy hangs the head. I just I hope that I can honour my community and my family. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.  Coco Framboise (Nikola Steer). Afro-Dite: HairLoom.

354,Anonymous,2019-07-09T21:39:04.318Z,Brazil court convicts mining company Vale in deadly dam rupture,"A Brazilian state judge on Tuesday convicted mining company Vale SA for damages caused by the deadly rupture of a tailings dam in January that killed at least 240 people. Judge Elton Pupo Nogueira ruled that Vale is responsible for fixing all the damages, although he did not set a monetary value for compensation, the Minas Gerais state court said on its website. It ""is still not possible to quantify solely by technical-scientific criteria,"" the statement said. The value ""will not be limited to the dead, but also effects on the local and regional environment, in addition to economic activity in the affected regions,"" the statement quoted Nogueira as saying. Vale did not immediately respond to request for comment. The company also operates mines in Canada. The 11 billion reais ($3.8 billion) in Vale assets already frozen by courts will remain blocked, it said. A dam containing mining waste at a Vale facility in the town of Brumadinho collapsed on Jan. 25, burying workers, residents and huge swaths of the environment in red-brown sludge. In 2015, a larger dam collapsed in the same region, killing 19 people and burying homes in what became known as Brazil's worst environmental disaster.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vale-brazil-dam-rupture-convicted-1.5205930,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vale-dam-collapse-residents-angry-1.5001252 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/tailings-dam-report-vale-1.5181029,N/A
355,Aly Thomson,2020-01-21T19:33:32.917Z,N.S. declined to seize insurance money granted to mentally ill man who killed wife,"Nova Scotia's Justice Department twice told the province's Supreme Court it would not apply to seize life insurance money granted to a Cape Breton man found not criminally responsible for killing his wife. The detail is noted by Justice Frank Edwards in followup comments to his ruling last week that Richard Maidment is entitled to his wife's life insurance, which totals $200,000 plus interest. Maidment, 42, who also uses the surname McNeil, killed Sarabeth Forbes on April 18, 2017, in the home they shared in Gardiner Mines, N.S. He was found not criminally responsible in December 2017. Two years earlier, Forbes named Maidment as beneficiary to her life insurance and her son as a contingent. In granting the money to Maidment — and not to the couple's 12-year-old son, who is now being raised by his grandmother — Edwards noted Maidment doesn't benefit from a crime because he didn't commit a crime and is not a criminal. Last week, a law professor noted there is precedent for provincial governments to intervene in such cases, under the province's Civil Forfeiture Act. In additional written comments released Monday, Edwards noted the court notified the province's attorney general of the claim for the life insurance, made by Maidment's mother on his behalf. Edwards said in a letter dated Aug. 6, 2019, a solicitor of the civil forfeiture unit of the Justice Department wrote that ""the province of Nova Scotia will not be participating in this matter."" After the unit was advised that Forbes's mother, Emeline Forbes, had filed an counter application for the insurance money on behalf of the couple's son, a lawyer for the department advised the court that it ""does not have an interest in the proceedings."" Edward noted that because the province did not intervene in the case, ""My decision did not deal with provisions of the Civil Forfeiture Act."" The Justice Department declined an interview request. But in a statement, spokesperson Barbara MacLean noted the Civil Forfeiture Act only allows for forfeiture of property — including money — to the province, and not to third parties.  ""To clarify, this means when applying the act under any circumstances, forfeited money would go into the general revenue of the province, and would not be able to be given to a third party."" MacLean declined to comment further, as it is a ""private legal matter.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/richard-maidment-life-insurance-nova-scotia-justice-department-1.5434765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mayann-francis-racial-profiling-santina-rao-arrest-1.5434509 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/maritimes-natural-gas-pipeline-commits-200m-in-case-of-mishap-1.5434396 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cliff-jumper-logan-latulippe-glace-bay-1.5433339 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841,N/A
356,Sarah Rieger,2019-12-22T00:28:19.775Z,U.S. judge rejects Trump's bid to dismiss lawsuit over Keystone XL pipeline approval,"A U.S. federal judge rejected motions filed by Calgary-based TC Energy and U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to dismiss a lawsuit which aims to block the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. On Friday, Montana Federal District Judge Brian Morris rejected the motion, stating that Indigenous and environmental groups against the $8 billion US project have made credible claims that should proceed to a merit hearing. The Indigenous groups claim Trump violated the law when he approved the pipeline, and that the pipeline would have negative impacts on the environment and traditional, cultural sites. Former U.S President Barack Obama's administration rejected the project in 2015 because of concerns about carbon pollution, but Trump reversed that decision in March 2017. A 2018 ruling by Morris found the project's environmental impact statement fell short of regulatory standards, so in 2019 Trump reissued a presidential permit in a bid to circumvent that court ruling against the project. However in this latest ruling, Morris denied the groups' request for a preliminary injunction, stating that TC Energy has voluntarily agreed to stop pre-construction activities until the second quarter of next year. If TC Energy's future activities interfere with the status quo, the judge wrote, the request for a preliminary injunction to stop that work can be renewed.  The 1,897-kilometre pipeline, first announced in 2005, would carry 830,000 barrels of crude a day from Hardisty, Alta., to Nebraska. It would then connect with the original Keystone that runs to Gulf Coast refineries. The original Keystone recently reopened after a 9,120 barrels of oil were spilled in North Dakota.  The pipeline expansion is also facing hurdles in South Dakota, where a board deciding whether or not to grant water permits has now extended its hearing into the new year after opponents repeatedly voiced concerns.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-ruling-1.5406064,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-delays-1.5123603,N/A
357,Brooklyn Currie,2020-01-21T15:39:35.262Z,Dartmouth's Prince Andrew High School takes name change discussion to online forum,"Prince Andrew High School in Dartmouth, N.S., is launching an online survey to get community feedback on whether the school should consider a name change. The school, commonly referred to as P.A., was named in 1960 after Prince Andrew of the Royal Family. Late last year, a woman accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was 17. The controversy forced Andrew to step down from his royal duties on Nov. 20. At a school advisory council meeting on Monday, school principal Brad McGowan explained how the process of gathering feedback online will work. Using an online platform called Thoughtexchange, people can submit their opinions, read other people's opinions and rate them. The program uses artificial intelligence to group common themes and topics together. ""[It will] have what I hope are sort of opportunities to reflect and have this transparent way to say, 'This is what I'm thinking, this is what other people are thinking, this is what's important to me,'"" McGowan said. All users will remain anonymous, but participation in the online forum will be invitation-only. McGowan said that will include current students, staff, faculty, parents/guardians, as well as people in the surrounding community and alumni. ""While I'm very aware that there are passionate voices on either side of this question, the only voice that matters to me as the principal of P.A., is the voice of the people that are part of the greater P.A. community,"" McGowan said. Belinda Oxner, the chair of Prince Andrew's school advisory council, said she thinks the name should be changed. ""No public establishment should be named after a living individual,"" she said. ""You can't determine what their future actions are going to be … it should be a standard policy."" Despite her personal feelings, Oxner said it's crucial to get public input before making any decisions. ""If we don't engage with the community before we move forward, it will just lead to greater debate at a later date,"" she said. McGowan said there's no deadline for possibly changing the name. ""Nothing is going to happen unless, or until, I can with confidence say, 'This is what the community wants to do,'"" McGowan said.

358,Sara Minogue,2016-08-30T17:45:53.790Z,"Bluenose East caribou quota would 'undermine traditional Dene conservation,' board rules","There will be no total allowable harvest for the struggling Bluenose East caribou herd in the N.W.T.'s Sahtu region if the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board gets its way.  The board announced Monday that imposing a quota ""would undermine traditional Dene conservation practices that continue to be central to the relationship between people and caribou in the Sahtu."" The board held hearings in Deline in March with the goal of creating a three-year recovery strategy starting this fall. It marked the first time a community presented its own plan alongside one put forward by territorial government biologists. The N.W.T. department of Environment and Natural Resources had proposed a total allowable harvest of 950 animals per year — 163 of those for the Sahtu region. Deline had proposed a harvest of 150 animals for that community alone, but it doesn't want to use tags to enforce that harvest.  ""It's been shown elsewhere that approach doesn't work,"" said Paul Latour, the board's vice-chair. ""I guess the board feels here's a community coming along with a different tack. Maybe time to give it a try."" The Bluenose East caribou herd, which straddles the N.W.T./Nunavut border, has declined rapidly in recent years — from an estimated 186,000 in 2003 to fewer than 40,000 in 2015. Deline's plan is based on the community's relationship with caribou, with a heavy emphasis on preserving culture as well as the herd. Its self-regulating approach would have the community manage and enforce hunting in Deline's region. The board is calling for amendments to the Wildlife Act to make that happen. ""Tags and heavy duty enforcement just is not going to work in the community,"" Latour said. ""At the end of the day we decided [the community plan] had a good chance of being workable."" The decision stands in contrast to that of the Wek'èezhii Renewable Resources Board, which earlier this year set an even stricter total allowable harvest than that proposed by the territorial and Tlicho governments. Both had suggested an annual bull caribou harvest of 950. Starting July 1, the board set a total allowable harvest within the Tlicho region of 750 bulls each year for the next three years.  In a news release, the neighbouring community of Colville Lake calls the idea of regulating the Indigenous hunt ""racist and dangerous,"" noting a total allowable harvest implies that indigenous hunting is the cause of the herd's decline, and deflects attention from the real causes such as natural population cycles, industrial development and climate change. Colville Lake Chief Wilbert Kochon says indigenous communities should be in charge of the wildlife they rely on. ""They are managing themselves,"" he says of Deline, which will officially become a self-governing community this week. ""Time to start practicing your own laws."" In total the board made 39 recommendations. It also recommends more funding and research on the herd's health — key points in both the territory's and Deline's plans. The board's final report in now in the hands of ENR minister Wally Schumann, who has until Sept. 23 to accept, vary or set aside and replace the board's recommendations.  It's not clear how the minister will reconcile the differences between the Sahtu and the Wek'èezhii boards' conservation plans. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-bluenose-east-caribou-conservation-decision-1.3741233,[],N/A
359,Shaina Luck,2020-01-22T16:11:38.172Z,'Historic' change allows transgender girls to enter Eskasoni pageant,"For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, the Eskasoni First Nation's annual winter carnival pageant is open to transgender women and girls. The Eskasoni Winter Carnival has been running for decades as a fundraiser for the local Holy Family Parish. The pageant is one of the most popular events of the festival in Cape Breton. ""To have this as one of the biggest symbols of gender affirmation for people who are trans is a total success and a very historic moment, not only for Mi'kmaw people, not only for people in Eskasoni, but for transgender women and girls all across this world,"" said Geordy Marshall, who is with Pride Eskasoni. Marshall is also the communications person for the Eskasoni First Nation and sits on the organizing committee for the winter carnival. He said about two dozen participants spend a month working on things like public speaking and confidence for the pageant. They bond as friends to encourage each other and learn from elders. ""It's an opportunity for young women to learn who they are and learn from the finest women in our community to become women. It's almost like a coming-of-age type of event,"" Marshall said. So far, one transgender participant has signed up, Bella Marie Poulette. She and her sponsors decided she should wait until after the pageant to do interviews to make sure the pageant is fair for all participants and to allow her to have the same kind of experience as everyone else. ""She is excited and she's felt overwhelmed by all of this emotionally,"" Marshall said. ""She's just overfilled with joy. This is something she's dreamed of all her life to do."" The winter carnival will take place Feb. 20-23. Maryanne Junta, 19, won the title of queen in the 2016 pageant. She said she loves that transgender girls are now allowed to enter. ""Trans girls are girls and it shouldn't be any other way,"" she said. ""They should be allowed to join pageants, they should be allowed to go in the girls bathroom, because they're girls. They should be able to experience life as a girl, as they want to.""  Marshall said the community's reaction has been mixed.  ""There were people who celebrated and rejoiced on the wonderful day, but there's also a lot of people who expressed their transphobic beliefs and were totally against it,"" he said. Marshall said many transgender teens struggle with poor self-esteem, which is one reason being able to enter the pageant with other young girls is important. ""It's hard to live in a world where it's full of lateral violence and residual effects from residential schools and Indian day schools and colonization. A lot of these young girls deal with a lot of pressure in their lives,"" he said. ""This is one of the great things we get to celebrate as a community. We see all of their hard work paid off and we truly honour them on that day. Whether they're a crowned winner or not, they're all our princesses.""

The senior official from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Mexican government official declined to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The flight was expected to reach Guadalajara later on Thursday morning, and one shelter in the city said it had been informed of a likely influx of deportees. The Mexican Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clamping down on unlawful migration a top priority of his three-year-old term in office and his looming 2020 re-election campaign. He has pressured the Mexican and Central American governments to better patrol their borders to thwart migrants, as well as having those petitioning for U.S. asylum protections wait for court dates outside the United States or seek refuge elsewhere. Despite the surge in the number of Central American immigrants in recent years, and the decline in the number of Mexicans, more Mexican single adults are still apprehended at the border than Central Americans, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data show. Almost 150,000 Mexican single adults were apprehended at the U.S. border in fiscal 2019, the data show.

361,Jackie McKay,2020-01-19T15:27:49.728Z,Inuit designers launch new line of parkas for Canada Goose ,"Canada Goose has launched a new collection of Inuit-made parkas.  The collection called Atigi 2.0 has 90 parkas made by 18 seamstresses who all live in Inuit Nunangat — Inuit regions of N.W.T., Nunavut, Quebec to Newfoundland and Labrador. Last year, Canada Goose launched project Atigi with 14 original parkas. The parkas from Atigi 2.0 were shown publicly for the first time at a media launch in New York Thursday.  ""It's unbelievable,"" said Stephanie Pitseolak, one of the designers who lives in Iqaluit. ""I can't believe my parka is there right now.""  New York isn't the only international city her parka will be on display; next week it will be making its way to France where the collection will be on display at the Canada Goose store in Paris. Pitseolak said the experience was exhausting. Canada Goose sends the seamstresses a box of materials to use for their designs. Things like fur, hollow fill insulation, zippers and Canada Goose commanders and patches with the logo. They had a month to make five identical parkas each in a different size.  Even Pitseolak was struggling. She said she couldn't give up and felt like her late grandmother was guiding her while she sewed.  ""I wanted people to know it's possible, even if you're very busy, even if you have kids, even if you're working,"" said Pitseolak.  ""I'm glad I did it and I'm happy for myself.""  The parkas will be on sale at the Canada Goose website for $2,500 each. The proceeds will go to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), a national organization that advocates for the rights and interests of Inuit in Canada.   Canada Goose donated nearly $80,000 to ITK from the sales of last year's Atigi parkas, according to ITK. Inuit land claims organizations for the four Inuit regions — Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Makivik Corporation, and Nunatsiavut Government each received $20,000.   ""We have big plans and a big vision from project Atigi,"" said Gavin Thompson, vice-president of corporate citizenship for Canada Goose. ""We are literally just getting started.""  Thompson said they want to grow the project but wouldn't reveal details of what that looks like.  ""We are just so proud of this collection,"" said Thompson.

362,Jessica Deer,2019-10-30T08:00:00.988Z,"Underfunded and under-resourced, Indigenous police services struggle with MMIWG cases","Chronic underfunding and a lack of resources and access to training has hampered the ability of Indigenous police forces to properly investigate violence against Indigenous women and girls. It's one of the many findings of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and something Melanie Morrison knows all too well. The Mohawk woman of Kahnawake, Que., has been working over the last decade to improve how the Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers, a First Nations police force serving her community, handles MMIWG cases after she felt her sister's disappearance was mishandled. Morrison's younger sister Tiffany, 24, was last seen on June 18, 2006 in the LaSalle area of Montreal, before getting into a taxi with a man. She never made it home. Morrison said her family were the ones knocking on doors, interviewing her friends, and tracking down her last whereabouts rather than the police. The missing persons file was only opened 16 days later.  ""That's how long it took them to take it seriously,"" said Morrison. ""We had to basically demand that a file be opened. They took the information but that was about it. They were convinced she would be back."" Four years after Tiffany disappeared, her remains were found in a wooded area at the foot of the Honoré Mercier Bridge that connects LaSalle with Kahnawake. The homicide case remains open with the Sûreté du Québec, and Morrison said the family's relationship with the Peacekeepers has improved. ""They've changed and adapted so that they have proper protocol in place so that that won't happen to somebody else when they report somebody missing. They won't be meeting those same walls that we did,"" said Morrison. Dwayne Zacharie, chief of police at the Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers, said his officers have made big steps to change how they deal with all aspects of policing in their community but also face challenges with resources, funding, and access to training under the First Nations Policing Program. ""We definitely would do more,"" he said.  ""We don't always get it right but we're always looking to improve and to get better and to be able to provide our community and anyone in our territory with a professional service."" Unlike non-Indigenous communities across Canada where policing operates as an essential service, under the First Nations Policing Program funding agreements are negotiated between the communities, Public Safety Canada, and the province.  Twenty-two Indigenous police forces operate under the program in Quebec that serve 44 First Nations communities and Inuit villages across the province. The Peacekeepers, a force of 36, has been funded through the program since 1995. ""The First Nations Policing Program sets us up to fail,"" said Zacharie, who is also the president of the First Nations Chiefs of Police Association. ""Throwing money at something is one thing, but just because you put extra dollars in something doesn't mean you're going to fix things. We need to look at staffing, training, resourcing, and infrastructure. ""So many First Nations police services are taxed to the 10th degree and are out there working constantly. Some places don't have enough staff to respond to the issues."" He said burnout is a regular issue for his officers. The current size of the force, which expanded this year, is still not enough to meet the needs of Kahnawake's population of 10,000 and the 100,000 vehicles a day that pass through the community to access the Island of Montreal via the Mercier Bridge.  Access to timely training for officers in English has also been a challenge. Zacharie said he once waited eight years for the École nationale de police du Québec to provide training on securing a crime scene and fingerprinting, until the Peacekeepers decided to go somewhere out of province. Other times, he was told he'd have to wait on material to be translated in English, and a minimum of eight to 15 officers would need to sign up for the course in order for it to be cost-effective. ""How could I ever send 15 people? We also have a duty to staff our community so that our community is safe and secure. If I sent 15, that's nearly half the entire police service,"" said Zacharie. In order to meet the department's training needs, Zacharie said he's sent officers to Regina, Ottawa, and even as far as Florida. ""Of course it's an extra cost,"" said Zacharie. ""It makes us feel like there's not really an interest to provide us with the training."" Quebec's Viens Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services called on the province's police academy to offer specialized training in English for Indigenous police services. Both the national and Quebec inquiries called upon all governments to ""immediately and dramatically"" change the state of Indigenous policing, including amending Quebec's Police Act to acknowledge the existence and status of Indigenous police forces as being similar to those of other police organizations in the province, as well as replace the program with a legislative and funding framework developed in partnership with Indigenous Peoples. Both reports cited Toward Peace, Harmony, and Well-Being: Policing in Indigenous Communities, a report published by the Council of Canadian Academies in April 2019, that concluded Indigenous communities receive policing services that do not meet their safety and security needs. Naiomi Metallic, an assistant professor and chancellor's chair in Aboriginal law and policy at Dalhousie University, was an expert panellist for the report and also testified at the national inquiry's Expert and Knowledge Keeper Hearings about how the program needs an overhaul. She said underfunding and structural problems in the delivery of essential services in First Nations communities, like policing, impact the vulnerability of Indigenous women and girls.  ""A part of it is underfunding but it's part of a broader structure that's really problematic,"" said Metallic. ""Current government policies that are being made today are resulting in the ongoing and exacerbation of poverty in communities and is putting communities at risk."" An essential service designation would secure regular and predictable funding, according to the report. ""We're always asking for the same recognition, resourcing and support that other police services get because we know and we understand the needs of our community,"" said Zacharie. ""For us, it's about being able to provide services to our communities. Why do we ever have to get into these negotiations? If we say we need something, shouldn't we have the resources to deal with an issue?"" The calls for an essential service designation has been echoed from Indigenous leaders including Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde and Quebec and Labrador regional chief Ghislain Picard. During the federal election campaign, the Liberal Party pledged to improve public safety in First Nations communities by co-developing a legislative framework for First Nations policing which recognizes First Nations policing as an essential service and to expand the number of communities served by First Nations policing. Since the First Nations Policing Program was created in 1991, 20 self-administered First Nations police services have closed across Canada and there hasn't been a new one created since 2008. Quebec officials met with First Nations leaders on Oct. 17 and will again in December to discuss the implementation of the Viens Commission's recommendations. ""Our government intends to do things differently in collaboration with its Indigenous partners, since they must play a fundamental role in the recommendations' implementation. We'll wait for the feedback from our Indigenous partners before we prioritize our actions on the recommendations,"" a statement to CBC News read. For families like the Morrisons, changes need to come sooner than later. ""It's not something that can just sit and be pushed to the side,"" said Morrison. ""That needs to happen now. It has an impact on the reality of Aboriginal women.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-indigenous-policing-program-1.5339727,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-inquiry-police-followup-1.5335784 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/first-nations-policing-1.4377733 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/viens-report-quebec-indigenous-1.5323214,N/A
363,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-17T20:45:50.416Z,Jury selected for Harvey Weinstein rape trial,"A jury of seven men and five women was selected Friday for Harvey Weinstein's rape trial after an arduous two-week process, setting the stage for testimony to begin in the next week. The final tally mostly erased a gender imbalance that, just hours earlier, led to complaints by prosecutors that the defence was deliberately trying to keep young women off the panel. ""They are systematically eliminating a class of people from this jury,"" prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said.  The defence said it wasn't specifically targeting young women, but didn't want jurors who were too young to understand the way men and women interacted in the early 1990s. ""That was a different time in New York and on planet Earth,"" Weinstein attorney Arthur Aidala said. Weinstein, 67, ambling out of the courthouse, didn't comment when asked his thoughts on jury selection. ""Ask Donna!"" he said, referring to lawyer Donna Rotunno. Three alternate jurors — one man and two women — were also chosen. They will sit through the trial and take the place of any jurors on the main panel who can't make it through to deliberations.  Weinstein, the former studio boss behind such Oscar-winners as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could face life in prison.  The tussle over juror gender comes amid a selection process that has been far from easy.  Weinstein's case has attracted widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement, as dozens of women have come forward over the last two years with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. That's made it tough for Weinstein's lawyers, prosecutors and Burke to find a fair and impartial jury.  Each day for nearly a week, whenever Judge James Burke introduced Weinstein to a new batch of potential jurors and asked if they couldn't be impartial, dozens of hands shot up.  Weinstein's lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can't possibly give Weinstein a fair trial. Cognizant of the media attention and the weight some people are putting on the case, Burke has cautioned potential jurors: ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."" Of more than 600 people summoned as potential jurors in Weinstein's case, some have marked themselves for disqualification by admitting they knew one of Weinstein's many accusers, had personal experience with sexual abuse or read Catch and Kill, a book by Ronan Farrow, one of the first reporters to bring the allegations against Weinstein to light.  There were others like supermodel Gigi Hadid, who reported for jury duty and wound up in the Weinstein pool, who even said they had met the defendant. One man's wife starred on a show that Weinstein's studio produced and said he couldn't be impartial. One woman said she couldn't be impartial because she has a ""close friend who had an encounter with the defendant in his hotel room.""  Another man was scratched for saying he couldn't be fair-minded because he had often spotted Weinstein in Tribeca, the lower Manhattan neighborhood that hosts an annual film festival. ""On several occasions I've seen him on the phone screaming at someone,"" he said of Weinstein. In the end, the jury includes the author of a upcoming novel that she describes as involving young women dealing with predatory older men. The defence, out of challenges, argued against including her on the jury, but Burke said she could serve. The defence then asked for a mistrial over her inclusion on the jury, but was denied. Weinstein lawyer Rotunno said the woman had lied on her jury questionnaire, but prosecutors noted she disclosed on the form that she was a novelist. That so many people in the running to be on the jury have had experiences involving Weinstein or his accusers speaks to the breadth of his alleged abuse, as well as the ubiquitous nature of celebrity in New York, where stars are frequently spotted by paparazzi and the public alike riding the subway, shopping for groceries and walking their pets. Then there have been other issues, including at least one instance of what jury consultants call ""stealth jurors"" — people eager to serve, especially on a high-profile case, because they hope to make a point or a profit.  On Thursday, Burke threatened to hold a potential juror in contempt of court for asking his followers on Twitter ""how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel.""  Opening statements are expected next Wednesday. The trial could last about six weeks.  During the phase of jury selection called voir dire, where lawyers attempt to size up people who have assured the judge they could be fair and impartial jurors, the lawyers' concerns were in evidence. Addressing a pool of prospective jurors Thursday, prosecutor Meghan Hast signaled concerns that the sight of Weinstein, who's been using a walker since back surgery last month, could influence their attitudes about him. ""Is there anything about Harvey Weinstein, looking at him today, that makes you feel that there's no way that man's a rapist?"" she asked. No one responded. Defence lawyer Damon Cheronis told the panel that they would hear testimony from Weinstein accusers who might get emotional and cry on the witness stand. He also asked the potential jurors whether they were familiar with the concept of ""victim shaming."" Another one of his questions: ""Does anybody think an individual could have sex with someone that they may not find attractive for reasons other than love?"" No one responded. Prosecutors plan to call at least four women to the witness stand who have accused Weinstein of violating them, but whose allegations weren't the basis for the New York charges. As jury selection was getting underway last week, California prosecutors charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting two women there, one of whom who is expected to testify in the New York case.  Burke ruled Friday that if Weinstein testifies on his own behalf, prosecutors can't question him about that accuser on cross examination. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-hadid-1.5426418 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-recusal-rejected-1.5420656,N/A
364,Anonymous,2019-11-23T11:00:00.320Z,"Despite murky future, N.W.T. mushers prepare for 2020 Arctic Winter Games","Is it really the Arctic Winter Games if one of the Arctic's most iconic traditional sports isn't there?  That's what's at stake as Alaska reconsiders its decision to keep its mushers home for the upcoming 2020 Arctic Winter Games next March. Officials with Team Alaska voted to forego mushing because they felt there wasn't enough competition in 2018 and don't want a repeat in 2020.  Though Alaska is re-evaluating that decision, the sport itself could be dropped in future games if low participation continues, according to the games' sport policy. Games officials decided in 2018 to examine whether the sport will continue.  In the Northwest Territories, mushers are preparing for the territorial trials next month, and hope Alaska will ultimately decide to send mushers to Whiterhorse.  ""I'm not convinced the door is closed,"" said Susan Fleck, from the Deh Gah Dog Mushers Club in Fort Providence, N.W.T.  ""We've been in contact with some Alaskan mushers who participated in the games in Hay River two years ago and they're very interested in participating,"" she said. ""It may be that there's some misunderstanding.""   Fleck agrees that the 2018 games didn't have enough teams participating. Only the Northwest Territories and Alaska ended up sending mushers after Nunavut and Yukon dropped out before the games started.  She knows mushing has deep roots across the North, with healthy interest in Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. She hopes more awareness could help bring in mushers to compete from places like northern Alberta, helping round out the field.   ""We know personally of dog mushers in Fort Chipewyan, Fort McMurray. If we can help them find ways to alert Alberta Sport that they are there and willing to participate, [mushing] can continue to go ahead,"" she said.  Regardless of who participates, Fleck believes mushing has an important role to play in the future of the games, and the games have an important role in the future of the sport.  For example, the upcoming trials will have 11 teams from across the territory, including from Tuktoyaktuk, Paulatuk, Fort Resolution, and Yellowknife, Fleck explained. At least three coaches from those teams have been champions at the Arctic Winter Games.    ""It's obvious the Arctic Winter Games are a really good way to promote sport development in dog mushing,"" she said.  ""There's lots of interest in dog sledding in all the jurisdictions. I think there are a few ways we can continue to have dog mushing in the Arctic Winter Games,"" she said.  The Northwest Territories Arctic Winter Games dog mushing trials are scheduled for Dec. 12 and 13 in Fort Providence. The community will also host its annual Christmas races on Dec. 21 and 22.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-dog-mushing-future-northwest-territories-1.5364048,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alask-dog-mushers-awg-2020-1.5358750,N/A
365,Éric Grenier,2020-01-21T09:00:00.484Z,Not all lanes will lead Conservative leadership candidates to the finish line,"The Conservative Party leadership race is starting to take shape, but there are only so many paths to victory each candidate can take — and limited space in each of them. Some candidates have a better path forward than others. To date, no one has yet met the bar to be classified as a ""verified"" candidate by the Conservative Party. Among those who have publicly declared their intention to run, only former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu have a good shot of meeting the party's stringent qualification requirements. Ontario MPs Pierre Poilievre and Erin O'Toole are expected to enter the race soon, while the decision of former Quebec premier Jean Charest is reportedly imminent. Other candidates could come forward between now and the Feb. 27 deadline for entry ahead of the June 27 vote. Each of them will be looking to identify a lane that takes them to the leadership, cobbling together like-minded regional and ideological groupings within the party's membership that are large enough to elect a leader. These lanes are not always well-defined — and some candidates can blow them apart. Maxime Bernier, the runner-up in the 2017 leadership race, did not have particularly regionalized support. Holding a libertarian worldview, Bernier also defied the old split between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform, the two legacy parties. But Andrew Scheer's lane was to draw support from the rural parts of the country and a mix of members from across the spectrum, pulling both from moderates like O'Toole and Michael Chong and social conservatives like Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux. Scheer was able to attract support from both of the old wings of the party in part because Bernier was an unconventional candidate. The contours of the current roster of likely candidates, however, looks less unusual. The candidate with the steepest hill to climb is likely to be Gladu, who lacks what could be a decisive factor in such a short race: a high profile. The two-term Sarnia–Lambton MP may be able to build support from ridings in southwestern Ontario, but will have some work ahead of her to break through. The second-choice backing of her supporters, however, could prove a hot commodity by voting day. But how about the others? What are their most promising paths to victory? MacKay's path to the leadership looks the most obvious. He has a few things working in his favour. He has the aura of electability, with polls showing he is more likely than some other candidates to stack up well against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. His standing as the last leader of the defunct Progressive Conservatives makes him the natural heir to the support of more moderate, centrist members. His dutiful years of service in Stephen Harper's cabinet might also make him acceptable to the Harper wing of the party. MacKay will likely have a strong and unopposed regional base in Atlantic Canada. Though there are only 32 seats in the region — all seats across the country will be weighted equally in the Conservative voting system — running up the numbers in this one smaller region could pay more dividends than narrowly leading a crowded field in bigger regions. He is already showing some support in other parts of the country, with endorsements from B.C. MP Ed Fast and Alberta MP Blaine Calkins. MacKay has the potential for growth as candidates are eliminated from the ranked ballot, particularly candidates like Gladu, O'Toole and possibly Charest, if MacKay's lack of fluency in French is not seen as too big of an obstacle. He already seems to be fishing in O'Toole's pond — both Fast and Calkins endorsed O'Toole in 2017. The clearest path to 50 per cent is to be seen as the Harper candidate — the person who most closely embodies the continuation of the Harper model, both in governing style and in party management. This person has a strong base in Western Canada and among the old Reformers, but is also acceptable to Conservatives in places like the Greater Toronto Area. Poilievre has the best shot at that title — and that makes him a potentially formidable candidate. The Ottawa-area MP has a ready-made base in eastern Ontario. His bilingualism will give him a fair chance in Quebec. Born and raised in Alberta, he also has the best claim to being the Western candidate. His team includes Jenni Byrne, Harper's former campaign manager, signalling a tacit (if not necessarily exclusive) endorsement from that camp. He has potential for down-ballot growth from O'Toole, whose supporters swung to Scheer over Bernier in 2017. If Charest enters the race, Poilievre could also peel votes away from him among members who believe the next leader needs to be bilingual. But there are still some open questions when it comes to Poilievre. Having played the role of partisan attack dog for his party, members may not see Poilievre as electable in a general election. His recent statements in support of both same-sex marriage and abortion rights could exclude him from getting the social conservative support that was a key component of Scheer's victory. And the entry of another Western Canadian into the race could scupper Poilievre's hopes of support in that part of the country. The need for one candidate to take the Harper lane is both Poilievre's best chance and greatest vulnerability, as being pushed out of that lane would cost him his spot as a front-runner. It is not immediately obvious which lane is Charest's. His standing as a former PC leader (from 1993 to 1998) is shared with MacKay, who helped create the modern Conservative Party but doesn't carry the political taint (in party circles) of also having been leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, as Charest was from 1998 to 2012. He could claim electability thanks to his profile across the country, flawless bilingualism and experience running (and winning) election campaigns.  But his regional base is likely to be restricted, even in his home province. The areas of Quebec that backed the right-leaning ADQ and CAQ during the Charest years are unlikely to warmly welcome their former opponent. Charest also faces the prospect of an ""anybody but Charest"" campaign, which could severely limit his growth potential. While O'Toole has a path to the leadership, it could be occupied by other candidates. His best results in the last leadership race came in the Maritimes, a region that is more likely to back MacKay. Representing a riding in the Greater Toronto Area is an advantage — there are more seats there than in B.C., Alberta or Atlantic Canada — but that is likely to be a hotly contested part of the country. O'Toole did not show great strength in the GTA in 2017, placing first in only five ridings on the last ballot before he was eliminated. His relatively lower profile and lack of fluency in French chips away at his perceived electability. But he does have the potential to be a consensus candidate — one that is acceptable to the broadest swath of the Conservative membership, like Scheer in 2017. The problem for O'Toole, however, is that being everyone's second choice only matters if enough voters list you as their first. He might be able to pull significant support from Gladu, MacKay or Charest, but only if he finishes ahead of them. Much will depend on the final roster of candidates and how the race unfolds. It is early days. But the initial signals suggest MacKay and Poilievre have the most plausible paths to winning the leadership before anyone has taken their first steps.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-next-conservative-leadership-1.5400959 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A
366,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-21T21:57:28.784Z,New North American trade deal bill coming next week: PM,"The Liberal government will table legislation to implement the trilateral trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico next week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced today. Trudeau, speaking at a news conference after a three-day cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, said pushing forward with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is the government's most pressing priority, as millions of jobs depend on the new trade pact. ""On Monday, we will present a ways and means motion, and on Wednesday we will table legislation to ratify the deal,"" he said. With a minority government, the Liberals need support from another party to pass legislation in the House. Trudeau expressed the hope that all parties will negotiate and come together on ratification. ""On NAFTA, those discussions will of course engage and activate as we accelerate, as we move forward with the ratification process in the House,"" he said. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his government's plans for ratification of the revised NAFTA ""What we are doing is reminding everyone in the House and across the country of how important it is to secure the most important trading relationship for future generations."" Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen said that while her party is ""the party of free trade ... we expect the Liberals to provide for proper due diligence by allowing Parliament to study the impacts that the deal will have on important sectors of our economy, such as auto, agriculture and aluminum."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also said New Democrats want to see the fine print. ""How can Canadians trust the Liberals to get this right when they spent months saying they had the perfect deal and mocked us for saying it needed to be changed?"" Singh said in a statement released by his office. ""Now they're trying to take credit for changes they said were impossible. ""[Canadians] can count on us to look carefully at this agreement. We're going to discuss it in caucus and in the debate in the house and see if it actually delivers for Canadians."" Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said his caucus members won't agree to swift passage of CUSMA unless they're convinced it's a good deal for Quebec. ""If Mr. Trudeau expects of us to go against what are obviously the best interests of the regions of Quebec, he will not be happy with my answer. It will be no,"" he said. ""There will be no fast-track, whatever it requires. It will not happen."" During the meetings in Winnipeg, cabinet ministers heard from expert guest speakers on the state of the economy, the fight against climate change and pressing global affairs. Ministers also drilled down on individual files linked to the government's top priorities. Ratifying the so-called NAFTA 2.0 — the trade deal known domestically as CUSMA — tops that list. ""This is an absolute priority, not only for the government but for our workers, our industries, people from all provinces,"" said Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez Monday. ""So I call upon the opposition to support us to make sure we ratify this as quickly as possible."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who led the NAFTA renegotiation talks and is in charge of pushing it past the finish line, noted that the agreement was ratified by the U.S. Senate last week and by Mexico before Christmas. ""Now it's Canada's turn,"" she said, adding that debate and ratification of the agreement is crucial for ensuring stability in the Canadian economy. New legislation on medical assistance in dying (MAID) is also at the top of the Liberal legislative agenda. Justice Minister David Lametti said this week he plans to table a bill in February. While not offering details on when a bill might be on the way, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said new gun control measures are another key government goal for the session. The government continues to consult with various stakeholder groups, municipalities and law enforcement agencies in order to keep a campaign commitment to allow communities to control or ban handguns, and to prohibit military-style assault weapons. Blair said Monday that the legislation must be flexible enough to adapt to different needs across the country. ""We know that the environments in different parts of the country are varied, and it's important, I think, to make sure that the laws that we bring forward are effective in every place in keeping communities safe,"" he said. As the ministers were holed up in closed-door meetings, they were also dealing with other pressing external issues. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says balance is crucial when dealing with changes to medically assisted dying legislation The government responded to a request from Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball to assist in snow clearing operations after a massive blizzard. About 300 troops were deployed to the province. Also hanging over the cabinet retreat were questions about Iran's willingness to surrender the flight recorders recovered from the crash of Flight PS752 over Tehran, which killed 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada. Iran initially said it would release the black boxes to Ukraine or France, but recent reports suggest that may no longer be the case. Today, Trudeau said Canada continues to ""pressure"" Iran to turn over the black boxes to a third country, such as France. ""It is not simply a question of having the right experts in place to analyze the black boxes. There is the question of significant technological requirements that cannot be done in Iran,"" he said. ""That is why we are calling upon Iran to release the black boxes to a reliable third country that has the technological capacity and personnel to properly analyze those boxes."" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne held a call Monday with the International Co-ordination and Response Group (ICRG) made up of representatives from Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom, the countries that lost citizens in the crash. In a readout after the call, Champagne said Iran had been co-operating with foreign experts in the investigation ""to date."" ""Members of the ICRG call on Iran to move the black boxes to a facility with all the technology and expertise required to quickly and reliably download and analyze the data without delay,"" the readout said. Trudeau will end the week with more meetings with his Liberal caucus in Ottawa.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-retreat-winnipeg-1.5433886,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medically-assisted-death-lametti-1.5432519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-pallister-liberal-cabinet-meeting-1.5432616 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/youth-businesses-climate-change-manitoba-1.5433047,N/A

The Eskasoni Winter Carnival has been running for decades as a fundraiser for the local Holy Family Parish. The pageant is one of the most popular events of the festival in Cape Breton. ""To have this as one of the biggest symbols of gender affirmation for people who are trans is a total success and a very historic moment, not only for Mi'kmaw people, not only for people in Eskasoni, but for transgender women and girls all across this world,"" said Geordy Marshall, who is with Pride Eskasoni. Marshall is also the communications person for the Eskasoni First Nation and sits on the organizing committee for the winter carnival. He said about two dozen participants spend a month working on things like public speaking and confidence for the pageant. They bond as friends to encourage each other and learn from elders. ""It's an opportunity for young women to learn who they are and learn from the finest women in our community to become women. It's almost like a coming-of-age type of event,"" Marshall said. So far, one transgender participant has signed up, Bella Marie Poulette. She and her sponsors decided she should wait until after the pageant to do interviews to make sure the pageant is fair for all participants and to allow her to have the same kind of experience as everyone else. ""She is excited and she's felt overwhelmed by all of this emotionally,"" Marshall said. ""She's just overfilled with joy. This is something she's dreamed of all her life to do."" The winter carnival will take place Feb. 20-23. Maryanne Junta, 19, won the title of queen in the 2016 pageant. She said she loves that transgender girls are now allowed to enter. ""Trans girls are girls and it shouldn't be any other way,"" she said. ""They should be allowed to join pageants, they should be allowed to go in the girls bathroom, because they're girls. They should be able to experience life as a girl, as they want to.""  Marshall said the community's reaction has been mixed.  ""There were people who celebrated and rejoiced on the wonderful day, but there's also a lot of people who expressed their transphobic beliefs and were totally against it,"" he said. Marshall said many transgender teens struggle with poor self-esteem, which is one reason being able to enter the pageant with other young girls is important. ""It's hard to live in a world where it's full of lateral violence and residual effects from residential schools and Indian day schools and colonization. A lot of these young girls deal with a lot of pressure in their lives,"" he said. ""This is one of the great things we get to celebrate as a community. We see all of their hard work paid off and we truly honour them on that day. Whether they're a crowned winner or not, they're all our princesses.""

RCMP Cpl. Jen Clarke said it appears his death was not suspicious. She said he was reported missing in the Saint John area late last summer. His body was found on Sandy Cove Beach on Sept. 8. Police are not releasing the man's name or his cause of death. Clarke said Nova Scotia RCMP would be assisting Saint John police to determine exactly what happened.  Last week, RCMP released a reconstructed image of the man's face after working with students in a forensic reconstruction workshop at the New York Academy of Art. Clarke said the Nova Scotia medical examiner's office had already been trying to identify the man with DNA analysis, and in the end the photo didn't factor into discovering who he was. However, she said investigators were impressed with the public's response to the image of the unidentified missing man and his clothing, of which police also released photos.  ""We're very appreciative of the amount of interaction we saw online — people trying to help and lending their ideas to the post, which is great,"" she said.   ""It was really overwhelming.

369,Paul Withers,2020-01-21T10:00:00.693Z,Software glitch damages part of new Canadian science vessel,"A software malfunction is being blamed for damaging a critical piece of equipment on board Canada's new offshore fisheries science vessel, Canadian Coast Guard Ship Sir John Franklin. Spooling gear on the starboard trawl winch took off on its own. The winch is used to retrieve heavy gear and nets deployed to gather ocean climate data and fish stocks on board the B.C.-based vessel. The coast guard said the damaged part will be replaced and the winch repaired when the ship heads into planned maintenance next month. At the time of the malfunction, no personnel was in the vicinity, spokesperson Benoit Mayrand wrote in an email to CBC News. An official with the Union of Canadian Transportation Employees said the malfunction occurred in the middle of the night during a patrol last November. ""The shipyard is aware of the issue and is taking responsibility and will complete the repairs under warranty,"" Mayrand said. Franklin was the first large ship built under Canada's national shipbuilding strategy and it was delivered last June. Seaspan Shipyard in Vancouver was awarded the contract to build three offshore fisheries science vessels in a $687-million project. CCGS Jacques Cartier, which will be based in Halifax, was turned over to the coast guard last November. The third vessel, the John Cabot, is expected to be delivered this summer and will be based in St. John's. Seaspan said the sophisticated software and systems on its vessels are tested and approved by independent third parties before delivery. ""As with all large, complex systems, it is not uncommon for minor software anomalies to occur. These are addressed in routine maintenance windows. This is a minor issue isolated to the Sir John Franklin,"" spokesperson Amy MacLeod wrote in an email to CBC. Last March, Franklin struck a breakwater as it was returning from its first week of sea trials. To ensure the ship met its June delivery date, the rudder and propeller were removed from the third offshore science vessel, the John Cabot, and installed on Franklin. ""There are no delays to the delivery of the CCGS John Cabot due to the breakwater incident and no financial implications for the Government of Canada,"" Mayrand said. No parts were needed from the Cabot to repair the Franklin starboard trawl winch. In 2018, CBC News revealed portions of the Franklin hull were re-welded after an inspection uncovered a series of defective joints.

370,Anonymous,2019-04-12T17:25:57.534Z,D.C. lobbyist gets probation as a result of charge stemming from Mueller probe,"A Washington political consultant initially entangled in the Russia investigation was sentenced Friday to three years of probation for illegal lobbying and skirting the ban on foreign donations to U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural committee. Sam Patten, 47, and prosecutors had asked for leniency, citing his co-operation in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and other ongoing probes. The sentencing comes as federal prosecutors in New York continue to investigate foreign donations to the presidential inaugural committee and as the Justice Department has been cracking down on foreign lobbying violations. Separately, prosecutors filed charges Thursday against former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, accusing him of lying to the government to conceal his own work on behalf of the government of Ukraine. Craig denies wrongdoing and is set to appear in court later Friday. In Patten's case, he pleaded guilty to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act for lobbying on behalf of the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party. He also admitted to orchestrating a $50,000 US straw-donor scheme to purchase tickets from the inaugural committee on behalf of a wealthy Ukrainian client. Federal law bars such committees from accepting foreign donations, a fact Patten has admitted he knew when he violated the law. Later, Patten also misled the Senate intelligence committee about his conduct when asked to provide documents and testimony as part of the panel's investigation of Russian election interference. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was most troubled by Patten's lies to the committee and likely would have given him a short prison sentence under other circumstances. But she credited him for co-operating with the government and for taking responsibility for his actions, something the judge said ""doesn't happen every day in this courtroom."" Jackson said Patten's conduct was also ""markedly different"" from that of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who carried out a years-long conspiracy to launder money, evade U.S. tax authorities and covertly influence American policy-makers on behalf of Ukrainian interests. Jackson imposed a sentence earlier this year that led to Manafort facing about seven years in prison. ""There are reasons why your sentence is not going to be like his sentence,"" she told Patten, as she also imposed a $5,000 US fine and 500 hours of community service. Prosecutors didn't fully detail Patten's co-operation, nor say whether he has helped as part of the inaugural committee investigation. In court papers, Patten's attorney, Stuart Sears, said his client wasn't part of a larger scheme to funnel foreign money to the inaugural committee and isn't a Trump supporter. Patten helped with the Manafort investigation and was slated to testify in his case before Manafort pleaded guilty last year. The two men shared an associate, Konstantin Kilimnik, who was Patten's business partner and a Manafort co-defendant. The FBI said Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, an allegation he denies. Kilimnik, who lives in Russia, was indicted alongside Manafort on charges of witness tampering but has not appeared in a U.S. court.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sam-patten-sentence-dc-1.5095972,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/patten-lobbyist-charges-mueller-1.4806623 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/boag-barr-trump-mueller-report-legacy-history-mitchell-1.5092777 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ex-obama-wh-counsel-charged-with-lying-in-lobbying-probe-1.5095149 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/barr-house-committee-1.5090145,N/A

At a council meeting on Monday night, the elected members voted unanimously to limit the number of rooms landlords can rent to four, but there are some exceptions. ""Over the last few years, we've been getting quite a few complaints from our residents,"" said Mayor Laurie Boucher. ""We were asked by the community to try to do something about it. And what we decided on as a council is, 'Can we limit the number of rooms that are being rented?'"" The answer is both yes and no. The new lodging home bylaw only applies to new home or ""lodging"" construction. Landlords who already own homes and rent out to multiple tenants will be unaffected. There are more than 90 old Victorian-style homes, with multiple units inside, in the downtown area of Antigonish that will be ""grandfathered in,"" or listed as legal/non-conforming. Boucher said those landlords will continue to be allowed to rent as they choose, but the new bylaw will require they be registered with the town, which will trigger a fire and safety inspection. Boucher said that should address the concerns of students who have complained in the past of living in unsafe buildings. As for neighbours who complain about party houses, Boucher said council is trying to balance their concerns with those of landlords and students. ""Being a university town, we absolutely need places and residents for our students to live. In September, our population doubles in size,"" she said. ""But it's our due diligence to make sure that people in our community are safe and that people have the right to live in their homes and communities without being disturbed. ""We have two bylaw officers that are very knowledgeable within the town and know what's going on."" Boucher said the town is working on an education campaign for students to remind them of the existing noise bylaw.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/town-of-antigonish-cracks-down-on-landlords-who-over-rent-1.5435186,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/air-canada-flight-u-s-dollar-charge-website-1.5433619 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/eskasoni-pageant-allows-transgender-girls-women-1.5435132 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/movie-making-way-of-improving-newcomer-students-english-1.5435150 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/municipality-of-argyle-oyster-farm-ocean-eelgrass-environment-developer-19-spots-lease-1.5433555 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/n-s-police-watchdog-investigating-walmart-incident-1.5435174,N/A
372,Melody Lau,2019-01-31T16:59:34.055Z,Why do women make up only 1/3 of Juno nominees?,"Last March, Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award recipient Denise Donlon gave a rousing speech at the Juno Gala Dinner and Awards ceremony that pushed for gender equality and inclusivity. Referring to a women-only industry event that took place earlier that week, Donlon said, ""We saw some sad numbers on female representation in every business, at the executive level and on boards and in politics. Frankly the numbers, they're a market fail."" Donlon concluded her speech by asking the men in the room — the men who were dedicated to creating more balance in the music industry — to stand up. The result: the majority of the room was on its feet. While visually disheartening to see how much space men still took up, their pledge to bettering the Canadian music scene was a meaningful gesture.   But in order to see that vision come to fruition, gender representation needs to be evident in the Juno nominations — and that is still a work in progress. This year, women only make up 24.7 per cent of the overall nominations, with an additional 2.8 per cent for female-fronted groups with mostly male members, and 8.8 per cent for duos, trios or groups with a mix of genders. In comparison, 63.3 per cent of this year's nominees are men. It's a number that hasn't fluctuated too drastically over the years — last year, 24.1 per cent of the overall nominees were women — but it's simply too low (and not rising fast enough) to ignore. (The calculation process looked primarily at names listed in the nominations. For example, the Jack Richardson Producer of the Year Award counted the producers who are named and not the artist with whom the producer worked.)  In all the major non-genre-based categories — such as single of the year, album of the year, artist of the year and breakthrough artist and group of the year  — women are outnumbered by men. In the following categories, no women were nominated at all: rock album of the year, rap recording of the year, dance recording of the year, Jack Richardson Producer of the Year, recording engineer of the year and album artwork of the year. Below is a visual breakdown of the Junos nomination process. While some awards — such as single of the year, international album of the year and album of the year — factor in sales figures in order to narrow down its nominees (which are later voted on by academy delegates or the CARAS board of directors), other more genre-specific categories are open to submissions and are then subjected to two rounds of voting by a jury of music industry members. (Full disclosure: some members of CBC Music are on the Junos jury for certain categories.) For a detailed explanation of how each category is broken down, you can head to the Junos website. This lack of representation isn't, and never is, due to a lack of talent, though. The last year alone saw rap group the Sorority carving out a feminist future for hip hop, Charlotte Day Wilson helming her own project by co-producing and co-engineering her Stone Woman EP (which is up for R&B/soul recording of the year), Céline Dion re-entering the soundtrack arena with the Deadpool 2 cut ""Ashes,"" and producer Wondagurl landing some big tracks on rapper Travis Scott's chart-topping 2018 album, Astroworld. Not to mention notable releases from Metric, Ralph, Alice Glass, Dilly Dally, Partner, the Weather Station, Marie Davidson and U.S. Girls, all of whom either scored only one nomination or none at all. To circle back to the Walt Grealis Special Achievement Award, for which Donlon was only the second woman to be named a recipient, this year's honouree is Duff Roman. The Humanitarian Award is being given to David Foster, and the Canadian Hall of Fame inductee is Corey Hart. All deserving names, but the backwards slide into an all-male lineup of recipients so far just ensures that the rooms Donlon was referencing continue to look overwhelmingly unbalanced. When asked about this at the Junos nominations press conference on Jan. 29, president and CEO of CARAS, Allan Reid, responded: ""It's something that we certainly look at every year. We don't have gender categories so everyone is basically competing in the same group, but I think it's something that is also going to take a little while to change.""  Reid also notes that the breadth of women in music represented at this year's Juno Awards broadcast will be encouraging for up-and-coming acts. This year's host is Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, and newcomer Bülow was announced as a performer in addition to Loud Luxury and Corey Hart. ""I think having a balance of someone like Sarah, who is this iconic woman who's had this incredible career to someone like Bülow, who's just coming onto the Junos stage for the first time — I hope is inspiring for a lot of young women out there.""  McLachlan, who was also at the press conference, was both surprised and saddened by these statistics. ""I feel like there's so many more great women coming out and getting recognized,"" she says. ""So I found that number surprising. I thought it would be a little bit more equal."" On the surface, it may look like Canada's biggest, most celebrated stars are mostly male: Drake (who hasn't submitted his work to the Junos in recent years), the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Justin Bieber and Michael Bublé. And while McLachlan is the face of the Junos this year as the host, there is still a wealth of diversity beyond this year's roster of performers and nominees. So how do we ensure that there's space for them?  ",https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos/features/why-do-women-make-up-only-1-3-of-juno-nominees-1.4995742,[],N/A

Women are seeking advice in greater numbers thanks to what some are calling the “Jolie effect.” “I’ve never quite heard it termed that before, but yes, since she’s come forward to share her story, we’ve definitely seen a spike in the referrals to our genetic counselling and also for families seeking assistance,” Dr. Shannon Salvador, a gynecological oncologist at the Jewish General Hospital, told Daybreak on Thursday. ""It's not something that I think was generally known outside of people who had already been seeking treatment for gynecological cancers."" After going public two years ago with the fact that she got a double mastectomy, the Oscar-winning actor revealed earlier this week she had undergone more preventive surgery, having her ovaries and Fallopian tubes removed in hopes of reducing her risk of cancer. Her mother died of ovarian cancer, and her maternal grandmother also had ovarian cancer — strong evidence of an inherited, genetic risk that led the actress to undergo preventative surgery to try to avoid the same fate. Only a small percentage of women inherit the same faulty gene as Jolie. Known as BRCA1, the name stands for ""breast cancer susceptibility gene."" The average woman has a 12 per cent risk of developing breast cancer sometime during her life. Women who have inherited a faulty BRCA1 gene are about five times more likely to get breast cancer. Listen to the full Daybreak interview with Salvador and Nathalie Sofer, an NDG resident who underwent surgery herself after her mother died from ovarian cancer.

On Thursday, the division chief for fire prevention and investigation with the Moncton Fire Department was walking through an area that could pass as a campground — in a quiet downtown neighbourhood. ""It's cold,"" said a man leaving one of the approximately 15 tents that dot the area that is part of a former military base. ""A little too cold to be sleeping in tents."" Many of the people emerging from the campsites were suspicious of LeBlanc. One asked, ""Are you here to make sure we're stepping on our cigarette butts?"" LeBlanc replied, ""I'm just here to make sure you guys are OK."" Gary Mills, 39, has been bouncing around the streets and Moncton's two shelters. ""I don't have anyplace to go,"" he said. ""Three-and-a-half years ago I became homeless. My ex got everything and I got homeless. I've always worked for a living and I got nothing."" Mills said he has worked ""on the oil rigs out West"" and at a battery plant and wants to find a job. ""I'm thinking if I can't find happiness around here, like I've been here for two years now on and off, and I'm thinking I don't want to be here anymore."" Mills said he hasn't been able to find work because he is ""too occupied doing something else."" When asked, ""Is it an addiction thing you're dealing with,"" he replied, ""No, not really, it's just a homeless thing."" ""I came to the shelter two years ago, and I've had my wallet stolen there, all my clothes stolen over and over. I've had everything stolen from me over and over, and I can't have so much as a backpack."" On the other side of the tent city, a thin woman in flip-flops is sweeping the area in front of her tent. There is a chair outside and colourful windmills attached to the trees with bungee cords, turning in the wind. She has been living there since late May and told LeBlanc the neighbours in the house behind her love her because she is clean and quiet. The day before, an RCMP officer told her she had to pack up and move within 24 hours. She told LeBlanc she has nowhere to go and has been on a waiting list with New Brunswick Housing for an affordable apartment for 25 years. She wants to get back into customer service work. ""Talking to these people, I don't know who wouldn't feel bad about this,"" LeBlanc said. ""There's some very fine people living here that are trying hard to get a better life, and sometimes it's just not working out."" As he walked back to his vehicle, LeBlanc had tears in his eyes. ""Twenty-five years she's been waiting and working and going through, obviously, a lot of personal stuff, some drug dependencies,"" he said. ""But it is heart-wrenching. ""Just a perfectly normal person going through some hard times. It is hard. It bothers you."" In the past year, LeBlanc doesn't think a whole lot has changed. ""I wish I could say that I believe that things are getting better but since last year, I believe there's actually been more people that are out in the street,"" he said. ""Some of these people are actually from out-of-town that are … coming into the city as there's a lot of the services readily available."" LeBlanc and his fire prevention team check regularly on about 55 vacant buildings that are boarded up because they are unsafe. Homeless people constantly try to find a way in as they seek shelter. On Dominion Street, there are three old homes in a row, each one boarded up. When LeBlanc pulled in to check on the properties, he finds two large homemade tents, a bicycle, bicycle trailers and shopping carts filled with someone's belongings in one of the backyards. ""Those are brand new,"" he said of the tents in the yard. ""I was here yesterday."" ""They have taken shelter here as some of them are likely being moved from the Albert Street area."" Moncton serves eviction notice to homeless people at tent site ""What you see there — that's their whole world. That's all they have."" LeBlanc expects these new residents will also be told to move along in the next couple of days, but he doesn't expect they will go far. ""You know that probably within the next couple of weeks you're going to run across them somewhere else. Every few days we run into the same people, just somewhere else — different areas of the city."" Both emergency shelters, House of Nazereth and Harvest House, are at capacity since the eviction notices were issued to people in tent cities in Moncton. Harvest House is prepared to accommodate people on mats or cots, but executive director Cal Maskey said it will still require government funding to pay extra overnight staff. A new shelter announced by the House of Nazereth has run into delays, and there is no indication when it will open or how many beds it will have. ""As it stands right now, I don't believe there's enough places for these people to go,"" LeBlanc said. ""And right now there's probably well in excess of 100 and some people around in our streets. So they need to go somewhere. If they have no shelter above them, they're going to be in our neighbourhoods."" According to the latest count by the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee, 134 people are living on the streets in Moncton, compared with 120 at this time last year. LeBlanc believes shelters shouldn't be a long-term solution to homelessness.  ""What we need to look at as a community is we need affordable housing and we need to go one step beyond [shelters],"" he said. ""We need to be able to turn these people around. To rehabilitate them and then steer them in the right direction.  ""What I see everyday, like where we just came from — these people really don't deserve that. This is Moncton 2019, and we have have [more than] 100 … people living on the street.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/charles-leblanc-moncton-fire-department-homeless-tent-city-1.5298120,[],N/A
375,Kate McGillivray,2016-06-13T03:24:46.464Z,"Heavy police presence during Grand Prix hurts sex workers, says Montreal group  ","Campaigns that focus on sexual exploitation during the Grand Prix weekend are both misleading and harmful to people who work in the sex industry, says Stella, a Montreal-based support group for sex workers.  Human rights groups and the government recently teamed up to crack down on exploitation, particularly during race weekend. But according to Stella director Sandra Wesley this effort is endangering sex workers. She argues that a heavier police presence puts sex workers more at risk, not less, with the fear of being arrested leading them to make unsafe decisions.  ""Women might decide to carry fewer condoms with them, out of fear that they'll be used as proof that they're engaging in sex work,"" said Wesley.  ""We will also see women who work on the street who will not take the time to chat and determine if it's safe before getting in the car.""     At the beginning of June, several Montreal humanitarian groups introduced the ""Buying sex is not a sport"" campaign, writing in a press release that the Grand Prix weekend is ""sadly recognized as devastating in terms of human trafficking."" Wesley said that while sex workers might see an increase in clientele, the evidence of a spike in exploitation or trafficking during the weekend just isn't there. ""There are a lot of studies that show that sporting events do not increase exploitation or trafficking,"" said Wesley. She says fears about exploitation are often pinned on large events like Formula 1 or the Olympics.  According to a Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women report published in 2011, ""No evidence shows that big sporting events cause an increase in trafficking.""  Nathalie Khlat, president of Beacon of the Freed, one of the partner organizations in the ""Buying sex is not a sport"" campaign, argues the lack of evidence can be chalked up to the clandestine nature of sexual exploitation itself, which makes it harder to document.  ""We have trouble getting numbers. When we do have them, we see just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Khlat.    The Montreal police rolled out their own campaign last week, promising to up police presence at ""various strategic locations"" and placing posters downtown reminding people that buying sexual services is illegal in Quebec. ""[This weekend] there are a lot of people in Montreal, it attracts a certain kind of clientele, and we're here to intervene,"" said Chief Insp. Johanne Paquin of the SPVM.  Wesley says the increase in police presence is keenly felt by sex workers.  ""We've heard about police raids, we've heard about arrests,"" she said.  Wesley underlines the importance of not mixing notions of sex work with sexual exploitation.  ""If there are more clients for sex workers, in the same way there would be more for restaurants or hotels, that doesn't necessarily mean that these are clients who are coming to exploit women or be violent,"" she said.  She would like to see police consult directly with sex workers so they can understand their needs better.  ""If we really want to get serious about talking about exploitation, then we need to listen to sex workers and not people who are against sex work as an industry.""   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stella-sex-work-grand-prix-exploitation-1.3631636,[],N/A

Jennifer Wood, hired by Health PEI, started this week, and is handling some of the more than 2,300 patients in the area who are still without a family doctor. ""We are really happy about that,"" said Lisa Gallant, of the South Shore Health and Wellness Committee and owner of the pharmacy in which the medical clinic is located. ""We probably get 20 phone calls at the pharmacy every day, people worried about a follow up of chronic conditions, where can they go to be seen, who's monitoring their blood work, where did their X-rays go, where did their MRI go? People are very anxious about having no one to follow their chronic medical conditions."" The nurse practitioner will only be seeing former patients of Dr. Joey Giordani, who used to work in Crapaud but left. Files will be kept on each patient and follow-up appointments will be scheduled when needed. ""It's a relief,"" said 91-year-old Crapaud resident George Nicholson. ""The fact that you can make an appointment and come and not have to sit here for two hours, that means an awful lot to somebody my age."" Walk-in clinics will also continue to operate four times a week for several hundred other residents in the South Shore area who have no primary care provider. For local resident Sarah MacQuarrie, having a nurse practitioner in the community is reassuring. ""You know, it's different to go to a place where nobody knows anything about you at all,"" she said. ""If you trust somebody, if you trust the system, it's part of the solution and it's a solution we're looking for."" The nurse practitioner is working three days a week to start, and will eventually work full time. She'll stay in that role until a physician is recruited for the area, according to Health PEI. The South Shore Health and Wellness Committee said they need one more nurse practitioner and a physician to fill the gaps. ""This is going to go a long way in addressing a lot of the health-care issues that have not been properly looked after in the last 18 months just because of the nature of a walk-in clinic,"" Gallant said. ""Obviously not everyone's going to be able to be seen by one nurse practitioner, but certainly her services will go a long way in providing that continuity of care that's been missing."" The wellness committee said it will meet with the health minister next month to discuss next steps.

This year, Hallmark Channel introduced two new movies to its holiday lineup which it described as Hanukkah films.  Holiday Date centres on a woman who hires an actor to play her boyfriend over Christmas, but worries about keeping up their secret when she learns he's Jewish. The second film, Double Holiday, tells the story of a career-focused woman whose Hanukkah plans are derailed when she is forced to help plan her office Christmas party. Earlier this week, Hallmark also bowed to public pressure when it reversed its decision to pull ads featuring same-sex couples. Watch the trailer for Hallmark Channel's new film, Holiday Date. Zlotnick says the films felt more like Christmas movies with Hanukkah elements than movies specifically dedicated to Hanukkah. ""First of all, they don't have Hanukkah in the title and they involve so much Christmas,"" she told Day 6 host Brent Bambury.  Second of all, it really does seem like the Jewish characters in both movies are portrayed as in opposition to the norm. Hanukkah is highlighted in these movies as strange or different elements in the plot, so to me that means that these aren't really Hanukkah movies."" Zlotnick said Holiday Date also relies on stereotypes that Jews are suspicious or can't be trusted, which could easily have been avoided. ""If I were in charge … you could take almost any one of the Christmas movies that they already have and pretty much keep the plot, but make the characters Jewish and have them decorate with blue and white instead of green and red, have them gather around a menorah instead of a Christmas tree, and everything would be great,"" Zlotnick said.  ""Even if you aren't Jewish you would understand that movie.""

Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recorders for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, Champagne reached out to his counterpart today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes] be sent where [they] should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes contain the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and have information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attack that struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respected on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran. ""In the interests of privacy, I won't go into too much detail ... but I can tell you that the wishes of the family are paramount and we will ensure this is the case in all cases,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to meet with some family members of the crash victims on Monday evening in Winnipeg. On Friday, Trudeau announced that the government would provide $25,000 per victim to assist families in the aftermath of the disaster, while insisting Iran must provide compensation.

""I don't know if this is ever going to sink in,"" Larry Walker Sr. said Tuesday, his voice cracking during a telephone interview from his home in Mission, B.C. ""When it happened there were no words and I couldn't talk. Emotional time, speechless time."" Walker is a career .313 hitter over 17 seasons, including 10 with Colorado. WATCH | Walker gets call to Hall: He made his major league debut in 1989 and played six seasons with Montreal before signing a free-agent deal with Colorado. He received 54.6 per cent of the votes last year in his ninth year on the ballot, up from the 34.1 per cent he received in 2018. ""What he's done is just truly amazing and I never ever dreamt that I'd ever be talking about my son like this today ... about my son being inducted into the hall of fame,"" he said. ""And to me it was just the pinnacle … I never dreamt it would ever happen."" Walker's father said his son should have been voted to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., years ago. WATCH | Larry Walker speaks to The National after his election: ""But to get in on the last vote, that's better than missing the last vote. I'm very proud about that."" Larry Walker's path to the hall of fame began as a peewee player with the Ridge Meadows Minor Baseball Association in B.C. when he was about 11 or 12, his father said. ""He always had a natural ability to play baseball,"" his dad recalled. Jeff Scott, vice-president of the association, said Walker's success shows that even though baseball doesn't have a ""spotlight"" on it like hockey does in Canada, there's a chance that any kid can play in the best league in the world and make it to the Hall of Fame. ""It just shows kids that no matter where you're from or what your background is that there's hope for you to be a superstar,"" he said. Larry Walker Sr., 81, was a baseball coach and his son's instructor during his peewee years. ""I was his coach for two or three years but I didn't coach him too much,"" he said. ""It was a thing where I found that your kids listen to you less than they listen to somebody else when they're on the ball field. You know what I mean? It just goes in one ear and out the other ear."" He said his son's achievements will make him a role model who younger kids look up to.

380,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-15T23:23:07.691Z,Stephen Harper resigns from Conservative Fund board as leadership race heats up,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper has resigned from the board of the Conservative Fund Canada, the financial arm of the national party, just as the party's leadership race begins in earnest. A spokesperson for the party confirmed Harper has stepped back from the position, one he assumed after his party's 2015 electoral defeat. Maclean's magazine was first to report the development Wednesday. ""The fund thanks former prime minister Harper for his tireless work on the board, and wishes him well. His contributions, support and wise counsel to the board over the past many years has been appreciated,"" said Cory Hann, a spokesperson for the party. The board, composed of other senior Conservative operatives such as former Sen. Irving Gerstein (a self-described ""proud party bagman"") and Ontario Sen. Linda Frum, helps raise funds and sets the budget for the party and its leader. Frum, who was appointed to the Senate by the former prime minister, told CBC News Wednesday she is still a member of the board. Harper loyalists in the party declined to comment on his departure Wednesday. Maclean's magazine columnist Paul Wells reported Wednesday that Harper stepped back from an official party role so he could be more actively involved in the upcoming leadership race. The magazine, citing an unnamed source, said prospective leadership candidate Jean Charest sought Harper's endorsement in a December phone call but the former prime minister refused to give it. Harper told Charest, a former leader of the now-defunct Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, that ""the party is no longer the party [you] led,"" the magazine reported. The more moderate PC Party merged with the conservative Canadian Alliance in 2003. Speaking to CBC's Power & Politics today, Wells said Harper's decision to leave the board was ""accelerated"" as it became increasingly clear Charest is readying a run for the leadership. ""It's pretty clear that Stephen Harper does not want Jean Charest to be the leader. As a long-time senior Conservative said to me, 'Harper is quitting the fund board so he can block Charest.' That wasn't my language, that was volunteered to me by one of my sources,"" Wells said. ""Harper cannot himself announce, 'I block thee, Jean Charest.' All he can do is speak his mind, say what he thinks and use his considerable clout within the party to rally opinion. Charest gets to decide if he wants to run against those headwinds."" The Conservative Fund has been a source of controversy in recent weeks. A source close to the board told CBC News in December that board members were blindsided by a report that party funds had been used to send the children of outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer to private school. The fund was in the process of looking into the matter when Scheer abruptly quit his post as permanent leader. The fund's decision to probe the spending and Scheer's resignation were ""not viewed as coincidental,"" the source said. Dustin Van Vugt left his job as executive director of the party during the fracas over who knew what about the spending. Van Vugt, who brokered the tuition deal with Scheer, has since been replaced by Jamie Girard. The news of Harper's resignation comes on the day former senior Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay announced he'd join the race to replace Scheer as leader. It is not yet known if Harper is prepared to endorse one of the candidates vying for the top job.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mackay-tweets-leadership-1.5427544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-iran-change-1.5426140 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-party-new-executive-director-1.5407538,N/A
381,Tom Ayers,2020-01-23T10:00:00.421Z,"As CBRM violated in-camera rules, documents show governance was 'pretty sloppy,' says prof","The Nova Scotia government is making changes to its training materials for municipalities after CBC News reported on Cape Breton regional council's in-camera practices. In 2018, Cape Breton Regional Municipality admitted it breached the Municipal Government Act by dealing with its own pay in camera four times over a period of two years. There is no penalty for breaching the Municipal Government Act, but the province now says training materials for councils are being revised to specifically forbid discussing pay behind closed doors. Those training materials are expected to be provided to CBRM as soon as possible and will be rolled out to all councils after the general municipal elections scheduled for this fall. An access-to-information request by CBC for correspondence covering the two years in which council pay was discussed in camera show some senior staff were OK with it, but does not clearly say whether any staff advised against it. ""One takeaway is that the governance of CBRM is not a well-oiled machine,"" said Tom Urbaniak, a political science professor at Cape Breton University. ""It's pretty sloppy."" In 2015, CBRM had to change its practices to start notifying the public about in-camera meetings after it was discovered council had held 31 secret meetings over a span of 22 months. The municipality was not saying ahead of time when it was meeting in camera or what was being discussed, and that is not allowed under the law. In 2018, after CBRM revealed it had been discussing council remuneration in camera, officials said they believed council could do that under rules allowing in-camera discussion on personnel matters. After CBC reported that, the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a ruling saying council members are not staff or personnel. The department said remuneration for elected officials must be discussed in open public meetings. In a recent email, the department said it provided CBRM with a training session on the Municipal Government Act — including a session on in-camera meetings — in April 2018. Departmental documents don't specifically say council pay can't be discussed in camera, but the training materials emphasize that municipal government should be conducted in public as much as possible. Urbaniak said access-to-information documents from CBRM at the time do not show whether staff, the mayor and councillors understood that. ""Even though there are ambiguities in the Municipal Government Act, the expectation is that our elected officials will err on the side of transparency,"" he said. Despite that, the documents show the municipality's chief administrative officer and clerk believed council pay could be discussed in camera. The documents also show the solicitor seemed to disagree, but they also show he deferred to the clerk on that. Urbaniak said that's interesting, but isn't as important as what council members thought. The documents show very little, if any, discussion among councillors on whether they could — or should — discuss their own pay behind closed doors. ""Councils themselves have to take responsibility for their effectiveness as governing bodies,"" Urbaniak said. ""These are elected officials and they have a public trust to uphold."" The issue was discussed briefly at a public council meeting in March 2017, when the mayor decided not to refer a discussion on remuneration to an in-camera session after senior staff disagreed on whether that was allowed. In any event, council pay was discussed in camera three times after that — twice after the April 2018 training session by the province. ""There was that one little experiment with going public and then it went back into confidential session,"" Urbaniak said. ""Unfortunately, the documents don't give us a clear indication about the sequence of events leading from that public meeting to putting this back into confidential session."" Mayor Cecil Clarke said after the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a clear ruling late in 2018 that council pay must be discussed in the open, CBRM changed its practice. ""When the department had made an indication it should be public, it quickly became public and that's the standing practice and will be going forward,"" he said. Clarke said CBRM is more open than it used to be and he said council goes beyond the requirements of the legislation, for instance, by holding public budget consultation sessions. ""Council ... as far as procedures and activities, has evolved and council will evolve because some of the complexities of issues today require to have that level of openness and transparency, and that's a good thing,"" he said.

""I think LGBTQ is a Liberal term. I don't talk about people that way,"" the former Conservative staffer told CTV's Power Play Wednesday night. ""Do you think that's a choice or do you think it's biological?"" asked host Evan Solomon.  ""I think it's a choice,"" responded Décarie. ""How people are behaving, it's one thing. I think government has [the] responsibility to encourage the traditional value that we have had for the past years."" I vehemently reject this message. I will not serve under someone whose leadership pitch is that someone's sexuality is something to be ""fixed"". I am full on tired of this type of shit defining the conservative movement in Canada. Giddyup, you're going to have to go through me. <a href=""https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc"">https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc</a> A number of Conservatives who are expected to run for the leadership were quick to distance themselves — and the party — from Décarie's stance. The Conservative Party voted to end its official opposition to gay marriage in 2016, more than a decade after it was legalized. ""Being gay is not a choice and nobody should be running for office on a platform to roll back hard-won rights,"" tweeted former cabinet minister Peter MacKay after a clip of the interview began racking up thousands of views online.  Erin O'Toole, another former cabinet minister who is musing a bid, called Décarie's statement ""ridiculous,"" and Sarnia MP Marilyn Gladu, who like MacKay has publicly signalled a leadership run, said it was ""unacceptable."" Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre, who had been expected to make a run for the top job until today, said Décarie does not speak for Conservatives. ""Being gay is not a choice. Being ignorant is,"" he tweeted.  In a followup interview with CBC on Thursday, Décarie apologized for offending people and said he didn't understand the visceral reaction to his comments. ""I was told that I was offensive, and if I've been offensive in the eye of some people I'm sorry about that,"" said the the former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper. ""Those who are very liberal should be joining Mr. Trudeau."" Décarie said that, if he's elected prime minister, he'd work to ""clarify"" same-sex marriage in Canada. ""I think it's important that marriage should be exclusive to men and women and all other unions are civil unions,"" he said. Décarie said that while he's received a lot of backlash over the past day, a number of social conservatives have reached out in support. ""There are many social conservatives in our party and many Canadians want [a] true conservative voice to speak and stand up for them. So I feel I am their voice and we'll see who will be elected,"" he said. ""The so-cons are mobilized and they feel that I could be representing them."" It remains to be seen how much sway the social conservative wing will have on picking a leader to replace Andrew Scheer, who had his own socially conservative leanings. Both Décarie and Ontario MP Derek Sloan, who announced his intentions to run on Wednesday, are pitching themselves to the social conservatives in the party. In the 2017 leadership race, with the help of groups like Campaign Life Coalition, former MP Brad Trost came in fourth place in a field of 14 candidates. ""I am full on tired of this type of shit defining the conservative movement in Canada,"" tweeted Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel Garner on Wednesday.

The actions are the latest escalations in a labour dispute that has now stretched on more than a month. About 700 workers from the Co-op refinery were locked out in early December. At a news conference Tuesday, the union said it would escalate job action. On Friday at 4 a.m. CST, union members started fencing off a fuel and propane station in northeast Regina. Unifor said the decision was made after the union asked the company to return to the bargaining and the company did not want to take concessions off the table.  Kevin Bittman, president of Unifor local 594, was on the picket line Friday. ""They've locked us out of our employment, so today FCL [Federated Co-operatives Limited] employees aren't going into their work,"" he said. Bittman said any employees inside were allowed to leave and that the union talked to the fire marshalls and opened some gates for emergency vehicles only. The Co-op Refinery Complex said in a statement the blockades puts public safety at risk. The refinery said the site has large amounts of fuel and propane, and the distribution is critical to heat homes and livestock and construction sites. It's always possible Unifor could be hit with another injunction, Bittman said. ""The legal system is there for a reason and if somebody has a problem with what we're doing, or think it's illegal, that's the avenue they have to go in,"" he said. Bittman said he is not sure if the fences are legal. He said they have a right to picket and that is what they are doing.  On Thursday, Unifor posted a video, titled Meet the Scabs, on its Twitter page. The video names and shows images of about a dozen people. As of Friday morning it had more than 26,000 views. Some photographs appeared to be taken off of social media while others were photographs of people arriving or at their work. Each person is labelled 'Scab at Co-op Refinery.'  The union said previously that it would ""shine a bright light"" on replacement workers in Regina. Unifor made a similar video in Gander, Newfoundland during a labour dispute there.  Scott Doherty, Unifor's lead negotiator and executive assistant to the president, said that being a replacement worker does not grant a person privacy. ""We believe we have the right to do it,"" Doherty said. ""I think people knew that we were at some point in time going to do this."" The Co-op Refinery Complex said in a release that the video was ""disgusting"" and that it was disappointed but not surprised by the release of the video.  ""[Replacement workers] do not deserve to be treated this way. Unifor's behaviour and these tactics are not acceptable,"" Gil Le Dressay, vice president of refinery operations, said in a release.  Le Dressay said the refinery will protect the safety and well-being of people in the video.  ""It is abundantly clear that Unifor's Toronto-based leadership have no respect for anyone but themselves and that their tactics are not in line with Canadian values,"" the release said.  Doherty said he believes Unifor members are still getting support from the public, even when some people don't like what they are doing.  ""Frankly scabs should really think twice about whether or not it's worthwhile for them to take the jobs of somebody who has been disrespected by their employer — as these individuals have,"" he said.  Bittman said the union is not putting people's safety at risk by identifying replacement workings. ""There's lots of work out there. They don't need to be going inside and doing that,"" he said.  Bittman says his members aren't feeling any pressure to stop picketing.  ""The members are solid. I'm up and down the lines every day and they're 100 per cent on board,"" he said. ""We're not being greedy and they just need to put a fair deal on the table.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/meet-the-scabs-union-labour-dispute-1.5421854,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/unifor-defends-video-identifying-scabs-at-dj-composites-1.4816496 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-co-op-refinery-lockout-1.5418113 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/trucker-accuses-union-disobeying-injunction-1.5412650,N/A

But now, the U of S centre will be able to work toward fighting African swine fever, or ASF. ""It's now affecting several countries in Asia and has made its way into Europe, even in Belgium and the Czech Republic,"" said Volker Gerdts, VIDO-Intervac's director and CEO. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced this week that VIDO-InterVac has now been approved to work with African swine fever, of ASF. That means vaccines for the virus can be tested in Saskatoon. VIDO-InterVac is the first non-government facility to be approved to work with the ASF virus in Canada.  Before being approved to work with the virus, the lab had sent more than 30 vaccines to Winnipeg to be tested. ASF has infected over 60 per cent of Asian swine, and they are starting to die.  For countries that export pork products, like Canada, ASF could have have severe economic repercussions. ""As soon as you have an outbreak in your country your ability to trade with other countries is lost,"" said Gerdts. ""We're exporting almost 70 per cent of our pork to other countries."" Vaccine research is conducted in one of the centre's high-level labs where scientists are usually clad in protective suits and hoods. ASF can't be transmitted to humans so the scientists working on the vaccines only need to wear hair nets, gowns and gloves. The vaccines VIDO-Intervac sent to Winnipeg in the past were eventually tested on pigs. Gerdt says that the lab on the U of S campus will be able to test vaccines on the animals in about a year. The centre participated in an international conference, organized by the federal government. The intent of the conference was to share ASF research and co-ordinate an international effort to eradicate the fever. ""The government of Canada is taking a leadership role to protect our pork industry, economy and Canadians' jobs,"" said Marie-Claude Bibeau, minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food in a release announcing the research.

On the final day of a two-day hearing, the judges peppered a Crown lawyer Tuesday morning with questions about the conduct of a private detective described as a ""traitor"" by a lawyer for Sandeson. Samson, a Dalhousie University student, was killed in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. The hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway yesterday in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer, Ian Smith, asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes live blogged from court. Smith focused much of his arguments on Bruce Webb, a retired RCMP sergeant who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment. Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe. The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of Webb's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb. MacLellan said Arnold found Sandeson's fair trial rights were not infringed upon because the witnesses' evidence would have come out even without Webb having spoken to police. She also noted Arnold determined that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. Judges on the three-member Court of Appeal panel spent much of yesterday afternoon and this morning asking MacLellan about Webb's actions. Justice David Farrar questioned Arnold's characterization of Webb ""merely"" telling the police to requestion the witnesses when describing the impact of his actions. ""This is a breach of a duty that Webb had to his client … and it's during the trial process,"" said Farrar. MacLellan reiterated that Arnold found police did not do anything wrong in their handling of Webb's information. She said he considered Sandeson's right to a fair trial against the defence's request for a mistrial. She noted a mistrial is a ""remedy of last resort,"" and a particularly undesirable one seven weeks into a trial.  ""Other less drastic remedies have to be considered,"" said MacLellan. ""The trial judge is in the best position to determine in the circumstances of what has happened here if a mistrial is the best remedy."" Smith also argued that a search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant was not lawful, because there were no ""exigent circumstances"" that justified their actions. But MacLellan argued the situation was urgent, as at that point it was a case of suspected kidnapping and therefore an ongoing concern. She noted Sandeson's first statement to police, which he gave voluntarily, raised concerns with police when they compared his answers to his text messages and found out he had lied about meeting Samson that night. He said police searched Sandeson's apartment because they believed it was the last place Samson had been seen. Smith also claimed that Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officers' aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. MacLellan noted that kidnapping is ""not a bloodless crime,"" and that the investigation was at that point still a kidnapping. She said the phrasing of the officers' questions — such as, ""Why won't you help him, Will?'"" — suggested Samson was still alive. ""It shows that they're very sincere in their belief that this is still a kidnapping and it's nothing more than a hunch, or serious fear, that Samson is dead,"" said MacLellan. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years. In his closing arguments, Smith said a new trial would allow Sandeson to apply for a stay of proceedings. If that remedy wasn't available to him, Smith said Sandeson could apply to have certain evidence excluded from a new trial, such as the evidence from Blades and McCabe.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-snowmobile-crash-new-ross-lunenburg-county-1.5434326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-provincial-park-development-golf-eastern-shore-1.5433792 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/prince-andrew-high-school-name-change-online-forum-1.5433374 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-outbreak-province-sexually-transmitted-infection-1.5433651,N/A
388,Anonymous,2020-01-22T02:41:07.922Z,U.S. officials confirm first U.S. case of China coronavirus,"A resident of Washington state who returned from a trip to China last week has been diagnosed with the new coronavirus that has sickened hundreds in China, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday. The man returned to the Seattle area in the middle of last week after travelling to Wuhan in central China, where the outbreak began. The Snohomish County resident is in his 30s and was in good condition Tuesday at a hospital in Everett, outside Seattle. He's not considered a threat to medical staff or the public, health officials told reporters on a conference call. ""This is certainly not a moment of panic or high anxiety,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said later at a news conference. Officials are now tracing the man's movements and contacts in China and the U.S. He has told health officials he did not visit any of the markets in Wuhan that are implicated in the outbreak and did not know anyone who was sick.  ""We are still in the early days of this investigation, both domestically and abroad,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the conference call. The man did not have symptoms when he arrived at Seattle-Tacoma airport last Wednesday, but contacted health officials on Sunday when he began to feel ill, officials said. Samples were sent to the CDC overnight Sunday, and the man's diagnosis was confirmed on Monday. ""The risk to the public is very low,"" Messonnier said. The CDC later said it will add Atlanta's international airport and Chicago O'Hare to the list of three airports already screening for the illness — New York's Kennedy International, Los Angeles and San Francisco. What's more, officials also will begin forcing all passengers from Wuhan to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S. The agency also said it expects more U.S. cases of the coronavirus. More than 1,200 travellers have been screened so far, and none has been referred for testing. The CDC had previously said it has developed a test to diagnose the new coronavirus that it plans to share with domestic and international partners. The virus, which can cause coughing, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia, has infected 440 people in 13 Chinese provinces, according to China's National Health Commission Wednesday morning. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to nine. Separately, China's eastern Zhejiang provincial health authority said a total of five cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed as of noon Tuesday local time. Chongqing city also confirmed five cases of infection, the city's health authority said on Tuesday. As the death toll from the mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed and new cases surged, authorities fretted about the added risk from millions of Chinese travelling for the Lunar New Year holiday.  The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday that the new coronavirus was likely to spread. ""More cases should be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days,"" said WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. WATCH:  Hong Kong scientists warn about containing coronavirus promptly Based on current information, an animal seems to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak. Jasarevic said. ""Reports suggest that infection can cause mild to severe disease and be fatal in some. Based on current data, some new cases seem to experience milder diseases which is within the milder end of the spectrum of symptoms caused by respiratory illnesses."" The WHO tweeted that it will hold an emergency committee on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and what recommendations should be made to manage it. So far in China, the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although isolated cases have also been reported in Shanghai and Beijing. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and now the U.S.  Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, also confirmed its first case, a woman who had returned from working in Wuhan, on Tuesday. Taiwan, which has close economic and people-to-people links with China despite political tensions, on Monday set up an epidemic response command centre to co-ordinate the island's response to the virus. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further. Countries in Asia and around the globe have begun body temperature checks at airports, railway stations and along highways in hopes of catching people carrying the virus. The measures are part of a widening effort aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, another coronavirus that started in China and killed nearly 800 people, paralyzed transport and damaged Asian economies. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. China's often secretive Communist government was blamed for making SARS far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work of WHO. This time, China's leader Xi Jinping has led calls for tough measures, ordering that ""party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first."" At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were being checked. Virtually anyone in a public role, from traffic policemen to bank tellers, along with many riding public transport have donned protective masks. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters Monday that there are no reported cases in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out over the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News on Sunday that ""the overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low.""  Canada has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the volume of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low, PHAC said. PHAC said it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the past 14 days.   A spokesperson for the Vancouver Airport Authority said Tuesday the new measures have not yet been implemented.  If an ill passenger is referred for quarantine, their temperature could be taken as part of the assessment.   One case has been detected in Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points, with many visitors from China expected to arrive during the holidays. The number of Chinese tourists has risen steadily in recent years, with more than nine million visiting last year. Japan will require visitors arriving from Wuhan to fill in health forms, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said. WATCH: Coronavirus could spread during Lunar New Year travel rush, WHO warns Japan confirmed its first patient last week, a man in his 30s who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from Wuhan. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said it has tracked down 41 people who had contacts with the patient and is monitoring them. It says none has developed pneumonia symptoms. Brendan Murphy, Australia's chief medical officer, said flights from Wuhan are being met by biosecurity staff and by state health officials in New South Wales who are distributing pamphlets in English and Chinese to all passengers describing the symptoms of the disease and asking them to identify themselves if they have any. Australian health officials said a man was placed in isolation in Brisbane after developing a respiratory illness after traveling to Wuhan but has now recovered. Russian airports have stepped up screening of travelers arriving from China too, airport officials said on Tuesday. At least four Russian airports - Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo in Moscow, as well as airports in Yekaterinburg and Irkutsk - have introduced screening measures to try to identify infected passengers, Russian airport officials said. The virus was a threat to Russia, deputy health minister Sergei Kraevoi was cited as saying by the RIA news agency. Russia's consumer health regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, advised Russian tourists who planned to go to China to refrain from visiting Wuhan and to steer clear of zoos and of markets selling animals and seafood. The regulator said it could not rule out the possibility of the infection spreading to Russia, but evaluated the risk of a widespread outbreak in Russia as low, the Interfax news agency reported. It was also cited as saying that a testing system to diagnose the new coronavirus had been developed in Russia and that laboratories would start receiving it by the end of the week. Regional authorities have already been briefed on measures they need to take to reduce the risks of an epidemic. More than 1.5 million Chinese citizens visit Russia each year, according to Rospotrebnadzor.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187,N/A

390,Yvonne Colbert,2019-09-20T11:12:30.896Z,Peeling paint on your white Toyota? Help may be on the way,"Peeling paint has plagued some Toyota owners, and now the automaker says it will do something about it. But just what it will do is not yet clear. Toyota Canada told CBC News this week it plans to follow the lead of Toyota USA, which is offering a ""voluntary customer support program"" for owners of affected vehicles.  ""We will be launching a similar support program for impacted customers in Canada,"" Toyota Canada spokesperson David Shum said in an email. Shum provided no other details, but said that once the program is ready, owners of all affected vehicles will be notified by mail.  The Toyota USA notification went out recently to affected owners in that country. The company acted in response to reports of peeling paint on certain vehicles with the original factory-applied ""blizzard pearl"" or ""super white"" paint colours. ""These reports indicate that vehicles with these specific paint colours, applied during the vehicle manufacturing process, may experience paint peeling on exterior metal body parts,""  the notice said. It said the problem may occur ""when sunlight over time degrades the adhesion between the factory-applied paint primer coat layer and the base metal electrodeposition layer causing the paint to peel from the metal body panel."" Rachel Mosley, who lives in Prospect, N.S., was the first to bring the story to CBC's attention. Her 2011 RAV4 had small paint peeling spots that continued to grow. ""I'm not able to wash the vehicle because as soon as I wash it then the paint comes off,"" she said in September 2018. She complained to Toyota, but like others, was told the warranty on her vehicle had expired. Mosley is pleased Toyota is finally taking responsibility and said she's looking forward to the details of the program. Aisha Alam's six-year-old son was the first to notice the paint peeling on her 2013 RAV4 with white ""blizzard pearl"" paint in June. ""He said 'Mom, your car is broken,'"" said Alam, who lives in Kitchener, Ont. It was then she noticed that the paint had come off on the driver's side of the vehicle. ""It's a lot worse now,"" she said. ""There's a huge chunk of paint now missing on the sunroof and there's random places all over where it's just starting to chip."" Alam said she spoke with several Toyota representatives and dealerships, and was told by a representative earlier this week that she could ""possibly"" get 50 per cent of the cost of repairing her vehicle. But she said that was not acceptable. She's relieved to hear that Toyota will be doing something, and made a suggestion as to what that should be. ""Toyota should take the whole car and repaint it properly,"" she said, noting the problem is not caused by owners and the peeling isn't isolated to just one area. Neither Toyota Canada nor Toyota USA has released details of the program. The mailout to affected customers doesn't say whether vehicles will be completely repainted, whether Toyota will pay the entire bill, or exactly what years and models with the specified white paint will be covered. It does reference those who previously paid for their own repairs and outlines a process for those customers to be reimbursed, but it doesn't say whether they will get all of their money back or just some of it. George Iny, director of the Automobile Protection Association ⁠— a consumer advocacy group ⁠— said he is pleased and surprised to hear Toyota Canada plans to repair the vehicles. ""What we would like to see is lifetime coverage but a one-time repair,"" he said. ""You come in, we look at your vehicle no matter how old it is and we fix it in those areas that one time."" He said he expects Toyota to pay 100 per cent of the cost to repair damaged areas. Iny said that because many of the affected vehicles are older, it's important for owners to update their contact information by either going into a dealership or calling Toyota Canada.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/automaker-peeling-paint-customer-support-1.5290488,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-politicians-react-trudeau-blackface-1.5290323 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cape-breton-university-transit-buses-1.5289558 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/alana-paon-office-dispute-house-of-assembly-management-commission-1.5289919,N/A
391,Paul Tukker,2020-01-18T17:00:00.235Z,They're taking over a small town Alaska newspaper — for $20,"It seemed too good to be true — take over a beloved local newspaper in a scenic small town, for free? Turns out, it wasn't free. It's been sold for $20. ""My accountant said I've got to put some number on the contract,"" said Larry Persily, the soon-to-be-former owner and publisher of the Skagway News in Skagway, Alaska.  ""So, $20 ... I'll get a pizza out if it."" Persily's been running the paper from Anchorage since he bought it a little over a year ago. In November, he decided to pass the torch — and put word out that he wanted to give the whole operation away, for nothing. That news went viral. He heard from people all over Alaska and the rest of the U.S., and Canada. He also heard from interested people in Australia, Israel and Europe. Impressive, considering the paper serves a community of about 1,000 people. ""An amazing number. More than I expected,"" Persily said. He quickly ruled out anybody lacking newspaper or journalism experience. But that still left a good pool of plausible candidates, he said. ""It really came down to just kind of a gut feeling,"" he said. ""I wasn't looking for the Pulitzer Prize-winning greatest journalist in America, I wasn't looking for someone who thought they were going to change the world with investigative reporting, or start doing videos ... I was trying to find someone who I thought was really sincere about wanting to make a life in a small town."" He found them just outside Anchorage, in Chugiak, Alaska. ""We've kind of been on cloud nine, and we couldn't tell anyone for a while,"" said Gretchen Wehmhoff, a part-time teacher and journalist who's now set to take over the Skagway News with her friend Melinda Munson. The two longtime Alaskans were named as the paper's new owners on Friday. Wehmhoff recalls hearing about the gig last fall. ""Melinda actually was the one that talked me into it,"" Wehmhoff recalled. ""And when she first sent me an e-mail, I was like, 'Oh yeah, you're funny.'"" Munson — also a teacher and part-time journalist — wasn't joking. Soon they were huddled in a together in a classsroom putting an application together. ""Why not? There were more reasons to do, than to not do,"" Wehmhoff said.    ""My rule has always been that if somebody gives you a free paper, you say yes,"" laughed Munson. ""I live by that rule."" Wehmhoff calls it a dream job. ""We both love journalism, and we both love serving the community. And for me, I would rather do a small paper versus a large paper,"" she said. ""And I've always wanted to work in journalism where we were our own boss."" ""Amen,"" Munson said.    It's no secret, though — keeping a small-town newspaper afloat these days is tough, and getting tougher. Just ask Persily, who's had a long career in journalism. ""You're seeing it around the country, where newspapers, admitting the challenging economics, are going to nonprofit models or something different than the traditional one ... because it just doesn't work anymore."" Still, he's got faith in Munson and Wehmhoff — that's why he chose them to take over. ""I wish them well. I hope it works. I actually put in the contract for the $20 that I will be happy to mentor and coach and do everything I can to help, for no charge, for a year — because I care about the town,"" he said. ""I'm sure we'll have problems along the way, but I expect this will work out well."" Munson and Whenhoff say they're not planning any major changes, at least in the short term. But Whemhoff says they are thinking about the future. ""We've got some great ideas for expanding it digitally, expanding maybe perhaps the involvement with young people there, student journalists, as far as teaching journalism,"" she said. They're planning to hold a community meeting when they arrive, to talk to the locals and answer questions. ""We just want the community to feel comfortable,"" Munson said.  They're due to arrive in Skagway in early March — just in time to cover a borough assembly meeting.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owners-giveaway-1.5431784,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owner-giveaway-1.5368236 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-cabin-fire-helicopter-rescue-1.5377523,N/A

393,Richard Gleeson,2019-11-21T13:00:00.810Z,Giant Mine cleanup team says no to compensation claims,"After considering dozens of claims for compensation totalling millions of dollars, the team overseeing the cleanup of Giant Mine just outside of Yellowknife has arrived at a total amount it feels should be paid out for damages caused by the cleanup — zero. The claimants include the City of Yellowknife, boaters and the Yellowknife Historical Society. They want to be compensated for damages they say they are going to suffer when access is closed off to areas around the Giant Mine townsite including a city boat launch, the historical society's museum, and the Great Slave Sailing Club's boat yard. In filings with the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board, the cleanup team says it needs to close off the area to remove contaminated soil and sediment, put a covering over contaminated lake bottom and build a water pipe out into the lake for a new water treatment plant it is constructing. No one from the federal cleanup team or the City of Yellowknife was available for an interview for this story. In an email response, the city said it is ""eager to work with the Project and the Government of the Northwest Territories to avoid, or mitigate, any impact the Project might have on residents by exploring any and all options."" In filings with the land and water board, the city says that, until recently, the federal team overseeing the cleanup estimated the closure would continue for years. The team now says it will be far shorter. It says it is planning to build a new boat launch at the sailing club in an effort to avoid any interruption of people's access to Great Slave Lake while the existing boat launch is shut down. The biggest claim for compensation is being made by the City of Yellowknife. It wants to be paid $1.3 million for each year public access to the boat launch and sailing club areas is interrupted. The city is also claiming the full $34.5 million cost of replacing an aging underwater pipeline it uses to draw the city's drinking water from the Yellowknife River. In its response, the federal Giant Mine team says the city is asking to be compensated for work it wants done. The team said it initially planned to clean up the site to an industrial standard but, at the city's insistence and an additional cost of $35 million, the team is now cleaning it up to a residential standard. In its response, the team points out that the federal government has agreed to pay three quarters of the cost of replacing the drinking water pipe. It says the pipe has to be replaced because it's 50 years old, not because of the cleanup project. Members of the sailing club and boaters who use the city launch at Giant also filed claims. The sailors said the sailing club is the only place they can crane their boats in and out of the water, and if it's shut down for years it would render their boats worthless. ""Boaters, sailors and others navigating on water do not fit any of the categories, and are not eligible to make compensation claims,"" wrote the project team, referring to categories defined in the Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act. ""They cannot make a claim on the sole basis of their boating and sailing activities."" The sailing club sued for lost revenue, including fees for membership, boat storage and sailing lessons. The cleanup team noted the lease agreement the club has with the city allows for the lease to be terminated with six months notice to allow for remediation work. The same provision is in the lease between the city and the Yellowknife Historical Society for the museum site.

394,Pam Berman,2020-01-22T20:06:45.710Z,"So far, pads and tampons not part of Halifax region's budget","Halifax regional council has dug in its heels over the provision of menstrual products in municipal facilities such community centres, pools and arenas. Next year's operating budget for the facilities was presented Wednesday, but did not include the $230,000 needed to provide the products and install dispensing equipment. ""Staff have missed the boat on this, these are essential,"" said Coun. Tony Mancini. ""It's 2020 right? Let's remind everybody what year it is."" Councillors were particularly upset that money for the menstrual products wasn't included in the proposed budget, but the increase for three new employees in corporate communications was covered. ""This has ended up as an item that we have to struggle and plead and mount a case for,"" said Coun. Lisa Blackburn. ""I just don't think it sends a good message."" Blackburn pointed out that menstrual products are being provided at all 14 branches of the municipality's library service without a significant impact on its finances. ""It should have been baked into the budget,"" said Blackburn. Finance officials said a staff report on where the funding will come from has not made it to the audit and finance committee, so the item could not be included. The annual ongoing costs for menstrual products would be $220,000. Coun. Shawn Cleary had another solution. He asked for a report on cutting $267,000 — the cost of the staff increases. Cleary pointed out Halifax already has 22 people in corporate communications. ""That's a lot for a city our size,"" said Cleary. The municipality's director of corporate and customer services, Jerry Blackwood, said communication officers do not just deal with the media, but help with special projects and emergency situations. ""The increased staffing was based on a consultant's review of where we need to up our game,"" said Blackwood.

395,George Maratos,2020-01-19T12:00:00.792Z,This Yukon teen bikes to school year round — even in -40 C,"How cold is too cold when it comes to riding your bike in the winter? It's a question that 13-year-old Phineas Pearson of Whitehorse, a dedicated winter cyclist, doesn't know the answer to.  ""I guess –50 would be too cold. I've never biked in –50."" This week, despite the temperature hovering around –40 C, he still hopped on his bike and rode to school. He's the only student at F. H. Collins who rides every day, no matter the weather. ""I do this because it's something I enjoy and in the cold temperatures it really wakes you up and gets you ready for school,"" he said.   ""I had an exam the other morning and when I came to school, I was very awake and normally I would be very, very tired.""  Pearson comes by his enthusiasm for biking honestly.  Both his parents are avid cyclists and the bicycle has been his go-to mode of transport since he was in kindergarten. At age five, he would hop on his dad's extra-cycle, an adult bike that has an attachment on the back specially designed for smaller riders. Just two years later, Pearson was riding alone to school. ""That was really hard for me, but they need their independence,"" said Phineas' mom, Georgi Pearson. ""We've always biked as a family and I'm proud of the fact that he just does it. It's just kind of how we get around."" Living in downtown Whitehorse, Georgi says they rarely have to use a car. ""If we go out the door, there's a good chance we're bringing a bike with us."" For the past week, the roads in Whitehorse have been quieter than normal. The city is under a cold snap like it hasn't experienced in years, and many people have elected to park the vehicle and stay inside. Not Phineas. On Tuesday, just before noon, he had an exam. And while most high school students would probably have been doing some last-minute cramming, Phineas was more focused on making sure he was geared up properly. ""I have to wear snowpants, a large winter jacket, a sweater, hats, mitts and a buff — not necessarily in that order,"" he said. ""A good jacket is definitely the most important."" Phineas says he doesn't really notice the cold except on the bridge of his nose, which is exposed at times. He says the cold is harder on the bike than him. ""It seizes up about halfway to school and gets really hard to pedal,"" he said. ""But the experience of biking in –40 isn't as unbelievable as you might think, it's just like going for a walk in the cold."" The bike Phineas rides is not cheap, and it can withstand the elements of a Yukon winter. It's a fat bike, and comes equipped with special gloves on the handlebars called pogies, that provide warmth. The main feature is the bike's extra-wide tires, designed for comfort and control. ""It feels kind of like driving a tank, and does feel very powerful,"" he said. Georgi says on top of giving her son independence the biking also allows Phineas to exercise without even realizing it. ""He's a book reader, and cycling is a good way for us to get him to have some physical activity without him maybe realizing he is,"" said Georgi. ""He probably does know that that's our ulterior motive.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bike-winter-high-school-fat-bike-yukon-year-round-1.5431709,[],N/A
396,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-16T16:32:18.723Z,"No one will be untouched by a warming planet, scientists say","On Wednesday, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released their annual report on global temperatures and climate conditions — 2019 was the second warmest year on record, and the past decade was the warmest ever. These types of temperature milestones are the norm now; every month it seems another record is set, and every year we reach another global warming milestone.  In fact, the hottest years on record have all occurred since 2005, according to the report.  But scientists say rising heat is about more than just numbers; behind those statistics are consequences for people, their livelihoods and our delicate ecosystems. Climate change is costing cities as they try to adapt and mitigate. Farmers are facing increasing challenges, which can lead to consumers paying more for food. Extreme weather disasters are on the rise in Canada and costing insurance companies, leading to higher premiums. People are dying in heat waves which are set to become more frequent as the planet warms; and hurricanes are stalling, meaning more people are in danger for longer periods of time.  ""In my line of work, we do track the numbers and we do try to quantify the behaviour of the climate system, but ultimately what really matters is where it intersects and impacts with the people we love and the things we do,"" said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). In our normal, day-to-day lives, the effects of a warming planet may not be so evident to most Canadians. But to some, it's all too real. The most dramatic changes are found in the north. The region is warming almost three times faster than the planet as a whole, resulting in record-low sea ice levels in the Arctic and melting permafrost. These occurrences have consequences. They're taking a toll on ecosystems — and on the people who have called the cold, icy area home for centuries. Inuit are losing their homes. They are losing their way of life. They are falling through the rapidly thinning ice while hunting. The warming is also affecting the mental health of people who had cherished longer winters and persistent cold. To people who have long relied on the consistency of the cold north, the change is all too real. Farmers are also particularly vulnerable to climate change. ""Some people who work in weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture … are seeing [climate change] on an annual basis, and they're seeing [it] through greater extremes, and they're also seeing it in the greater variability, the wild swings,"" said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.  Phillips' annual list of Canada's top ten weather stories cited the terrible farming season in the Prairies in 2019. The weather went from dry before the planting season even began for many, to too wet from June to August, followed by an early snowfall at the start of harvest time in September. This meant a lot of crops remained unharvested. John Guelly, chair of the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said the 2019 growing season was ""the harvest from hell.""  Guelly, who has been a farmer for the past 30 years just northwest of Edmonton, plants canola, wheat and barley, with 1,000 acres of crops.  ""In our particular region, where I farm, it's actually been the fourth really lousy harvest season we've had in a row,"" he said. ""It's definitely taking its toll on people."" But not all the challenges have been the same. In 2018, smoke from the B.C. fires reduced sunlight, for example. And with climate change forecast to create drier conditions in some regions, this may be a sign of things to come. ""If you'd asked a farmer before Christmas what they wanted for Christmas, it was 'Can the growing season be normal next year?'"" Guelly said. "" What's normal anymore? We're not sure."" The fires raging in Australia are just a recent example of the challenges a continuously warming Earth will present. To date, 28 people have died, including two firemen, and millions of animals are thought to have perished.  Then there are hurricanes. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian sat almost immovable above Abaco Island in the Bahamas for more almost 24 hours, killing at least 70 people. Heat waves killed an estimated 1,500 people in France in 2019. The good news is this is far below the 2003 heat wave that killed an estimated 30,000 across Europe, with 14,000 in France alone. And here at home, a heat wave killed 66 people in Montreal in 2018. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), an international humanitarian medical organization, believes places like South Asia and the Pacific region, the Middle East, the Sahelian Belt, and Southern Africa are particularly at risk. Carol Devine, a humanitarian advisor at MSF focusing on human health and climate change, said she's concerned about what the future holds.  ""Vulnerable people tend to become more vulnerable, and climate change exacerbates health issues,"" she said.  ""Climate-sensitive diseases — that concerns us,"" said added. ""All these pieces interconnect somehow: climate-sensitive diseases, water and food insecurity, malnutrition related to drought or micronutrients or salinity coming into crops."" She's seen certain diseases move into areas that hadn't faced them before, leaving some local doctors unable to adequately treat patients. ""There are already so many vulnerabilities, so what's to come?"" she said. While not all weather events are a result of climate change, climate change can exacerbate them. It upsets a delicately balanced Earth system. And scientists are getting better at teasing out weather from the changing climate, improving attribution.  But, without curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the future contains a lot of upheaval and big impacts on people's lives. ""No area will be immune from it,"" Phillips said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-2019-1.5427586,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ice-free-arctic-1.5291966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/australia-bushfires-1.5414325 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/blackrock-investment-climate-change-1.5426465,N/A
397,Anonymous,2020-01-21T23:53:32.293Z,Trump impeachment: Who will be making the case for and against the U.S. president in the Senate trial,"As the Senate impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump begins in earnest this week, those arguing for and against his removal from office are gearing up for a contentious battle. Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid approved by Congress as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress in the ensuing probe. Seven House impeachment managers will make their case as to why the president should be ousted. Trump, meanwhile, will be defended by several high-profile lawyers. Republican and Democratic senators will sit and listen to each side, acting as jurors. The presidential impeachment trial — only the third in U.S. history — will be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who has little actual power over the proceedings. Impeachment trial begins with clashes over rules and evidence Here are the key figures whose actions will help determine whether the 45th president of the United States will be removed from office: These seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives were chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make the case against Trump, making them de facto prosecutors: A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is chair of the House intelligence committee and the lead  impeachment manager. For many, he has become a familiar face of the proceedings, leading the investigation into the allegations against the president. He presided over the House impeachment hearings in the lead-up to the Senate trial, earning the scorn of Trump — and a nickname: ""Shifty Schiff."" Nadler is chair of the House judiciary committee, which drafted the two articles of impeachment against Trump. Nadler was also a member of the judiciary committee during president Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998. Nadler was an earlier supporter of a Trump impeachment, declaring last August that his panel would hold impeachment hearings related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. A member of the House judiciary committee, Jeffries is also House Democratic caucus chairman. The former litigator is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, and is seen as someone who could eventually replace Nancy Pelosi A former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan who also worked as a lawyer, Crow is a freshman member of Congress. He is the only manager who is not a member of either the judiciary or intelligence committees, but, as the New York Times noted, is considered a leading voice on national security. A former Houston judge and newly elected congresswoman, Garcia became one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in U.S. Congress. She has also worked as a social worker, legal aid lawyer and as a city controller for Houston. She serves on the House judiciary committee. A judiciary committee member, Lofgren, who has been in Congress for almost 25 years, is the only manager who was involved in the two other presidential impeachment proceedings, against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Specifically, she worked on the congressional staff investigation of Nixon's impeachment. (Nixon resigned before he was impeached). Demings is a member of both the judiciary and intelligence committees, but is the only manager without a law degree. However, she does have law enforcement experience. She worked for the Orlando Police Department for 27 years, becoming the force's first female police chief in 2007. Trump's lawyers will present their case for the president and will be allowed to cross-examine the impeachment managers, along with any witnesses. Cipollone is the current White House counsel, who advises the president on all legal matters. He leads Trump's defence team but has spent most of his career in commercial litigation and doesn't have extensive experience with trials. But he has worked on numerous high-profile cases, including the lawsuit against credit-reporting company Equifax after a massive data breach. The personal lawyer to Trump, Sekulow also represented the president during the Mueller investigation. Sekulow hosts a radio talk show and is chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a non-profit that advocates for religious freedoms. A former prosecutor and independent counsel, Starr's 445-page report formed the basis for the House impeachment of Clinton in late 1998. The former appeals court judge had been appointed to investigate the Clintons in relation to a real estate deal known as the Whitewater controversy, among other matters, but his probe widened to include Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Harvard law professor has been part of the legal team for a number of high-profile defendants, including O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, Jeffrey Epstein and Mike Tyson. A self-described Democrat, Dershowitz nevertheless says he doesn't believe the actions of the president necessitate his removal from office. The former federal prosecutor succeeded Starr as independent counsel during the investigation of Clinton. But Ray declined to prosecute Clinton in connection with perjury and obstruction charges. The former attorney general of Florida and a longtime Trump supporter, Bondi joined the White House communications team late last year on a temporary basis to help shape the administration's defence strategy around the House impeachment investigation.  The former federal attorney has handled organized crime and racketeering cases, including the nine-month trial and conviction of the underboss of the New England Mafia. Raskin and her husband, Martin, were both part of Trump's legal team during the Mueller investigation. Herschmann is a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, a law firm that has represented Trump in numerous cases over the last 15 years. He's also a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The U.S. Constitution mandates that a Senate presidential impeachment trial be presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, a position currently held by Roberts. Appointed to the high court by George W. Bush in 2005, Roberts's role in the Senate trial is mostly ceremonial, as he has limited powers over the proceedings. He won't be ruling on objections, but he does have authority to hold someone in contempt, if, for example, a witness refuses to testify. He can rule on the relevance of material, but the Senate majority can overrule him.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966,[],N/A

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency has said nobody was detained because of their background, and the delays at the border were related to staffing issues and a pop concert that large groups of Iranians were attending. But Jayapal and other human rights advocates said what happened this weekend was wrong, if not illegal. ""It was the result of some sort of directive that we are trying to get to the bottom of what that was. I understand that CBP has said that no such thing occurred, but it is difficult to believe that when you listen to the multiple accounts of what happened,"" said Jayapal in a news conference in Seattle on Monday. Jayapal is a U.S. representative from Washington's 7th congressional district which encompasses Seattle and suburban King County.  She said her office is trying to gather information to determine exactly what happened and why. ""This seemed to be a directive to pull aside anybody of Iranian descent,"" said Jayapal. She said witnesses described more than 60 people facing up to 11 or 12 hour delays as they crossed into the U.S. after shopping, skiing or visiting Canada for various reasons.  ""We have been in touch with a number of people  [U.S. citizens] who are afraid to say anything,' said Jayapal. Many of the U.S. or Canadian citizens affected were also Nexus cardholders. A Nexus card is an expedited border control program designed to pre-approve low-risk travellers. At the Monday morning news conference, 38-year-old interior designer Negah Hekmati, who settled in the U.S. more than seven years ago, described her ordeal at the border. Hekmati said she has a U.S. passport and often visits Canada. On Saturday, she was returning from a ski trip when she, her five- and eight-year-old children and her husband faced a five-hour delay and questioning. She said that her passport and car keys were confiscated by authorities, and her family was not allowed to wait in their vehicle where the children could have slept. ""[The children] were very frightened,"" said Hekmati. She described how her daughter feared being taken by authorities and urged her mother not to speak Farsi. ""My kids shouldn't experience such things. They are U.S. citizens,"" said Hekmati who holds Canadian, U.S. and Iranian citizenship. ""If there is a war, my kids will be picked on in school, because they speak fluent Farsi ... We chose this country [America], because we thought we were free. Rights advocates at the news conference said that many U.S.-Iranians told a similar story of U.S. border patrol agents asking them to exit their cars and step inside the building. Once inside, their passports were confiscated and and they waited in lines before being questioned for hours about family, school and work histories.  Jorge Barón is the executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Program (NWIRP). He said despite border officials claim that nobody was detained, ""these people were not free to leave."" ""We believe this was illegal."" In an earlier statement, Jayapal chastised the president for inciting or ordering policies that chip away at American freedoms. ""If these reports are true, the Administration would be following its dangerous foreign policy decisions with dangerous policies here at home. Let me be clear: Instituting xenophobic, shameful and unconstitutional policies that discriminate against innocent people, trample over basic civil rights and put fear in the hearts of millions, do not make us safer"" she wrote. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) denied reports of people being held for questioning, calling social media posts about this ""false."" The CBP blamed longer wait-times on reduced staff due to holiday traffic and people returning from an Iranian pop concert. But Washington state immigration lawyer Len Saunders said he believes the heightened scrutiny was related to U.S. President Donald Trump's order to have Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani killed. Early Friday morning, a U.S. airstrike killed Soleimani, 62, and others as they travelled from Baghdad's international airport. Following the strike, the Pentagon said Trump ordered the U.S. military to take ""decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad.""

399,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-18T23:09:29.618Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan will give up royal titles, public funding","Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer be working members of the Royal Family and will, therefore, no longer use their royal titles or taxpayer money, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace released Saturday. ""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty and hastily called family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal Family and spending more time in North America. In a surprising Instagram message posted at the beginning of 2020, the pair called the move ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement. It will remain the couple's U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy, was the subject of scrutiny last year. Media reports revealed renovations to the building — which cost an estimated £2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)  — were coming from the Sovereign Grant, the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A | Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, Markle didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporter Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there are ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

400,Elizabeth McMillan,2020-01-21T21:26:33.948Z,Former N.S. lieutenant-governor says racial profiling 'alive and well',"Former Nova Scotia lieutenant-governor Mayann Francis says the arrest of a black woman in a Walmart last week in Halifax has left her shaken and even fearful of police for the first time. Last week, officers arrested Santina Rao while she was shopping with her baby and toddler. She suffered a broken wrist and numerous bruises and is now facing charges of causing a disturbance, assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest. ""I just went into this deep sense of 'Oh my heavens, we are gone back 100 years,"" Francis told CBC Nova Scotia's Information Morning. Francis served as lieutenant-governor from 2006 to 2012 — the only black Nova Scotian to hold the position — and has spoken out before about racial profiling she said she faces in retail stores in the province. She said a video clip showing police on top of Rao ""scared"" her and brought to mind Viola Desmond, the black woman who was dragged from a New Glasgow, N.S., movie theatre in 1946 for sitting in the whites-only section. Rao has said she paid for electronics in one section of the store and stopped in a toy aisle on her way to ring in some produce that couldn't be weighed at the checkout where she made her first purchase. She said police believed she was concealing items and that when she became upset they cuffed her without explaining why she was being arrested. She was not charged with theft. Chief Dan Kinsella on Monday called the situation ""disappointing"" and said he has referred the case to Nova Scotia's police watchdog. On Tuesday afternoon, the Serious Incident Response Team announced it will be investigating the incident. The Halifax Examiner has posted a video of part of the arrest. The incident has left Francis thinking about what would have happened if she had been accused of shoplifting. ""What if they called and the police came and surrounded me? Would my fear cause me to do something that I would not normally do? Would I show ID if they asked me to? I don't know,"" she said. Francis said the incident's timing is particularly bad because it makes people question Halifax Regional Police's recent apology for street checks, a now outlawed practice that disproportionately targeted black men. Being followed through stores is something with which Francis said she's all too familiar. As a black woman, she said she doesn't have the option of putting things in reusable bags because she has no doubt a staff member would pull her aside. She employs her own strategy of keeping her hands out of her pockets and avoiding opening her bags. ""I just do all of that so that I don't add to the suspicion of being a black woman, which is very stressful,"" she said. ""I'm treated like 'Why are you in this store? You're not welcome.'"" Recently, Francis said she couldn't avoid taking something out of her bag but she did so reluctantly.  ""I just said a little quick prayer and I pulled the backpack off,"" she said.

401,Anonymous,2020-01-20T19:21:36.071Z,"Oil and gas industry must do more to address climate change, report says","The oil and gas industry needs to increase its efforts to address climate change or risk becoming socially unacceptable and unprofitable, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. ""No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, in a statement Monday. The IEA is an independent non-governmental organization that advises countries and industry on sustainable energy. The world is demanding energy services and emissions reductions at the same time, the report says. Social pressures on the industry are rising, it notes, highlighting growing opposition to new infrastructure projects in certain areas and fracking bans. ""Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option."" Some companies have taken steps to address climate change, but the report says the industry as a whole could do more. The diverse industry requires a variety of approaches based on the particular circumstances of individual companies, according to the report, which was produced in co-operation with the World Economic Forum and will be presented at the organization's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The ""immediate task"" for the industry is to reduce its operational environmental footprint, Birol said. Approximately 15 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers, the report says. ""A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,"" said Birol. The most important and cost-effective measure would be to reduce methane leaks to the atmosphere, the report says. Other measures include integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments. The report argues the industry and its resources and skills ""will be critical"" in helping some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies, like low-carbon hydrogen and biofuels, reach maturity. It says that scaling up such technologies and lowering their cost requires qualities the industry has, such as large-scale engineering and project management capabilities. ""Without the industry's input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,"" Birol said. On average, oil and gas companies invest about one per cent of their total capital spending in non-core areas — with the greatest amount in solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Leading companies spend about five per cent, according to the report, which says ""a much more significant change"" in capital spending allocation is needed to accelerate energy transitions. The energy sector can transform without the help of the oil and gas industry, the report reads, but that is a more difficult and expensive path. ""Regardless of which pathway the world follows, climate impacts will become more visible and severe over the coming years, increasing the pressure on all elements of society to find solutions. These solutions cannot be found within today's oil and gas paradigm.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A
402,Anonymous,2019-10-16T21:38:54.991Z,Netflix's U.S. subscriber growth slowing as competition looms,"Netflix's subscriber growth is bogging down even before the leading video streaming service confronts high-powered threats from Apple and Walt Disney Co. The latest sign of the challenges facing Netflix emerged Wednesday with the release of its third-quarter results. The numbers provided further evidence that Netflix's salad days may be over, particularly in the U.S., where most households that want its 12-year-old streaming service already have it. Netflix added 6.8 million subscribers worldwide from July through September, below the 7 million customers forecast by the Los Gatos, California, company. Just 520,000 of those subscribers were picked up in the U.S., below the 800,000 that management anticipated. The shortfall came after Netflix lost 123,000 subscribers in the U.S. during the April-June period, marking its first contraction in eight years. That downturn and the uncertainty about the service's future growth is the main reason Netflix's stock had dropped by about 30 per cent below its peak price of $423.21 US reached 16 months ago. Netflix's shares surged by 8 per cent in extended trading Wednesday, apparently because some investors had been bracing for an even bigger letdown in the third quarter. For the third quarter, Netflix's net income rose to $665 million, or $1.47 per share, from $403 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $5.25 billion from about $4 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.52 billion. In the next earnings report, Netflix will begin disclosing revenue and membership by regions - Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America and the United States, the company said. Netflix said it expects to add another 7.6 million worldwide subscribers during the final three months of the year, down from 8.8 million during the same period last year. The more conservative outlook amounted to a concession to the new entrants in the streaming market. ""The launch of these new services will be noisy,"" Netflix advised in its third-quarter letter to shareholders. ""There may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance."" The big question now is whether some of Netflix's existing subscribers will decide to cancel its service and defect to cheaper alternatives that Apple and Disney will launch within the next month. Apple is charging only $5 per month for its service, set for a Nov. 1 debut, while Disney is selling a service featuring its vast library of treasured films and TV shows for just $7 per month beginning Nov. 12. Netflix's most popular plan in the U.S. costs $13 per month. Netflix is counting on the unique lineup of award-winning TV shows and movies that it has amass since expanding into original programming six years ago to help it retain its competitive edge and attract more subscribers. It has taken advantage of its head start in video streaming to track the viewing interests of millions of households around the world, giving it valuable insights into the kind of programming that is most likely to appeal to wide swaths of its audience. That knowledge, in theory, will help it pick and choose which TV shows and movies to back in the future as it bids for programming against the likes of Apple, Disney and existing rivals such as Amazon and AT&T's HBO.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-subscriber-growth-slowing-1.5323517,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-growth-down-1.5215574 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/disney-plus-launch-canada-1.5251906 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/apple-iphones-video-service-1.5277247,N/A
403,Jordan Gill,2019-07-09T11:17:15.384Z,Fredericton's lone female councillor calls out city hall for proposed all-male committee,"Concerns over diversity has delayed the appointment of five city representatives to a committee that would look into possible development at the New Brunswick Exhibition grounds in Fredericton.  City council was set to vote on the appointments Monday night for the new NBEX land development committee, with a recommendation from staff to approve the appointments. But a plea from Coun. Kate Rogers led councillors to vote down the proposal. Rogers said there were several qualified female candidates who could have been nominated, herself included, but she was concerned to see an all-male nominee list. ""They are, as I already said, good candidates,"" said Rogers, who is the city's only female councillor. ""But when I look at the candidates, when I look at the list that we did receive … there are some women who put their names forth, who also have very strong credentials. And I think that it's incumbent on us, in this day and age, to try to reflect at the very least gender diversity."" The NBEX land development committee was formed after years of conflict between the city and the Fredericton Exhibition Ltd. In 2017 the city started discussions to push the NBEX into a new location and away from the current grounds, so it could be developed into a residential area. That was opposed by NBEX, which eventually brought the city to court before dropping the case last fall.   The committee was initiated after the city and the Fredericton Exhibition came to an agreement to develop a new plan for the grounds back in February. Coun. Eric Price, one of the nominees for the city's five committee members, said he was not aware there was an issue with representation. ""I appreciate Kate's points as well and they're very valid points,"" Price told city council. ""I had no idea about all those things that you just talked about, so thank you for enlightening me on that."" The rest of the nominee list includes Deputy Mayor Steven Hicks, Fredericton's Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Jeff Trail, Shawn Bilerman and Trevor Hanson. Rogers said this isn't the first time she's bought up issues regarding women's representation to her male counterparts. ""I feel that they hear me, but I don't know whether or not they're listening,"" said Rogers after Monday night's council meeting. ""Some of them don't want to hear it. Some of them have been disrespectful when I have raised it. Others have come to me and said, 'We know it's a problem. We don't have the slightest idea what to do to make a change.'"" Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien has the final say on the list of nominees presented to council. O'Brien said while it is his purview, he instructed staff to choose the nominees. ""I left that to staff,"" he told council. ""That's not to put any onus on staff … but the staff made the recommendation and I signed the report."" Meanwhile at a council-in-committee meeting that took place earlier Monday, a visiting mayor from Port St. John's, South Africa, lightly chastised the city for only having one female councillor. ""When we saw the picture of the council members, as a female mayor, I had an issue,"" said Nomvuzo Mlombile-Cingo, who was visiting the city along with a group of South African mayors on a cultural exchange. Rogers said her objections were not ""sour grapes."" The city councillor said she would support any decision the council made, but that it's important to have a more diverse council and city committees. ""What is right is that we have more women represented on our council to reflect our community, to reflect the parity that exists in our community,"" she said. The matter has returned to city staff. No timetable was announced for the introduction of new nominees. CBC News has asked the city for the full list of candidates for the committee but has not yet received that list.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-council-diversity-concerns-1.5204768,[],N/A

Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny Breen said businesses were to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow was piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday, even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to this basement apartment in the Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's a doorway that was previously blocked due to snow and high winds that hit 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carve pathways around homes in the city.  The door of this shed blew open in the Kibride neighbourhood of St. John's.  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking a single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed — with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300 Canadian Armed Forces members are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, some snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on Friday — an aptly named one too. Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],N/A

On Friday Horgan was near Wet'suwet'en territory when he paid a visit to an LNG facility in Kitimat, and was asked by the chiefs for a face-to-face discussion while in the area. He offered to meet by phone instead, telling CBC he wasn't going to ""drop everything I'm doing to come running when someone is saying they need to speak with me."" The hereditary chiefs are leaders in the Indigenous opposition to Coastal GasLink project within their unceded territory.  Coastal GasLink is building the 670-kilometre pipeline from British Columbia's northeast to Kitimat on the coast. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but the hereditary clan chiefs, who are leaders under the traditional form of governance, say the project has no authority without their consent. The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against supporters of the hereditary chiefs who have set up camps close to a pipeline work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. In a letter addressed to Horgan and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Jan. 10, Nam'oks asked to meet. ""We formally request a meeting with you to discuss the impacts of the recent interlocutory injunction and RCMP enforcement,"" the letter read, adding that ministers who have decision-making authority in relation to the project were also invited. In a letter faxed and emailed on Monday, Horgan offered to send Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation for a meeting on Wednesday in Smithers. ""I regret we were not able to speak by telephone last week as I proposed,"" wrote Horgan. ""If you're going to have decent communication with anybody, it's best to be looking eye-to-eye,"" Nam'oks has previously said. ""We want to show the respect back, too."" Horgan said in his letter that the B.C. government has no authority to alter the injunction order issued by the court, nor to direct the RCMP in its role of enforcing the order. ""I remain committed to dialogue to achieve a peaceful and safe resolution of this issue,"" said Horgan, adding that he was honoured to visit Wet'suwet'en at Nam'oks' request last year, a trip that was ""carefully planned and months in preparation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/horgan-wet-suwet-en-hereditary-chief-meeting-1.5434188,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/i-m-not-being-disrespectful-i-m-just-saying-be-realistic-horgan-defends-not-meeting-wet-suwet-en-chiefs-1.5433495 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/john-horgan-wet-suwet-en-territory-visit-1.5432347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-wet-suwet-en-camp-logging-road-1.5420521,N/A

The city is looking downtown, at the intersection of Fitzroy and Great George, and where the Confederation Trail crosses Longworth Avenue. Public works manager Scott Adams said there have been public complaints about the intersection, and police have also expressed safety concerns. ""Some of the issues are some speeds with vehicles, vehicles not yielding for pedestrians to cross and drivers maybe not being able to see the pedestrians waiting to cross the road,"" Adams said. The public works department has recommended to council that changes be made, and wants to hire a consultant for the final design. The design could include medians at both locations, which tend to slow drivers down, and create a visual cue for drivers to pay closer attention. ""We also call it a pedestrian refuge,"" Adams said. ""It just gives them a safer spot. If something does end up happening, it just gives them ... a little bit of a safety net that they can stop and wait there."" Extending the curb more out into the street is also being considered at Fitzroy and Great George. The idea is to make waiting pedestrians more visible, said Adams, as they would be out past the parked cars.

Then, he flips them end over end before coming down to earth — all in the matter of seconds.  It's not a common hobby, but it has taken England, 28, from his home in Yellowknife to places around Canada and the United States. Now, it's earned him a spot in the freestyle snowmobile competition at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colo., the premier event for extreme sports.   Though he's been selected as an alternate, England's excited to just get a taste of the competition he's been dreaming about since he was in high school. ""As a rookie going into X Games, it's a good place to start,"" he said. ""It takes the pressure off the event, it's the step, where you start.  ""I'm stoked no matter what,"" he said. ""Alternate or competing, you're still in the X Games regardless."" Freestyle snowmobiling is a relatively small sport, involving athletes doing aerial tricks with snowmobiles, earning points based on the execution and degree of difficulty. They perform backflips, spins, and hanging from the handlebars upside down.  England's been doing tricks like that on his mountain bike since he was a teen riding on Twin Pine Hill in Yellowknife, but doing that with a sled was a big step up.  ""Flipping sleds is a gnarly business,"" he said. ""It's a high-risk trick. You don't want to make any mistakes when you're doing flips. The consequences are high.""  One of England's close friends, Darryl Tait became paralyzed from the waist down following a snowmobile crash 10 years ago.  ""That's always in the back of my mind,"" England said. ""It's part of the sport, it's part of the game I play.""  But to compete at the highest level, England had to take on the most difficult tricks, even with the inherent risk in flipping sleds 10 metres up.

409,Pat Martel,2017-03-02T13:40:44.699Z,After you flush: Take a tour of P.E.I.'s largest municipal sewage plant,"The smell inside the Charlottetown Pollution Control Plan isn't as bad as you might think it is  — despite 20 million litres of raw sewage flowing into the facility every day. ""Fresh sewage doesn't have that strong of an odour,"" said plant superintendent Steven Stewart. ""It's mostly water. It's like 99 per cent water that comes in."" Raw sewage from the capital city enters the plant in a building called the headworks. Before the treatment process begins, two things happen in the headworks. First, grit material such as sand, gravel and eggshells is removed.  Then a trash rack removes garbage such as plastic spoons, disposal wipes and pieces of wood that people aren't supposed to flush.  ""A lot of untreatable waste that doesn't decompose should not be flushed down the toilet,"" said Stewart. ""Sometimes it does get through the process and it ends up in pumps, plugging pumps, plugging up different parts of our process."" The next stage, called primary clarification takes place outside, in one of the many open cement ponds.  Here, close to 60 per cent of raw solids are removed from the stream of sewage. The separated solids sink to the bottom, while the water begins a clarification process for eventual release into Charlottetown Harbour.  ""It also removes the floatable material from our waste stream — grease and fat that comes from kitchen waste and restaurants mostly and from humans as well,"" said Stewart. A lot of seagulls hang around this area of the facility.  ""They're feeding on food that's in the waste stream … if it floats will come to the top and the animals will pick it off.  Before upgrades to the plant in 2007, this would have marked the last stage of the process, with the effluent going into the Hillsborough River. ""Now we have much cleaner, we have secondary treatment.  Primary treatment removes about 40 to 60 per cent of the waste material, and secondary treatment removes 95 to 96 per cent.""  Much of the work to clean up the water in the secondary treatment stage is done by nature, with a little help from aeration. ""We add air back into our system, which supports the biological life that's in here,"" said Stewart. ""They are naturally-occurring bacteria. We just provide the right conditions and they thrive in this kind of environment and consume the waste that's in the waste stream."" The water goes through one more stage before emptying into the Hillsborough River — past some huge UV lights for disinfection.  ""UV light in contact with pathogens, with bacteria and viruses, they inhibit their ability to reproduce so they end the lifecycle of those bacteria and pathogens,"" said Stewart. It takes the water about 24 hours to pass through the plant. The solid waste take 20 days, and it has to go through more stages before it's clean. The next stage is the one that you might smell when you drive by the plant. It's where the solids are thickened, and settle to the bottom of yet another cement pond.  The next stage is not what you expect to find in a sewage treatment plant.   Pasteurization takes place in a spotlessly clean building with huge stainless steel tanks. ""We pump that solid material through a heat exchanger where we pasteurize those solids, just like you would milk — 70 Celsius for 60 minutes."" The final stage is called the anaerobic digester. It's similar to what happens in your stomach. ""Our two anaerobic digesters break down the organic matter and break down the solids. Anaerobic means there's no oxygen, so the bacteria do that job."" After the material has been digested, it's about 20 to 25 per cent solids. It drops out in a steamy, dry form, almost like soil. ""So the biosolids you see dropping out there, they meet the criteria for exceptional quality, Class A bio-solids,"" said Stewart. ""They're hauled off site and we take them and they get spread on agriculture land.""  There's one more useful by-product from this process — methane gas, which comes in handy during the winter. ""We use that biogas in our boiler to get heat for our pasteurization and we use the heat to heat our buildings."" In summer, the extra gas is flared off. That's when you might notice that Olympic-sized flame as you drive by the plant. Steven Stewart is hoping others will realize that working in the sewage treatment plant is not so bad. ""They think you're working around sewage and stuff, but it's a lot of technical. We're running the equipment more so than we're working in the sewage.""

410,Sara Minogue,2020-01-20T14:00:00.843Z,Public hearings into $1B Giant Mine remediation begin at last,"Public hearings on the closure and remediation plan for Yellowknife's defunct Giant Mine begin Monday.  That's after 13 years of study, planning, assessment and discussion. ""It's monumental,"" said Natalie Plato, deputy director of the Giant Mine Remediation Project, which is leading the cleanup. The project is seeking a water licence for a 20-year term and a land-use permit for a five-year term from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. If all goes well, Plato anticipates her group could have those permits — along with terms and conditions — as soon as this summer, and start work on the cleanup project in 2020/2021. ""It means we can actually start the work and get this site remediated,"" Plato said. The Giant Mine site, which sits within the boundaries of the City of Yellowknife, is one of the most contaminated sites in Canada. From 1948 until 2004, gold from Giant Mine was a major economic driver for Yellowknife and the N.W.T. The mine became the property of the government of Canada in 1999, when Royal Oak Mines Inc. went into receivership. It operated for another five years before closing for good.  The closure and remediation plan first and foremost addresses 237,000 tonnes of highly toxic arsenic trioxide left behind. The plan is to freeze the waste underground forever using thermosyphon technology. The cleanup will also fill old pits, cover up tailings ponds and build a new water treatment plant so that runoff water can be treated before being discharged. It will also see the cleanup of the former Giant Mine townsite, on the shore of Back Bay, as well as the future site of a mining heritage museum.  ""Our pitch is to make the site safer for the environment and the public,"" said Plato.  In 2007, when the plan was first presented and before an environmental assessment was ordered, it came with a price tag of $947 million, which was frequently rounded up to $1 billion. Plato said she expects that number to be revised once the terms and conditions of the water licence are made clear.  Most of the details of the cleanup plan have already been reviewed by stakeholders and discussed at length during two technical sessions and a ""closure criteria"" workshop.  Stakeholders — from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation to Fisheries and Oceans Canada — have already filed their evidence, all of which is available on the land and water board's public registry.  ""There has been a lot of work done up until this point,"" said Shelagh Montgomery, executive director of the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. The enormous project is not without controversy.  ""While we support the overall goals of the Project, in its current form, the water licence process is not capable of accommodating the YKDFN's rights,"" reads the opening slide of a presentation from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation.  The First Nation is still seeking compensation and an apology for the damage caused by the mine. It also fears that Baker Creek, which runs through the site, will not be returned to its full health, and that the Yellowknives will be shut out of environmental monitoring to follow the remediation unless more is done to train and build capacity among First Nation members. The City of Yellowknife also has concerns.  ""The project's responses to the City's outstanding concerns have mostly refused to acknowledge validity of the concerns and a consequential absence of effort in addressing them,"" reads a slide the city will present this week. ""Rather than working to resolve the issue, the project's effort has been in denying their applicability or value."" City administrator Sheila Bassi-Kellett is most concerned with the socio-economic impact of the cleanup. In particular, maximizing the business and employment opportunities for Yellowknifers and the Yellowknives Dene.  ""This is a complex project,"" she said. ""There are opportunities associated with the remediation and those benefits should accrue here given the legacy of the project for the region."" Bassi-Kellett notes that the mine site takes up about seven per cent of the land within the city's municipal boundary, presenting unique opportunities. ""It's not like it's 350 miles away.""  But no matter what happens, Bassi-Kellett said this week's hearings are significant.  ""This is huge,"" said Bassi-Kellett. ""If there is an opportunity now — which we believe there is — to find some good to come out of the mine, we really want to see that happen.""

411,Anonymous,2018-11-23T16:00:33.652Z,"Plane veered off northern Manitoba runway because of oil leak, flight crew decision, investigators say","  An oil leak and the decision by flight crew to land with both engines running contributed to a plane veering off a runway after landing at a northern airstrip a year ago, the Transportation Safety Board says. A 19-seat Perimeter Airlines flight from God's River to Thompson landed and then careened off the runway on Nov. 2, 2017, after losing pressure during the 300-kilometre trip, a TSB report says. No passengers were on the 19-seat Fairchild Metro III. The two crew members consulted air traffic control after noticing a low oil pressure alert associated with the left engine, investigators say. The crew considered landing without nose-wheel steering and just one of two engines firing, but decided to keep them both running due to perceived risks. That decision was at odds with protocol, investigators said. ""The decision to continue the flight with both engines running was not consistent with the quick reference handbook procedures for low oil pressure indications,"" the TSB report says. The low oil pressure alert was probably the result of a ""steady oil leak"" in the left engine.  The two crew members suffered minor injuries and the plane was ""substantially damaged."" Investigators say the plane also was fitted with a flight management system capable of recording engine information, but it wasn't enabled. The plane also had a cockpit voice recorder but didn't have flight data recorded; that equipment isn't legally required. Those factors mean there are no in-flight voice, video or data recordings, which the TSB says hinders investigations.  In April 2018, the TSB recommended the installation of these recording systems by commercial and private operators not currently required to have that technology on board. The TSB asked Transport Canada to review the emergency protocol manual entry on low engine oil protocol for the Fairchild Metro III. Perimeter Aviation has since installed memory cards to store engine data on planes equipped with an integrated flight management system, as well as implementing crew training on resource management, the TSB said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/transportation-safety-board-thompson-landing-crash-1.4917722,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/transportation-safety-board-landing-incident-thompson-1.4386192,N/A
412,Brian Higgins,2020-01-22T10:00:00.510Z,More untreatable waste expected at Charlottetown sewage plant,"Staff at Charlottetown's sewage treatment plant are bracing for trouble when waste water from Stratford begins to arrive. The amount of stuff that shouldn't be there — mostly disposable wipes and cloth rags  — will likely increase, according to the plant superintendent. ""We fill one dumpster a week,"" said Steven Stewart. ""That could go to three when it all gets going."" The city will have a new screening facility up and running in a couple of weeks to help deal with the gunk. It's part of $12 million in upgrades undertaken to handle increased waste at the Charlottetown plant. The new screening facility will be housed in a separate building on the plant's waterfront property on Riverside Drive. The new, finer screen will replace a decades-old machine that currently sifts all manner of items out of the sewage that flows from the homes of Charlottetown residents. ""This looks like somebody's Calvin Kleins,"" said Stewart, as he used a pitch fork and gloved hands to pick through a knotted wad of cloth and elastic that turned up in the pipes in recent days. The name of the designer-label undergarment was clearly visible. Over the years, staff have removed many curious items: an animal horn, bones, children's toys, cash. A pair of crinkled $5 bills are kept in the plant as examples of what can turn up. One worker told CBC he once found a $50 bill.  And a set of dentures.  Staff estimate they remove a ""five gallon bucket"" of untreatable items from pumping equipment every day. It takes valuable time, and puts staff at risk, according to Stewart. ""You get syringes. Sometimes we have razor blades,"" said Stewart. ""It's a hazard to employees because on a daily basis we have to go in and unplug these things from our pumps. ""Don't put anything in the toilet that isn't toilet paper or number one or number two."" Despite the ongoing problems, city residents are ""quite conscientous,"" according to Charlottetown's sewer and water manager. ""People have educated themselves,"" said Richard MacEwen. ""Island Waste Management does a great job of explaining how the waste-handling system works and people have embraced it."" The advent of disposable wipes has created a new challenge in recent years, according to MacEwen. ""They're not flushable,"" said MacEwen. Cooking oil and grease also clog pipes and should not be poured down kitchen drains. The city of Summerside says it's having trouble with people flushing mop heads. They say staff continue to pull mop heads out of clogged sewage pumping equipment on a regular basis.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewer-clog-charlottetown-1.5435153,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-east-royalty-wastewater-charlottetown-plant-1.5426796 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-sewage-treatment-1.4004557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewage-green-1.4023899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-wastewater-treatment-consolidation-1.4131259 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775,N/A

Xiaoyu Zhou is originally from the city of Wuhan — where the outbreak of the new virus began — and was on his way there to visit his parents for Chinese New Year, but cancelled his plans on Tuesday, he told CBC Radio's Up To Speed host Nadia Kidwai. ""It's not a good time to go back to home right now, and my parents encouraged me to not go home at this point,"" he said on Wednesday. On Dec. 31, a cluster of cases of pneumonia was reported in the city of Wuhan. The cause was confirmed as a new coronavirus — a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. The Wuhan coronavirus had not previously been identified in humans, according to Health Canada. The death toll from the new respiratory virus has risen to 17, Chinese state television reported on Wednesday. The total number of confirmed cases had climbed to 544 as of Wednesday, according to the Communist Party's Peoples Daily newspaper. The United States announced Tuesday it confirmed its first case of the coronavirus. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada so far. The Public Health Agency of Canada says the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan is low, but  has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions such as avoiding large crowds. Zhou said his family has told him that most members of the general public in Wuhan, including his family, are trying to avoid being out and about as much as they can. However, he said his parents are doing fine right now, and the situation in Wuhan does not appear to be as terrifying as news headlines might make one believe. ""[People in Wuhan] are actually pretty OK,"" he said. If people have to go out, they are being advised to wear a mask around their mouth and to avoid close contact with people, he said. Meanwhile, as health officials try to get the outbreak under control, some public events for the Lunar New Year have been cancelled, Zhou said.

414,Michael Gorman,2020-01-21T19:41:58.663Z,Premier reaffirms no new effluent will enter Boat Harbour after January,"Pictou Landing First Nation Chief Andrea Paul is expressing concern that although Boat Harbour will stop receiving effluent from Northern Pulp at the end of January, it will still be several months before the former tidal estuary is completely closed to all materials from the mill. Paul issued a news release Tuesday saying she has not agreed to allow the Pictou County, N.S., treatment facility to continue to be used after Jan. 31. She takes particular issue with the company's plan to run its power boiler to provide heat at the site while winterizing the mill, a move that would mean water would flow through the system and into Boat Harbour as late as April. ""We were not consulted about it,"" Paul said in the news release. She could not be reached for an interview. In her release, Paul said the community is disappointed. ""We were expecting a complete shutdown of the Boat Harbour treatment facility,"" she said. ""Northern Pulp could have started draining the pipes weeks ago in order to complete the work before Jan. 31 and avoid the need to heat the mill after that."" Last month, Premier Stephen McNeil rejected calls from the mill to extend the legislated deadline for the company's use of Boat Harbour to treat its effluent. On Tuesday, McNeil said the government is dealing with the situation as it exists, while continuing to keep the promise enshrined in the Boat Harbour Act. ""There will be no new effluent going into Boat Harbour as of the 31st of January. Our commitment has been met to [the Pictou Landing First Nation] and we'll continue to work with them,"" he said. ""Here's where we are,"" McNeil added. ""The reality of it is, we also have an issue and that's that pipe. So we couldn't do anything with the pipe until [Jan. 31]."" Running water through the boiler means the pipe connecting the mill to Boat Harbour, which the province owns and is responsible for, will be flushed and cleaned, allowing it to be disconnected and permanently removed by the end of April, said McNeil. In the meantime, he's expecting a detailed plan from the company within the week about how they will deal with other issues on the mill site, such as leachate and the capping of manhole covers on the property that receive runoff water, which flows into Boat Harbour. As those details continue to be worked out, people who work in the woods and other industries connected to the forestry are on watch for what all of it means for them. The province's forestry transition team has made several funding announcements to assist with silviculture work and retraining, but removing the industry's largest player all but guarantees some operators won't be able to remain viable for the long term. Already, companies from other provinces are advertising job fairs. Josh Molnar operates Molnar Welding in Lantz, N.S., a fabrication and repair shop that specializes in work for sawmills, and employs 25 people. They've been in business for about 45 years. Molnar, the third generation of his family to run the business, said he's watching closely to see what happens with sawmills around the province. If they reach the point where they have nowhere to send chips, it will have a direct effect on his own business. He's hoping that new markets for those chips come about quickly, such as for district heating or biomass for electricity. As much as some people in the industry would like to see Northern Pulp keep operating, Molnar said the immediate focus right now must be on finding new markets and ways to keep the sector viable. ""[Sawmills] need time, they need a solution to get rid of their products so that they can invest for the future,"" he said. It would also mean a future for the 25 people at Molnar Welding and other businesses like them.

415,Steven D'Souza,2020-01-21T20:55:22.413Z,'This is going to be very ugly': Weinstein defence may use prevailing myths about rape to his advantage,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. When opening arguments begin Wednesday in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul's behaviour will be put under a microscope. But so, too, will the actions of his accusers, and some psychologists worry that outdated myths about rape will be used to discredit them. ""I think this is going to be very ugly,"" said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus in the women and gender studies department at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and predatory sexual assault against two women. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Fitzgerald said the defence may employ a tactic commonly used in sex assault cases: turning the focus from the accused to the accuser and playing on misconceptions about victims. One line of defence in such cases is to suggest the rape didn't really happen or that it wasn't really rape. ""They are going to try and capitalize on myths,"" Fitzgerald said. One of the accusers in the trial, who hasn't been identified, alleged Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in 2013. On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers announced they want to use friendly emails the accuser sent to the former producer after the alleged assault in a bid to convince jurors that any contact was consensual. ""There's direct communications between Harvey and women, always friendly, sometimes romantic, that would lead, I think, any reasonable person to think that the claims are untrue,"" Weinstein's lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told ABC News. Fitzgerald, who has written about rape myths and workplace sexual harassment, said there are decades of studies detailing how women behave in certain situations after being sexually assaulted, and the reasons behind that. ""Lots of people remain in contact with their abuser for a whole variety of reasons,"" she said. ""In some cases, because he has a lot of power and he can hurt you."" Trauma psychologist Joan Cook said it's disheartening to already see indications from Weinstein's team that it will be relying on an outdated understanding of how victims of sexual assault behave.  ""There's a lot of ways that men and women who have been sexually violated respond, and it's not the way we think,"" Cook said. ""Most don't go to the police; most don't confront their abuser; and many don't disconnect for various reasons.""  Watch: Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, talks about the defence's strategy Many survivors are in shock or numb after the assault, so they stay silent, Cook said, because what happened to them may not register right away or because they're afraid of the personal and professional consequences of cutting off contact. ""It's not surprising to me at all that people would have kept in touch with [Weinstein],"" said Cook. ""He owned Hollywood, so if you wanted to function there, weren't you going to still try and maintain a connection?"" That was among the reasons Dominique Huett said she stayed in touch with Weinstein, even after she alleged he sexually assaulted her in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2010. She was the first Weinstein accuser to file a civil claim against him. ""I emailed him after the assault happened, but that doesn't mean the assault didn't happen,"" Huett told CBC News. ""It just means I was trying to regain some sense of control back over what he did."" Huett's allegation falls within the statute of limitations, and she hopes charges can still be filed in California for her case. ""I think the old rhetoric of blaming the victim is very outdated at this stage,"" said Huett. ""I think the #MeToo movement kind of exposed how women are not, you know, liars."" Huett is a member of the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers who have come together to amplify the experiences of sexual assault survivors. In addition to questioning the motivation and actions of the accusers, Weinstein's defence is expected to call two experts to testify about memory. The judge, however, limited the scope of their testimony and denied a defence request to have them testify about a phenomenon called ""unwanted voluntary sex."" Cook said the understanding among researchers used to be that memory was fixed and unchanging, but today, it's recognized that the fact that an assault victim's recollections may change over time isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. ""The truth is, memory is much more fluid, and memories can change, and they can be altered over time,"" Cook said. The prosecution will be calling Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist at Temple University in Philadelphia who is an expert on rape and sexual assault trauma. The Manhattan district attorney's office is hoping Ziv can counter some of the myths around sexual assault, including why victims often wait to disclose their assault. Ziv gave such testimony in the second trial of Bill Cosby, who was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a Canadian woman who met Cosby while working at his alma mater, Temple University, in the early 2000s. The prosecution also hopes the four additional women who will be allowed to testify even though their allegations against Weinstein haven't resulted in charges will help establish a pattern of behaviour similar to how the testimony of other women did in the Cosby retrial. The question of how deeply the message of the #MeToo movement has permeated society was an undercurrent during the contentious two weeks of jury selection. Judge James M. Burke cautioned jurors that the case was not a referendum on the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment or women's rights. In narrowing down the jury pool, the prosecution accused the defence of ""systematically eliminating"" younger white women, who are more likely to be aware of #MeToo and possibly sympathize with Weinstein's accusers. In the end, seven men and five women were chosen. Six of the men and two of the women are white.  How educated the jury is in rape myths will be crucial in determining the outcome, Fitzgerald said. ""That's always what's critical in rape cases — the jury has to be willing and able to see through these things,"" Fitzgerald said. The flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, which followed a New York Times exposé in October 2017 that sparked the #MeToo movement, ignited an international conversation about women's experiences. But Fitzgerald says she doesn't think public awareness has progressed as far as people want to believe it has. Fitzgerald worked as a psychological consultant for Anita Hill and her legal team in 1991, when Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Fitzgerald called that moment the first great awakening for American society in the debate over sexual misconduct. She said after that, however, society forgot the lessons learned about women's experiences, and the issue fell out of the national conversation. But with high-profile stars now speaking out, she hopes there will be a more permanent reckoning with the issue on national scale. ""I think it's going to be more powerful this time, and it's going to be more widespread and more lasting.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,N/A
416,Kate Letterick,2019-03-10T15:17:20.661Z,Province lags behind rest of country getting women into skilled trades," When it comes to women in the trades, New Brunswick has some work to do. ""We are dead last as a province in the country, "" said Helene Savoie-Louis, director of MAPS Strategic Workforce Services, the non-profit that runs the New Boots: Progressing Women in Trades program.   According to Savoie-Louis, women make up about four per cent of the workforce in trades. The national average is six to seven per cent. She hopes to raise awareness through education and public events like ""Try-A-Trade,"" which was held at the community college in Dieppe on Friday. There were 10 interactive booths, where people could try everything from bricklaying to welding and construction. The idea was to let people, especially women, get ""hands-on"" experience in a trade. Savoie-Louis said that in New Brunswick, there are few examples of women working on construction sites or even at a garage, and ""you cannot be what you cannot see."" Shelby Lyman is a Red Seal automotive service technician, who repairs ambulances for the province. She agreed there aren't enough women in trades. ""Not nearly enough,"" she said. ""It needs to be showcased a little more. It's a great opportunity. I love my job. It's a lot of fun."" Lyman said her father had a garage, so working on cars came naturally to her. But attitudes need to change, she said. ""That whole stigma, too, that trades are for the people that aren't as intelligent — like that was a big stigma growing up, like, 'Oh, you're not very good at science, so go and do a trade because that's what's really there for you.'""   Katelyn Lyman, a truck and transport service technician, said she was the only woman in her college class, graduating with top marks. ""When I went through high school and stuff, it wasn't encouraged enough,"" she said. It's a sentiment shared by Carley Trites, who loves being a carpenter but said not enough is done to promote jobs like hers to other women. ""I think we're doing terrible actually, but it's events like this that [are] going to make it a lot better, and hopefully they'll keep these things up.""  Fellow carpenter Morgan Anderson said her training went smoothly, and she was hired right out of college. She thinks the tide is slowly turning. ""I'm seeing a lot more, and it's really good to try and encourage girls, especially with the new programs that are coming through New Brunswick that have been established. They can bring more women in and there's more coming, so that's good.""  Timing is crucial, according to Savoie-Louis, because the province is facing a mass retirement of skilled trades workers in the next 10 years. ""We know that we're going to be missing two to three thousand people to take the place of journey people retiring,"" she said. ""Those are two to three thousand jobs in New Brunswick.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-women-skilled-trades-1.5049371,[],N/A

With a large donation from a local philanthropist, James Bay New Horizons is expanding its efforts to engage those elderly residents in the simple pleasures of socializing over coffee or a hot meal. ""The trick for us is to try and get people out of their homes,"" said Kim Dixon, the group's executive director. ""As people retire, or as they age in place, a lot of them have lost family and friends, and then they don't want to go out and meet new family and friends because it's too much of an effort."" So far the society has held more than 80 coffee parties in apartment building lobbies and common rooms, attended by more than 400 seniors. The outreach worker who organizes the parties tells participants about available services and programs, such as the reassurance program in which seniors receive a call every morning to ensure they're OK.  Dixon said many elderly apartment residents have never met the other tenants in their building. Aside from the social benefits of meeting over coffee, Dixon said, residents get to know if their neighbours will need help to evacuate the building in case of a fire or other emergency. New Horizons also offers a Sunday suppers program at its centre, where the group serves a hot meal to 25 invited seniors who are socially isolated, seated at tables of four or five to make it easy to hear and talk about shared interests.  Among the regular diners is Elsie Farr, aged 103, who lives in her own condo and still attends other special events at the New Horizons centre where she's been a member for 35 years.   Other participants include Sally Fischer, who wrote in a thank you to Dixon: ""Here I meet nice people and am served the best food — something I very much need.

418,"Karen Pauls, Angela Johnston",2020-01-22T02:59:25.225Z,"Ex-reservist Patrik Mathews and others planned violent revolution, U.S. prosecutors say","A former army reservist and two other alleged members of a violent neo-Nazi group discussed ""executing"" a police officer to steal his weapons and ""committing targeted acts of violence"" at Monday's pro-gun rally in Virginia, according to documents filed Tuesday in a Maryland court.  Patrik Mathews — who went missing for several months after police raided his home in Beausejour, Man. — also made a video calling for violent revolution and the derailing of trains, expressed hopes of building a network for others with similar views, and predicted an upcoming civil war, according to a sweeping document filed by federal prosecutors.  The document, which cites hidden camera footage, lays out arguments for keeping Mathews and the two other men behind bars. All three were arrested last week.  It also reveals the lengths Mathews, Brian Mark Lemley Jr., and 19-year-old William Garfield Bilbrough IV planned violence similar to what was seen at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, in which one person was killed and dozens others injured. ""We can't let Virginia go to waste, we just can't … Virginia will be our day,"" Mathews stated, according to the detention memo.  The conversations were captured in December and January on a hidden camera and microphone installed by law enforcement in the apartment where Mathews and Lemley, a 33-year-old former U.S. army cavalry scout, were living. They were installed after a Dec. 13 secret search of the apartment, in which officers found flyers promoting The Base, communication devices, empty rifle cases and ""go bags"" — with ready-to-eat meals, knives and the items needed to build an assault rifle. They also found videos of Mathews talking about his journey into the United States, using violent anti-Semitic and racist language.  In the video, in which Mathews wears a gas mask and has his voice distorted, Mathews says: ""The time for talk has ended … If you think politics is a solution, you are a damn fool … It is the system that is fomenting violent revolution, not us, and they shall now reap what they have sown."" He goes on to say people can either prepare for collapse or bring it. ""Derail some f-cking trains, kill some people and poison some water supplies … If you want the white race to survive, you're going to have to do your f-cking part."" At one point, Mathews says he wishes he had set explosive devices for the RCMP team that raided his home and took his guns in August. ""In all honesty, I could really wish they f-cking all started searching my place, accidentally trip a pin, and, boom, and the whole house goes boom. Boy, wouldn't that be terrible, a bunch of f-cking RCMP search experts got f-cking exploded,"" he said, according to court documents.  Mathews and Lemley are facing a number of charges, including transporting a firearm to commit a felony. Bilbrough is charged with ""transporting and harbouring aliens."" They were all scheduled to appear in court Wednesday for detention hearings, but Lemley has since waived his right for a detention hearing.  Mathews' lawyer would not comment when asked if he was proceeding with the hearing. Bilbrough's lawyer said they intend to proceed as planned. The latest document fills in some of the blanks of Mathews' alleged activities since he disappeared from his home in Beausejour, Man., at the end of August 2019, shortly after he was first accused, by a reporter with the Winnipeg Free Press, of being a recruiter for The Base. The document says after illegally crossing the border near Piney, Man., Mathews met Lemley and Bilbrough in southern Michigan. Police followed their movements using Google location data, cell phone location data and recorded calls.  In mid-September, Lemley drove Mathews to the property of a Base member in Georgia, identified by an undercover FBI agent as a headquarters and training camp for the group.  Tuesday's document does not name the house's owner, but previous court filings state that a man presumed to be Mathews stayed at Luke Austin Lane's property for months last year. Lane was among three Georgia men arrested last week, charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being part of a criminal gang. During his time in Georgia, Mathews said he ""only exists for the white revolution now,"" according to the document. He wanted to remain a ""ghost"" and oversee safe houses for other Base members and, when there were enough of them, start committing attacks.  Mathews also searched the internet for information about Atomwaffen Division, another neo-Nazi group; building AR-15 assault rifles; and stories about himself, prosecutors allege.  Between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2, he was joined at the Georgia location by Lemley, Bilbrough, and other alleged Base members. Lemley and Bilbrough had bought about 1,500 rounds of ammunition while they were in Georgia. Separate affidavits have described about a dozen members of the group — including an undercover FBI agent — attended this meeting, which included firearms training, medical training and a pagan ritual with the sacrifice of a goat.  At the end of that gathering, the trio returned to Maryland. Lemley and Mathews rented an apartment in Newark, N.J. One day before their arrests, Lemley told Mathews that ""there cannot be no trust among a group of murderers,"" court documents say.  ""I cannot trust you to keep my murdering secrets. Not under threat of 30 years in jail and torture. Why should I trust you?"" Lemley asked. Monday's rally in Richmond, Va., attracted tens of thousands of people and, although there was some tension between different groups, ended without violence. Mathews was released from the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) at the end of August. The Department of National Defence says it can't comment on specific cases, but said in a statement that as of Dec. 5, 2019, investigations involving 15 CAF members have resulted in measures ranging from counselling, warnings and probation to other disciplinary measures. Twenty-one members are no longer serving in the CAF; three were released because of hateful conduct. Other investigations are ongoing. The military ombudsman is currently reviewing racism and white supremacy in the CAF. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Tuesday he's hoping for an update on that review soon. ""The vast majority of Canadian Armed Forces personnel are absolute professionals … who want to make sure that the organization that they join, the uniform that they wear, upholds those values,"" he said. ""They're not going to allow the few to take that away from them."" Sajjan and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair were in Winnipeg for Liberal cabinet meetings. Blair declined to say if Canadian authorities are also investigating The Base. ""I'm not going to talk about any ongoing investigation or the sharing of intelligence information except to confirm that we do work very closely with U.S. authorities and are very vigilant in addressing any potential risks to Canadians,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/patrick-mathews-base-violent-revolution-1.5435323,[],N/A
419,Anonymous,2019-05-30T17:11:40.936Z,"Italy's coalition sticks together for now, but Luigi Di Maio faces confidence vote","Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini on Thursday ruled out early elections, dismissing talk that he would capitalize on a triumph in European parliamentary elections to seek a power grab for his right-wing League party. At Sunday's European vote, the League trounced its coalition partner, the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement, fuelling speculation Salvini might ditch Five-Star and seek fresh elections at the head of a bloc of smaller conservative parties. Speaking to reporters in parliament, Salvini forcefully denied the reports. ""There will be no early election. In September we will be preparing the budget,"" he said. ""If I wanted to bring down the government, I wouldn't spend night and day putting together policy proposals ... there are so many things to do, I don't want an early election."" Salvini has been behaving since the European election as if he were already prime minister, promising tax cuts and calling for changes to European Union budget rules, while Five-Star licks its wounds and tries to resolve a leadership crisis. Salvini's strategy appears to be to dictate the policy agenda while insisting the government should continue, knowing that if Five-Star bows to his demands, it would risk losing more support among its core voters. If it does not, that might trigger a coalition collapse and fresh elections which would be likely to reward Salvini. While Salvini basks in his election success, Five-Star members were voting on Thursday to decide the fate of party leader Luigi Di Maio, who said he needed to know if the party wanted him to carry on after Sunday's debacle. The vote is being held on Five-Star's dedicated online platform, with the result expected to be announced Thursday night. Turning to the economy, Salvini said the government will respond ""politely"" to Brussels's concerns over its public finances by citing data that will avoid any disciplinary steps. ""The economy is showing signs of picking up,"" he said, adding tax revenues are higher than were expected. Rome must respond by Friday to a European Commission letter asking for explanations for its rising budget deficit and debt. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who formally has the task of replying to Brussels, told reporters in the northern city of Trento that the missed targets were due to an economic slowdown and public accounts would be back on track next year. He said Italy would adopt no additional cuts in 2019. In another sign that he is in no rush to sink the government, Salvini on Thursday sacrificed a junior League minister who was convicted of embezzlement, defusing a potential flashpoint with Five-Star. Several League officials had rejected calls from Five-Star for deputy transport minister Edoardo Rixi to step down if convicted, setting the scene for another clash between the quarrelsome ruling parties. Salvini said Rixi had offered to go, and he had accepted his resignation ""to protect him and the activity of the government from senseless attacks and polemics.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-coalition-salvini-dimaio-1.5155820,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-pm-populist-government-1.4686344 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-italy-yellow-vest-dispute-1.5012806 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-salvini-migration-eu-1.4690268 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/conte-5star-league-italy-pm-1.4675744,N/A
420,Brittany Spencer,2019-02-26T10:00:00.726Z,"With few hair and beauty options, some members of P.E.I.'s black community find their own solutions","When Luke Ignace thinks about the things he misses most about his home in the Bahamas, he can't help but think about his barber. ""Back home, I love going to the barbershop,"" Ignace said. ""Having a place where you can feel represented is one of those things that's so rooted in our history, like going to a barber and having a black barbershop, and having black products and going to the salon. ""That's cultural, we kind of need that."" Since moving to P.E.I., Ignace said he's found it challenging to find a barber or hairdresser who knows how to cut his hair. He said he's been to at least three different barbershops in Charlottetown, and while all of them made him feel welcome, he said he hasn't been able to find a barber or salon that focuses on, or specializes in, cutting black hair. ""People have to understand, right, we don't have the same hair. The same concepts, the same rules don't apply when you're cutting our hair,"" Ignace said.  In some cases, barbers have told him they simply don't know how to cut his hair because they haven't done it before or aren't comfortable with the technique involved, which is something he says many of his friends have experienced. ""I feel like I can't identify with the shop, you know I feel like there's no representation for me here,"" Ignace said.  He said while he's met many skilled barbers on the Island, he finds it challenging to find a shop that feels like it reflects his own culture and heritage. ""My experiences in barbershops have definitely been nice over here, but they could be better. There could be a lot more community behind it,"" he said. ""Business is business in the end and you need to make sure you're representing different ethnic bodies in businesses, especially like barbershops.""  Kiara Fernander, who moved to the Island to study business at UPEI, also works as a freelance makeup artist. She said she's also struggled to find a salon that offers the services her hair requires, as well as beauty products. ""There's a big lack of not only like black-owned beauty brands, but also brands that cater to women of colour,"" Fernander said. ""When I'm in a situation where I can't find a foundation that matches my skin tone, it's a big problem."" Fernander said she often has to order products online or wait until she can make a trip off-Island to get what she needs. She said this can be a big challenge for her business but can also take a toll on the self-esteem of those who are looking for these products but don't see their needs reflected on the shelves. ""To be brutally honest, it almost feels like we're an after-thought,"" Fernander said.  She said she would love to see a beauty salon that specifically caters to the black community open on the Island, and has even thought of opening one herself. But until that happens, she said she and her friends rely on each other to get their hair done rather than going to the salon.   Ignace has also taken things into his own hands. When attending UPEI in 2014, he started offering free haircuts to his friends and classmates.  He said he still has people knocking on his door looking to have their hair cut and he tries his best to create that barbershop feeling he's been missing, right in his living room.  ""Barbershops, they're a place for community. They're a place for conversation,"" Ignace said. ""It's a culture within a barbershop that you can't really find anywhere else.  ""I really feel like a barbershop would be such a great place for community to be built around the black culture,"" Ignace said. ""Not having that on P.E.I., it really affects you.""  Sherri Runighan, president of the P.E.I. Hairdressers' Association, said while there are a number of hairdressers and barbers who are trained in the techniques to cut black hair, there are many who say they've never had the chance to learn.  She said the association will look at different ways of solving the problem, including establishing a list of barbers and hairdressers who are trained and making that information available on their website. ""It is important because I think our population is growing with immigrants that come to live on the Island and of course it's important for them to have all those needs met,"" Runighan said. Runighan said the association will also discuss the option of bringing more training to the Island.  Ignace says he hopes to raise awareness about the need for a community space like a barbershop on P.E.I., and hopes to someday open one himself. Until then, he said hopes to see more salons and barbershops start to offer the services members of his community need.

421,Anonymous,2020-01-20T19:19:39.969Z,Iran considers dual nationals on downed Ukrainian plane to be Iranians,"Iran considers dual nationals aboard a Ukrainian plane that was shot down accidentally this month to be Iranian citizens, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Monday. Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Many of the 176 people killed in the disaster were Iranians with dual citizenship. Canada had 57 citizens on board. ""We have informed Canada that Tehran considers dual nationals who were killed in the plane crash as Iranian citizens … Iran is mourning their deaths,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi told a televised weekly news conference. Mousavi announced that the ""loved ones who have perished were Iranian"" and that Iran did not accept their dual citizenships.  ""According to our laws … we recognize them as Iranians. We will take measures for the victims and their families according to our own laws,"" he said.  In his speech, Mousavi also criticized Canada for following diplomatic pressures imposed by United States, saying Iran had announced its ""readiness to have a consular section"" but the requests had been ignored by the Canadian government.  ""Yet they don't even allow hundreds of thousands of Iranians who are in Canada to use basic consular services …. And now, in this type of situation, they are worried about Iranians."" Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the federal government cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012. The Liberals pledged to re-engage with the country in 2015, but to date, bilateral relations have not been renewed. As protests erupted in Iran over the plane disaster, the British ambassador in Tehran was briefly detained. Officials said he was at an ""illegal"" rally, while the envoy said he was attending a vigil for victims. Britain criticized his detention. ""Iran respects all foreign diplomats in Iran as long as they do not violate international laws,"" Mousavi said. Aurel Braun, professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, said Iran's statement was tantamount to denying the Canadian citizenship of those killed.  ""It complicates co-operation [with Canada] when recovering remains and investigating the crash. It just makes everything vastly more difficult,"" Braun told CBC News.  Refusing to acknowledge dual citizenship was a ""matter of control,"" and a signal to those travelling the country that they are subject to the ""whims of the totality of the regime's power,"" he said.   ""It is a fear of external interference."" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne's office told CBC News that Canada has had assurance from Iran that the deceased families' wishes would be respected regarding where remains would go.  ""We continue to expect that that will be the case and have been clear with the Iranians about that expectation,"" spokesperson Adam Austen said.  Also on Monday, Ukraine urged Iran to return the black boxes from the downed plane. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said returning the boxes would show that Iran was committed to an unbiased investigation. Prystaiko was speaking as an Iranian delegation led by Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami was visiting Kyiv to discuss the Jan. 8 tragedy. ""His main task is to apologize and acknowledge what happened. We hope that we can go a little further than just political discussions and discuss practical problems. Among them in particular is the return of the black boxes,"" Prystaiko told reporters. Iran said on Sunday it was trying to analyze the black boxes, denying an earlier report it would give them to Ukraine. ""At first they stated that they were handing them over, then the same person stated that they were not handing them over. This created some misunderstanding in Ukraine and we were starting to be asked: are they being handed over or not?"" The office of President Volodymyr Zelensky said Iranian experts were expected to assess Ukraine's technical ability to decode the black boxes. A statement said the wreckage of the aircraft was to be returned to Ukraine. ""I promised the families and relatives of the victims, I promised the people of Ukraine that the truth will be established. We must know what happened,"" the statement quoted Zelensky as telling the Iranian minister.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/iran-dual-nationals-downed-ukrainian-plane-iranians-1.5432918,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-says-iran-must-take-full-responsibility-after-admitting-its-missiles-brought-down-ps752-1.5423764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/compensation-victims-ps752-1.5424415 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-ukraine-plane-crash-black-boxes-1.5432118 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847,N/A
422,Keith Boag,2020-01-22T10:34:41.585Z,Trump's defenders emboldened by their certainty of a win: Keith Boag,"""Why should this trial be different than any other trial?"" asked U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff as he opened the Democrats' case for convicting the president and removing him from office. ""The short answer is, it shouldn't."" But of course Schiff knows that politics assures the impeachment trial will be different, and in the most important ways. The Republican Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, drafted rules for the trial that allowed the possibility there might be no witnesses heard and no evidence presented even from the House investigation that produced the articles of impeachment that form the basis for the prosecution.  Watch: Rep. Adam Schiff makes his argument against the proposed trial rules On Tuesday, on the first day of the trial, Republicans rejected three Democratic efforts to obtain documents and evidence.  A trial without witnesses and evidence is not a trial, the Democrats complain — a seemingly compelling argument on the face of it. But the Senate is not a courtroom, and McConnell is proud to say the majority of his ""jurors"" are in lockstep with the White House to assure an acquittal. And that's the crucial distinction between any other trial and the Senate's trial of Donald Trump. The verdict is effectively already in: Democrats need 67 votes to convict and they don't have them — they're 20 short. Republicans believe they can't lose. So the battle over the rules governing evidence, witnesses and so on isn't really about the case Republicans and Democrats can make to the Senate so much as it's about the case they can make to the TV viewing audience.  That's a battle about whether the public will perceive the seemingly inevitable acquittal of Trump as justice or a sham. It's about what Americans are allowed to see and to hear to help them make up their own minds about whether to remove the president from office when they have that chance in November's election. With no easily imagined way to lose the case, Trump's defenders seem emboldened to embrace some brazen tactics, like using the platform of the trial to spread demonstrably false, easily discredited claims. ""The president has done nothing wrong,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone assured everyone in his opening statement for the president's defence Tuesday. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. That's certainly the president's position. But Cipollone knows that it's officially untrue that the president did nothing wrong.  A report last week from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said the president flat out broke the law. It said he violated the Impoundment Control Act when he directed a freeze on nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved — the exact thing at the very heart of the impeachment case. Cipillone also repeated a false characterization of the House intelligence committee's investigation of Trump when he said Democrats held secret meetings in a basement office on Capitol Hill.  It's true neither the public nor the media were invited to those meetings, but that hardly makes them secret. Some 48 Republican members of Congress had access to the meetings and were allowed to ask questions, nine of them sitting on the committee itself. The testimony and evidence they all saw and heard — the Republicans included — they all kept secret, as they are routinely required to do in those circumstances. There was one truly secret detail about the House investigation: The ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, was apparently personally involved in the Ukraine scandal and didn't tell anybody. It seems he and a member of his staff were secretly active players in what Nunes nevertheless publicly dismissed as nothing but a ""hoax"" while he sat on the committee hearings about it.  That inconvenient little bombshell was alleged by Lev Parnas, a small-time operator and indicted (for campaign finance schemes) former associate of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas unexpectedly started blabbing to the media in lengthy interviews last week, and he had a lot to say. If the Trump team hadn't been so sure that the Senate trial was a lock, they might have worked harder to get to the bottom of the story so they'd be better prepared to contain the blast when the former Giuliani conniver turned against them.  Parnas — until recently a supporter of Trump — described a broad conspiracy to lean on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and extort political favours from him to help re-elect Trump in November. He tied the conspiracy directly to Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and Nunes, among others, and he produced documentary evidence.  Both the president and Nunes have said they hardly know Parnas. But photographs of Parnas with the president, and the fact Parnas seems to have Nunes's cellphone number, argue otherwise. The White House brushed it all aside with a comment about Parnas's criminal indictment and a suggestion he can't be trusted to tell the truth. But this is the risk of Trump, and Republicans have known it since the beginning: They have no idea from one day to the next what they might be called upon to defend.    Now, and with the spotlight on them, there really is no telling what they might be asked to swallow in this unique trial that Trump and his team believe they can't possibly lose, no matter the evidence. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A

The premier, who was near Wet'suwet'en territory Friday while touring the LNG Canada project site in Kitimat, was asked by the chiefs for a face-to-face discussion while in the area, which Horgan declined. Chief Na'moks, who also goes by John Risdale, said only an in-person meeting from the premier demonstrates respect for the chiefs. ""I'm not going to drop everything I'm doing to come running when someone is saying they need to speak with me,"" said Horgan in an interview on Daybreak North Monday. ""I'm not being disrespectful, I'm just saying be realistic here."" Horgan said he had other obligations during this tour but did offer to speak to the chiefs by phone. His offer was not accepted. ""If you're going to have decent communication with anybody, it's best to be looking eye-to-eye,"" said Na'moks. ""We want to show the respect back, too."" An in-person meeting may not change the status quo, as Horgan said he has no plans to pull permits for a project he says is an economic chance for numerous other nations along the pipeline route who do support it.  ""I think its disingenuous to suggest that a handful of people can stop progress and success for people who have been waiting for a break like this for many, many years,"" said Horgan.  Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands rather than unceded territories. The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against supporters of the hereditary chiefs who have set up camps close to a pipeline work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. ""There is no negotiating to be done,"" said Horgan.  Judith Sayers, assistant professor of environmental studies and business at the University of Victoria and president of the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, said the project ""flies in the face"" of Wet'suwet'en's own laws which have existed since time immemorial and need to be acknowledged. Sayers said under the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which passed in the B.C. Legislature in November 2019, Indigenous people have the right to own, use and manage their own lands.  ""We've moved into a new era in British Columbia with UNDRIP, which talks about the right of self-determination,"" said Sayers. ""Courts need to be acknowledging the laws of Indigenous people. We haven't seen that happen."" Horgan said UNDRIP is meant to be forward looking, not backward looking and this project was approved in 2018. There will always be conflict. There is conflict between families, conflict within communities. People don't always agree,"" said Horgan. ""We are doing our level best to move forward on issues in a respectful and methodical way.""

424,Leah Hendry,2017-11-27T10:00:19.258Z,"Outcry over service cuts for severely disabled 'unreasonable,' says health authority senior manager","Amid an uproar over cuts in services to some of the most severely disabled Montrealers in the English-speaking community, a senior health and social services bureaucrat fired off an email last week calling critics of the sweeping changes ""unreasonable."" As CBC reported, Miriam Home and Services, which provides a range of services to people with intellectual disabilities, is kicking scores of clients out of its specialized day program for profoundly disabled adults to make room for others on its long waiting list. ""People in real need of a rehab program were left on a waiting list while the ones on 'maintenance' were using our professional resources without any hope of improvement,"" said Dupuis in the email.  The day program, run out of the Lori Black Community Centre in the Town of Mount Royal, offers activities and outings and gives profoundly disabled adults of all ages a chance to get out in the community, socialize, learn and integrate. The program is being reoriented to focus on clients who have the potential to learn new skills. Under the planned changes, more than 100 clients who now attend the program will be dropped to make way for younger clients who still live at home. Many families call the cuts discriminatory and outrageous. With the cuts initially due to go into effect in December, a users committee called an emergency meeting last week. An invitation went out to Alan Maislin, the president of the board of directors of CIUSSSS West-Central Montreal, to attend. Maislin couldn't attend the meeting, but Dupuis wrote back, defending the reorganization of services. She lashed out at critics of the reorganization. ""These people are very unreasonable,"" Dupuis wrote. ""The pressure they are putting on the program managers is unacceptable."" She also accused some group home managers of using the day program as ""babysitting,"" so they could save money on hiring extra staff. Shelley Alper Stern and Rosanne Superstein, who both have relatives being dropped from the day program, were floored by Dupuis's comments. ""How does an organization that looks after disabled individuals come up with a statement like that?"" asked Alper Stern. Her 27-year-old son, Richard Stern, lives at The Benjamin and Vanda Treiser Maison Shalom — a group home in Côte-des-Neiges for adults with profound intellectual, emotional and physical disabilities. Without the day program, Alper Stern is worried her son will deteriorate. Stern uses a wheelchair at the group home. At the day program, he uses a standing board, which gives him a chance to loosen his muscles, move around and relate to others at eye level. ""He loves to be around people, and you can see it in his eyes,"" said Alper Stern. Rosanne Superstein's 44-year-old brother, Andrew, also lives at Maison Shalom and goes to the Miriam Home's day program. ""It gives him a reason to get up in the morning,"" said Superstein. She's sympathetic to the fact that there are many people on the waiting list for the day program, but she said her brother will be devastated if he can't continue to go. The Miriam Home has promised to hire a recreational therapist to train group home managers.  That means that therapist would only be available about five days every year to each group home, Superstein said. Superstein and Alper Stern are both on the board of Maison Shalom.  They've spoken to several group home managers who don't know how they'll continue. Many, they say, are already struggling with tight budgets. It's already difficult to find qualified staff. Superstein says if group home managers are now also responsible for providing leisure activities, she's afraid many will burn out or give up. ""That will leave the client with nothing, no day program and no stable home,"" said Superstein.  Contacted by CBC, Dupuis said her email was internal and not meant for public consumption. She said the Ministry of Health and Social Services has made it very clear it will no longer allow Miriam Home to provide rehabilitation services to clients whose condition can't improve.  ""They are people who are heavily medicated,"" said Dupuis. ""They are usually quite old and have no potential for rehab."" She said there are as many as 200 others waiting to get rehabilitation services. ""It's a bit terrifying to see these people left on a waiting list, while other people could be getting the leisure activities elsewhere,"" said Dupuis. Dupuis says she does understand why families are upset and has asked Miriam Home to delay cutting services until the New Year. At that time, each client will be evaluated individually.  ""I can assure you, it will not be done like they were cattle,"" said Dupuis. Dupuis says she is trying to get more money from the government to fund an alternative day program.  ""If we keep the status quo, it's like putting our head in the sand,"" she said. Superstein said that even if the current outcry seems to have prompted a temporary reprieve, she fears the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal health authority will still find a way to whittle services away. Even before this latest cut was announced, she said, Maison Shalom would often get a call to say her brother's educator wasn't available that day — and because there is no replacement staff, on those days he'd have to stay at the group home. ""The government has to wake up and pay attention,"" said Superstein. ""This is a vulnerable population, and the real problem is there isn't enough money."" Another users committee meeting is scheduled for Dec. 5, at which managers of both Miriam Home and CIUSSS West-Central Montreal are to be present to answer questions.

Trudeau, speaking at a news conference after a three-day cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, said pushing forward with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is the government's most pressing priority, as millions of jobs depend on the new trade pact. ""On Monday, we will present a ways and means motion, and on Wednesday we will table legislation to ratify the deal,"" he said. With a minority government, the Liberals need support from another party to pass legislation in the House.

""How can Canadians trust the Liberals to get this right when they spent months saying they had the perfect deal and mocked us for saying it needed to be changed?"" Singh said in a statement released by his office. ""Now they're trying to take credit for changes they said were impossible. ""[Canadians] can count on us to look carefully at this agreement. We're going to discuss it in caucus and in the debate in the house and see if it actually delivers for Canadians."" Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said his caucus members won't agree to swift passage of CUSMA unless they're convinced it's a good deal for Quebec. ""If Mr. Trudeau expects of us to go against what are obviously the best interests of the regions of Quebec, he will not be happy with my answer. It will be no,"" he said. ""There will be no fast-track, whatever it requires. It will not happen."" During the meetings in Winnipeg, cabinet ministers heard from expert guest speakers on the state of the economy, the fight against climate change and pressing global affairs. Ministers also drilled down on individual files linked to the government's top priorities. Ratifying the so-called NAFTA 2.0 — the trade deal known domestically as CUSMA — tops that list. ""This is an absolute priority, not only for the government but for our workers, our industries, people from all provinces,"" said Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez Monday. ""So I call upon the opposition to support us to make sure we ratify this as quickly as possible."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who led the NAFTA renegotiation talks and is in charge of pushing it past the finish line, noted that the agreement was ratified by the U.S. Senate last week and by Mexico before Christmas. ""Now it's Canada's turn,"" she said, adding that debate and ratification of the agreement is crucial for ensuring stability in the Canadian economy. New legislation on medical assistance in dying (MAID) is also at the top of the Liberal legislative agenda. Justice Minister David Lametti said this week he plans to table a bill in February. While not offering details on when a bill might be on the way, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said new gun control measures are another key government goal for the session. The government continues to consult with various stakeholder groups, municipalities and law enforcement agencies in order to keep a campaign commitment to allow communities to control or ban handguns, and to prohibit military-style assault weapons. Blair said Monday that the legislation must be flexible enough to adapt to different needs across the country. ""We know that the environments in different parts of the country are varied, and it's important, I think, to make sure that the laws that we bring forward are effective in every place in keeping communities safe,"" he said. As the ministers were holed up in closed-door meetings, they were also dealing with other pressing external issues. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says balance is crucial when dealing with changes to medically assisted dying legislation The government responded to a request from Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball to assist in snow clearing operations after a massive blizzard. About 300 troops were deployed to the province. Also hanging over the cabinet retreat were questions about Iran's willingness to surrender the flight recorders recovered from the crash of Flight PS752 over Tehran, which killed 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada. Iran initially said it would release the black boxes to Ukraine or France, but recent reports suggest that may no longer be the case. Today, Trudeau said Canada continues to ""pressure"" Iran to turn over the black boxes to a third country, such as France. ""It is not simply a question of having the right experts in place to analyze the black boxes. There is the question of significant technological requirements that cannot be done in Iran,"" he said. ""That is why we are calling upon Iran to release the black boxes to a reliable third country that has the technological capacity and personnel to properly analyze those boxes."" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne held a call Monday with the International Co-ordination and Response Group (ICRG) made up of representatives from Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom, the countries that lost citizens in the crash. In a readout after the call, Champagne said Iran had been co-operating with foreign experts in the investigation ""to date."" ""Members of the ICRG call on Iran to move the black boxes to a facility with all the technology and expertise required to quickly and reliably download and analyze the data without delay,"" the readout said. Trudeau will end the week with more meetings with his Liberal caucus in Ottawa.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-retreat-winnipeg-1.5433886,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medically-assisted-death-lametti-1.5432519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-pallister-liberal-cabinet-meeting-1.5432616 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/youth-businesses-climate-change-manitoba-1.5433047,N/A

At a council meeting on Monday night, the elected members voted unanimously to limit the number of rooms landlords can rent to four, but there are some exceptions. ""Over the last few years, we've been getting quite a few complaints from our residents,"" said Mayor Laurie Boucher. ""We were asked by the community to try to do something about it. And what we decided on as a council is, 'Can we limit the number of rooms that are being rented?'"" The answer is both yes and no. The new lodging home bylaw only applies to new home or ""lodging"" construction. Landlords who already own homes and rent out to multiple tenants will be unaffected. There are more than 90 old Victorian-style homes, with multiple units inside, in the downtown area of Antigonish that will be ""grandfathered in,"" or listed as legal/non-conforming. Boucher said those landlords will continue to be allowed to rent as they choose, but the new bylaw will require they be registered with the town, which will trigger a fire and safety inspection. Boucher said that should address the concerns of students who have complained in the past of living in unsafe buildings. As for neighbours who complain about party houses, Boucher said council is trying to balance their concerns with those of landlords and students. ""Being a university town, we absolutely need places and residents for our students to live. In September, our population doubles in size,"" she said. ""But it's our due diligence to make sure that people in our community are safe and that people have the right to live in their homes and communities without being disturbed. ""We have two bylaw officers that are very knowledgeable within the town and know what's going on.""

A statement from a group, which did not identify itself, said the demonstration is in support of Wet'suwet'en members opposing the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern B.C. The terminal reopened as the protest ended around 9 a.m., and traffic started flowing again. BC Ferries said all sailings leaving Swartz Bay would be delayed until traffic on Highway 17 has cleared. BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said the protest blocked the inbound lanes to the Swartz Bay terminal, but there was also ""concern"" that kayaks might have been in the water. Passengers driving to get to the fare booths ahead of the sailings were stuck in gridlocked traffic. Sidney RCMP were also on scene. Anne Roberge had a reservation for the 7 a.m. sailing and couldn't get close to the terminal. ""At one point we said, 'Oh boy. That doesn't look good,'"" she said, speaking by phone from her spot in traffic. Coastal GasLink is building a 670-kilometre pipeline from northeast B.C. to Kitimat on the coast. The project runs through Wet'suwet'en traditional territory. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but five hereditary chiefs say the project has no authority without their consent. Last week, RCMP blocked access to Wet'suwet'en territory, heightening tensions between government officials and hereditary chiefs. The Mounties have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.  Kolin Sutherland-Wilson, a spokesperson for the Swartz Bay demonstration, said the grassroots protest was comprised of young people, students and Indigenous allies from across the province. ""I hope it makes a statement because what's happening up north is disheartening ... our way of life is being criminalized by the province,"" said Sutherland-Wilson, a UVic student who is from the Gitxsan First Nation — a neighbouring nation and ally to the Wet'suwet'en Nation.

428,Shaina Luck,2020-01-23T10:00:00.830Z,Burst pipe forces Halifax's winter shelter to scramble for new location,"Halifax's emergency winter shelter is scrambling to find a temporary location just one week after it settled into its new home. Last week, a pipe burst on the upper floor of the College Street shelter while no one was there. ""It ended up leaking for a while and it caused a lot of water damage, so we won't be back in this season,"" said Rebecca Whitzman, co-ordinator for the Out of the Cold Emergency Winter Shelter. The shelter moved to the Needham Community Centre gym for two nights on the weekend and is now in the Brunswick Street Mission for one week. The shelter is serving 15 guests per night and is overcapacity, but Whitzman said no one is being turned away. The shelter's insurance company is assessing the damage and Whitzman said it would likely take months to make repairs. The space may have to be gutted and rebuilt. For the last 10 years, the shelter operated in the basement of St. Matthew's United Church in downtown Halifax. Moving to the new location was a big change. The College Street location has bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen where guests can gather and talk while staff cook meals. ""We were just commenting on how beautiful the space was, how cozy it was,"" said Jeff Karabanow, one of the shelter's founders. ""The guests were really enjoying the space. It was a very different vibe than the shelter in the past."" Karabanow said the shelter can't stay long at the Brunswick Street Mission and is exploring where to go next. One church in Spryfield and one church in Fairview have said they are open to the idea, but Karabanow said no final decisions have been made. ""We're just figuring out the transportation issue and seeing if we could get the funds to support folks coming back and forth,"" he said. Karabanow said staff are exploring with the province and the city to see if a downtown location close to their regular clients is available, but he's doubtful one can be found on short notice.

429,Teresa Wright,2019-12-14T16:41:21.788Z,"From fourth place, Singh says he'd rather push Liberals than work with Tories","The New Democratic Party is sitting in fourth place after the fall's divisive federal election and its leader Jagmeet Singh says he is not interested in partnering with the Conservatives to overwhelm Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal minority. In a year-end interview with The Canadian Press, Singh acknowledged there could be political expediency in having his New Democrats turn to the Conservatives to either defeat or dominate the Liberals. But Singh has no plans to go down that road. ""When it comes to the values that I have and have been pushing for, I don't see an alignment with the values the Conservatives have pushed forward,"" he said. The NDP and Liberals found themselves in a war of words during the fall election campaign to prove which party was more progressive, especially after the New Democrats lost many of the seats they gained in the 2011 ""orange wave"" to the Liberals in 2015 In general, a weakened Liberal party is good for both the New Democrats and the Conservatives. Despite this and despite the fact the NDP often struggles to differentiate itself from the Liberal party in its policies, Singh said he still couldn't imagine teaming up with the Conservatives — even under a new leader, with Andrew Scheer's recent resignation. ""My goal isn't to defeat the Liberals. My goal is to push them to do better,"" he said. Singh said he wants progressive laws that he believes are priorities for many Canadians, including to create national programs to cover drug costs and dental care. However, Trudeau would be wise not to presume his offer of political help comes without strings, Singh said. ""The frame that I take is — the Liberals need to work with somebody. They have 13 votes that they need in this minority government. So they need to get that support from somewhere. I put it out there that I am willing to be that person that supports them,"" Singh said. But if the Liberals' goal is to simply ""cruise along"" and hold onto power, Singh said he's out. ""My leverage and my encouragement comes from — if you need something passed that's meaningful, I'm right here. I'm ready to do it. But I'm not going to be taken for granted. I'm not going to support them blindly if it's not good for people."" Singh and his New Democratic Party had a roller-coaster of a year, beginning with Singh spending much of his time in British Columbia in a bid to win a seat in the House of Commons. He won his Burnaby South seat in a February byelection, but appearances in question period and the halls of Parliament did not translate into an immediate bump for the party. The New Democrats struggled with fundraising after finishing 2018 with nearly $4.5 million in negative net assets — the party's worst balance sheet since 2001. A mass of recognized and well-respected NDP MPs retiring dealt further blows to party morale. The NDP wasn't able to match the Liberals' and Conservatives' advertising during the campaign, thanks to its smaller war chest, and also only chartered a campaign plane for the last 12 days of the race. Many pundits were predicting the NDP could lose official party status, thanks to these factors and low polling numbers at the start of the campaign. However, Singh was able to turn his infectious, seemingly bottomless enthusiasm into upward momentum mid-race. Polling numbers started rising, crowds at his rallies started getting bigger and the spotlight started shining more positively in Singh's direction. But the momentum didn't translate into enough votes to keep the NDP from losing seats. The party was reduced to fourth place in the House of Commons behind the Liberals, Conservatives and Bloc Québécois after winning just 24 seats, down from the 39 it held before the Oct. 21 vote. The party's losses were especially deep in Quebec, where it lost all but one of 16 seats the party had held onto in 2015. Singh attributes this to his being new to the federal scene. This election was his ""introduction to Canada"" and to Quebec, ""where I had the biggest introduction to make,"" he said. The campaign also saw heated debate among federal leaders over Quebec's controversial law banning religious symbols like hijabs, turbans, kippahs and prominent crucifixes for some civil servants — a law that is widely popular among Quebec voters. Watch: The NDP leader talks about working with the Liberals Singh admits the law, known as Bill 21, could have played a part in his party's major losses in the province. Singh is a practising Sikh known for his brightly coloured turbans and he wears a symbolic knife. ""I think it was divisive as a bill and I think divisive bills will encourage or create more division. And that might impact me as someone, on first glance if there is something promoting division, because I look different."" Many people face discrimination based on race, gender or country of origin, Singh said, and he hopes to be a voice for those people and show he's willing to take a stand against it and to try to win over the ""hearts and minds"" of Quebecers. Looking to 2020, Singh says he hopes to work with the Liberals to implement a universal, single-payer pharmacare program and national dental coverage and to see Indigenous communities finally given access to clean drinking water, housing and equitable child-welfare funding. He says that even though Canada may be experiencing divisive politics and policies, he believes there is reason to hope. ""While we live in a beautiful place, it's an incredible country. There's so much more that unites us than divides us and there's this real, strong belief that people want to take care of their neighbours. And I want to build on that feeling of camaraderie.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/from-fourth-place-singh-says-he-d-rather-push-liberals-than-work-with-tories-1.5396706,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-trudeau-meeting-1.5359037 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-appoints-house-leader-and-party-whip-1.5371413 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-ndp-critic-1.5376735,N/A
430,Adam Miller,2020-01-22T10:50:27.511Z,Key things to watch for in the coronavirus outbreak,"As the coronavirus outbreak continues in China and beyond, key questions remain about the nature of the virus and how quickly and easily it can spread between people.  Here's a look at some of the potentially serious turns the outbreak could take. Human-to-human transmission is the spread of an illness from an infected patient to a non-infected person. There are two types of this transmission: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission. Infections among health-care workers strengthen the evidence for this,"" the WHO in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" WHO officials will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to discuss what recommendations should be made to manage it. ""The key issues here are what is the extent of human-to-human transmission and how easy is human-to-human transmission?"" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.  ""That's going to be a factor into how widespread this ultimately gets.""   Health officials will also be watching closely to see if the virus changes as the outbreak continues, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.  ""Viruses evolve and mutate, and they may start to take on new attributes and characteristics that either make them more easily transmissible or make them more deadly,"" he said.  ""The reality is that the longer that it's out there, the more it will evolve.""  Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said if the coronavirus mutates into something more contagious, that would be a ""significant concern"" similar to the way in which SARS evolved. McGeer said the initial clusters of patients infected with SARS in early 2003 were associated with open-air markets in China, much like in the current coronavirus outbreak, with limited transmission from person to person.  ""Then over the next couple of months, the virus evolved into a virus that was more transmissible person to person, but more transmissible person to person when people were seriously ill,"" she said.  ""If that process is repeating itself, and the virus is changing, then we may be moving from one problem to a completely different problem. So far that's not what it's looked like, but I don't think you can be sure about it."" McGeer added there haven't been many reports of transmission to health-care workers, aside from the reported 15 cases of medical staff in Wuhan, which she said concerns her about the potential for the virus to change.  ""They must have followed up with health-care workers after the initial cases in December, they didn't see transmission and now they've found transmission,"" she said.  ""It does raise the concern that this is a virus that is changing and if it's a virus that's changing then that's a whole new set of issues. There's nothing we can do except wait to know what's going to happen."" Another concern is the possibility of a ""super-spreader,"" a highly infectious patient who can spread the illness to many people at a disproportionate rate to other carriers.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said super-spreader events were ""pivotal"" in the spread of SARS worldwide in 2003.They defined super-spreading as transmission to at least eight people.  One super-spreading event was identified early in the epidemic in Beijing, where a patient with an onset of SARS two months after hospital admission was the source of transmission to 76 patients, including 12 health-care workers and several hospital visitors.  Prof. Gabriel M. Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said Tuesday the ""critical issue"" in controlling a coronavirus epidemic is to make sure that super-spreading events are controlled quickly.  ""It is absolutely critical that public health authorities recognize a super-spreading event in the very earliest stages,"" he said during a media availability. ""Before it goes absolutely explosive.""  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said the possibility of a super-spreader is top of mind for health officials worldwide.  ""There is also the possibility of super-spreading events. The global community is very familiar [with] what has happened with SARS in the past and this is something that is on our radar,"" she said during a press conference Tuesday. ""That is possible, and what we need to prepare ourselves for."" Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot that uses data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world, said outbreaks are like fires, and infected individuals are like embers.  ""They may land in one location where they happen to just trigger a big outbreak, and it may have to do with a super-spreading event,"" he said.  ""A super-spreading event does not mean that it is limited to the epicentre in Wuhan; it could catalyze multiple new epicentres.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A
431,Desmond Brown,2020-01-23T01:54:40.559Z,Toronto resident travelling to China for Lunar New Year unfazed as coronavirus spreads,"A Toronto woman — one of millions of people heading to China for the Lunar New year — says she is unfazed by the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 17 people amid more than 570 confirmed cases.  Nancy Li is travelling to the Chinese city of Guangzhou Wednesday night as the SARS-like coronavirus spreads and health officials in several places expand their enhanced checks.     ""This is the first time I go back in five years, that's why it's particularly important for me to go,"" Li told CBC News.  ""I am stocking up the face masks and … hand sanitizer and gloves.""  The coronavirus strain, previously unknown to scientists, was thought to have emerged from an animal market in the central city of Wuhan, with cases now detected as far away as the United States. The World Health Organization says it will decide on Thursday whether to declare a global emergency. Wuhan is closing its transport networks and advising citizens not to leave the city, Chinese state media reported.  ""For Lunar New Year, the human flow is out of Guangzhou into the inland. People are leaving Guangzhou to Wuhan, not the other way around,"" Li said.  ""If I was going to Wuhan I might really, like, reconsider this trip. There will be less people in Guangzhou this time of the year."" Li said she will be in China for 10 days and is more concerned about going through airports, given the number of people passing through them, some of whom might have been to areas affected by the outbreak.  ""I will go home and just basically spend time with my grandma, that's OK,"" Li said.  ""I'm worried about the airport and stuff.""  There is no confirmed case of the coronavirus in Canada but Li is also concerned that there might be intense screening in place by the time she returns to Toronto. For those heading back to Canada after the celebrations, Dr. Eileen de Villa, medical officer of health for the City of Toronto, said her first advice to those who are unwell is to avoid contact with other people.  ""Keep your illness to yourself,"" de Villa said on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.  ""If, however, you are feeling unwell enough that you feel you need medical attention, then do seek that medical attention,"" she added.  ""But make sure that you tell your health-care provider, one, of your symptoms; and, two, of any travel history, so that that can be taken into consideration both in terms of diagnosing what you might have and in terms of infection control and prevention measures."" She said the authorities are also on high alert and are making preparations in the event the coronavirus comes to Canada.  ""I think we always thought that there might be some possibility. We have a disease entity that we know had shown some degree of human-to-human transmission. How quickly, how readily it goes from human-to-human is still being established,"" de Villa said.  ""In a pretty mobile population, particularly here in Canada in cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, we see quite a bit of international travel, so I'm not particularly surprised to see some degree of movement of this virus and its emergence in the United States.""  At the same time, de Villa said Toronto has had its share of experience dealing with disease outbreaks.  ""I think what's really important in our case in Toronto, given that we've had so much experience — we've had the experience of SARS, … pandemic influenza in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 — we've had lots of experience dealing with this kind of situation, so we feel that we've learned the lessons from those and are prepared to put those lessons into action."" Meanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon, Health Minister Christine Elliott said while the risks posed by the new coronavirus to Ontarians remain low, the province is actively monitoring and is ready to respond. Speaking at a news conference, Elliott said she briefed Premier Doug Ford and her cabinet colleagues earlier in the day on the province's efforts to monitor the disease and the state of readiness to respond.  ""At that meeting our government approved new actions to strengthen the ministry's ability to monitor any coronavirus cases by adding novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under the province's public health legislation,"" Elliott said.  ""Now physicians, hospitals and other health-care facilities will be required to report a suspected or confirmed case of the new coronavirus to their local medical officer of health. ""The local public health unit can then quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection,"" Elliott added.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-health-emergency-declaration-1.5436518 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,N/A
432,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-22T23:21:13.084Z,"As U.S. threatens retaliation over digital taxes, Canada waits for OECD talks","As the U.S. continues to threaten other countries with retaliation if they proceed with a digital services tax, Canada's trade minister says the question of how to ensure profitable search engines, social media platforms and online retailers pay their fair share can only be tackled on a multilateral basis. France is preparing to target internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook with a three per cent tax on the revenues from their digital business in that country. Canada may eventually follow France's lead — but for now, it's not prepared to go it alone. Speaking while in transit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Wednesday, Small Business Minister Mary Ng said her government is looking at this issue in terms of what's in the best interests of Canadian businesses. ""I do think it's important to tackle this on a multilateral basis,"" she said. ""You do need to work through those processes."" Taxing multinational tech firms was part of the Liberals' re-election platform, which committed to ""work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations."" The proposal would tax the proceeds of online advertising and user data sales for digital firms with global revenues of more than $1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than $40 million. The Liberal platform projected $540 million in new revenue in 2020-21 from ""making multinational tech giants pay their fair share."" But Canada may not be able to proceed with its plans and start banking that kind of income this spring. Taxing multinational tech firms is easier said than done. Digital businesses models cross borders: a company may be headquartered and taxed in one country while it profits from its business activities in many others. That's why the 36 member countries of the OECD are trying to reach an international agreement on how to tax digital companies by mid-2020. Governments share a common concern: multinationals setting up in low-tax jurisdictions and avoiding taxes in others. Ng told CBC News Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to work though this process. Last fall, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among American industry groups urging the Trump administration to oppose Canada's adoption of a French-style digital tax. American digital companies believe they could be subject to ""double taxation,"" where they end up paying tax on the same revenue in both countries — something the tax treaty in place between the U.S. and Canada is supposed to prevent. The U.S. groups warned that the Liberal proposal could undermine American investments in the Canadian tech sector and be inconsistent with Canada's international trade commitments. World Trade Organization rules, as well as trade agreements like the recently renegotiated North American free trade deal, are supposed to prevent discrimination between foreign and domestic companies in areas like tax policy. Countries aren't allowed to create arbitrary rules to game the system in favour of their own corporations. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party also proposed taxing digital firms in the last election, said ""it makes no sense at all"" that an international foreign company could make money in Canada and not pay any taxes. Speaking during a break in caucus meetings Wednesday in preparation for the return of the House of Commons next week, Singh said that when working class people are paying their fair share, it's wrong for multinationals to do otherwise. He brushed aside the risk of retaliation. ""I don't think that we should live in fear of Mr. Trump. I don't think we should make decisions based on fear,"" he said. ""Particularly when our decisions are the right thing to do."" Talks Wednesday in Davos brought a temporary truce to a heated trade dispute over France's tax, which targets companies that have global revenues of over 750 million euros ($1.09 billion Canadian) and French revenue of over 25 million euros ($36 million Canadian). The thresholds are meant to offer French start-up companies room to grow. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he'd agreed to postpone collection of the tax until December — after the next U.S. election cycle — in return for a commitment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold off on the retaliatory sanctions President Donald Trump threatened to impose on French exports like champagne and cheese. Other European countries, including Austria, Italy, Spain and Britain, are considering similar taxes. Sajid Javid, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), told a panel in Davos Wednesday his country plans to proceed with its two per cent tax in April as a ""temporary tax"" until there is an international agreement on how to proceed. Mnuchin then told the same panel discussion that the pair needed to have ""some private conversations"" about this because such a tax would be discriminatory. ""If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on their car companies,"" Mnuchin said. More talks between Le Maire, Mnuchin and the head of the OECD, José Ángel Gurría, are expected Thursday. Gurría urged the countries to take the ""time and the space"" necessary to reach a deal and avoid bilateral confrontations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764,N/A
433,John Paul Tasker,2017-02-03T22:15:33.492Z,Métis of Ontario sign agreement with Ottawa clearing path for new benefits,"Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett and the Métis Nation of Ontario have signed a landmark agreement, a deal that could result in new benefits for Indigenous people of mixed heritage, pending the outcome of negotiations. The two parties agreed Friday to hold talks to work through long-standing Métis grievances with the federal government, namely the contention that Ottawa broke its promise to hand over land to the Métis in exchange for Manitoba joining Canada in 1870, a deal struck by Louis Riel. It is hard to predict, at this early stage, what could come from a deal — but financial compensation, access to federal spending on health and education programs, the right to self-governance and possibly a land claim are on the table for the 86,015 Métis living in Canada's largest province. Leadership from the Métis community will consult with its membership before it makes specific demands. Métis groups in Manitoba and Alberta have also signed similar memorandums in the last year. In a statement, Bennett called it a ""historic step forward in achieving lasting and meaningful reconciliation for the benefit of the Métis Nation of Ontario and all Canadians."" Margaret Froh, the president of the Métis Nation of Ontario, said Friday's memorandum has been 150 years in the making, as her people have long been forgotten in the discussion around Aboriginal rights, which has principally focused on First Nations and the Inuit. The Constitution Act, 1982 recognized the Métis as a distinct and separate people, with rights and title, but little has been done to put those principles into practice, Froh said. ""We know that Métis, in terms of the socioeconomic indicators, we know that we fall behind Canadians, on every single marker — education, health, housing,"" Froh said. Métis leaders have argued their people ""fall through the cracks"" when it comes to health services, employment and training, and education, supports that are offered to First Nations. ""Over the last 150 years, other Indigenous Peoples have had access to, for example, federal government policies, programs and services. The Métis have been excluded, and so with this signing of the memorandum … we're finally going to begin to move forward to define the relationship,"" she said in an interview with Rosemary Barton on Power & Politics. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised during the last election campaign to more adequately address Métis rights claims, which have been recognized by the Supreme Court in a number of recent decisions, including the Daniels case, which definitively ruled that tens of thousands of Métis and non-status Indians are the responsibility of the federal government. Prior to that ruling, the court found, Métis and non-status Indians were a ""political football,"" passed between federal and provincial governments, a situation that deprived the communities of significant federal funding for programs and benefits. The Supreme Court did not specify what particular benefits Métis stood to gain from this status — if any — leaving it up to the two parties to negotiate on a nation-to-nation basis, hence the push to more clearly enunciate Métis rights. Both sides will also have to accept who exactly a Métis is for negotiation purposes, something that has been a source of contention. The Métis National Council has long said the only people who can rightfully claim to be Métis are those who are accepted by the larger community, and can trace their ancestry to someone who lived in the ""historic Métis homeland,"" which includes the three Prairie provinces and extends into Ontario, B.C., and the Northwest Territories. This definition thereby excludes people who live east of Ontario, or those who cannot trace their roots back to an ancestor descended from a mixed European and First Nations marriage, in this area, from the 1700s onwards. Others, including the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, a group that represents Indians living off reserve, and some Métis peoples, have said that definition is too restrictive. ""For us, it is very, very, clear and there is no confusion [who is a Métis]. I think there is the potential for others to be engaged in those kinds of queries and I'm sure it's going to be something the federal government will have to contend with,"" Froh said.

The most recent audit by News Media Canada singles out P.E.I. as the only Canadian province to exclude municipal government bodies from the application of its freedom of information law.  ""Charlottetown, Summerside, Montague and other P.E.I. municipalities, as well as municipal police, need to be brought under the aegis of the province's FOI law,"" the report continues, ""so they are accountable to their citizens and others in the same way as other municipalities across Canada."" Criticism aside, the P.E.I. government received a mark of 'A' in the report, and was commended for responding to all information requests from the organization within 30 days. Of the 15 requests made by News Media Canada to the province, 11 resulted in full disclosure of the information requested. Two requests were withheld in part, one resulted in a fee estimate of $540, and in another case the province said no record existed. As part of its audit, News Media Canada also sent six requests for information to the City of Charlottetown, five of which were released in full taking an average of 2.7 days. While noting the fast response time, the report's author Fred Vallance-Jones said as long as municipalities aren't covered by legislation, they get to ultimately decide what information they make available. ""The point is that you give the power to the citizens to decide what it is they want to see, not to the government to decide what they should see,"" Vallance-Jones said. ""You have the most open democracy, the most effective democracy when people have a right to know not just what the government says it's doing, but what it is doing. Freedom of information acts provide that accountability."" In the 2015 provincial election, the PCs, Green Party and NDP all promised to expand P.E.I.'s freedom of information system to take in more public bodies, including municipalities and post-secondary institutions. The Liberals, meanwhile, pledged to make the system less cumbersome. In its 2015 Speech from the Throne, the MacLauchlan government indicated the system would be reviewed. So far that review has not taken place. However, a spokesperson told CBC News via email that government is still committed to a review, and details could come forward during the fall sitting of the legislature.

Hammond's report, produced by the Yukon Anti-Poverty Coalition, says the 2019 living wage is $19.07. That's up $.50 from last year.  The living wage is the hourly rate of pay required to meet a household's basic needs, after accounting for government transfers and deductions from income. The report is based on a ""reference family"" consisting of two adults working 35 hours a week apiece, and two children, ages four and seven. Yukon's minimum wage is $12.71, $6.36 less than the living wage.  ""Whitehorse has one of the highest living wage rates in the country, in part driven by high cost of rental housing,"" said Hammond.  ""Just over 30 per cent of pre-tax income goes toward shelters as the largest single expense incurred by low and moderate income households,"" he said. ""Childcare is a substantial driver as well."" Hammond said the largest monthly cost for the reference family is $1,844.09 in rent, and the second largest is $1,219.92 for childcare. The report recommends ten measures to improve affordability and reduce poverty for families in the Yukon.  Those include building more social housing, offering a low cost transit pass and introducing a basic annual income pilot that reflects the cost of living in the territory.  The living wage is calculated with a standardized formula used across the country. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/2019-living-wage-report-yukon-1.5341937,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-minimum-wage-increase-2019-1.5046234 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-minimum-wage-lori-fox-opinion-1.5109303,N/A

The 15-year old, who hails from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, shared her dismay at their lack of attention toward the issue while on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Peltier has spent her last eight years putting pressure on politicians to take climate change more seriously, while advocating for clean drinking water in Indigenous communities and serving as the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario. She has urged the United Nations General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet and confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations. While sharing the stage in Davos with fellow teen activists Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Natasha Mwansa from Zambia and Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, she heaped more pressure on politicians back home. ""It is almost like they don't believe climate change is real,"" she said. ""Climate change is a real thing and they are not realizing that."" Her remarks come amid warnings that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and as youth like Peltier are increasingly calling for the globe to band together and address climate change. Peltier said she has received some support from Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Mike Mantha and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, but has found that many of their counterparts are putting their attention elsewhere. ""They are all focused on just money and we need to be more focused on the actual things going on,"" she said. She also revealed that her age plays a role in how seriously she's being taken. ""I personally don't feel that heard from politicians....When it comes to federal government it is really hard to get their attention and be heard by them,"" she said.

As of Wednesday, there have been 544 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17 deaths. At least one confirmed case has been reported in the U.S. Symptoms of coronaviruses, which are a large family of viruses, cause a range of illnesses from the common cold to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

A specimen from the patient would then be sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg to confirm. Strang said the clinical understanding of the coronavirus is evolving.

But the newly elected Ontario MP insists that won't hold him back in the Conservative leadership race. ""Let's say you had someone who had the cabinet experience ... but they're kind of boring and their ideas are same-old, versus someone who has bold ideas and is more engaging,"" he said. ""I would say the playing field would be almost level at that point."" The Belleville, Ont.-area MP is the second member of Conservative caucus to announce he's running for the leadership; MP Marilyn Gladu is also running. And while they haven't officially announced, both Erin O'Toole and Pierre Poilievre are organizing leadership campaigns and are expected to make their bids official in the coming days. Businessman Rick Peterson announced Wednesday he would make another attempt for the party leadership. He finished 12th in a 14-person race in 2017. Former interim leader Rona Ambrose, meanwhile, put an end to speculation about her interest in the job today, confirming in a Facebook post that she will not run. Sloan, a lawyer and former small business owner, said he has a list of ""30, 40 bold ideas on anything conceivable that I've been able to come up with,"" including tax cuts and poverty among seniors. But he said he won't reveal any of them until the leadership campaign is officially underway. Sloan said he identifies as a social conservative — but doesn't want to typecast himself as the race's designated so-con candidate. ""I'm not running specially to only make a point on those areas, although I am a social conservative and I have opinions,"" he said. Still, Sloan argues there's a legal vacuum on abortion in Canada and Canadians deserve to see the issue debated by their representatives. The Conservative Party's constitution doesn't allow a Conservative government to bring forward a bill on abortion, he said — so any change would have to come from an individual MP putting forward a private member's bill. ""Bring on the discussion, bring on the debate,"" he said. Unlike many members of the Conservative caucus, Sloan said that while he favours balanced budgets, a return to balance would not be his priority as Conservative leader. ""I'm more of a 'build the right structure and things will take care of themselves' [candidate],"" he said. The right tax cuts and economic policy would create an economy robust enough to drive the federal budget toward balance, he said. ""I got into politics for one reason, and that is to make the Conservative party the dominant force in the country,"" he said, adding the party can't rely on being Canadians' first alternative ""when the Liberals mess up."" That can be achieved, he said, if the Conservatives have ""bold platforms on everything."" Sloan said he's been ""aggressively"" taking French lessons and describes his own French as mid- to high-level intermediate. He did agree to answer one question from CBC News in French; he stumbled during his response, then laughed and described it as ""vaguely intelligible."" Sloan said he considers himself ""officially"" in the race, although he's still completing the paperwork and collecting the members' signatures required by the party. The Conservative Party's first deadline — when candidates have to come up with $25,000 and 1,000 signatures from party members — is Feb 27. Sloan insisted he's in for the long haul.

443,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-21T22:47:56.106Z,'I won't be swayed': P.E.I. to ban flavoured vape juice,"Consultations are underway for regulating vaping product sales on P.E.I., but Health Minister James Aylward says he has made up his mind on one thing. Flavoured vape juice will be banned in the province. ""We did it with flavoured tobacco, we're going to do it with flavoured vaping as well,"" Aylward told CBC's Island Morning. ""I won't be swayed."" The health minister has made the decision in the face of opposition from Imperial Tobacco and the Atlantic Convenience Stores Association. In a news release, Imperial Tobacco urged governments in Canada to be certain vaping regulations were based on science. ""This is an extremely complex issue for which governments need to talk to scientists and doctors who understand the issue and not get swayed by the dramatized headlines,"" said Eric Gagnon, head of corporate and regulatory affairs at Imperial Tobacco Canada. ""If politicians and regulators allow themselves to be influenced by fear instead of facts, the biggest losers will be the millions of adult smokers across Canada who want an alternative to smoking."" In a release, the Vaping Industry Trade Association said it's calling upon ""all levels of government to formally acknowledge the thousands of Canadian vapers who quit smoking by vaping."" The organization said it wants government to carefully consider how proposed policies negatively affect adults who rely on vaping products to remain smoke-free. Shamus Kelly, owner of Eastern Vapes in Charlottetown, said banning flavoured vaping products won't get them out of the hands of Island youth. ""They're pushing everybody to the black market. They are going to get their hands on it, no matter what,"" Kelly said. ""But now it's not going to be professionally-tested, lab-tested stuff. It's going to be black market products that, who know what's in them, right? And they're going to get them that way.""  Kelly said up to 80 per cent of his business is selling flavoured vapes so he expects the decision to affect his bottom line.  Julia Hartley, with the P.E.I. Lung Association, said there's evidence to show that youth between the ages of 18 and 24 are particularly drawn to flavoured vaping products.  ""We have data showing that almost 100 per cent of youth prefer flavoured products and also data showing that half of these kids would quit vaping if, you know, the flavours were taken away. That's all the evidence we need,"" she said.  Aylward said he was alarmed by news from P.E.I.'s Public Schools Branch that vaping is starting as early as Grade 4. He believes banning flavoured vapes will discourage young people. ""Trying to protect our population, particularly our youth, that's the number one thing that I think about every day,"" he said. Consultations on regulations will go on about another week, said Aylward, and he expects to have draft regulations by early March, and those could be in force as soon as the end of that month. Aylward said there is still a role for the federal government in regulation when it comes to online sales and limiting the amount of nicotine in products. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-flavoured-vaping-banned-1.5434281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-flavours-canadian-vaping-association-1.5367882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-bill-deagle-1.5365964 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-partners-medical-society-doctor-recruitment-2020-1.5433244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,N/A
444,Anonymous,2019-11-29T03:11:39.908Z,"Vancouver has banned plastics — but will it hold up, legally?","The City of Vancouver says its plastic ban bylaw will withstand legal challenge because it is governed by a different charter than the City of Victoria, which had a similar bylaw struck down earlier this year after a legal battle. On Wednesday, Vancouver city council voted to phase in a ban on plastic straws and plastic shopping bags. Under the bylaw, plastic straws will be banned starting in April, and plastic bags will be banned in January 2021.  However, in July, a similar bylaw proposed by the City of Victoria — banning plastic bags — was struck down by the B.C. Court of Appeal after being challenged by the Canadian Plastic Bag Association.  In the decision, the court said Victoria, which is governed by B.C.'s Community Charter, overstepped its jurisdiction in creating the bylaw. It said the plastic bag ban went beyond the regulatory business rule the city argued it was. Rather, it was an attempt by the city to regulate environmental issues: ""It set out to slow down and ultimately end the harm caused by plastics in waterways both local and global,"" the decision read.  In order for the bylaw to be valid, it continued, Victoria would have to seek provincial approval from the Minister of Environment. Monica Kozmack, senior project manager for the single use reduction strategy at the City of Vancouver, said she is confident Vancouver has authority to create its plastic ban bylaw.  First of all, she said, the City of Vancouver is governed under the Vancouver Charter, which is different than the Community Charter that governs other municipalities in B.C. ""[The Vancouver Charter] gives us authority to regulate business and that's the authority that we're drawing on to do these bylaws,"" Kozmack said.  When questioned whether that argument would hold — given the City of Victoria's failed characterization of its own bylaw as a business rule — the city said it is confident of its own bylaw.  ""I think that there was some discrepancy about that, but [at] the City of Vancouver, we're confident this is a regulation of business."" The City of Victoria has now launched an appeal of the decision at the Supreme Court of Canada. The court has yet to decide whether it will hear the case. Kozmack says Vancouver will be watching.  ""Our understanding is that the City of Victoria is seeking leave to appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada on the question of regulation for business so it will be interesting to see what happens there,"" she said.  CBC has reached out to the Canadian Plastic Bag Association and the Canadian Plastics Industry Association for comment.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-has-banned-plastics-but-will-it-hold-up-legally-1.5377507,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-single-use-plastics-ban-1.5376424 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/victoria-bc-plastic-bag-ban-regulation-1.5360420 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-grocery-stories-plastic-waste-1.5359710,N/A
445,Wendy Martin,2020-01-24T01:03:03.631Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence","A Cape Breton obstetrician facing dismissal from his job at the regional hospital is facing accusations of sexual misconduct from two female patients. Dr. Manivasan Moodley is scheduled for a formal Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons disciplinary hearing next month related to allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. The details of the allegations were posted on the college's website Thursday, just hours before a rally in support of Moodley was scheduled to be held in front of the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in Sydney. In the case of a patient referred to only as A.B., the college alleges Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in an sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. For patient C.D., the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace. About 80 people attended the rally, which took place in front of the hospital Thursday evening. ""Bring Moodley back, bring Moodley back,"" ralliers chanted. Some people carried signs with messages that said ""Stop pushing doctors out,"" ""Stop abusing doctors,"" ""Respect foreign doctors,"" ""Re-instate Dr. Moodley now,"" and ""Name those who want Moodley out."" A petition was passed around and signed at the rally asking for Moodley's medical licence and sponsorship to be reinstated so he can continue practising medicine. Julia Farr, one of the protesters, said Moodley is her sister's doctor. She said she's concerned about what would happen to her sister's care if Moodley is no longer able to practise. ""We don't need to lose anymore doctors, we need to bring them back in,"" Farr said. Dr. Gus Grant, the college's registrar, said the allegations against Moodley are ""extraordinarily serious"" and follow a significant period of investigation. Moodley, who arrived in Cape Breton in March 2017 from South Africa, has been working as an obstetrician and gynecologist on what's known as a ""defined licence"" in Nova Scotia. As a foreign-trained doctor, he is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship is being withdrawn, and his last day of work is Friday. On Wednesday, before the allegations against him were made public, he said he was bewildered by the sudden withdrawal of his sponsorship, and has been given no reason for it. ""I think that doctors who are recruited here should be treated with respect and dignity,"" he said in an interview. He acknowledged he faced two complaints against him, but refused to discuss the details. On Thursday, he refused comment after more information was shared by the college. Since September 2017, Moodley has been working under restrictions imposed by the college that require him to have an attendant present at all times when treating patients and not to contact patients outside a clinical setting. A notice dated Sept. 22, 2017, does not outline why the restrictions were imposed. A letter informing patients of the restrictions is posted in Moodley's office, by order of the college. On Wednesday, Dr. Margaret Fraser, a family and emergency room doctor in Sydney and the head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said Moodley was being tossed aside like ""a piece of garbage."" She said Moodley is well-liked and highly respected, and acts as a mentor to the other members of the department, most of whom are early in their careers. On Thursday, she said in a Facebook post the rally of his supporters was still on. She said none of the allegations against Moodley had been proven and she suspected they had been ""leaked so people will stay away and they can quietly dispose of him."" But Grant said he worries the ""public attention"" garnered by the withdrawal of Moodley's sponsorship will put extra pressure on the two complainants. ""It's very difficult to summon the courage to bring a complaint against a physician for sexual misconduct,"" he said in an interview. ""And with the public attention being brought to Dr. Moodley's licensure, I think there's an added intimidation that will be felt, perhaps unintentionally, but there will be a certain degree of intimidation felt by these women who are coming forward, to help us regulate the profession."" The Nova Scotia Health Authority said it cannot comment on matters involving staff. Moodley was recruited by the former head of the obstetrics department at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, who has since retired. The disciplinary hearing, which will be open to the public, is scheduled for Feb. 24 at the college's office in Bedford. Additional dates have been set aside for Feb. 25-28, March 31 and April 1.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forestry-northern-pulp-lahey-report-environment-ecology-1.5436402 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-changing-municipal-training-after-cbrm-in-camera-pay-discussions-1.5436718 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lower-sackville-water-main-break-under-repair-1.5437027 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/eagle-watch-sheffield-mills-1.5437273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-emergency-winter-shelter-burst-pipe-new-home-1.5436536,N/A
446,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-14T00:34:47.640Z,Canada investigates reports that Iran is harassing families trying to repatriate remains of crash victims,"Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne says Canada is looking into ""disturbing"" allegations that Iran is harassing family members of PS752 airline crash victims who are desperately trying to bring home their loved ones' remains. Responding to a video posted on Twitter of a woman pleading for Canada's help in bringing home the body of her son, Champagne tweeted back that the government is looking into the matter. The video was posted by an Iranian journalist/activist who said Iranian authorities are telling families of crash victims not to speak to journalists. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. These allegations are disturbing and we will look into them. Please have this family reach out to Canadian officials by calling 613-996-8885 or emailing sos@international.gc.ca. <a href=""https://t.co/lCB7UWlWrZ"">https://t.co/lCB7UWlWrZ</a> Champagne's office confirmed the minister is looking into allegations that families are being harassed. Iranian leaders said Saturday that Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 using surface-to-air missiles, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Of those passengers, 138 were destined for Canada, but it's not known how many were permanent residents or were travelling on visitor or student visas. Champagne confirmed Friday that 57 of the victims were Canadian citizens. The process to identify the remains will require DNA or dental records. Canadian officials, most likely including the RCMP, will assist in the operation on the ground. Little is known at this point about how the repatriation process will play out. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, something that's been an issue in past consular cases; a government official said it's too early to say what impact that factor could have in this case. Ukraine's ambassador to Canada Andriy Shevchenko said the identification and repatriation process will be ""quite a complicated procedure"" — because of the technical nature of DNA collection and comparison and the legal complications arising from the fact that many of the victims held dual citizenship. He said families could have to wait some time before their loved ones' remains are returned to Canada. ""It's a very difficult thing to speculate because it might be days and weeks, but it also might be months,"" he told CBC's Robyn Bresnahan, host of Ottawa Morning, in an interview Monday. ""It is a legal issue because we need to make sure Iran gives all the necessary permits to do this, and obviously it is up to the families to decide what should be done to the remains."" Champagne said today the Standing Rapid Deployment Team (SRDT) — a group of staffers from Global Affairs Canada trained and ready to deploy in response to overseas emergencies — and a team from the Transportation Safety Board will be in place in Tehran by tonight. Two members of the SRDT will provide support from Ankara in Turkey, while other experts may be dispatched as needed, the minister said on Twitter. Champagne also has scheduled an in-person meeting of the International Coordination and Response Group at Canada House in London, U.K. for Thursday. The Canada-led group, which includes participants from Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the U.K., was struck to ensure transparency and accountability in the wake of the crash. Lawyers have told CBC that family members of those killed on Flight PS752 likely are entitled to monetary compensation through civil action, the International Court of Justice or international diplomacy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that he expects Iran to take full responsibility for the downing of the jetliner and indicated that he would press Iran to provide compensation on behalf of those killed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-victims-repatriation-canada-ps752-1.5424920,https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/university-of-alberta-memorial-iran-1.5422971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-iranian-community-manitoba-memorial-plane-crash-victims-1.5424428 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/maple-leaf-foods-ceo-ps752-us-iran-1.5424530,N/A

""Every friend I have came over to help,"" said MacDonald with a laugh, noting this was her fourth move in six years. Her new print shop, Deep Hollow Print, is in her home in North Alton, in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. The letterpress process involves putting movable type on a press bed. You fill the spaces between the type with other material. Once that's locked and ready to go, you put ink on the press. The paper is pressed down onto the letters to create the print. Some presses use electricity, but MacDonald's doesn't. She uses elbow grease and oil.

This is a place where she creates and hosts house concerts. Some music has been recorded here too. In this digital age, MacDonald said there's a resurgence of people wanting something more tactile and warm, like vinyl records. Her letterpress posters have this feel. ""They're warmer, they're friendly, they're human, "" she said. ""You can tell in all their imperfections that, you know, somebody has touched them to make them."" MacDonald specializes in gig posters, but also creates album covers and concert tickets. She's won two East Coast Music Awards for her work.

She moved to the United States when she was young, but came back home about 10 years ago to work at Gaspereau Press. She was interested in book publishing and binding at the time, but developed a love for letterpress. Her letterpress education also took her to Nashville, where she interned at Hatch Show Print, which is famous for it's circus and minstrel show posters. A lot of famous performers had posters printed there, including Elvis Presley and B.B. King. ""Eventually, they sort of become the face of the country music industry down there,"" said MacDonald. She experienced that history first-hand. ""I used an h that was used on an old Hank Williams poster,"" said MacDonald. While at Hatch Show Print, she worked on posters for the likes of Willie Nelson.

She said the Annapolis Valley is a very supportive community. Most of her clients are local, and the music scene in the valley and the province has been good for her business. A lot of her clients like to come to her shop to see the process, and sometimes they even help her print the work. MacDonald said she would eventually like to hold printing workshops.

You can be part of the community discussion by joining our Facebook group. An environmental group in Lunenburg is gathering community feedback in an effort to persuade town council to put bans on single-use plastics. Plastic Free Lunenburg is hosting a series of open house events to drum up support for using less plastic and to help answer questions from both citizens and local businesses. ""The support that we're hearing from folks is that what people want to do is refuse and avoid these products in the first place,"" said group member Teresa Quilty. ""We really have a plastic crisis globally and it might be easy for us in Nova Scotia to think that we're not part of that, but we are."" Jesse Robson was one of several people who stopped by Plastic Free Lunenburg's open house on Sunday. She wanted to learn more about reducing her own plastic use. ""I think it will require a cultural shift,"" Robson said. ""We'll all need to start bringing Tupperware places and using our own mugs, that sort of thing. ""But if we're all in it together then that's great."" Last week, the group held a public meeting where 200 people turned out to vote on reasonable timelines to ban items such as straws, plastic bags and single-use condiments in the town. Quilty said with the heavy tourism influx in Lunenburg during the summer months, there is a lot of plastic use when it comes to items like take-out containers. But she said businesses have shown a willingness to reduce the single-use plastics in their stores. They want information on where they can get things like metal straws and compostable take-out boxes locally.

""We're working really hard to make sure everybody's voice is heard during this process."" Jennifer Constable with Plastic Free Lunenburg said the turnout from the community shows that people are enthusiastic about the process. But the group's plan is to eventually have council institute bylaws to reduce single-use plastics.

""So I think that the reality is it has to be some sort of a legislative ban."" Constable's family went plastic-free last year. She said there are simple things people can do to get started, like using reusable mugs, water bottles and bags for grocery and produce.

450,Anonymous,2020-01-24T01:38:29.184Z,WHO says it's not declaring new virus a global emergency — but it may become one,"A World Health Organization (WHO) panel of experts on the new coronavirus said Thursday ""it is a bit too early"" to consider the outbreak an international emergency — but it may become one, the organization's chief said. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said while the outbreak is an emergency in China, ""it has not yet become a global health emergency."" ""It may yet become one,"" he said. The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the UN agency's headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday. Tedros said the committee was divided again on Thursday. Watch | Tedros explains why the new coronavirus is not a global emergency yet: The new coronavirus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 25 people and infected 830, according to Chinese health authorities. Most of the cases have been in China, but cases have been detected as far away as Thailand. The update Friday morning also confirmed the first death outside the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located. WHO defines a global emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.  ""For the moment, the WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade,"" Tedros said. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio. A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Deciding whether an outbreak amounts to an international crisis can therefore also be politically fraught. In 2014, WHO initially resisted declaring the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be a global emergency because it feared the announcement would anger Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The UN agency ultimately declared the Ebola outbreak a global emergency after more than 1,000 people had died and the virus had spread across multiple national borders. The Canadian government urged travellers on Thursday to ""exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws,"" a notice that is one level below an official travel advisory. The government previously said in a travel health notice that the ""overall risk to Canadian travellers and to Canada remains low."" Watch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discusses the virus: Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. A CDC spokesperson later said the agency is seeking emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow states to use its diagnostic test for the outbreak. Early this week, the agency said it expected to see more cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country that is due to report back to the panel. Tedros said China had taken measures that the WHO believes are appropriate. Peter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase. ""Regardless of the decision not to declare this a public health emergency of international concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,"" he said. ""National authorities and the World Health Organization will need to continue to monitor developments very closely."" In separate developments, three research teams are to start work on developing potential vaccines against the new coronavirus, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said on Thursday. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is co-funding the emergency projects, said the plan was to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June. The research will be conducted by the drug and vaccine developer, Moderna, working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the U.S. firm Inovio Pharma, and a team at the University of Queensland, Australia. Each of the three projects will test a distinct scientific approach to developing a preventative vaccine against the China virus, known as nCoV-2019. ""Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks,"" said Richard Hatchett, CEPI's chief executive. ""There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5437217,N/A

The Oslo District Court acquitted the government against charges from Nature and Youth and Greenpeace Nordic that drilling for oil and gas in Arctic waters would violate with the Paris Agreement on climate change and the Norwegian constitution. The court cited the constitution, saying ""natural resources shall be managed on the basis of long-term considerations, which will safeguard this right for future generations as well.""

The government said following the court ruling that it now ""had a sound basis for its decision to award the production licences."" The court also said the groups should pay legal expenses worth 580,000 kroner (about $118,000 Cdn).

""This is all the way from Borden to Cornwall from the South Shore all the way up to Breadalbane. There's about 2,800 people here who do not have a full-time physician,"" said Ian Dennison, mayor of Victoria and the co-chair of South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. Over the last year they've been trying to bolster health care in the area, including raising money for the construction of a new health clinic attached to the South Shore Pharmacy. The clinic is expected to open in April. In the meantime, a temporary walk-in clinic located inside the pharmacy began operating last year after the village's only full-time physician relocated his practice to Cornwall, P.E.I. It's been running a few days a week with part-time staff but Dennison said that's not enough. ""You do not have the continued care that is so necessary. What happens is there are gaps in the care for people and people's needs, they really start not being met,"" he said. The group said it's been promised a full-time nurse practitioner for Crapaud by the minister of health. But in a statement sent to CBC, Health PEI said the province is looking to hire a doctor and a nurse practitioner for the Queens West Network, which covers the area from Crapaud to Charlottetown. ""Health PEI remains committed to permanently filling the vacant family physician position in Queens West primary care network,"" said Anita MacKenzie, acting director of primary care.  ""Once recruited, we will work with the new physician to determine where and how they want to operate their practice."" Lisa Gallant of the South Shore group said they're clear in their request and want the hires to be in Crapaud. ""Those people very clearly indicated they want to receive their primary care services in Crapaud which is the geographical centre of the previous physician's practice,"" she said.  Dennison said the group will continue to lobby the government until it's successfully had a full-time doctor recruited to the area. ""We're just not giving up. We're not going away.""​ The province said it would support any recruitment efforts the group makes to bring a physician to Crapaud.

453,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-24T18:51:25.357Z,"Texas murder suspect arrested in Halifax remains detained, refuses to leave cell","An American murder suspect nabbed in Halifax will remain detained until February, when he'll have another hearing to determine whether he's admissible to Canada, a member of the Immigration and Review Board ruled Friday. Derek Cameron Whisenand was scheduled to appear before the board Friday morning for both a detention review and an admissibility hearing, but refused to leave his cell in Halifax. A board member maintained Whisenand's detention on the basis he was a flight risk and a danger to the Canadian public. Dianne Tordoff also agreed to proceed with a hearing on admissibility on Feb. 11, regardless of whether Whisenand has secured counsel by then. The admissibility hearing scheduled for Friday was adjourned because Whisenand had the right to be present. ""But if a person refuses to attend, the board must proceed with celerity — we can't just keep postponing the hearing,"" Tordoff said. Whisenand, 28, is a suspect in the June 2019 death of a 78-year-old man in Eastland County, Texas, about 170 kilometres southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He has been detained since his Dec. 30 arrest, which came after police responded to a call about the shoplifting of work boots at a Walmart in the city's Bayers Lake area. A police report filed as an exhibit in connection with his detention said Whisenand had been living in a tent in the woods with his dog near the busy shopping district. According to the report by Halifax regional police, he was arrested after leading officers on a foot chase and only stopped after a constable threatened to use her Taser on him. The police report alleged the fugitive was wearing brand-new beige work boots that still had the price tags on them. He was evasive with Halifax officers and gave a false name — Christian Bates — before the officer found a tattered U.S. social security card with his real name on it, without a birth date, the report states. After giving police his date of birth, he allegedly pleaded with them to let him go on a promise to appear so he could fetch his dog at the campsite. Police confirmed they found a tent, clothing, dishes and dog food in a wooded area not far from where the alleged theft took place. The dog was seized by animal control officers. Whisenand was subsequently turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency and has refused to answer questions from immigration officials. In July, RCMP warned that he had illegally crossed into Canada near Haskett, Man., sometime during the week of June 24. Authorities in North Dakota said Whisenand's vehicle was found about three kilometres from the Canadian border. Whisenand hasn't explained how he got to Nova Scotia, but he was believed to have gotten a ride from the border to Winnipeg, then headed towards Atlantic Canada. He has no family or friends in Canada and has been detained at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. Whisenand didn't participate in his initial hearing on Jan. 2 and told the board at the second one on Jan. 8 that he wished to consult with a lawyer before proceeding on the issue of admissibility. Michel Gallant, a CBSA hearing officer, said Friday that officers have tried to interview Whisenand, but he's rebuffed their attempts. Gallant also said the U.S. consulate in Halifax will provide an emergency travel document if Whisenand is ultimately ordered removed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/new-stamp-commemorates-black-hockey-league-1.5437722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/northern-pulp-mill-boat-harbour-government-environment-1.5437969 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,N/A

Qassem Soleimani. The House voted 224 to 194, almost exclusively along party lines, reflecting the deep divide in Congress. Democrats accused Trump of acting recklessly and backed the war powers resolution, while Trump's fellow Republicans, who rarely vote against the president, opposed it. The war powers resolution is not binding on the president and would not require his signature. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nonetheless insisted it ""has real teeth"" because ""it is a statement of the Congress of the United States."" The measure will ""protect American lives and values"" by limiting Trump's military actions, Pelosi said. ""The administration must de-escalate and must prevent further violence."" Passage in the House sends the measure to the Republican-controlled Senate, where its fate is uncertain. Republicans hold 53 of the chamber's 100 seats and rarely vote against the president, but at least three Republican senators — including ex-Marine Todd Young — have expressed support for the war powers resolution. ""We are members of a separate and distinct branch of government. It is our duty not to take anyone's word for things as we are dealing with matters of life and death,"" Young said. The Indiana Republican added that he wished Trump administration officials had provided more intelligence information during a briefing Wednesday on a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian general. The White House issued a statement opposing the measure. ""This concurrent resolution is misguided, and its adoption by Congress could undermine the ability of the United States to protect American citizens whom Iran continues to seek to harm,"" the Statement of Administration Policy said. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, denounced the Democratic measure as little more than ""a press release designed to attack President Trump."" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California called it a ""meaningless vote"" on a measure that will never be sent to the president or ""limit his constitutional authority to defend the American people.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-dc-iran-vote-1.5420384,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-united-states-trump-conflict-sanctions-retaliation-1.5420012 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-trump-iran-iraq-soleimani-1.5419972 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-jan-8-2020-1.5417307/trump-wants-europe-to-do-more-in-middle-east-it-s-in-their-interest-to-do-so-says-professor-1.5419452 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canadian-troops-vance-iraq-kuwait-1.5417627,N/A

456,Anonymous,2019-12-11T18:24:43.853Z,Suu Kyi denies Myanmar genocide allegations at International Court of Justice,"Myanmar's former pro-democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday denied the armed forces committed genocide against the Rohingya minority, telling the UN's top court the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Muslims was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents. Suu Kyi denied allegations the army had killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017 in what Myanmar's accusers describe as a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that saw more than 700,00 Rohingya flee to neighbouring Bangladesh. She said the allegations stem from ""an internal armed conflict started by co-ordinated and comprehensive armed attacks ... to which Myanmar's defence services responded. Tragically, this armed conflict led to the exodus of several hundred thousand Muslims."" Her appearance at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was striking in that Suu Kyi was defending the very armed forces that had kept her under house arrest for about 15 years. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize in absentia for championing democracy and rights under Myanmar's then-ruling junta. A small group of her supporters gathered Wednesday outside The Hague-based court. Rohingya representatives and rights group said they were appalled by Suu Kyi's testimony. ""The world will judge their claim of no genocide with evidence,"" said Mohammed Mohibullah, chairman of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights. ""A thief never admits he is a thief, but justice can be delivered through evidence."" Suu Kyi told the court the African nation of Gambia, which brought the legal action against Myanmar on behalf of the 57-country Organization of Islamic Cooperation, had provided ""an incomplete and misleading factual picture"" of what happened in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state in August 2017. Gambia alleges genocide was committed and is still ongoing. It has asked the world court to take action to stop the violence, including ""all measures within its power to prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide"" in Myanmar. In three days of hearings this week, judges are hearing the first phase of the case: Gambia's request for provisional measures — the equivalent of a restraining order — against Myanmar to protect the Rohingya population until the case is heard in full. Whether that will happen is not yet clear. But if the court grants the provisional measures, Canada's special envoy to Myanmar, Bob Rae, said UN organizations and others may be granted access to Rakhine they've not had previously. ""From my point of view listening to the two sides, I'd say that the very least that we ... should be able to get from the court is some greater degree of protection for the civilian Rohingya population,"" Rae told CBC News Network on Wednesday. Rae said Suu Kyi's assertion the allegations are an internal matter that will be dealt with in Myanmar lacks credibility. ""The Myanmar army is not capable of taking the kind of action against its own members that clearly has to be taken,"" Rae said. Having travelled to the region several times since he was appointed to the envoy role two years ago, he said every conversation he had with someone now living in a camp for the displaced revealed ""another atrocity.  ""I flew over northern Rakhine — I've not been allowed to travel either by car or on foot in northern Rakhine apart from one small community — but I've seen burnt-out villages."" Rae said he's had interviews with women who describe being tortured and raped and the killing of their children. But Suu Kyi said developments in one of Myanmar's poorest regions are ""complex and not easy to fathom."" She detailed how the army responded on Aug. 25, 2017, to attacks by insurgents trained by Afghan and Pakistan extremists. Addressing the court in her capacity as Myanmar's foreign minister, Suu Kyi insisted the armed forces had tried ""to reduce collateral damage"" during fighting in 12 locations. While conceding excessive force might have been used and one helicopter may have killed ""non-combatants,"" Suu Kyi said a Myanmar investigation is looking into what happened and should be allowed to finish its work. ""Can there be genocidal intent on the part of a state that actively investigates, prosecutes and punishes soldiers and officers who are accused of wrongdoing?"" she asked the court. Suu Kyi and Myanmar's legal team argued the genocide convention does not apply to Myanmar. They invoked Croatia during the Balkans wars in the 1990s, saying no genocide was deemed there when thousands of people were forced from their homes by fighting. Although a UN fact-finding mission found ""the gravest crimes under international law"" had been committed in Myanmar and called for genocide trials, no court has weighed evidence and established a genocide in Myanmar.  Rights groups joined Rohingya representatives in slamming the claims Suu Kyi and Myanmar's legal team made in The Hague. George Graham, humanitarian advocacy director at Save the Children, said Suu Kyi's remarks ""fly in the face of all the evidence gathered by the UN, and the testimony our own teams have heard from countless survivors."" ""Rohingya families have faced patterns of unimaginable horrors in a campaign of violence. Children and their parents have been systematically killed, maimed and raped,"" he said, adding that ""the government of Myanmar has failed at every turn to punish those responsible."" Amnesty International's Nicholas Bequelin accused Suu Kyi of trying to downplay the severity of crimes committed against the Rohingya and ""wouldn't even refer to them by name or acknowledge the scale of the abuses. Such denials are deliberate, deceitful and dangerous."" ""The exodus of more than three quarters of a million people from their homes and country was nothing but the result of an orchestrated campaign of murder, rape and terror,"" he said. On Tuesday, Gambia's Justice Minister Aboubacarr Tambadou urged the ICJ to ""tell Myanmar to stop these senseless killings, to stop these acts of barbarity that continue to shock our collective conscience, to stop this genocide of its own people."" Also Tuesday, the U.S. slapped economic sanctions on four Myanmar military officers suspected of human rights violations. It sanctioned Min Aung Hlaing, commander of Myanmar's armed forces, over allegations of serious rights abuses. Deputy commander Soe Win and two other military leaders, Than Oo and Aung Aung, were also targeted. CBC's Nahlah Ayed and Stephanie Jenzer travelled to Bangladesh in 2017 and Myanmar in 2018.

458,Angela MacIvor,2017-06-16T17:13:25.431Z,How changes to prostitution laws shifted the way police tackle the issue,"More than two years after a controversial federal bill came into force that changed the laws around sex work, police forces in Nova Scotia have taken different approaches to prostitution cases. While most files investigated by Cape Breton Regional Police have focused on people who buy sex, RCMP and Halifax Regional Police officers have tended to concentrate on those who are trafficking women and girls. ""Our most serious cases [are] dealing with young persons that are victimized,"" said Staff Sgt. Darrell Gaudet of the Halifax Regional Police VICE unit. The number of prostitution-related charges filed by provincial RCMP and Halifax Regional Police has dropped since the law changed in 2014. CBC News obtained statistics that show 44 charges were laid 2013. Last year, the total was 24. It's unclear how many charges led to convictions as many cases are still before the courts. The statistics do not include charges laid by municipal police forces outside the Halifax region. The drop is primarily due to the fact that prostitution is now treated as a form of sexual exploitation, rather than a crime. An entire section of the Criminal Code focusing on the criminality of prostitution was struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2013. New federal legislation was subsequently drafted, and in November 2014 Bill C-36 became law. It targeted people who buy and exploit sexual services in Canada. In September 2015, Cape Breton Regional Police charged 27 men with obtaining sexual services for consideration. The sting, called Operation John Be Gone, was aimed at cracking down on men searching for prostitutes in Sydney's downtown core. ""We felt we had to do something to deter and protect these women from further exploitation, and we felt the undercover operation was the best way to enforce Bill C-36,"" CBRP Staff Sgt. Jodie Wilson said. An additional three charges were laid following the sting, including one count of receiving material benefit from sexual services and one charge of procuring a person to offer or provide sexual services. The law change prompted a new mindset in the department, said Wilson, leading officers to treat prostitutes as victims rather than criminals. ""It was a real eye-opener once we developed a rapport with some of the women on the street, to learn what they're actually subjected to and the violent acts by johns and pimps,"" she said. ""We realized that a lot of these women aren't there by choice."" Canada's revised prostitution law follows the Nordic model. Sweden first introduced changes in 1999, and has since touted a dramatic shift in demand. ""We can see that it's a bad market for the traffickers,"" said Det. Insp. Simon Haggstrom of the National Swedish Police Force. ""We can see quite clearly the effect of the legislation that it is not socially acceptable to buy sex in Sweden at all."" Haggstrom visited Yarmouth, N.S., this week to speak at a conference about how he investigates trafficking cases. He also met with police officers in Halifax and Truro. The Swedish officer insists that focusing on clients is the most effective approach. ""You have to go after the pimps and the traffickers, and you should do that. But you also must go after the johns,"" he said. ""I think you are in the same place here in Canada as we were after two or three years with the legislation back in Sweden. It takes some time for a new law to be enforced."" According to officers with the Halifax VICE unit, johns don't get a pass. Since 2015, seven people have been charged for communicating for the purpose of obtaining sexual services. Gaudet said his biggest challenge currently is taking care of his team's mental health. ""I have to keep an eye on my investigators, make sure they're not burnt out because it is very taxing work,"" he said. ""They become emotionally involved in the cases and sometimes that leads to burnout."" In the Halifax VICE unit, there are two dedicated officers. Gaudet said when he worked on the city's prostitution task force the early 90s, there was a team of 12 investigators. Now, his unit focuses on the most serious cases where ""someone has been victimized."" ""The victims have to feel safe before they're going to testify,"" he said. ""One of our main goals is to get the youth and the victims off the street, to get them to a normal life. They're being victimized and we're trying to stop that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-prostitution-law-human-trafficking-police-1.4162524,[],N/A
459,Wendy Martin,2020-01-24T01:03:03.631Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence","A Cape Breton obstetrician facing dismissal from his job at the regional hospital is facing accusations of sexual misconduct from two female patients. Dr. Manivasan Moodley is scheduled for a formal Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons disciplinary hearing next month related to allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. The details of the allegations were posted on the college's website Thursday, just hours before a rally in support of Moodley was scheduled to be held in front of the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in Sydney. In the case of a patient referred to only as A.B., the college alleges Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in an sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. For patient C.D., the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace. About 80 people attended the rally, which took place in front of the hospital Thursday evening. ""Bring Moodley back, bring Moodley back,"" ralliers chanted. Some people carried signs with messages that said ""Stop pushing doctors out,"" ""Stop abusing doctors,"" ""Respect foreign doctors,"" ""Re-instate Dr. Moodley now,"" and ""Name those who want Moodley out."" A petition was passed around and signed at the rally asking for Moodley's medical licence and sponsorship to be reinstated so he can continue practising medicine. Julia Farr, one of the protesters, said Moodley is her sister's doctor. She said she's concerned about what would happen to her sister's care if Moodley is no longer able to practise. ""We don't need to lose anymore doctors, we need to bring them back in,"" Farr said. Dr. Gus Grant, the college's registrar, said the allegations against Moodley are ""extraordinarily serious"" and follow a significant period of investigation. Moodley, who arrived in Cape Breton in March 2017 from South Africa, has been working as an obstetrician and gynecologist on what's known as a ""defined licence"" in Nova Scotia. As a foreign-trained doctor, he is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship is being withdrawn, and his last day of work is Friday. On Wednesday, before the allegations against him were made public, he said he was bewildered by the sudden withdrawal of his sponsorship, and has been given no reason for it. ""I think that doctors who are recruited here should be treated with respect and dignity,"" he said in an interview. He acknowledged he faced two complaints against him, but refused to discuss the details. On Thursday, he refused comment after more information was shared by the college. Since September 2017, Moodley has been working under restrictions imposed by the college that require him to have an attendant present at all times when treating patients and not to contact patients outside a clinical setting. A notice dated Sept. 22, 2017, does not outline why the restrictions were imposed. A letter informing patients of the restrictions is posted in Moodley's office, by order of the college. On Wednesday, Dr. Margaret Fraser, a family and emergency room doctor in Sydney and the head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said Moodley was being tossed aside like ""a piece of garbage."" She said Moodley is well-liked and highly respected, and acts as a mentor to the other members of the department, most of whom are early in their careers. On Thursday, she said in a Facebook post the rally of his supporters was still on. She said none of the allegations against Moodley had been proven and she suspected they had been ""leaked so people will stay away and they can quietly dispose of him."" But Grant said he worries the ""public attention"" garnered by the withdrawal of Moodley's sponsorship will put extra pressure on the two complainants. ""It's very difficult to summon the courage to bring a complaint against a physician for sexual misconduct,"" he said in an interview. ""And with the public attention being brought to Dr. Moodley's licensure, I think there's an added intimidation that will be felt, perhaps unintentionally, but there will be a certain degree of intimidation felt by these women who are coming forward, to help us regulate the profession."" The Nova Scotia Health Authority said it cannot comment on matters involving staff. Moodley was recruited by the former head of the obstetrics department at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, who has since retired. The disciplinary hearing, which will be open to the public, is scheduled for Feb. 24 at the college's office in Bedford. Additional dates have been set aside for Feb. 25-28, March 31 and April 1.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forestry-northern-pulp-lahey-report-environment-ecology-1.5436402 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-changing-municipal-training-after-cbrm-in-camera-pay-discussions-1.5436718 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lower-sackville-water-main-break-under-repair-1.5437027 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/eagle-watch-sheffield-mills-1.5437273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-emergency-winter-shelter-burst-pipe-new-home-1.5436536,N/A
460,Adam Hunter,2019-11-14T21:55:27.372Z,"Province's growth plan includes increasing Sask. population and oil production, new overseas trade offices","The Saskatchewan government has released its 10-year plan to grow the province's population and economy. The growth plan includes goals of increasing the population by 226,000 and creating 100,000 more jobs by 2030. ""Growth allows us to help and protect the most vulnerable among us,"" Moe said. ""Growth enables us to provide opportunity for young people so they stay in Saskatchewan.""  Premier Scott Moe shared the details of the plan, which he teased in the fall throne speech, at a Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce event Thursday morning.  Saskatchewan's population is now 1.174 million, according to the most recent Statistics Canada estimates. In 2012, the Saskatchewan Party government announced a growth plan that aimed for 1.2 million people by 2020. ""Growth will afford the ability to invest in a better quality of life for Saskatchewan families and communities,"" Moe said.  The province's plan includes 30 goals for 2030. Aside from population and job growth, those include: Another new initiative revealed in the plan is the revival of international trade offices in Japan, India and Singapore. In an effort to increase trade by 50 per cent in the next decade, the provincial government will also be hiring Harper and Associates, the consulting firm of former Prime Minister Stephen Harper. ""We expect that Prime Minister Harper is going to help us increase our exports to the more than 150 countries where we do business each and every day,"" Moe said.   In 1991, the NDP government closed three international trade offices in Hong Kong, Minneapolis and Zurich. The offices are meant to establish a stronger Saskatchewan presence in key trade areas, Moe said. Costs are expected to be announced when the offices are open, Moe said.  ""Saskatchewan is a world class exporter and a powerhouse in our confederation,"" Stephen Harper said in a statement.  ""Its people and products can compete and win at home and around the world."" The government is paying Harper and Associates $240,000 for the contract. Harper is headed to India with Saskatchewan Minister of Trade Jeremy Harrison this week. The government also plans to reinstate cancelled provincial sales tax exemptions for exploratory and downhole drilling. The government said it is hoping the change will ""increase mining exploration and the value of mining exports."" Moe said the taxes need to be competitive. ""We heard from the industry — that the PST changes brought in were putting a damper on exploration,"" Moe said. ""We're hopeful and we know that this policy change will encourage more exploration."" Opposition NDP leader Ryan Meili said growing the population would be a positive step for the government, but that the key is making sure the province can handle it.  ""It's not just about more people, it's about making sure that people's lives are good in the province. Where are the children of those 1.4 million people going to go to school?"" Meili said.   ""We need to make sure that we understand that fundamental foundation of that growth is the people of the province."" Meili said he would focus more on the success of people, better health care, film and cultural sectors. He said Moe didn't mention opportunities for renewable energy sources like wind and solar. He also said more contracts should go to local workers instead of outside corporations.  Meili said he agreed with Moe's plans to open international offices and add more revenue to the current commodities through processing locally. Moe said more people need to know what's going on in Saskatchewan's. ""For example, more people in this province and nation should know about Verdient Foods in Vanscoy,"" Moe said. ""Two years after that announcement, I'm still amazed that there are people that don't realize the size of the investment that they have made here."" Moe said that by cutting regulatory burdens, his government can increase small business in the province. Moe said they have done red tape reductions so far but they can do more. He said he plans to appoint a business advisory panel to inform the province's red-tape reduction committee, which informs the government on what the industry wants in terms of regulations.  ""We want people to start a business, and we want them to grow a business here."" Moe said there has been no better time to start a business.

461,Anonymous,2019-12-08T17:49:00.679Z,Angela Merkel pays 1st visit to Auschwitz as German chancellor,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel voiced a feeling of ""deep shame"" during her first-ever visit on Friday to the hallowed grounds of the former Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau, where Adolf Hitler's regime murdered more than a million people. Merkel noted that her visit comes amid rising anti-Semitism and historical revisionism and vowed that Germany would not tolerate anti-Semitism. She said Germany remains committed to remembering the crimes that it committed against Jews, Poles, Roma and Sinti, homosexuals and others. Speaking to a gathering that included former Auschwitz inmates, she said she felt ""deep shame in the face of the barbaric crimes committed by Germans here."" ""Nothing can bring back the people who were murdered here. Nothing can reverse the unprecedented crimes committed here. These crimes are and will remain part of German history and this history must be told over and over again,"" she said. She called such responsibility a key element in German national identity today. Merkel also brought a donation of 60 million euros ($88.1 million Cdn), which will go to a fund to conserve the physical remnants of the site — the barracks, watchtowers and personal items like shoes and suitcases of those killed. Together, those objects endure as evidence of one of the most recognizable symbols of humanity's capacity for evil. But they also are deteriorating under the strain of time and mass tourism, prompting a long-term conservation effort. Accompanied by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Merkel began by seeing a crematorium and walking under the gate with the notorious words ""Arbeit Macht Frei."" That was a cynical phrase that meant ""work will set you free,"" when the truth was that inmates were subjected to either immediate execution, painful scientific experiments or forced labour. Merkel and Morawiecki went next to the site of executions, where they bowed their heads before two wreaths bearing their nations' colours. The stay lasting several hours also included a visit to the conservation laboratory, where old leather shoes were laid out on a table, and a laying of candles at Birkenau, the part of the vast complex where Jews were subjected to mass murder in gas chambers. The donation to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation comes in addition to 60 million euros that Germany donated when the foundation was launched a decade ago, according to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial, which is funded in part by the foundation. That brings the total German donation to 120 million euros and makes Germany by far the most generous of 38 countries that have contributed. As with the earlier donation, half comes from the federal government and half from the German states, an acknowledgement of the German nation's responsibility. Nazi German forces killed an estimated 1.1 million people at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex during their occupation of Poland during the Second World War. Most of the victims were Jews transported from across Europe to be killed in gas chambers. But tens of thousands of others were killed there, too, including Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and Roma, or Gypsies. The camp was liberated by the Soviet army on Jan. 27, 1945. Since becoming chancellor in 2005, Merkel has paid her respects at other Nazi concentration camps, and she has been five times to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum and memorial. Still, Poland's Foreign Ministry called her visit ""historic,"" in an acknowledgement of the unique status Auschwitz has in the world's collective memory. The ministry also noted that it was just the third visit of an incumbent head of a German government.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/poland-auschwitz-merkel-germany-1.5386676,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/germany-poland-second-world-war-1.4280440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/germany-dey-nazi-trial-1.5324055 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/belarus-ceremony-holocaust-victims-1.5144736 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/helmut-oberlander-nazi-supreme-court-1.5385268,N/A

The civil lawsuit accuses the Mail on Sunday of copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating the U.K's data protection law with the ""intrusive"" publication of the letter, a spokesperson for Schillings, the law firm handling the case, said. Prince Harry accused the Mail on Sunday of editing the letter in ""an intentionally destructive manner"" to ""manipulate"" readers with an unflattering portrayal of his wife, who was the American actress known as Meghan Markle before the couple married in May 2018. In a long statement lambasting British tabloids more broadly, Harry said the lawsuit had ""been many months in the making"" following a ""ruthless campaign"" to smear Meghan by a ""press pack that has vilified her almost daily"" and created ""lie after lie at her expense"" during her maternity leave. ""I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in,"" the prince said in the statement posted on the couple's royal website. ""There is a human cost to this relentless propaganda, specifically when it is knowingly false and malicious, and though we have continued to put on a brave face — as so many of you can relate to — I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been,"" Harry said. A Mail on Sunday spokesperson told Britain's Press Association the paper ""stands by the story it published and will be defending this case vigorously. ""Specifically, we categorically deny that the duchess's letter was edited in any way that changed its meaning.""  Harry has criticized British celebrity news coverage before. He lashed out at aggressive paparazzi that stalked Meghan's every move when they were dating and offensive treatment of her biracial heritage by some media. In Tuesday's statement, he mentioned his late mother, Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash while being pursued by paparazzi, as the reason he knew the move to take a tabloid to court ""may not be the safe one, it is the right one. ""Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,"" he said. ""I've seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. Meghan and Harry are paying for the lawsuit with private and not public funds, the Press Association reported. The news agency said if damages are awarded to Meghan, they will be donated to a charity that combats bullying. The lawsuit also names the Mail on Sunday's parent company, Associated Newspapers. Harry said the couple and their baby son, Archie, have received positive news coverage during their royal tour in southern Africa that demonstrated how Meghan has been subjected to press ""bullying"" back home.

Burns, one of Scotland's best-known poets and a pioneer of the Romantic movement, was born Jan. 25, 1759. Since his death in 1796, Burns Nights have become an international tradition — including in New Brunswick, where Scottish immigrants first began to arrive in the early 1800s. The province's rich Scottish heritage has been carried on in place names such as Campbellton, Elgin, Minto, Perth-Andover, Rothesay and Saint Andrews.   According to the New Brunswick Scottish Cultural Association, at least five Burns Night celebrations are taking place this year in New Brunswick communities from Kincardine to Miramichi.  Part of Burns's lasting appeal could be his depictions of working-class life. ""Burns speaks to people now the same way he spoke to people 230 years ago,"" said Dr. Sandra Bell, professor of English at UNB Saint John. Burns, a poor tenant farmer-turned-poet, ""speaks about the natural world in a way many of us recognize, about love and all of its glories and anguish — about politics, and the role of the average person,"" said Bell.  ""In a democracy, like we live in, the common person has a lot to say — perhaps even more so in the 21st century than in the late 18th century."" <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/robertburns?src=hash"">#robertburns</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BurnsNight?src=hash"">#BurnsNight</a> BURNS WAS SO COOL🍾🍾🍾🤣🤣 <a href=""https://t.co/AwEBfnijcw"">pic.twitter.com/AwEBfnijcw</a> Although the old-fashioned dialect used in poems such as Auld Lang Syne, To a Mouse, and Ode to a Haggis can be intimidating, Burns's archaic language is ""one of those things that draws you and makes him unique,"" Bell said. Not everybody gets Robbie Burns — which is fine. Gotta confess: still confused as to why <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fredericton?src=hash"">#Fredericton</a> has a Robbie <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Burns?src=hash"">#Burns</a> statue. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nb?src=hash"">#nb</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/frednb?src=hash"">#frednb</a> ""For some people, that Scottish dialect is difficult,"" Bell said. ""But he still brings people together. His writing looks to the past, but also allows us to talk about the present."" Moreover, Burns Night has become a tradition in its own right. ""For 200 some years, people have been gathering and celebrating,"" Bell said. ""You don't want to give that up. ""It's an evening of fun, food, song, and poetry, and that's a good way to gather people together.""

464,Keith Boag,2020-01-22T10:34:41.585Z,Trump's defenders emboldened by their certainty of a win: Keith Boag,"""Why should this trial be different than any other trial?"" asked U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff as he opened the Democrats' case for convicting the president and removing him from office. ""The short answer is, it shouldn't."" But of course Schiff knows that politics assures the impeachment trial will be different, and in the most important ways. The Republican Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, drafted rules for the trial that allowed the possibility there might be no witnesses heard and no evidence presented even from the House investigation that produced the articles of impeachment that form the basis for the prosecution.  Watch: Rep. Adam Schiff makes his argument against the proposed trial rules On Tuesday, on the first day of the trial, Republicans rejected three Democratic efforts to obtain documents and evidence.  A trial without witnesses and evidence is not a trial, the Democrats complain — a seemingly compelling argument on the face of it. But the Senate is not a courtroom, and McConnell is proud to say the majority of his ""jurors"" are in lockstep with the White House to assure an acquittal. And that's the crucial distinction between any other trial and the Senate's trial of Donald Trump. The verdict is effectively already in: Democrats need 67 votes to convict and they don't have them — they're 20 short. Republicans believe they can't lose. So the battle over the rules governing evidence, witnesses and so on isn't really about the case Republicans and Democrats can make to the Senate so much as it's about the case they can make to the TV viewing audience.  That's a battle about whether the public will perceive the seemingly inevitable acquittal of Trump as justice or a sham. It's about what Americans are allowed to see and to hear to help them make up their own minds about whether to remove the president from office when they have that chance in November's election. With no easily imagined way to lose the case, Trump's defenders seem emboldened to embrace some brazen tactics, like using the platform of the trial to spread demonstrably false, easily discredited claims. ""The president has done nothing wrong,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone assured everyone in his opening statement for the president's defence Tuesday. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. That's certainly the president's position. But Cipollone knows that it's officially untrue that the president did nothing wrong.  A report last week from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said the president flat out broke the law. It said he violated the Impoundment Control Act when he directed a freeze on nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved — the exact thing at the very heart of the impeachment case. Cipillone also repeated a false characterization of the House intelligence committee's investigation of Trump when he said Democrats held secret meetings in a basement office on Capitol Hill.  It's true neither the public nor the media were invited to those meetings, but that hardly makes them secret. Some 48 Republican members of Congress had access to the meetings and were allowed to ask questions, nine of them sitting on the committee itself. The testimony and evidence they all saw and heard — the Republicans included — they all kept secret, as they are routinely required to do in those circumstances. There was one truly secret detail about the House investigation: The ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, was apparently personally involved in the Ukraine scandal and didn't tell anybody. It seems he and a member of his staff were secretly active players in what Nunes nevertheless publicly dismissed as nothing but a ""hoax"" while he sat on the committee hearings about it.  That inconvenient little bombshell was alleged by Lev Parnas, a small-time operator and indicted (for campaign finance schemes) former associate of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas unexpectedly started blabbing to the media in lengthy interviews last week, and he had a lot to say. If the Trump team hadn't been so sure that the Senate trial was a lock, they might have worked harder to get to the bottom of the story so they'd be better prepared to contain the blast when the former Giuliani conniver turned against them.  Parnas — until recently a supporter of Trump — described a broad conspiracy to lean on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and extort political favours from him to help re-elect Trump in November. He tied the conspiracy directly to Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and Nunes, among others, and he produced documentary evidence.  Both the president and Nunes have said they hardly know Parnas. But photographs of Parnas with the president, and the fact Parnas seems to have Nunes's cellphone number, argue otherwise. The White House brushed it all aside with a comment about Parnas's criminal indictment and a suggestion he can't be trusted to tell the truth. But this is the risk of Trump, and Republicans have known it since the beginning: They have no idea from one day to the next what they might be called upon to defend.    Now, and with the spotlight on them, there really is no telling what they might be asked to swallow in this unique trial that Trump and his team believe they can't possibly lose, no matter the evidence. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A

Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recorders for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, Champagne reached out to his counterpart today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes] be sent where [they] should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes contain the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and have information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attack that struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respected on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran. ""In the interests of privacy, I won't go into too much detail ... but I can tell you that the wishes of the family are paramount and we will ensure this is the case in all cases,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to meet with some family members of the crash victims on Monday evening in Winnipeg. On Friday, Trudeau announced that the government would provide $25,000 per victim to assist families in the aftermath of the disaster, while insisting Iran must provide compensation.

466,Anonymous,2020-01-24T01:38:29.184Z,WHO says it's not declaring new virus a global emergency — but it may become one,"A World Health Organization (WHO) panel of experts on the new coronavirus said Thursday ""it is a bit too early"" to consider the outbreak an international emergency — but it may become one, the organization's chief said. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said while the outbreak is an emergency in China, ""it has not yet become a global health emergency."" ""It may yet become one,"" he said. The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the UN agency's headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday. Tedros said the committee was divided again on Thursday. Watch | Tedros explains why the new coronavirus is not a global emergency yet: The new coronavirus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 25 people and infected 830, according to Chinese health authorities. Most of the cases have been in China, but cases have been detected as far away as Thailand. The update Friday morning also confirmed the first death outside the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located. WHO defines a global emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.  ""For the moment, the WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade,"" Tedros said. Previous global emergencies have been declared for crises including the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio. A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Deciding whether an outbreak amounts to an international crisis can therefore also be politically fraught. In 2014, WHO initially resisted declaring the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be a global emergency because it feared the announcement would anger Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The UN agency ultimately declared the Ebola outbreak a global emergency after more than 1,000 people had died and the virus had spread across multiple national borders. The Canadian government urged travellers on Thursday to ""exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws,"" a notice that is one level below an official travel advisory. The government previously said in a travel health notice that the ""overall risk to Canadian travellers and to Canada remains low."" Watch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discusses the virus: Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. A CDC spokesperson later said the agency is seeking emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow states to use its diagnostic test for the outbreak. Early this week, the agency said it expected to see more cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country that is due to report back to the panel. Tedros said China had taken measures that the WHO believes are appropriate. Peter Piot, a professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the outbreak was at a critical phase. ""Regardless of the decision not to declare this a public health emergency of international concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks,"" he said. ""National authorities and the World Health Organization will need to continue to monitor developments very closely."" In separate developments, three research teams are to start work on developing potential vaccines against the new coronavirus, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said on Thursday. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is co-funding the emergency projects, said the plan was to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June. The research will be conducted by the drug and vaccine developer, Moderna, working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the U.S. firm Inovio Pharma, and a team at the University of Queensland, Australia. Each of the three projects will test a distinct scientific approach to developing a preventative vaccine against the China virus, known as nCoV-2019. ""Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks,"" said Richard Hatchett, CEPI's chief executive. ""There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5437217,N/A

But as the dog's owner takes her pet's fight for life all the way to B.C's. Court of Appeal, animal advocates fear Punky's legal battle may inadvertently make it easier to kill more corrigible canines provincewide. ""The decision in this case will have far reaching implications on all dangerous dog matters in this province,"" animal rights lawyer Rebekah Breder said as she argued Friday before B.C.'s Court of Appeal. ""(It could) essentially mean an automatic death sentence for dogs that are considered dangerous that would really put us back 15 years in where the case law has taken us."" Breder represents three of five organizations granted leave Friday to intervene in Punky's appeal — the B.C. SPCA, HugABull and RAPS, the Richmond-based Regional Animal Protection Society. It's rare enough for a dangerous dog case to make it all the way to the province's highest court, but the issues at play in Punky's situation mean the outcome will set precedent regardless. For more than a decade, provincial court judges have stopped short of ordering the destruction of many dogs deemed by animal control officers to be dangerous, releasing them on ""conditional orders"" instead. The order might call for a dog trainer and the rehabilitation of dog, owner or both. It could call for muzzling, increased security or even adoption. But the ability to grant a conditional order isn't written into the law. And as the City of Vancouver fights for Punky's death, their lawyers plan to point that out — arguing that technically, judges have no jurisdiction to grant reprieves to dangerous dogs. If the appeal court agrees, Breder says the lives of hundreds of dogs declared dangerous every year but able to be rehabilitated would be at risk. ""The authorities establish that provincial courts have been releasing dogs on conditions for at least 15 years, with no evidence that doing so has put the public at risk."" Breder's argument for intervention reads. ""Reversing this trend would have a devastating effect on dogs as those who would otherwise be able to become good canine citizens would automatically be euthanized once found to be 'dangerous.'"" Susan Santics says she ""rescued"" Punky as a puppy four years ago from drunk people who sold him at the Vancouver Folk Festival. According to the original provincial court decision ordering the dog's death, Punky sunk his teeth into Alyssa Prattas' leg at Locarno Park on Aug. 27, 2017. She was seated on the grass, texting. Punky was jumping up and down. ""When she next looked up she saw that Punky was chasing a bird in the sky,"" wrote Judge Wilson Lee. ""Punky then saw Ms. Prattas and charged at her."" Punky sank his teeth into Prattas' leg and hand. ""Her wounds continued to bleed profusely for a week and some of her injuries did not completely stop bleeding until weeks later,"" Lee wrote. ""The wounds have left scarring and a loss of sensation in some areas. Ms. Prattas still has ongoing pain and sensitivity."" The court heard from a dog trainer who recommended Punky be neutered and muzzled, a veterinarian who claimed he couldn't examine Punky without being attacked and an animal control officer who said she tried for an hour to get Punky into her vehicle — even using a catchpole — before Santics agreed to drive him to an animal shelter. A B.C. Supreme Court judge upheld the lower court's destruction order, leaving Santics no option but the appeal court for another stay of execution. Her lawyer, Victoria Shroff, argues that Punky was condemned on a dearth of evidence and that the onus is on the city to meet a higher threshold where the life of a sentient animal hangs in the balance. ""The case might be about one dog but we're really talking about all dogs,"" Shroff said outside the appeal court. ""This is the every-dog. This a dog that has been accused of something without any proof at the lower courts about the levels of his dangerousness and the levels of his rehabilitation. That's patently unfair."" One of the issues underlying the whole situation is what advocates claim is a relatively low bar to declaring a dog dangerous — written into both Vancouver's Charter and the Community Charter relied on by the rest of the province. A dog can be declared dangerous if it has killed or seriously injured a person, killed or seriously injured a domestic animal while in a public place or on private property other than the owner's or if ""an animal control officer has reasonable grounds to believe"" the dog is likely to kill or seriously injure someone else. ""The threshold of meeting the statutory definition of ""dangerous dog"" is too low for the draconian order of destruction (i.e. death sentence) of a person's sentient companion,"" Shroff writes in her appeal. ""Dogs for most owners, and certainly the appellant, are more aptly described as beloved family members rather than simple property."" Shroff says she doesn't believe the appeal court judges should consider the legal validity of conditional orders, which she believes are accepted law, no matter what the city's position. But she accepts the fact that Punky's case may have opened up a can of legal worms. Santics meanwhile comes from New Westminster once a week, to visit Punky for half an hour at a time, in his doggie death row cell. ""He is in a small kennel. He is allowed out to play for — I am told — three times a day, but in not a very large area,"" she says. Santics, a retired nurse's aide, who testified that she values Punky more than her own home, says she's been getting training of her own, in case Punky wins his appeals. If need be, Shroff says she's willing to take Punky's case all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Santics shrugs as she sits outside the court. She says she'll follow the dog wherever he takes her. Even Canada's highest court? ""Where's that?"" she asks. ""Ottawa?""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dangerous-dogs-punky-court-1.5096502,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dog-death-shooting-savary-justice-1.4708674 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/airbnb-strata-fight-emily-yu-1.4765183 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dog-strata-small-retriever-civil-dispute-1.4665833,N/A

Unifor national president Jerry Dias was among the group arrested and charged. Those arrested must now stay at least 500 metres away from pickets.  ""It was not like they're going to drop it,"" Anderson said. ""It was all legit, and as of right now, obviously it's in our lawyers' hands."" Approximately 40 union members from Windsor are currently in Regina taking part in protests at the Co-op Refinery Complex, after Unifor Local 594 issued a 48-hour strike notice in early December that culminated in the refinery locking out employees on Dec. 5, 2019.  The strike notice and lockout came after pension bargaining broke down in November without an agreement.  ""[Unifor Local] 444 has been here since day one, they've been rotating in and out about every two weeks,"" said Anderson, who took part in protests throughout the winter holidays, left to go on a family vacation and returned to Regina afterwards.

469,Jon Hernandez,2019-03-21T12:00:00.140Z,Transit advocates call for hydrogen trains on century-old Fraser Valley rail corridor,"As a long freight train thunders past Rick Green along the Langley Bypass, he can't help but wonder why the century-old tracks aren't being used to transport commuters. ""How come this hasn't happened?"" asks Green, who is the township's former mayor. ""If you don't have proper transportation, you've got nothing."" While Vancouver and Surrey move ahead on major SkyTrain projects, Green says there's a notable absence of rapid public transit options between communities in the Fraser Valley. But he says there's an affordable solution to the problem. Green is part of a group called South Fraser Community Rail, and members are actively campaigning TransLink and municipalities across the region to get onboard a proposed hydrogen-powered train transit project that would connect Surrey all the way to Chilliwack — utilizing land that's already owned by B.C. taxpayers. A network of interurban rails connect Surrey all the way to Chilliwack. The Fraser Valley corridor is more than a century old, and was even used for passenger travel until the 1950s, when it reverted to freight-use only. Freight rights are currently owned by both Southern Railway of B.C. and Canadian Pacific Railways. But the province has rights to the land through its Crown corporation, B.C. Hydro, and can reintroduce passenger service to the corridor in the future, according to a sales agreement from 1988. ""The freight companies have to provide adequate time for use of passenger [service],"" said Green, referring to a master agreement between C.P. Rail and B.C. Hydro. In a statement to CBC News, TransLink said it's in the early stages of assessing how these interurban rail corridors could be used for public transit. While no plans are set in stone, the South Fraser Community Rail is strongly advocating for a hydrogen-powered train to eventually carry commuters along the 99-kilometre stretch between Surrey and Chilliwack. Hydrogen trains are currently operating in Germany. They run on hydrogen fuel cells and are said to only emit a mix of water and steam. Since the land is already available, the group says the project could be done for $12.5 million per kilometre. By comparison, the Broadway SkyTrain extension will cost up to $500 million per kilometre. ""This whole line, 99 kilometres, could be re-activated with a state-of-the-art hydrogen rail, for about $1.5 billion,"" said Green. The proposed line would have 12 major stops, including Newton, Langley, Abbotsford, and Chilliwack. The group says it has a meeting with TransLink's planning committee in April. The transit authority did not confirm that meeting, but said it welcomes the group to make a presentation to the Mayor's Council during the public delegation portion of its next session. TransLink says its first priority is to follow through on the Mayors' 10-Year Vision. It's currently in the process of updating a long-term transportation strategy that will incorporate potential uses of interurban rails. Public consultations will begin this summer.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transit-advocates-call-for-hydrogen-trains-on-century-old-fraser-valley-rail-corridor-1.5065117,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/could-the-okanagan-s-transit-future-be-hydrogen-powered-rail-1.4871090 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-go-trains-fuel-cells-1.4162123,N/A
470,Kory Teneycke,2020-01-23T21:57:35.880Z,It's Stephen Harper's party — and he'll do what he wants to,"This column is an opinion by Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for prime minister Stephen Harper, manager of the recent Ontario PC Party campaign, and currently a partner at Rubicon Strategy. Teneycke has declared he will remain neutral in the federal Conservative leadership campaign and has recused himself from work Rubicon is providing for the MacKay campaign. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Even five years after his defeat, the presence of Stephen Harper still defines the Conservative Party of Canada. In any other party it would be a bit odd for a past leader to be so dominant in the race to replace his successor's successor. But not in this one. Only 17 years ago, it was a much younger, more ideologically strident Stephen Harper who forged a new party from the shattered pieces of the PC Party (which had become an Atlantic Canadian regional rump) and the Canadian Alliance (Preston Manning's failed effort to rebrand the Reform Party). As a Reform Party staffer and later as a Member of Parliament, Harper had always been a hardliner. Critical of Manning for his lack of conservatism and dismissive of those advocating the need for the two right-of-centre parties to merge. In running for the Canadian Alliance leadership, he was full of bravado about the ability of the CA to best the PC Party electorally. But in what would become a telling sign of his future approach to governing (best described as pragmatic, conservative incrementalism), in 2003 Harper adjusted course and engineered the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. On matters of party discipline, Harper would sometimes in half-jest quote Louis XIV: ""l'etat c'est moi"" (I am the state). Harper wasn't just the first leader for the first half of its existence, he was the Party. And everybody knew it. Even in departure he continued to maintain a low-profile but powerful role as a director of the Conservative Fund – the body that holds the purse strings for party operations and campaigns. His recent departure from the Fund generated headlines and speculation. Some ""unnamed sources"" have alleged this was to free him to attack potential leadership candidate Jean Charest. It is unlikely that was ever true, but given Charest's decision to not enter the race, it clearly is no longer a motivation. Even if Charest had entered the leadership he would have had to kiss the ring of Harper's legacy, and adopt positions similar to those of Harper on a range of issues — including conservative cultural issues such as gun control. Harper doesn't need to campaign for or against anyone in the party leadership race. Every candidate will be attempting to claim some degree of ownership or continuance of the Harper record, and quietly intimating that they have his private approval. There is no path to victory running against Harper's legacy. The decision to leave the fund is more likely, as National Post columnist John Ivison suggested, an effort to sidestep Andrew Scheer's expense account scandal – of which private school funding is rumoured to be only the tip of the iceberg. Harper has a near anaphylactic intolerance for expense account abuse. While he did get criticism for charging his personal stylist to the Party, Harper's legacy governing is one of transparency. His reforms brought in pro-active disclosure of expenses for cabinet ministers and their staff. And back in Reform Party days he was the alleged source for blowing the whistle on then Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's use of party funds to fix his teeth and purchase bespoke suits. Regardless the reasons for his departure from the Fund, it makes no difference. It is still Harper's party. It is the electoral coalition that he built that is the foundation of the party – not just nationally, but in provinces like Ontario as well. Fundraising letters sent on behalf of the party bring in the most money when sent under his name. Most telling, numerous polls demonstrate Harper continues to be the most popular potential leader for the Conservative Party – by far. He would easily achieve a first-ballot victory if he chose to enter the race (which I predict he won't). Of course, the Conservative Party will need to evolve. It was a mistake for the Scheer campaign to run on a mildly updated version of the Harper 2015 platform. But at its core, the conservative electoral coalition is quite strong. And that is thanks to Stephen Harper.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A
471,Justin McElroy,2017-09-30T14:00:00.610Z,"B.C.'s overdose crisis may be 'new normal,' no matter what politicians say","At the end of every Union of B.C. Municipalities conference, it's tradition that the premier makes an address — and usually makes one big-ticket policy announcement. Christy Clark announced a labour agreement with the British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union one year. Gordon Campbell announced the end of tolls on the Coquihalla at another. This year's conference saw plenty of panels and resolutions on marijuana legalization, housing affordability, and recovery from the wildfires that wreaked havoc to the Interior.  And yet, John Horgan used his speech to announce new programs to combat the overdose crisis: $31.1 million over three years, for innovation funds and addiction clinics and naloxone kits and much more.  It wasn't new money, per se — it came out of the $322 million announced in a September budget update. But it sent a statement that the government wasn't done putting public attention on the deadliest drug crisis in B.C.'s history.  ""This is not something that should be done quietly in the corner,"" said the premier. ""It should be open, it should be loud, in rooms like this, on television screens, on computers right across B.C."" Horgan was talking about public awareness campaigns initiated by public officials. But among the general public, it's an open question whether there is fentanyl fatigue.   British Columbia has been in a public health emergency since April 14, 2016. At the time, the government said it was implemented to ""help prevent future overdoses and deaths by better targeting outreach, bad drug warnings, awareness campaigns and distribution of naloxone training and kits."" Since that time, there have been more targeted outreach, more awareness campaigns, and especially more distribution of naloxone kits — allowing regular citizens to administer the medication that quickly blocks the effects of overdoses. This year alone, over 26,376 kits have been distributed at 588 sites across the province, health officials said. And yet, from January to July this year, 876 people died of an overdose in British Columbia. That's up 81 per cent from the first seven months of 2016. But it's hard to argue public attention on the crisis has risen by the same amount. ""I worry with where we're at ... is a point where people are starting, not necessarily to lose interest, but to throw up their hands, simply because we're running out of new ideas for our response,"" says Travis Lupick, a journalist with the Georgia Straight. Lupick has arguably reported on the current overdose crisis from the frontlines more than anyone in Vancouver, and has a book coming out in November that looks at the city's drug crisis in the 1990s, hoping lessons can be drawn from the the community's response then.    He's concerned that today — even after 36,000 calls to 911 for overdose/posioning since the beginning of 2016 — a certain passivity towards fentanyl is starting to set in.   ""Despite pretty serious significant action, people are beginning to accept this might be the new normal, this might be where it's at.""   Fentanyl was detected in 67% of overdose-related deaths in B.C. last year. <br><br>That seems high, right?<br><br>This year it's at 81%. There was only one panel on the overdose crisis at this year's UBCM, but politicians who attended were certainly engaged, with many responding to simple questions with minute-long monologues about how the situation must improve. ""At a meeting of politicians and bureaucrats, I expected specific questions: how do I implement this program? What sort of resources are required?"" said Lupick.  ""Instead, there were politicians just taking the microphone and expressing frustration similar to how you see activists and community members react on the Downtown Eastside ... I'm really worried we're running out of ideas on how to respond to this, and politicians are feeling that and beginning to feel helpless.""

""I know this is the most urgent task in front of my ministry,"" Darcy said, while outlining a number of new actions her government had taken.  Whether that will have a tangible impact on the number of lives lost will take months to determine.                 ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-normal-overdose-fentanyl-crisis-1.4314578,[],N/A
472,Anonymous,2020-01-03T11:37:15.757Z,"U.S. military killed top Iranian general on Trump's order, Pentagon says","The United States killed Iran's top general and the architect of Tehran's proxy wars in the Middle East in an airstrike at Baghdad's international airport Friday, an attack that threatens to dramatically ratchet up tensions in the region. The targeted killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, could draw forceful Iranian retaliation against American interests in the region and spiral into a far larger conflict between the U.S. and Iran, endangering U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and beyond. The U.S. Defence Department said in a statement that it killed Soleimani because he ""was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region."" It also accused Soleimani of approving the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad earlier this week. An adviser to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani quickly warned U.S. President Donald Trump of retaliation from Tehran. ""Trump through his gamble has dragged the U.S. into the most dangerous situation in the region,"" Hessameddin Ashena wrote on the social media app Telegram. ""Whoever put his foot beyond the red line should be ready to face its consequences."" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that a ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for the U.S.  Iranian state TV carried a statement by Khamenei also calling Soleimani ""the international face of resistance."" Khamenei also declared three days of public mourning for the general's death. Trump was vacationing on his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, but tweeted an American flag shortly after Suleimani's death was confirmed. <a href=""https://t.co/VXeKiVzpTf"">pic.twitter.com/VXeKiVzpTf</a> U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that Iraqis were dancing in the street for freedom. Iraqis — Iraqis — dancing in the street for freedom; thankful that General Soleimani is no more. <a href=""https://t.co/huFcae3ap4"">pic.twitter.com/huFcae3ap4</a> Iran's foreign minister called the killing ""extremely dangerous"" and ""a foolish escalation."" The US' act of international terrorism, targeting &amp; assassinating General Soleimani—THE most effective force fighting Daesh (ISIS), Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al—is extremely dangerous &amp; a foolish escalation.<br><br>The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy commander of Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, or PMF, the officials said. The PMF media arm said the two were killed in an American airstrike that targeted their vehicle on the road to the airport. Citing a Revolutionary Guard statement, Iranian state television said Soleimani was ""martyred"" in an attack by U.S. helicopters near the airport, without elaborating. The dramatic attack comes at the start of a year in which Trump faces both a Senate trial following his impeachment by the U.S. House and a re-election campaign. It marks a potential turning point in the Middle East and represents a drastic change for American policy toward Iran after months of tensions. U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, was critical of the attack in a statement, saying it was done without an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iran and without the consultation of the Congress.  ""The full Congress must be immediately briefed on this serious situation and on the next steps under consideration by the Administration,"" she wrote, ""including the significant escalation of the deployment of additional troops to the region."" The tensions are rooted in Trump's decision in May 2018 to withdraw the U.S. from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers, struck under his predecessor. A senior Iraqi politician and a high-level security official confirmed to The Associated Press that Soleimani and al-Muhandis were among those killed in the attack. Two militia leaders loyal to Iran also confirmed the deaths, including an official with the Kataeb Hezbollah, which was involved in the attack on the U.S. Embassy this week. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said al-Muhandis had arrived to the airport in a convoy to receive Soleimani whose plane had arrived from either Lebanon or Syria. The airstrike occurred as soon as he descended from the plane to be greeted by al-Muhandis and his companions, killing them all. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject and because they were not authorized to give official statements. The senior politician said Soleimani's body was identified by the ring he wore. Soleimani, who has led the foreign arm of the Revolutionary Guards and has had a key role in fighting in Syria and Iraq, acquired celebrity status at home and abroad. He was instrumental in the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East, which the United States and Tehran's regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel have struggled to keep in check. He has been rumoured dead several times, including in a 2006 airplane crash that killed other military officials in northwestern Iran and following a 2012 bombing in Damascus that killed top aides of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. More recently, rumours circulated in November 2015 that Soleimani was killed or seriously wounded leading forces loyal to Assad as they fought around Syria's Aleppo. Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups stormed the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday following U.S. air raids Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah militia bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week. The two-day embassy attack which ended Wednesday prompted Trump to order about 750 U.S. soldiers deployed to the Middle East. It also prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to postpone his trip to Ukraine and four other countries ""to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said Wednesday. The breach at the embassy followed U.S. airstrikes on Sunday that killed 25 fighters of the Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah. The U.S. military said the strikes were in retaliation for last week's killing of an American contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the U.S. blamed on the militia. U.S. officials have suggested they were prepared to engage in further retaliatory attacks in Iraq. ""The game has changed,"" Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday, telling reporters that violent acts by Iran-backed Shiite militias in Iraq — including the rocket attack on Dec. 27 that killed one American — will be met with U.S. military force. He said the Iraqi government has fallen short of its obligation to defend its American partner in the attack on the U.S. embassy. The developments also represent a major downturn in Iraq-U.S. relations that could further undermine U.S. influence in the region and American troops in Iraq and weaken Washington's hand in its pressure campaign against Iran.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/baghdad-airport-missiles-1.5413594,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/baghdad-embassy-iraq-iran-protests-jan1-1.5412257 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-president-rejects-iran-backed-prime-minister-nominee-1.5408814,N/A

474,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:23:55.786Z,UN experts call for investigation after Saudis linked to Jeff Bezos phone hack,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon's billionaire boss Jeff Bezos, United Nations experts said on Wednesday. The UN special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said they had information pointing to the ""possible involvement"" of the prince in the alleged 2018 cyberattack. Saudi officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd. Cybersecurity experts hired by Bezos, the world's richest man, concluded his phone was probably infiltrated by a video file sent from a WhatsApp account purportedly belonging to the prince in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. They said the device began leaking massive amounts of data about a month afterward, the source said. Callamard, the special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, and Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said the allegation of Saudi involvement ""demands immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities."" Outside experts consulted by the UN agreed that while the case was not airtight, the evidence was strong enough to warrant a fuller investigation. But the UN said the case illustrated the dangers ""from the unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware."" Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the charges. ""I think 'absurd' is exactly the right word,"" he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. ""The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos's phone is absolutely silly."" The alleged cyberattack is said to have taken place months before the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""At a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post,"" Callamard and Kaye said in their statement. The special rapporteurs, who released their findings in a statement, report to the UN Human Rights Council, but they are independent watchdogs and not UN officials. Their recommendations are not binding on countries, though are widely seen as carrying moral weight. They stopped short of identifying which specific technology might have been used in the alleged hack, but said software like that made by Israeli company NSO Group or Italian spyware maker Hacking Team could potentially have been deployed. NSO denied its technology was used in the alleged hack. ""We know this because of how our software works and our technology cannot be used on U.S. phone numbers,"" it said. ""Our products are only used to investigate terror and serious crime."" After a merger last year, Hacking Team is now part of Swiss-Italian cyber intelligence firm Memento Labs. Memento Labs's head, Paolo Lezzi, was not immediately available to comment but has previously said he has no knowledge of Hacking Team's earlier operations. With respect to the Khashoggi killing, the crown prince said last year was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it. Callamard led a UN inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. ""The evidence points overwhelmingly — and, in fact, in only one direction — which is that the killing was the state killing,"" she told CBC News in December. The Guardian newspaper first reported the crown prince's alleged involvement in the Bezos phone incident. Listen: Callamard speaks to CBC about Khashoggi murder investigation The relationship between the Amazon chief executive and the Saudi government had soured since early last year after he alluded to Saudi Arabia's displeasure at the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Khashoggi. In a previous flashpoint, Bezos's security chief said last year that the Saudi government had gained access to the Amazon CEO's phone and leaked messages to U.S. tabloid the National Enquirer between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who the newspaper said he was dating. A month before, Bezos had accused the newspaper's owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to Sanchez. The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirer reporting. Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy dismissed the latest allegations. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" it said in a message posted on Twitter.

475,Elizabeth Chiu,2020-01-24T10:00:00.099Z,'Good for your soul': Basketball coach uses comedy to help families heal,"When Colter Simmonds, 41, walks into Dartmouth High, it's not long before teens come up with smiles of surprise and warm hugs. It's the same reception at other schools around Halifax. For the last 20 years, the North Preston, N.S., native — nicknamed C.C., short for Coach Colter — has been earning respect and receiving affection as a mentor to hundreds of children in both sports and school. His coaching in basketball and life is aimed at keeping them off the streets where beefs are sometimes settled with guns, leaving lives violently cut short, and others locked up. What those teens might not realize is those realities were ""close calls"" Simmonds himself escaped. ""For me to be here, I think I'm an example that you can change and do better,"" he said during an interview last week at the North Preston Community Centre. In recent days he's been visiting with school principals, church pastors and bereaved parents — his special guests at Laugh Out Violence, the fundraiser he's organized Feb. 22 at Casino Nova Scotia, during African Heritage Month. Simmonds's goal is a sold-out evening to raise funds for We Will Win Youth Association, the non-profit organization he started in 1999 to help children pursue their dreams on the court, in the classroom or in the community. Comedy, he said, is ""healing, it takes your mind off things, it's good for your soul."" Leaders in the black community carry an added emotional burden, he said. They may know both sides in a dispute that's turned deadly — a situation he's found himself in after mentoring so many kids.  Karen Hudson, principal at Auburn Drive High School, said that's almost inevitable in a small province with many large, extended African-Nova Scotian families. ""You've got to show compassion and show them that you care. And as a black female, you never take off that skin, so you have to let them know that some of the individuals that are within the community, they may affect you too,"" she said. The night of comedy is no joke for Simmonds. He's spent nearly $8,000 of his own money to book the room and the headliners — Mark Walker, from Truro, N.S., and Cedric Newman and Chris Quigley, both from the Toronto area.  The event has no corporate sponsors, although the casino is offering the showroom at a reduced rate. We Will Win Youth Association has taken kids to tournaments around North America, and helped develop NCAA wing Daneesha Provo and NBA G-League guard Lindell Wigginton. Simmonds spent his teens in Toronto where he was an all-star point guard with enough talent to make it to the NCAA or Canadian university basketball, he said. But some ""influences"" tried to pull him in the other direction, and ultimately his attitude blocked him from reaching college ball. Even when he didn't believe in himself, his supporters never gave up on him, telling him, ""You can do better."" That message eventually sunk in, and stayed with him as he became a father at 21, a baptized Christian, a college graduate and now a youth programming co-ordinator. His belief that ""the more you do for others, the more God is going to bless you"" guides him as he pays it forward with the fundraiser.  Simmonds estimates he's known 40 people who've died violently or gone to prison because of it. It drives him to keep connecting with young people, especially those at risk, to show them that turning away from violence creates another path. ""You do what you're exposed to,"" he said. ""If you're exposed to negativity, then that's what you're going to get. If you're exposed to positivity, then there's the likelihood of living a positive life."" He hopes bereaved parents of children he's mentored will attend the evening of entertainment to know ""their child hasn't been forgotten."" The first Laugh Out Violence fundraiser was held in 2017, after Halifax marked 12 homicides in 2016, including three shooting deaths in seven days. Tyler Richards, 29, was among the young men killed. It was a terrible blow to Simmonds. Richards first reached out to Simmonds in 2003 to play for a team he was coaching in Toronto. Their paths crossed again the following year when Richards was trying out for Canada's basketball team, and also in 2013 when Richards made the NBL's Halifax Rainmen, briefly coached by Simmonds. ""Gone too soon, and to know he was somebody that was really wanting to do better in life,"" Simmonds said. R&B, gospel and hip hop musicians, along with a dancer — all who have been mentored by Simmonds — will take the stage at the fundraiser. He said this opportunity fulfils a promise to them. Spoken-word artist Michael Earle, known as MAJE, will perform his song Smile, which features positive lyrics and a music video that shows black fathers and their daughters. Earle didn't know Simmonds's back story until he shared it last week, but ""I always knew he had a big heart."" ""Like C.C. said, his kid is the reason he changed, so being in your kid's life can do miracles for you as a human."" Simmonds's son, Tyrell, was born when he was barely out of his teens.  ""I want him to have me there with him all the way through his life until he's old enough to have his own kids and understand that when I go, it's because it's time, I'm old.""

476,Steve Bruce,2018-11-26T12:02:48.361Z,Lobster trap Christmas tree lights up as memorial to fishermen lost at sea,"Just two months after tragedy struck Tignish, the tight-knit community was given a reason to smile Sunday night. An estimated 600 people gathered outside the Catholic Church in the western P.E.I. town — which has a population of just 700 — to watch a six-metre high Christmas tree, made up of 150 lobster traps, light up the night sky. ""It was just beautiful.  I've never seen anything more beautiful in my life,"" said Isabelle Getson, niece of Moe Getson. Moe Getson was one of two fishermen who died in September. He, along along with Glen DesRoches, died when their boat capsized off North Cape. The tree is a memorial both to them and all of the area's fishermen who have died at sea. ""This is really nice, a place for the community to come and reflect,"" said Blair DesRoches. ""I'm thinking a lot about my brother Glen tonight … I miss him a lot."" The community came together to search for the two fishermen in September, and they did the same to build the tree. Tignish's recreational director Tina Richard said the 100 sets of lights needed to cover the tree were quickly donated by locals. Dozens of fishermen then stepped up to stack all the traps in just two and a half hours. ""Fishermen are wonderful. I thought we needed carpenters. But they're like, 'No, you need fishermen,'"" said Richard. ""I put it on Facebook, and in an hour we had 25 people here … It was amazing."" As part of the tree lighting ceremony, fisherman Mark Arsenault performed a song he wrote just days after the bodies of his two friends were found, which reflects on the tragedy.  ""The community was in shambles, and this was my way of helping to heal myself I guess,"" said Arsenault. ""You don't look at the water the same anymore.  Maybe I will some day."" Richard said  the lobster trap tree will be lit every evening throughout the holiday season, in an effort to bring some peace during what will be a difficult Christmas for many in the community.  Getson's brother, Stewart, said he appreciates the gesture. ""It'll be nice to come up here, and see the tree,"" he said.  ""I'll be coming by plenty often … This is going to help a lot with the healing.""

477,Anonymous,2018-03-08T17:53:08.945Z,"Early cancer screening can lead to unnecessary treatment and side-effects, study suggests"," Read Story Transcript Early screening for prostate cancer can lead to unnecessary treatment, and nasty side-effects, according to a new study.  Richard Martin, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, ran a 10-year, randomized study of PSA testing, involving more than 400,000 men aged 50-69.  Researchers extended a single invitation to men from across the U.K. to undergo PSA screening, a blood test that measures the presence of a protein called prostate-specific antigen, which all healthy men have.  Men who showed raised PSA levels were invited to have a biopsy, which is required to make the firm diagnosis of prostate cancer.  They found that the level of detecting prostate cancer was higher in those who had been invited to the test (the intervention group), than those who were not invited (the control group). But the mortality rate between the two groups was the same.  ""The crucial finding was that there was no difference in the number of men who died of prostate cancer,"" he says of the results, which were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  ""0.3 per cent of men died in both groups, after the ten-years follow up.""  Some prostate cancers are indolent, and harmless, Martin says, while others are aggressive and can kill.  PSA testing highlights both, but cannot distinguish between them. Martin says we also can't tell if a harmless cancer will develop into a dangerous one.  This means patients could undergo treatment for a cancer that would never have harmed them — and living with incontinence, impotence and other health implications as a result. Stuart Edmonds, vice president of research, health promotion, and survivorship at Prostate Cancer Canada, says that the alternative to treatment is active surveillance.  ""You monitor and you don't treat, you only treat the ones [where] the PSA rises or where the biopsy suggests that something suspicious is happening.""  He agrees that better testing is needed.  ""PSA isn't a bad entry point, but it's not a diagnostic,"" he says, noting that results from biopsies and MRIs are improving all the time.  ""We need to do better at diagnosing the aggressive forms of disease — the disease that a man will die of, rather than the disease that a man will die with."" Listen to the full conversation — which includes a conversation with Lorraine Hulley, president and founder of Pro Health Navigators Canada, on how patients can better understand conflicting medical information.  You can share this article across email, Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.

An internal memo sent Tuesday confirmed the now-demolished Canada Training Centre was an unhealthy place to work, and said all employees who worked there will be sent a ""formal notification letter"" about the conditions there. It was issued the same day CBC/Radio-Canada reported on the concerns of a number of officers about the state of the barracks-like building, which trained an RCMP squad tasked with spy operations before closing down in 2006. ""We can confirm that there were hazardous substances present within the building while it was being used to train Special I installers,"" wrote Staff Sgt. Mike Roach in the memo. ""The hazardous substances identified includes friable asbestos, building materials containing silica, rodent and insect infestation, unsafe levels of lead in the water, and hazardous moulds."" The training centre housed a school used mainly for recruits of the force's Special I unit, whose members are called upon to install electronic surveillance equipment during undercover investigations. Several Special I agents spoke with Radio-Canada about the state of disrepair at the facility, 50 kilometres south of downtown Ottawa. They also talked about the nature of their training, which involved drilling holes in the walls and the ceiling. Radio-Canada also spoke to family members of six RCMP officers who trained or worked at the facility and all died between the ages of 39 and 57. In his memo, Roach said the RCMP was preparing ""a formal notification letter that will contain additional information regarding the conditions at Kemptville [and] will be sent directly to every employee that has been identified as having worked in the Kemptville building.""

The printer opened in March 2003 and since then has printed many Maritime publications including The Guardian and The Journal-Pioneer newspapers, entertainment monthly The Buzz and monthly food digest Salty. The company announced in November the plant would close.  ""I can tell you when the lead press-man shut the job off, there wasn't a dry eye in the house,"" said printing plant manager Bruce MacDougall.

480,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-04-24T21:42:54.241Z,Here's how rising air pollution is likely affecting your health,"Welcome to The National Today newsletter, which takes a closer look at what's happening around some of the day's most notable stories. Sign up here and it will be delivered directly to your inbox Monday to Friday. Air pollution is one of the world's biggest killers, responsible for more deaths each year than malnutrition, malaria, AIDS, or alcohol and drug abuse. And a spate of new studies suggest that our problems with unhealthy air are more pernicious and persistent than previously understood.  Today, the American Lung Association released its annual State of the Air report, finding that 43 per cent of U.S. residents — some 141 million people — now live in areas where poor air quality regularly risks damaging their health. That's seven million more people than in the group's last survey.  In places like California — the state that is home to seven of the nation's 10 smoggiest cities — the major driver of air pollution continues to be car and truck traffic, with the rapidly increasing population overwhelming even the most stringent environmental regulations.  Global warming is now also a big factor, creating more hot, dead air days and larger wildfires.  And perhaps most worryingly, only six U.S. metro areas recorded no unhealthy smog or soot days: Bangor, Maine; Burlington, Vt.; Lincoln, Neb.; Wilmington, N.C.; Melbourne, Fla.; and Honolulu, Hawaii. Overall, the World Health Organization now estimates that 75 per cent of the Earth's population — 5.5 billion people — live in areas where particulate pollution exceeds safety guidelines.  And bad air is understood to be shortening life spans in all sorts of ways. A recent NASA study used satellite data to model particulate pollution in Africa and concluded that it causes 780,000 premature deaths each year on the continent. The majority of those — 556,000 — are attributed to dust from Sahara Desert storms, but industrial emissions are believed to cause 182,000 deaths, and smoke from cooking and heating fires another 43,000. In South Asian countries  like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where air pollution is the most acute, the life expectancy for a child born today is 30 months shorter than in clean air zones. Air pollution in Canada is now believed to shave three months off a newborn's life expectancy.  Car and truck traffic is being blamed for 4 million new cases of childhood asthma each year worldwide, or roughly 11,000 each day. The study, published earlier this month in the Lancet Planetary Health journal, crunched data from 194 nations and found that per capita, Canada had the third-highest rate of new traffic-related asthma cases, behind China and India.  Researchers at the University of Aberdeen recently reviewed more than a decade of studies and concluded that air pollution has a bigger effect on fetal growth than alcohol, chemical exposure or a poor diet.  Poor-quality air significantly increases the risks of hospitalization for young cancer patients.  It has also been linked to spikes in London, England's crime rate, with incidents of less severe offences like shoplifting and pickpocketing up almost 8.5 per cent on the city's most polluted days, regardless of the wealth of the neighbourhood. (Assault, rape and murder rates don't seem to change with the air quality.) And another U.K.-wide study found that teenagers who live in the country's smoggiest areas have almost twice the rate of reported  psychotic  experiences compared to their peers in less-polluted zones. (The researchers are careful to note that they haven't established a causal relation — other factors associated with traffic, like noise, could be the trigger.) All just the latest additions to 25-years of peer-reviewed research on the dangers of air pollution.  Which makes an editorial published today in the journal Nature  all the more noteworthy.  The publication warns of a growing scepticism about the effects of air pollution in places like Germany, Poland, India and above-all the United States.  Efforts by government and industry to weaken air-quality standards are now themselves a threat to public health, says the journal. ""Environmental regulations to curb air pollution impose steep costs on a variety of industries, but questioning the evidence won't make it go away,"" the authors write. ""Now is not the time to undermine efforts to clean air — it is time to strengthen them."" Boeing has been scrambling to complete technical fixes for the 737 Max airliner and new training for pilots in the wake of two disastrous crashes, but the really difficult problem could be the damage to public confidence in the plane, reporter David Common writes.  Henry Harteveldt doesn't mince words.  ""Passengers are afraid of this airplane,"" says the long-time aviation analyst. ""I haven't seen anything like this in decades, in terms of consumer fear and desire to avoid flying on the 737 Max."" After two crashes within a few months of each other that killed everyone onboard, where pilots seem to have struggled with the same problem before their planes nose-dived into the ground, regulators around the world ordered the 737 Max grounded.  The aviation giant has changed the plane's software, altered the cockpit, conducted more than 130 test flights, designed a new pilot training regime, and seems to be on track to have the latest variant of its workhorse passenger jet back in the air over the summer. Convincing passengers the 737 Max is safe, however, will be a harder fix. Airlines are worried the planes already in their fleets or on order will scare the flying public. So Boeing will likely do something it's never had to before: speak directly to those passengers. It's expected to launch an extensive and expensive social and traditional media campaign to win back passengers.  ""It's bringing journalists and analysts and influencers into Boeing,"" says Hertveldt, ""take them on test flights, let them interview Boeing engineers and test pilots."" Convincing those passengers is key to restoring commercial success for the 737 Max. What was Boeing's fastest selling aircraft ever hasn't sold a single plane since the latest crash in March.  - David Common The non-stop demands of modern jobs can be a recipe for burnout, but there are ideas for preventing that from happening, producer Tarannum Kamlani writes. Stress at work seems to be on everyone's mind these days, especially since the ground beneath our feet seems to be shifting constantly.  How we work. When we work. Where we work. Why we work.

It is harder still because I had just spent the earlier 18 months campaigning furiously to win back my seat in the recent federal election, during which I mostly missed the first year of our baby's life."" ""As such, my heart is not fully engaged in this leadership race. Without being all in, I cannot be in at all. So I have decided not to seek the leadership of the party at this time.""

He told the Toronto Star that under his leadership, Conservative MPs would be free to bring forward legislation on abortion and vote according to their conscience, but that such legislation would not be adopted under a Conservative government under his leadership. He also lashed out at Richard Décarie, a social conservative who says he intends to join the leadership race, for comments he'd made on CTV's Power Play suggesting that being gay is a ""choice"". ""The comments are as unacceptable as they are ignorant. You do not speak for Conservatives — or for Canadians. Being gay is NOT a choice. Being ignorant is,"" Poilievre wrote on Twitter.

He's expected to formally join the race Saturday. Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu also has said she intends to join the race, and Ontario MP Erin O'Toole is expected to be a candidate. O'Toole's deputy campaign manager Melanie Paradis said Poilievre's decision to opt out means a narrow field of serious candidates. ""It's now a two-way race. We need a leader for 2020, not the 90s.

O'Toole responded to Poilievre's announcement on Twitter. ""Pierre has been a champion for our party and the conservative movement. I know he will continue to be an important voice,"" he wrote. Gladu told The Canadian Press today that the party's rules on fundraising and networking can be major barriers for women in politics.

483,Connell Smith,2019-08-28T08:30:00.714Z,Conservation groups want to 'eradicate' smallmouth bass from lake,"The confirmed sighting of an invasive fish in the southwest Miramichi River last week lends urgency to plans to eradicate smallmouth bass from a nearby lake. In 2008, Miramichi Lake was found to contain the bass, which were likely introduced there illegally.  In the 11 years since, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and a number of community conservation groups have operated a program using nets, electrofishing and other methods to prevent the fish from getting out of the 200-hectare lake and into the nearby Miramichi River, where they can do irreparable damage to native wild Atlantic salmon populations.  Over that same period, groups like the Miramichi Salmon Association and the Atlantic Salmon Federation have repeatedly called for a program to eradicate smallmouth bass in the lake by treating it with rotenone, a powdered product made from the dried root of certain bean plants. It was approved for use in Atlantic Canada in 2015. ""This is a problem that needs to be addressed, and this is really the only way,"" said Mark Hambrook of the Miramichi Salmon Association. ""I mean we've searched every other option and nothing else will be effective."" Under the plan, Hambrook said, native fish like white suckers, yellow perch, white perch and trout would be captured and stored in tanks. Rotenone, a traditional substance used for fishing in the Amazon, would then be applied to the lake water over one day. The rotenone would kill the invasive fish, along with any native fish not temporarily removed before the application. From several days to two weeks later, the native fish would be returned to the lake, where their populations could return to normal in a few years. An application to eradicate Miramichi Lake has already been submitted by the North Shore Micmac District Council, the organization heading the project. Approval would require a full environmental impact assessment. In the meantime, a large-scale search begins Wednesday for the single smallmouth bass that was photographed and confirmed in the river last Thursday.  Hambrook said anyone who catches a smallmouth bass in the Miramichi is asked to keep the fish and turn it over to DFO. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/invasive-species-smallmouth-bass-wild-atlantic-salmon-eradicate-rotenone-1.5261532,[],N/A

The city had hoped to have all households hooked up by now, but there are about 750 customers who still don't have a water meter. ""We are constantly out there reminding people that it is something that they need to have done,"" said Richard MacEwen, manager of the Charlottetown Water & Sewer Utility.  ""We have called, we have left letters, we have knocked on doors,"" he said.  He said in total, the city has about 10,000 customers, so only having hundreds left is still progress. The city is spending about $4 million on the water meter program. There is no cost to the customer to get one installed.  The Charlottetown Water & Sewer Utility said it's already seeing evidence that water meters are reducing water consumption to levels last seen in 2000.  ""We're seeing great results with respect to our water conservation program and also our leak detection program,"" MacEwen said.  City of Charlottetown hoping to speed water meter installation  The city is currently charging an extra fee to customers who don't have a meter. There's a $50 per quarter surcharge, and the utility has collected $70,000 in surcharges so far.  ""There are customers who are reluctant to have a meter installed,"" MacEwen said. He said although some believe water metering will raise their bill, it usually stays about the same.  ""Previously our flat rate was based on what we thought would be the average consumption for four people in a home,"" he said.   The province put conditions on Charlottetown when it wanted permission to have another well field to increase its water supply. Some of the conditions were to implement water conservation and leak detection programs, MacEwen said. ""It was accountability.""  MacEwen said water meters will allow the city to develop.  ""There was a time when we were actually looking that we needed to reduce the development within the City of Charlottetown because we were at the limits of our water supply capacity."" Within the next month the city expects to pump water from the new well field in Miltonvale.  MacEwen said the metering program has almost had the same effect of bringing in another well field.  ""It's really changed how we look at water supply."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/water-meters-charlottetown-pei-1.4510564,[],N/A

The shop, Chippewar Nation on Queen Street West, is lined with Soule's paintings as well as silkscreen-printed clothing that re-purposes the images from his paintings.   Soule has been working on the Chippewar line of clothing and art for five years and says he was inspired by Idle No More.   ""I was going through some major depression right around that same time and I started reevaluating my life a little about what I was doing with my artwork and my businesses,"" says Soule.   Soule is from Chippewas of the Thames First Nation, but he didn't grow up in his community because he was adopted and raised in a non-Indigenous family.   As Idle No More was unfolding, the Assembly of First Nations elections were being broadcast on CPAC. Soule says he spent days watching both events happening and it woke him up. This also inspired the name Chippewar.  ""The name came out of being Chippewa and being a warrior and just playing with the words,"" he says.  He describes his art as non-traditional, inspired by pop art with a politically-charged and Indigenous twist.  This past summer, he released a series of stickers in the form of speech bubbles that could be tacked on to Canadian currency offering political commentary or actual quotes from the historical figures on the bills. In the back of the shop is the studio space where Soule screen prints all of the shirts he sells with a silkscreen press.   In the summer he takes his work on the road, joining the powwow trail.  ""Most of my support comes from the Indigenous community. I've spent a lot of time out there building up good relationships with people, especially other powwow vendors and dancers and singers and food vendors.""

486,Marianne Klowak,2020-01-22T11:00:00.544Z,'These are complex issues': Federal government's survey on medically assisted death raises concerns ,"Canadians have less than a week to weigh in on possible changes to legislation around medically assisted death — and some say they're not happy with what they see in the federal government's online survey, or the idea of expanding eligibility for medically assisted death. The federal government began consultations on medically assisted dying — including the online survey and in-person consultations with experts across the country — on Jan. 13. The online questionnaire closes on Jan. 27. When the consultations were launched, Justice Minister David Lametti said they would allow the federal government ""to hear directly from Canadians and guide the path forward."" But one Winnipegger says she's disappointed by what's not in the online survey. ""There is a huge imbalance on the site,"" said Ruth Enns, 72, who lives with disabilities resulting from childhood polio.  ""There are so many things [in the survey] that promote [medical assistance in dying]. I could find nothing that discourages it. There was no place that I could find where people could complain about undue influence."" She also says there's not enough room on the survey for response. The survey has three fields, each with a limit of 500 characters, in which people can leave comments. ""These are complex issues,"" said Enns. ""You can't really comment on them in that."" CBC has asked the federal justice department for a response to Enns's comments. The federal justice minister says the survey has been overwhelmed by thousands of responses. Speaking to reporters before a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg on Sunday, Lametti said more than 150,000 have already participated in the government's online survey. He also said he plans to table new legislation in February to amend the criteria for Canadians to have medical assistance in dying. That comes after a Superior Court of Quebec ruling last September, which found that the federal government's rules around medically assisted death are too restrictive. Specifically, the court ruled that the requirement that death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" is unconstitutional. The court ruling only applies in Quebec, but the federal law was already facing a required review in the summer of 2020, five years after it came into effect. The federal government has accepted the Quebec ruling, and Lametti said the government is using the opportunity to update the legislation across the country. The government's consultations are focused on whether medically assisted death should be allowed in three different cases: Winnipeg family doctor Larry Rados says there is concern among some physicians about expanding medical assistance in dying, or MAID. ""I don't speak for all of them, but many have a discomfort, an angst, if not an emotion more serious than that about this whole issue,"" he said. ""We went into this to wear the white coat of the healer. I heard one person say we are now being asked to wear the black robe of the executioner. That does not sit well with a lot of physicians. It doesn't sit well with me."" In Manitoba, those seeking a medically assisted death must be referred to the provincial MAID team, which can be done by the patient, a family member or a health-care provider. CBC has requested an interview Dr. Kim Wiebe, the administrative lead of the provincial MAID clinical team. A request was also made to speak with the registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba.  Rados said he's particularly concerned about expanding medically assisted death to include people with mental illness. ""Let's take depression, for example. Psychiatrists will tell you there is a triad involved in depressive illnesses — the triad being the patient telling himself or herself 'I am no good, the world is no good, the future is no good.' ""Well, if a person has that mindset that the future is no good, they can easily be taken advantage of,"" Rados said. He thinks there should be expansion of palliative care, rather than MAID. Cam MacDonald, the interim director of Life's Vision in Winnipeg — a non-profit which opposes medically assisted death — agrees. ""Is this the best we can do for the disabled community?"" asks MacDonald, 27, who lives with cerebral palsy. He doesn't agree with expanding advance requests for medically assisted death. ""What message does that send to the disabled community? We need to do more to help those who are suffering — to do all that is in our power to help those who are suffering."" MacDonald, 27, is a competitive swimmer in addition to his full-time work. He says people with disabilities need messages of hope. ""When I am going through a tough time, what I really need is peace, what I really need is hope and what I really need is purpose. What we really need is to try and help people see their purpose,"" said MacDonald. ""The message we need to give is we know you are disabled but you still have value, intrinsic value."" Debra Mason, though, is grateful medically assisted death is a legal choice in Canada and would like to see it include advance requests. Mason is a volunteer with the Manitoba chapter of Dying with Dignity, a non-profit which promotes the right to medically assisted death. Her 94-year-old father received MAID in December 2017.  ""He had leukemia, a brain tumour. MAID couldn't come fast enough for him. He chose to die at home in Rapid City. He didn't want any treatments. He was starting to fail and decided to have it,"" she said. ""His death was peaceful because he was getting what he chose. He knew he was going to die. He never wanted to be one of those people who lingered in a bed."" She took the federal government's online survey on MAID eligibility. While she found it complicated and said she had to go through it twice, she supports the idea of expanding MAID eligibility. ""I think advanced requests would be a very positive step for me. The whole dementia thing is scary for our generation. I am 64 years old and tons of boomers could be facing this. ""I would like to pre-book if I am faced with a diagnosis that will affect my capability.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/meidcally-assisted-death-survey-1.5434619,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/consultations-medical-aid-in-dying-1.5422850 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medically-assisted-death-lametti-1.5432519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/doctors-advocacy-groups-address-proposed-law-protecting-those-who-object-to-assisted-dying-1.4390679 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/medical-assistance-in-dying-manitoba-1.5207224,N/A
487,Steven D'Souza,2020-01-06T09:00:00.342Z,How sexual assault trial could play out for Harvey Weinstein,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will impact the future of the movement.  When Harvey Weinstein's criminal trial begins in a Manhattan courtroom today, the disgraced movie mogul will face a legal reckoning for what dozens of accusers have said is a decades-long pattern of sexual assault, rape and intimidation. But proving that behaviour that many actresses alleged was common knowledge in Hollywood was a crime is one of many challenges facing prosecutors in the highest profile trial of the #MeToo era. Weinstein has been accused by more than 80 women of being a serial harasser and sexual predator. The list reads like a who's who in Hollywood: Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd, Salma Hayek, Rosanna Arquette to name a few.  But despite numerous accusers, Weinstein's criminal charges focus on just two specific cases. He's denied any non-consensual sex and pleaded not guilty to five charges including two charges of predatory sexual assault and two charges of rape. If convicted he could face up to life in prison. The 67-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges that he raped a woman in a hotel room in Manhattan in 2013. He's also charged with performing a forcible sex act on Mimi Haleyi, a former production assistant with his company in 2006 who has spoken publicly about the assault.  Having two accusers gives prosecutors an advantage as they seek a conviction said Kristen Gibbons Feden, who was part of the team that successfully prosecuted comedian Bill Cosby in 2018. While the Cosby case rested predominantly on the testimony of Canadian Andrea Constand, whom a jury found the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted in 2004, Gibbons Feden said the Weinstein prosecutors will be able to obtain a conviction ""whether the jury believes one of the witnesses or whether the jury believes both of the witnesses."" Like the Cosby trial, the Weinstein trial will also hear from women whose allegations of assault did not lead to charges, either because they were too old or the incidents didn't happen in New York.  Weinstein's trial will hear from three so-called ""prior bad act"" witnesses. Gibbons Feden said their testimony allows the prosecution to establish a pattern in the defendant's behaviour. ""The prosecution is going to have to show Weinstein's criminal tendencies … a pattern of raping these women, a pattern of establishing trust, grooming them, so that they are alone and in a private place with him such that he can prey upon them,"" Gibbons Feden said, noting the second Cosby trial had five ""prior bad act"" witnesses. One of those witnesses claims Weinstein assaulted her in 2005. Her lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said his client came forward voluntarily to help the prosecution, knowing the impact it would have on her life once her name is revealed. ""She thought long and hard about it, but she knew that as time went on and she got older and maybe had children of her own, that she could look back and say that she tried to make a difference in something that was very important."" Wigdor says his client's testimony will support the two accusers by showing how Weinstein used his power and influence as a Hollywood producer to prey upon her. ""What Harvey Weinstein was doing was actually a scheme and a plan,"" Wigdor alleges. ""He would typically lure the women that he would sexually assault by having them come to his office or to his apartment under the ruse of getting advice about their career or reading a script."" Wigdor also represents women seeking civil cases against Weinstein. While a $25-million US settlement with some plaintiffs was reported in December, he said his clients will continue to pursue their case. A fourth witness, former Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra, will also testify. She alleges Weinstein raped her 26 years ago, beyond the statute of limitations. Her testimony will be used to support the predatory sexual assault charge, which the prosecution must show at least two women were assaulted by the defendant. In 2017, when the New York Times detailed numerous allegations of rape and sexual assault against Weinstein, it sparked a national conversation about sexual abuse and assault by men in powerful positions known as the #MeToo movement.  The case will be heard before a 12-person jury, with selection beginning this week. Lawyers watching the case say a challenge will be finding people who aren't looking for justice for the broader movement, or conversely, think #MeToo has gone too far and will be seeking to exonerate Weinstein because of it.  ""It's going to be impossible to find jurors that haven't heard about [#MeToo],"" said criminal defence lawyer Dmitriy Shakhnevich. ""The next step will be to find jurors that have heard of it, but can put aside their preconceived notions.""  Weinstein's lawyer, Donna Rotunno, has been critical of #MeToo, telling CBS News recently that ""it allows the court of public opinion to take over the narrative."" She says the evidence in the criminal case favours her client and that Weinstein may not be perfect, but he's not a criminal. ""I'm not here to say that he was not guilty of committing sins. I'm not here to say that at all. But there's a difference between sins and crimes and I don't think he's a rapist. I don't believe he's a rapist,"" Rotunno told CBS. Legal observers like Matthew Galluzzo, a former sex crimes prosecutor now a criminal defence attorney, said the Weinstein defence team will have to remind the jury that this case is not a referendum on #MeToo. ""Did he do X? Not, did he do something wrong. There's black-and-white letter law for what is and is not a crime and if it doesn't fit, then it's not a conviction,"" Galluzzo said.  He said the defence will also chip away at the credibility of the witnesses by putting their story on trial, offering other reasons for their interactions with Weinstein. ""I think that's going to be the defence, essentially they agreed to have sex with him and now they're telling a different story all these years later, for whatever reason. It's gonna be up to the defence to fill in that explanation."" Gibbons Feden said in the Cosby trial, the prosecution recognized it would need to educate jurors about the behaviour of sexual assault survivors as a way to blunt attacks from the defence. They called an expert to explain that victims don't always report crimes right away and often maintain contact with their alleged assailant. That witness, Dr. Barbara Ziv, will also testify in the Weinstein trial. ""There is no typical response to sexual abuse, and if there is a delayed disclosure, if there's continued contact with an offender, that does not mean that that woman or man was not sexually abused,"" Gibbons Feden said.  Weinstein's case has already had some ups and downs before trial. In late 2018, the prosecution dropped one charge relating to an accusation made by aspiring actress Lucia Evans, when inconsistencies emerged in her story. It was also revealed that a New York police detective may have coached her to withhold evidence that put her story in question. Gibbons Feden hopes the Cosby trial and the #MeToo movement have helped better educate the public and courts about the behaviour of sexual assault victims.  While other jurisdictions are still investigating allegations against Weinstein, she said the Cosby conviction should give Weinstein's accusers and the prosecution confidence that a high-profile defendant can be found guilty. ""The fact that is possible, the fact that there are juries out there who will convict high-profile offenders as long as the evidence is there.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5415693 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-preview-1.5415567,N/A

""Every friend I have came over to help,"" said MacDonald with a laugh, noting this was her fourth move in six years. Her new print shop, Deep Hollow Print, is in her home in North Alton, in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. The letterpress process involves putting movable type on a press bed. You fill the spaces between the type with other material. Once that's locked and ready to go, you put ink on the press. The paper is pressed down onto the letters to create the print. Some presses use electricity, but MacDonald's doesn't. She uses elbow grease and oil. Video produced by Wesley Booth, Hilary Drummond, with help from Kyle Bernard, for CBC. Music: The Basin Brothers. The walls of MacDonald's studio are plastered with letterpress she's made or collected. There's the twinkle of string lights and wooden letters that all could tell a story. This is a place where she creates and hosts house concerts. Some music has been recorded here too. In this digital age, MacDonald said there's a resurgence of people wanting something more tactile and warm, like vinyl records. Her letterpress posters have this feel. ""They're warmer, they're friendly, they're human, "" she said. ""You can tell in all their imperfections that, you know, somebody has touched them to make them."" MacDonald specializes in gig posters, but also creates album covers and concert tickets. She's won two East Coast Music Awards for her work. She also does projects for local businesses, like the bags for North Mountain Coffee, and makes art prints. Some of her work is graphic design. MacDonald was born in Nova Scotia. She moved to the United States when she was young, but came back home about 10 years ago to work at Gaspereau Press. She was interested in book publishing and binding at the time, but developed a love for letterpress. Her letterpress education also took her to Nashville, where she interned at Hatch Show Print, which is famous for it's circus and minstrel show posters. A lot of famous performers had posters printed there, including Elvis Presley and B.B. King. ""Eventually, they sort of become the face of the country music industry down there,"" said MacDonald. She experienced that history first-hand. ""I used an h that was used on an old Hank Williams poster,"" said MacDonald. While at Hatch Show Print, she worked on posters for the likes of Willie Nelson. His manager would even send them Krispy Kreme doughnuts sometimes. ""Love Krispy Kreme donuts,"" said MacDonald. A lot of MacDonald's work is inspired by Nova Scotia.

489,Justin McElroy,2019-12-12T22:49:47.422Z,Metro Vancouver to have region-wide business licence for ride-hailing companies,"There are 21 municipalities in Metro Vancouver, but ride-hailing companies operating in them will only have to deal with one business licence. The TransLink Mayors' Council passed a motion fast-tracking a region-wide ride-hailing licence on Thursday, with the goal of having an interim set of rules in place by the end of January. ""It really works better if we function as a region, rather than 21 autonomous groups … it's been way too long that we've been waiting,"" said Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart. In the summer, the province announced individual municipalities would be allowed to issue business licences. Since then, communities in Metro Vancouver have taken wildly divergent approaches, from charging companies $25 per driver (Delta) to $510 per driver (Burnaby), to making a public stand that they won't issue business licences at all (Surrey).  Advocates for ride-hailing had criticized the approach, saying it would dissuade drivers from treating passengers across Metro Vancouver equally. TransLink vice-president Geoff Cross told mayors that in recent days, the province threatened to take over the process from municipalities if they couldn't find a common approach.  ""There is a fear that we could lose our jurisdiction to the province,"" said Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, who recently passed regulations for Vancouver with a $100 per driver fee.  ""If we hold it up in any way, we'll lose our local ability to have any regulation over this industry."" Over the next six weeks, TransLink will convene a working group to help set the terms of the inter-municipality business licences, including the fee structure and which municipality will collect and distribute the fees. An interim model would be in place by the end of January, with a full framework in place by the end of 2020.  While virtually all mayors supported the motion, a number expressed some reservations over whether the fee structure would be fair to taxi companies, or how municipalities would be able to enforce rules around pick-up and drop-off zones without control over a business license.  But most said time was of the essence.  ""It's not perfect, but we get to be a player at creating the solution, and not be reacting to something given to us by the province,"" said City of North Vancouver Mayor Linda Buchanan.  ""Given that everyone was aware ride-hailing was coming down the pipe, I am surprised this conversation around a regional framework is only happening now ... I hope to see this implemented as soon as humanly possible,"" said Port Moody Mayor Rob Vagramov.  Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum was the lone dissenting vote.  ""A large majority of our residents do not support ride-hailing in Surrey,"" he claimed.  ""It's not a level playing field. There are a lot of differences of levels that are not consistent between ride-hailing and taxis."" McCallum was vague on what specific actions Surrey would take to fight a regional ride-hailing business model, but Mayors' Council chair Jonathan Coté expressed hope a solution could be brokered. ""The vast majority of the region is very supportive of this approach,"" he said. ""Hopefully, we'll be able to continue our conversations with the City of Surrey and have them become a part of this process, but it definitely is a bit of a concern, and I think it'll be a concern for the provincial government as well."" Premier John Horgan originally promised to bring ride-hailing to B.C. by the end of 2017, but there have been a number of delays. Legislation has now been passed and several companies have applied to the Passenger Transportation Board for approval, with approvals expected by the end of the year. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-brad-west-mayors-council-1.5393202,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/translink-ride-hailing-report-1.5387423 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ndp-stalls-on-election-promise-to-bring-ride-hailing-to-b-c-by-end-of-year-1.4357347,N/A
490,Don Pittis,2019-11-20T09:00:00.544Z,Only governments can solve the Canadian illicit pot crisis: Don Pittis,"New rules effective Dec. 16 will come just in time so you can leave a cannabis-laced cookie or beverage out for Santa. But if the struggling Canadian pot business is looking forward to Cannabis 2.0  — as the availability of vaping products and edibles has been dubbed — they will likely be disappointed if they expect it to be a Christmas present that will solve their financial problems. The sector that was so recently a stock market darling and that attracted small-scale entrepreneurs like moths to candle flames has suddenly fallen on hard times as heavier cannabis users, who make up the bulk of sales, simply don't patronize the legal market. The legal industry that only months ago worried about a shortage of the drug is now facing a glut. Established players seek new sources of cash as share prices fall. Experts predict a shakeout in the industry as smaller players, unable to find buyers, begin to fail. The numbers vary across Canada according to how each province has managed their own legalization rollout, but statistics show the vast majority of cannabis users still get their pot from what police sources recently called ""a strong, vibrant dark market out there selling illegal drugs."" While the legal industry battles to grab market share from their illicit competitors, economists could have told them this would happen. And not just ""could have."" Economists did tell them. In April 2017, long before cannabis became legal on Oct. 17, 2018, economist Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute, was one of those who had a warning for governments expecting to get rich from legalized pot. ""If the government taxes marijuana heavily,"" she wrote in an open letter to Bill Blair, the federal cabinet minister who led the way on Canada's pot policy, ""it will ensure the continuation of the black market and will be undermining its efforts to control the substance."" Of course, revenue wasn't the only thing motivating government policy that helped keep pot prices high. Before legalization, health experts worried that legal availability and low prices would lead to a flood of new cannabis users. That pessimism from the health lobby was the mirror image of optimism from the cannabis industry and its investors, who foresaw Canadians smoking up a storm. But as it turned out, both sides were wrong. While there was a small uptick in purchases immediately following legalization attributed to law-abiding Canadian trying the drug for the first time or for the first time in a long time, the feared (and hoped for) deluge of new users never came. The latest figures from Statistics Canada show that cannabis use has been relatively static, with a few heavy users responsible for most of the consumption.  And while legal pot shop assiduously check IDs to make sure patrons are of legal age, the continued existence of a huge and thriving black market means younger buyers can get all they want from illegal dealers who, in Ontario for example, still control something like 80 per cent of the market. In that province, if the government had actually been trying to help the illicit market flourish, it would have been hard to do a better job. ""If we had one store for every 10,000 people, which is the rule of thumb, in Ontario we would have something like 1,500 stores and we only have 24,"" said cannabis business analyst Chris Damas, on the phone from his home in Barrie, Ont., about 100 kilometres north of Toronto. He says there is no shortage of illegal suppliers to fill that gap. ""Here in Barrie, which has a lively drug culture, [with a population of] 150,000 people, there's no store,"" said Damas, who writes the BCMI Cannabis Report. ""So why would they want to drive to downtown Toronto to get some marijuana that was legal?"" Damas says a high government excise tax and other expenses means prices are about double what people can get from their local dealers, including home delivery.  A potential solution to smash the illegal market proposed years ago was to use the power of a monopoly seller in a way that would be illegal if it were done in private business. Governments would have to step in, cut their own take to zero and promise not to raise taxes for say, two years, while letting the most efficient producers compete on price, all the while increasing the number of stores to make legal purchases easy. It might have worked better if that had been the plan from the beginning, back when cannabis producers were flush with cash. But after what he sees as years creating overcapacity, now Damas fears that despite Cannabis 2.0, economic activity in the sector could fall by half, which he calls ""the Great Depression in cannabis"" as the pot boom goes into reverse. ""The repercussions are pretty too-horrible to contemplate.""

491,Paul Palmeter,2020-01-23T12:44:40.090Z,Eagle watch draws birds and tourists to tiny Nova Scotia community,"If the eagles around Sheffield Mills could talk they would likely call Malcolm Lake the chicken man. When Lake pulls into the open Nova Scotia field with several dead chicken carcasses in buckets, dozens of large eagles can be seen in nearby hardwood trees anxiously awaiting his arrival. ""They know my vehicle and as soon as I get up there and open my door I can hear them begin to chatter away in the trees,"" said Lake. Lake collects dead chickens from several nearby poultry farms. After he throws the carcasses into the field the eagles keep their distance until Lake walks away. Then they slowly begin to approach the dead birds in the snow, before long dozens of eagles come out of the trees to feed. ""The most I've ever counted here was 92 eagles the week before last,"" said Lake. ""I've had up to 80 eagles here in the last seven days."" Lake feeds the eagles twice a day from late December to late March. He's excited for the 29th annual Sheffield Mills eagle watch which begins this weekend. ""It actually goes back to the '80s when the eagles were an endangered species in this county,"" said Lake. ""Back then the Nova Scotia government asked the farmers to throw out their dead chickens to give the juvenile eagles a better chance to survive the winter, the rest of the year they fend for themselves."" Last year eagle watch saw more than 5,000 people gather in the area to witness the majestic birds perform their amazing aerial displays as they descend on the field. Many of the visitors are amateur photographers who come from far away to see the eagles. Ron and Jane Todd are from Framingham, Mass. They honeymooned in Nova Scotia 40 years ago and this week they drove 12 hours so they could see the eagles up close. ""You don't often see something like this, so many bald eagles,"" said Jane Todd. ""We know we'll see something different each time."" The Todds are staying at a nearby bed and breakfast. Eagle watch is spread out over the next two weekends and has a big economic spinoff for the area. ""Eagle watch will bring in a lot of different people to the community that we don't normally see,"" said Jason deGraaf, who operates a local gas bar and convenience store in nearby Canning. ""It's going to be quite a busy two weekends for us."" The eagle watch festivities include pancake breakfasts and entertainment at the local community hall. All money raised will stay in the community. ""It's crucial for us, for our community hall, as it's our main fundraiser,"" said Meg Hodges, a member of the Sheffield Mills Community Association. ""It kind of keeps the lights on and the roof on and makes it available to our community, so without eagle watch we probably wouldn't have our hall.""

492,Michael Gorman,2020-01-23T20:19:22.709Z,Northern Pulp seeks judicial review of N.S. environment minister's ruling,"Northern Pulp is asking for a judicial review of the Nova Scotia environment minister's decision to require an environmental assessment report for the company's proposed effluent facility. In documents filed Thursday in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Halifax, the company, which filed the application along with representatives of the forestry industry and the union representing mill workers, said it wants Environment Minister Gordon Wilson's ruling last month to be quashed and for costs to be awarded. In December, Wilson said the company failed to provide sufficient information about its proposal in order for him to make a decision on the application. In providing his ruling, Wilson called for an environmental assessment report to be completed if the company wanted to continue with the process. Later that week, Premier Stephen McNeil rejected a request from the company to extend the deadline in the Boat Harbour Act, which calls for the company's effluent treatment facility to close at the end of this month. Without a place to send and treat its effluent, the mill cannot operate. In court documents, said company says it's seeking the review based on the following grounds: The minister erred in law and in fact and acted unreasonably in preparing and rendering the decision. The minister failed to properly interpret and apply certain provisions of the Environment Act and environmental assessment regulations. The minister based his decision ""on irrelevant and/or improper factors and considerations."" The minister breached the company's procedural fairness entitlements Anything else ""as may appear prior to the hearing of this matter."" The company is in the midst of an orderly shutdown at the Pictou County location, winterizing the mill so it can remain dormant while Northern Pulp works on the environmental assessment report, a process that could take as long as two years. In the meantime, workers at the company are being laid off and the forestry industry as a whole is facing much uncertainty. In a news release Thursday, Brian Baarda, CEO of Northern Pulp parent company Paper Excellence, said he and the other applicants are hoping the review ""will bring transparency to the decision-making process."" ""We're hoping that through this judicial review, Northern Pulp will be provided with clarity about the process and elements required in order to be successful in the [environmental assessment] process that we'll be embarking on later this year."" he said. ""We believe all of the necessary ingredients for a successful pulp industry are here in Nova Scotia including access to fibre, deep sea ports, a talented labour pool and a modern, competitive pulp mill."" As the mill has prepared to shut down, a transition team formed by the provincial government has been meeting weekly and determining what to do with a $50-million assistance fund in an effort to transition the industry to a future without Northern Pulp. Money so far has been allocated for retraining and silviculture work. An announcement from the transition team is expected Friday about a short-term financial support program for some people connected to the forestry industry.

493,Anonymous,2019-08-08T22:13:32.800Z,"What does bread from 4,500-year-old Egyptian yeast taste like? Rich, with 'overtones of brown sugar'","Read Story Transcript Seamus Blackley got a chance this week to combine two of his greatest passions — ancient Egypt and baking. The Pasadena, Calif., video game designer — best known for his role in developing Microsoft's gaming console, the Xbox — has baked a loaf of sourdough bread using 4,500-year-old yeast extracted from ancient Egyptian pottery. ""This was crazy because I had collected this stuff, you know, with syringes and masks and sterile techniques in museum basements from old pots,"" Blackley told As It Happens guest host Piya Chattopadhyay.  ""That the aroma and the texture of the bread was incredible was surprising to me."" Blackley documented the entire process on Twitter.  Baking like the ancient Egyptians is no easy feat. To make it happen, Blackley had to team up with a microbiologist, an Egyptologist and two museums — and he's still not convinced he got it totally right.  The whole thing started last spring, when he baked a loaf of sourdough with yeast he'd fed with freshly milled barley and einkorn, grains the ancient Egyptians used when baking.  But the final product, while delicious, just wasn't authentic enough to the bread he was trying to recreate. To do this right, he would need ancient, unadulterated yeast. ""The leavening that was used in the ancient world existed before modern wheat, before modern yeast, before any of the things that we really consider to be bread,"" he said. ""This is really old stuff."" To get ancient Egyptian yeast, he turned to ancient Egyptian pottery.  ""Yeast is incredible as an animal. It can survive in space and in a vacuum. You can freeze it. You can do all sorts of abuse to it and it will still bounce back. It can hibernate for thousands of years,"" Blackley said. ""The fact that the ancient Egyptians and a lot of other ancient peoples used really porous, natural clay pottery to do their baking and their brewing, we thought it was likely that vessels that have been used for doing that would have some of these yeast and bacteria, the symbiotic sort of mixture of starter culture, kind of pounded into the pores."" To get the yeast out of the pots, he turned to University of Queensland archeologist Serena Love and University of Iowa microbiologist Richard Bowman. With Love's help, he was able to convince the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard's Peabody Museum to lend them some ancient clay pots for their experiment.  ""I had to submit all sorts of documentation, detail our methods and show that it's a non-destructive analysis,"" Love told the New York Times. ""Once they could see that we weren't harming the vessels, they gave us permission."" Bowman then used his expertise to extract the yeast.   ""You pump a fluid in carefully with a syringe and some sterile cotton in contact with the ceramics. It soaks in and you vacuum it back out,"" Bowman told the London Times. Most of the yeast was shipped off to the University of Iowa for study, but Blackley was able to take home a sample to experiment with. With the hardest part over, Blackley was able to focus on what he does best — baking.  Using sterile lab techniques to keep the sample pure, he fed the yeast with ancient grains to make a sourdough starter. The first thing he noticed when he took the freshly baked loaf out of his oven was the incredible smell.  ""It was such a comforting and amazing and rich and sweet smell. I try to describe it. I say, oh, you know, it had overtones of caramel and brown sugar — which it did. But, really, it was emotional,"" he said. ""I mean, I was surprised that it worked at all."" Blackley described the taste of the bread as ""different."" Asked if it was good different or bad different, he enthusiastically replied: ""Great different!"" ""It was richer,"" he said. ""It had overtones of brown sugar. It was really interesting and cool."" His wife, he said, can vouch for him. She has already eaten most of the bread. But he's saved a piece to be sent back to the lab for further study. Still, after all his work, Blackley isn't convinced the final product captures the truly authentic ancient Egyptian experience. First of all, he said, the yeast samples back at the lab are undergoing DNA sampling to determine just how pure they are.  ""We really need to do more work to be sure that we have isolated just the ancient stuff,"" he said. ""The spread that I baked over the weekend was a mix of contaminants and, we hope, some ancient stuff."" What's more, he said, ancient Egyptians didn't bake in modern ovens.  ""They baked in a different way using the actual vessels themselves, the bread molds themselves, as sort of a little mini oven,"" he said.  ""So the loaf that you see on Twitter was baked in a Roman way. And the idea was, oh my gosh, this yeast seems to be working. Let's try it out. Let's do something that we're good at that we understand to experiment with the dough and see what it's like, see what the flavour is like — but it needs to go further to really be Egyptian baking."" He plans to keep working with Love and Bowman to create the perfect, authentic loaf.  Written by Sheena Goodyear.

494,John Paul Tasker,2019-12-27T09:00:00.197Z,Outgoing Senate leader wants Trudeau to appoint more people with political experience,"Sen. Peter Harder, Trudeau's outgoing point-man in the upper house, said the Conservatives' loss in the last election has secured the Senate's future as a more independent chamber free of partisan politics. And while he's pleased with the reforms made during his four-year term as government representative in the Senate, Harder said he'd like to see more people with political and parliamentary experience appointed to the place in the future. Only a few of the recent Senate appointments have a background in politics — like Sen. Frances Lankin, a former Ontario NDP cabinet minister, and Sen. Pat Duncan, a past Liberal premier of Yukon. Most of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's 51 appointees to date have been political neophytes. Under Trudeau's reforms, an independent appointments board compiles a list of eligible people to help the prime minister make his picks for the appointed chamber. But the effort to rid the place of people with a partisan bent has left the Senate short of people who came into the job knowing how Parliament works. Harder said Trudeau doesn't have to return to a time when Senate appointments were given out as ""gifts of the prime minister ... rewards for political loyalty and the like."" ""I personally believe having political experience ought not exclude you from consideration for the upper chamber. We'd benefit from having individuals who've had experience in legislatures, or the House of Commons, or who are more active in political life,"" he said. ""But when you come to the Senate you turn that page [on party politics]."" Harder, a former senior public servant, said there's been a steep learning curve for some of the Trudeau appointees coming from non-political fields like medicine, the arts, business or the charitable sector. Joining the Senate means a transition from private to public life — and the way Parliament works is completely unlike a private business or a non-profit. For example, the standing committee on internal economy, budgets and administration — which essentially governs the chamber's operations — is accountable not to shareholders but to the Canadian people, through senators. The procedural quirks of the Senate can be hard to master. And while the Red Chamber has considerable power to amend or defeat legislation — a tempting proposition for new senators eager to enact change — Harder said senators ultimately have to defer to the government of the day. ""It would be helpful, in the mix of skill sets that are in the chamber, to have people who've gone through the practicalities of legislating — which, by definition, requires political compromises,"" he said. The chamber's composition notwithstanding, Harder said the Senate has been more effective since the reforms because more senators are now willing to push the Liberal government to improve legislation. Of the 88 government bills passed by the Senate in the last Parliament, the Senate amended 32. And 29 of those amended bills ultimately were accepted in whole or in part by the government. Critics maintain some of those amendments were inconsequential or would have been proposed by senators during the drafting stage if they still sat in national party caucuses. But the Senate under Trudeau has made considerably more amendments than it did under former prime minister Stephen Harper — when only one bill was amended by the Red Chamber in a four-year period. Outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had promised to dismantle the Liberal government's appointments process. Scheer said he would revert to the decades-old tradition of appointing loyal party members to the Red Chamber. When asked if he was happy with Scheer's election loss on Oct. 21, Harder said no. ""I think that's not the right adjective. I wasn't relieved that Andrew Scheer didn't win but I do think that our Senate experience, of being less partisan, more independent, will take root. I take some pleasure in that,"" Harder said. ""The promise he made to go back to the political appointments and to the Senate of old is not good for the institution. It turned out not to be good for him politically, either."" If the Liberal minority government can serve out an entire four-year term without losing a confidence vote, Trudeau will have appointed nearly three-quarters of the 105 seats in the chamber. All of the Trudeau picks to this point have sat as Independents, outside of the traditional Liberal and Conservative caucuses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-harder-senate-point-man-political-appointees-1.5403028,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-cost-of-the-senate-has-soared-by-a-third-last-five-years-1.5359368 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-andrew-scheer-senate-partisan-peter-harder-1.4951451,N/A

The policy change appears likely to ensure the refinery — the nation's 18th biggest greenhouse gas emitter — misses the cuts by a wide margin at a time Ottawa is seeking to slash emissions and build a reputation as a world leader in the fight against climate change.  The family-owned company had publicized the 17 per cent carbon cut target after the Copenhagen Accord of 2009, an international agreement to combat global warming that has since been superseded by a more ambitious and widely adopted deal called the Paris Agreement. But Irving Oil removed the pledge from its website earlier this year, without any public announcement of a change in policy. Regulatory filings obtained by Reuters through a Right To Information Act request show the company ceased to target an outright reduction in carbon output from the refinery as early as 2016. It instead adopted a goal to maintain a carbon intensity rating among the top 25 per cent of rival refineries in Canada through 2025, using a methodology developed by Texas-based consultancy HSB Solomon Associates that considers a facility's ""complexity"" instead of just its emissions-per-barrel of throughput, according to the filings. Carbon intensity refers to the amount of carbon dioxide released by a facility per unit of production. Irving listed more than two dozen projects and programs to help achieve this goal, including ""fugitive emissions leak detection"" and improving the energy efficiency of the plant, according to its Greenhouse Gas Management plan filed with provincial regulators in 2016. In Irving's 2017, 2018, and 2019 annual reports to regulators on its progress with the plan, the company stated it was meeting its goal of remaining in the top 25 per cent among peers based on the Solomon method. In response to questions from Reuters, Irving confirmed that its carbon targets had evolved but did not provide any details.  ""We continually update our standards to accurately reflect the targets set in the areas where we operate,"" Irving spokeswoman Candice MacLean said in an email. The 320,000 barrel-per-day refinery emitted just over three million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2017, according to the latest data from Environment Canada, marking a seven per cent decline from 2005 levels. Irving did not provide more recent figures. The facility's carbon intensity, meanwhile — as a simple calculation of its emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of throughput — topped the list among Canada's five largest refineries that year, according to a Reuters review of the Environment Canada emissions data. But Irving has successfully argued to provincial regulators that a simple carbon-per-barrel calculation leads to unfair comparisons, according to the filings. ""The most effective benchmarking tool for measuring a refinery's GHG (greenhouse gas) performance is the Complexity-Weighted Barrel methodology developed by Solomon Associates,"" the company said in the 2016 filing, as New Brunswick was devising a provincial climate law. Solomon's methodology uses proprietary, non-public details about an oil refinery's operational units to calculate its complexity. It is used by regulators in several European countries, the state of California, and the provinces of Alberta and Ontario to track refinery climate performance. Canada has been an enthusiastic participant in the 2015 Paris accord, and in 2016 adopted stringent federal regulations, including a controversial tax on emissions, to help it reach its goal of slashing nationwide greenhouse gas output by 30 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. New Brunswick aims to help Canada meet that target in part by requiring its large industrial emitters to reduce their carbon intensity by at least 10 per cent by 2030. The province has agreed to track the performance of the Irving refinery, which accounts for around a fifth of provincial emissions, by using Solomon's Complexity Weighted Barrel method.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-carbo-pledge-1.5405518,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/carbon-tax-irving-oil-refinery-1.5312792 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-charged-refinery-explosion-worksafenb-1.5311511,N/A

He was interviewed in person for CBC's investigative podcast series, The Pit.  He claims he was at home on Dec. 7, 2015, the day Sheree disappeared. Sheree's semi-truck was found the next morning, abandoned in a gravel pit near her parents' farm in the Kenaston, Sask. area. Fertuck later said a recent head injury made it so he does not remember anything about his divorce to Sheree, or if he was in the area of the gravel pit on the day of Sheree's disappearance. Fertuck said he slipped on ice and hit his head on his way to a restaurant in December 2018. ""When I fell I guess I had a ruptured blood vessel in my brain, it started bleeding and that's partially the cause of my amnesia or whatever you want to call it,"" said Fertuck. ""I was in the hospital for over two months so I lost a bit of my memory."" Asked whether he has any information that could prove he was not near the gravel pit on Dec. 7, 2015, he said, ""not really.""  Fertuck said RCMP used a ""Mr Big"" operation in the investigation that led to his arrest.  Mr. Big sting operations involve police posing as criminals in an attempt to obtain a confession from a suspect. Fertuck claims he fabricated a story about Sheree because he was intimidated by the undercover officers posing as criminals. Fertuck said there was an individual who he thought had ""cleaned up"" after the murder of a woman in Alberta. Fertuck claims he thought the officer posing as a crime boss was going to have him killed too when he found himself in a situation with the same ""clean up guy.""

501,Sarah MacMillan,2020-01-24T10:00:00.401Z,Charlottetown water use lowest in 20 years,"Water use in Charlottetown has dropped significantly over the past 11 years, and the city says its water meter program and a focus on public awareness seem to be paying off. The city's water consumption was at its peak in 2008, when it hit 7.1 million cubic metres. In 2019, the rate was down to just under 6.2 million cubic meters — dipping below the consumption rate in 1999. ""With the growth that the city has seen over the last 20 years, that's a remarkable accomplishment,"" said Coun. Jason Coady, chair of the city's water and sewer committee. ""It's a great example of what happens when everybody kind of works together."" In 2015, the city began rolling out a mandatory water-meter program, with the initial target of having meters installed in all homes by the end of 2019.  While the city did not quite meet that goal, Coady said there remain only a ""very small number of non-metered residents,"" and he hopes to see all customers hooked up soon.  He said the metering program has been a success in reducing household and business consumption. ""When you get your bill you can see how much you used and what you're paying."" He also credits customers and businesses ""understanding that it's not an unlimited resource. The due diligence that they have on their part to reduce their water use has gone a long way.""  He believes the city's education campaigns, as well as programs such as rebates for installing low-flow toilets and shower heads have helped to create a conversation around water use in the city, and a focus on water conservation. In 2018, the city completed work on a new well field, in Miltonvale Park, in order to meet demands and ease pressure on the city's other three well fields. For years there have been concerns about water levels in the Winter River, the city's main water source.  With the fourth well field up and running, and the water consumption trending down, Coady is optimistic about the city's water capacity for years to come.   ""The city is in great shape going forward,"" he said.  ""To be honest with you, looking at the trend, if we had kept going where we were going in 2008, we'd probably be sitting here talking about another new water field, and we're not doing that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-water-use-down-1.5438136,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/charlottetown-mandatory-water-meters-1.3268824 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/water-meters-charlottetown-pei-1.4510564 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/charlottetown-well-field-problems-delays-pei-1.4978804 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dealyed-well-field-running-1.5109169 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-printing-press-transcontinental-job-offer-1.5438063 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-upei-online-courses-education-demand-1.5437958,N/A
502,Anonymous,2019-02-06T04:44:27.271Z,TSB says train began to move on its own before fatal derailment,"Investigators say a Canadian Pacific freight train was parked and began to move on its own before it derailed and killed three crew members near the Alberta-British Columbia boundary on Monday. The Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday the westbound 112-car train had been parked on a grade for two hours near Field, B.C. — about 80 kilometres west of Banff along the Trans-Canada Highway — when it started rolling. It barrelled along for just over three kilometres before 99 cars and two locomotives derailed at a curve ahead of a bridge, the TSB said. Only 13 cars and the tail-end locomotive remained on the tracks. ""The lead locomotive came to rest on its side in a creek and a number of derailed cars came to rest on an embankment,"" said TSB senior investigator James Carmichael as he provided an update on the investigation in Calgary on Tuesday. ""The remaining cars, including the mid-train remote locomotive, piled up behind."" On Monday, Greg Edwards, with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC), said the train fell more than 60 metres. The crash killed conductor Dylan Paradis, engineer Andrew Dockrell and trainee Daniel Waldenberger-Bulmer, all based out of Calgary. ""At this point, we're calling it a loss of control, which is when the crew can no longer maintain the track speed,"" said Carmichael. Carmichael said a new crew had just boarded and was preparing to take over control of the train, which had been parked with its emergency air brakes activated. ""It was not anything the crew did. The train started to move on its own,"" he said. ""We're going to try to determine why the brakes didn't stay in place.""​ The TSB said the train gained speed well in excess of the 32 km/h maximum for the tight turns in the mountain pass in the moments leading up to the derailment, which happened at Mile 130.6 of the Laggan Subdivision between the Upper and the Lower Spiral Tunnel, near Field, B.C. Christopher Monette, TCRC's director of public affairs, had described it as ""a runaway train."" At Tuesday's briefing Carmichael, of the TSB, used the phrase ""loss of control."" He said it was too early in the investigation to conclude what led to the derailment. ""We will look at every indication of how that train was handled going down that hill,"" he said. The probe will also look at when each car and locomotive was built and when they were last in for repairs, as well as what discussions might have taken place during the crew switch-over.  ""We haven't had an opportunity to talk to the previous crew that was on there,"" Carmichael said. ""But that is one of the things that we're going to find out if there was any issue beforehand. At this time we just know that they met, talked, and the switch was made."" The TSB website says the investigation will also examine weather conditions at the time of the incident, the railway's ""winter operating plan"" and its training specific to the reliability of air brakes in extreme cold temperatures. Some data was recovered from the tail-end remote locomotive, and work is underway to obtain data from the mid-train remote locomotive, the agency said. There are currently two investigators on site and two working from Calgary, with assistance from the TSB Engineering Lab and the TSB Human Factors Division. Federal Minister of Transport Marc Garneau said he has sent a ministerial observer as well as staff from Calgary and Vancouver to help the TSB investigation.  ""I want to see what actually comes out of the investigation to be done by the Transportation Safety Board and also supported by my ministry,"" he said.  ""It's always a possibility that accidents or derailments will happen. We're trying to make it as safe as possible, and we will continue to make that our priority."" Watch the TSB's full news conference in the Facebook Live video, below: CP Rail said there was no threat to public safety and there were no dangerous goods involved in the derailment. British Columbia's Environment Ministry confirmed dozens of grain cars went off the tracks. RCMP said they are assisting in the investigation, along with Employment Safety Standards Canada and the B.C. Coroners Service. Edwards, with the TCRC, said he got the call in the middle of the night. ""It's one of the worst calls that you want to take,"" he said Monday. ""Everybody I've spoken with, both within the company and within the union, is just devastated by this."" Edwards said Dockrell, the engineer, had more than two decades of railroad experience. CP Rail president and CEO Keith Creel said the tragedy will have a long-lasting impact on CP's family of railroaders. ""We continue to mourn the loss of our three CP family members. I spent the day at the derailment site yesterday, and I have not stopped thinking about this incident since it occurred,"" Creel said in a prepared statement. ""With any significant incident, there are many questions that need to be answered,"" he said, adding that the investigation will be thorough and co-operative, and that at this time ""we are establishing some key facts and gaining a preliminary understanding of the chain of events."" ""In the meantime, CP crews, contractors and agencies are working diligently in challenging conditions to remove the damaged rail cars and equipment,"" Creel said. ""We expect this process to take a number of days."" Locomotive engineer Danielle Hand, who was hired at the same time as Dylan Paradis in 2007, called him ""a great railroader,"" said she has driven trains through the Laggan subdivision several hundred times and it can be a challenge. ""It can get a little scary,"" she said. The accident happened just short of the Spiral Tunnels, which were built 110 years ago to help trains traverse the treacherously steep Kicking Horse Pass. It has a slope grade of 2.2 per cent, one of the highest rail slopes anywhere in North America, according to the Encyclopedia of North American Railroads, which includes historical maps of what the author refers to as the region's ""arduous"" slopes. Sixteen cars of a CP Rail train derailed on Jan. 3 in the same area, which is near the Upper Spiral Tunnels, close to Cathedral Mountain, between Field and Lake Louise, Alta. No one was hurt in that derailment. A search of data on the Transportation Safety Board website shows that since 2004 there have been 64 CP Rail derailments on the 220-kilometre stretch of railway between Field, B.C., and Calgary, nearly half of which happened within 30 kilometres of the treacherous area near Spiral Tunnels. No one was killed in any of those incidents. In 1997, a CP Rail train derailed during an uncontrolled high-speed descent through Upper Spiral Tunnels. In that incident, an exhausted operator dealt with a depleted air brake and did not remember to engage a supplemental braking system, according to the TSB report. The three crew members were not hurt in that incident. Teamsters Canada says eight railway workers have died in accidents in Canada since November 2017.

503,Erik White ,2020-01-24T10:00:00.534Z,Northeastern hospitals fight to keep 'hallway medicine' from being the new normal ,"There's a spot on the fourth floor of Health Sciences North, where the hall widens a bit. It's now filled with a patient lying in a bed, just steps away from a bench where other patients are waiting to see a doctor and right next to the hallway where people are streaming past.  This patient is separated from this foot traffic only by a few fabric privacy screens. The lights overhead stay on all night.  The Sudbury hospital also has a dozen patients in an open ""dormitory"" style room that used to be a rehab clinic for people recovering from hand surgery. This is meant to ease pressure during the annual flu season influx.   And then there's the 30 or so people who spend a day or more in the emergency department, waiting for a proper room to open up. ""It's not ideal,"" says vice-president of patient experience and digital transformation Mark Hartman.  Health Sciences North has been dealing with this problem for the better part of a decade. The new Sudbury hospital was built too small and there is the chronic issue of the hospital housing seniors while they wait for long-term care home spaces to open up. But Hartman says they are focused on finding a fix, so it doesn't become the new normal.  ""I'm not concerned that it will be accepted as an acceptable state to be in,"" he says.  ""Working out how to solve that is not going to be an overnight fix."" Health Sciences North is moving its children treatment centre in order to free up space for another 56 beds and is encouraged by the province's pledge to invest millions in new nursing homes. ""It's not a simple problem, but it's great that the problem is being recognized across the province and hopefully that will lead to solutions,"" says Hartman. A close second to Sudbury in hospital overcrowding is the Temiskaming Hospital, which was over capacity 135 days in the first six months of last year. CEO Mike Baker says currently they are housing 67 patients in a hospital with 59 beds. That means people staying in the chapel, in isolation rooms built for infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS and in the obstetrics unit, which is just supposed to be for new mothers and their babies. Baker says on top of keeping hospital staff busier, those extra patients translate into more meals, medicine and cleaning, which has put the Temiskaming Hospital in a $1 million deficit position.  ""So yeah, it's difficult to keep on top of it. It's difficult to find new solutions,"" he says. Baker welcomes the province's plan for more long-term care homes, pointing out that a similar size community like Kirkland Lake has no overcrowding at its hospital, thanks to a shorter long-term care wait list. But he says that could take years, during which seeing patients sleeping in hallways becomes more and more normal.  ""Can the ministry keep up with the pace, while we're waiting for that other transition to happen?"" says Baker.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hallway-medicine-hospitals-overcrowding-northeastern-ontario-1.5437347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-general-hospital-health-care-over-capacity-1.5436703 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/children-s-treatment-centre-sudbury-hospital-hsn-1.5350106 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hospital-capacity-rates-neo-1.4956900,N/A
504,Kory Teneycke,2020-01-23T21:57:35.880Z,It's Stephen Harper's party — and he'll do what he wants to,"This column is an opinion by Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for prime minister Stephen Harper, manager of the recent Ontario PC Party campaign, and currently a partner at Rubicon Strategy. Teneycke has declared he will remain neutral in the federal Conservative leadership campaign and has recused himself from work Rubicon is providing for the MacKay campaign. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Even five years after his defeat, the presence of Stephen Harper still defines the Conservative Party of Canada. In any other party it would be a bit odd for a past leader to be so dominant in the race to replace his successor's successor. But not in this one. Only 17 years ago, it was a much younger, more ideologically strident Stephen Harper who forged a new party from the shattered pieces of the PC Party (which had become an Atlantic Canadian regional rump) and the Canadian Alliance (Preston Manning's failed effort to rebrand the Reform Party). As a Reform Party staffer and later as a Member of Parliament, Harper had always been a hardliner. Critical of Manning for his lack of conservatism and dismissive of those advocating the need for the two right-of-centre parties to merge. In running for the Canadian Alliance leadership, he was full of bravado about the ability of the CA to best the PC Party electorally. But in what would become a telling sign of his future approach to governing (best described as pragmatic, conservative incrementalism), in 2003 Harper adjusted course and engineered the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. On matters of party discipline, Harper would sometimes in half-jest quote Louis XIV: ""l'etat c'est moi"" (I am the state). Harper wasn't just the first leader for the first half of its existence, he was the Party. And everybody knew it. Even in departure he continued to maintain a low-profile but powerful role as a director of the Conservative Fund – the body that holds the purse strings for party operations and campaigns. His recent departure from the Fund generated headlines and speculation. Some ""unnamed sources"" have alleged this was to free him to attack potential leadership candidate Jean Charest. It is unlikely that was ever true, but given Charest's decision to not enter the race, it clearly is no longer a motivation. Even if Charest had entered the leadership he would have had to kiss the ring of Harper's legacy, and adopt positions similar to those of Harper on a range of issues — including conservative cultural issues such as gun control. Harper doesn't need to campaign for or against anyone in the party leadership race. Every candidate will be attempting to claim some degree of ownership or continuance of the Harper record, and quietly intimating that they have his private approval. There is no path to victory running against Harper's legacy. The decision to leave the fund is more likely, as National Post columnist John Ivison suggested, an effort to sidestep Andrew Scheer's expense account scandal – of which private school funding is rumoured to be only the tip of the iceberg. Harper has a near anaphylactic intolerance for expense account abuse. While he did get criticism for charging his personal stylist to the Party, Harper's legacy governing is one of transparency. His reforms brought in pro-active disclosure of expenses for cabinet ministers and their staff. And back in Reform Party days he was the alleged source for blowing the whistle on then Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's use of party funds to fix his teeth and purchase bespoke suits. Regardless the reasons for his departure from the Fund, it makes no difference. It is still Harper's party. It is the electoral coalition that he built that is the foundation of the party – not just nationally, but in provinces like Ontario as well. Fundraising letters sent on behalf of the party bring in the most money when sent under his name. Most telling, numerous polls demonstrate Harper continues to be the most popular potential leader for the Conservative Party – by far. He would easily achieve a first-ballot victory if he chose to enter the race (which I predict he won't). Of course, the Conservative Party will need to evolve. It was a mistake for the Scheer campaign to run on a mildly updated version of the Harper 2015 platform. But at its core, the conservative electoral coalition is quite strong. And that is thanks to Stephen Harper.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A

We still don't know,"It's still not clear who organized and paid for a number of young people who appeared with signs supporting Meng Wanzhou outside of B.C. Supreme Court on Jan. 20, the first day of the Huawei CFO's extradition hearing.  CBC spoke to two women who said they were offered money to show up at the courthouse and hold signs with slogans like ""Free Ms. Meng,"" and ""Equal Justice.""  One of the women said she was paid $150. The other, actor Julia Hackstaff, said she and others in the local film community were led to believe they were working as extras on a movie shoot in exchange for $100. Meng is in court for hearings over a U.S. request to extradite the Chinese telecom executive on fraud charges She was arrested at Vancouver Airport in December 2018 and has been out on $10-million bail, living in one of her two multi-million dollar Vancouver mansions. In a statement, Huawei Technologies denied having anything to do with the protest. ""Huawei had no involvement with the protesters or supporters outside the Vancouver courthouse and is unaware of any plans by those responsible.""  The Chinese Consulate General in Vancouver also told CBC it knew nothing about the paid protesters and that any claims that it did were ""pure malicious smears.""  The group did appear in a Central China Television news report, portrayed uncritically as ""protesters asking for Meng's freedom."" However, many in the local media who witnessed the odd gathering suspected instantly there was more to the story. CBC News producer Georgina Smyth said after attempting to speak to some of the individuals, it became apparent they didn't have a clue about Meng or the issues surrounding her extradition hearing.   ""The people I spoke to were either bored or confused as to why they were there and were becoming increasingly agitated and angry at reporters questions,"" said Smyth. ""Many of the signs were the same pink cardboard colour and they had obviously been written by the same person. Others were simply pieces of paper that had text marks on them. A very rush job."" The two protesters CBC spoke with said they didn't know who was ultimately behind recruiting or paying them.

507,Anonymous,2020-01-24T05:04:46.361Z,Actress Annabella Sciorra testifies that Harvey Weinstein raped her,"Actress Annabella Sciorra confronted Harvey Weinstein from the witness stand Thursday, telling a jury in a quivering voice that the burly Hollywood studio boss barged into her apartment in the mid-1990s, overpowered her and raped her as she tried to fight him off by kicking and punching him. She said that a month later, she ran into him and confronted him about what happened, and he replied: ""That's what all the nice Catholic girls say."" Then, she told the jury, Weinstein leaned toward her and added menacingly: ""This remains between you and I."" ""I thought he was going to hit me right there,"" Sciorra testified. At other points in the 1990s, she said, Weinstein sent her packages with Valium and a box of chocolate penises and turned up early one morning at her Cannes Film Festival hotel room door ""in his underwear with a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other."" She said he eventually left after she started frantically pushing buttons on the room phone to summon help. The 59-year-old actress became the first of Weinstein's accusers to testify at his trial, where the movie mogul whose downfall gave rise to the #MeToo movement is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his New York apartment in 2006 and raping an aspiring actress in a hotel room in 2013. Weinstein is not charged with attacking Sciorra, whose accusations date too far back to be prosecuted. Instead, she testified as one of four additional accusers prosecutors intend to put on the stand to show that the powerful Hollywood producer had a pattern of preying on women. Weinstein, 67, could get life in prison if convicted. Weinstein, the executive behind such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. Recounting an accusation she said she kept largely secret for decades, Sciorra testified that after raping her, Weinstein went on to try to perform oral sex on her, saying, ""This is for you,"" as her body ""shut down."" ""It was just so disgusting,"" she said. She said she started to shake: ""I didn't even know what was happening. It was like a seizure or something."" WATCH | Actress tells Weinstein trial that he raped her in the early 90s: The defence tried to seed doubts about Sciorra's allegations, and she gave a slightly different version under their questioning, testifying that when the producer initially pushed her onto her bed, ""he was kind of, in a friendly way, trying to cajole me"" into having sex. She refused and soon found herself trying to get him off of her, she said. Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno noted that Sciorra never went to police or a doctor about the alleged rape. ""At the time, I didn't understand that that was rape,"" Sciorra said. Rotunno also suggested that Sciorra's judgment and recollection were clouded by drinking. The actress said she remembered having only a glass of wine with dinner and had kicked a Valium habit that developed after Weinstein sent her pills. In opening statements on Wednesday, another Weinstein lawyer, Damon Cheronis, argued the encounter was consensual, not rape, saying Sciorra once told a friend that she ""did a crazy thing and had sex with Harvey Weinstein."" The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. Sciorra drew acclaim for her part in Spike Lee's 1991 movie Jungle Fever and her role as a pregnant woman molested by her doctor in 1992's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle the next year. She later appeared on The Sopranos. Sciorra first made her allegations in a New Yorker article in 2017. She said she met Weinstein at an industry event in Los Angeles in 1990 or 1991. By 1993, she had starred in one of his company's movies — the romantic comedy The Night We Never Met. She said the rape happened in late 1993 or early 1994, after Weinstein dropped her off from a movie-business dinner and then appeared, uninvited, at her door a few minutes later. Sciorra said afterward, she started to cut herself and feel she didn't want to leave her house. At the same time, she said, she struggled with understanding that what happened to her was a crime. ""I thought he was an OK guy. I felt confused. I felt like I wished I never opened the door,"" she said. She said she told no one at first, not even her brothers. ""I wanted to pretend it never happened. ... I wanted to get back to my life,"" she told the jury. She did not come forward publicly until 2017.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-trial-sciorra-testimony-1.5437876,https://www.cbc.ca/news/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5416145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-1.5418742 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/annabella-sciorra-alleges-rape-weinstein-1.4377160,N/A
508,Amina Zafar,2020-01-24T10:00:15.274Z,'Just incredible:' Mass quarantines take China into uncharted territory,"China's move to lock down 10 cities to control the spread of a new coronavirus is unprecedented in modern history and its effectiveness is hard to predict, public health experts say. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, the train station and airport were shut down on Thursday, while ferry, subway and bus service ground to a halt. Trying to contain a city of 11 million people is ""new to science,"" said Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in China. ""We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.""  Similar measures were announced in other cities, all in central China's Hubei province. Mass gatherings were forbidden just as hundreds of millions of people prepared to travel and celebrate the Lunar New Year. ""That's just incredible,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital. ""The equivalent would be shutting down transportation to a comparable sized city like London, United Kingdom on Dec. 23."" But its effectiveness depends in part on how many ""chains of transmission"" have occurred.  Like branches of a tree trunk, each chain of infection represents one person infecting someone else. Many chains of infection usually means more people are infected and an outbreak is widespread, he said. If there have already been secondary chains outside Wuhan, then shutting down the transportation might slow the spread of the virus, but not stop it in its tracks. Bioethicist Kerry Bowman of the University of Toronto says quarantines can be effective in the early stages of an outbreak.  The rub is, in this case, the quarantine pits individual freedoms against an entire city's. ""This may be acceptable to people if it's short term,"" Bowman said. For China, the question becomes who does the quarantine serve, says Ann Carmichael, a professor emerita of history at Indiana University who studies quarantines during the 17th century outbreaks of plague in Europe.  Back then, she says, people would be killed for the tiniest infraction of public health laws, like not burning clothing as ordered. The word ""quarantine"" comes from the Italian quaranta giorni (""40 days""), which referred to a period of isolation placed on ships and people in a bid to control the Black Death.  These days, says Carmichael, ""I think what the Chinese government is always thinking about is — when does panic make it worse, and what is a measured response?"" she said. Panic is a possible side-effect of a quarantine, says Dr. Tom Solomon, who heads the U.K.'s Health Protection Research Unit on emerging infections. He says stopping all public transport from a city can be counterproductive. ""It can increase the level of panic and just cause people to flee by other means,"" Solomon wrote in a recent commentary.  It can also send people into hiding. Solomon gave the example of the village of Eyam in north England where, in the Middle Ages, residents built a wall during an outbreak of plague and didn't leave until it ended. Back then, outbreaks of plague, cholera and yellow fever provided a reason for one country to interfere in another's affairs. It wasn't until the 19th century that countries began to co-operate more officially on global health problems.  And today, says Carmichael, the world needs answers to questions — like whether this new coronavirus is poised to cause a pandemic, like the 1918 influenza.  More recent infections prompted a range of responses. During HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization did not get involved in quarantines or border restrictions, Carmichael said. During the SARS outbreak in Ontario, hospitals and long-term care homes practised a form of quarantine — with daily temperature checks for staff and a ban on visitors. In contrast, after SARS, Canada helped to revise International Health Regulations to avoid unnecessary restrictions on travel and trade. Carmichael said part of the history and practice of quarantine is ""keeping in"" — detention, confinement and isolation. The other is ""keeping out"" — border security, masks on persons and aggressive hand washing.

509,Greg Rasmussen,2020-01-03T09:00:00.404Z,Life changes instantly as cell service switched on in Ahousaht,"Classes done for the day, students stream out of Ahousaht's high school and onto the sidewalk. Like their counterparts across the country, many of the teens immediately bury their faces in their cellphones. But in this Indigenous community of 900 on an isolated island off the rugged west coast of B.C., it's a brand new experience because the service was activated on Dec. 1. ""I was happy I could send text messages and not use my Wi-Fi,"" one of the students, Corby Frank, said two days later. Jeremy Sam noticed a change right away in other students' behaviour. ""It's different,"" he said. ""Everyone is on their phone more."" Teacher Ethan Wills now finds himself in the same boat as most Canadian educators. ""When the switch was flicked, you could tell the kids were a little more distracted and a little less attentive to me."" But Wills said there is an upside. ""Ultimately I think it will be a major benefit,"" he said. ""More information coming, more information readily available, is a good thing. We just have to figure out how to navigate around it."" Ahousaht's Deputy Chief Melinda Swan said people across the community were excited when the cell coverage was activated after several years of lobbying for service. ""We're an isolated community, and some people are caught in situations where they need help and a cellphone would help them in our area,"" she said. The flood of summer tourists, as well as locals, will benefit, she said. Ahousaht resident Gino John said it's now suddenly much easier to arrange medical care for his child who has developmental issues that require frequent medical care. ""I have no landline, and having this benefits being able to email his doctors,"" he said, holding his child's hand by the side of the gravel road that runs through the community. But Ahousaht hasn't been entirely off the grid. Years before cell service, VHF radios ruled, and continue to be a significant mode of communication. Residents communicate on a specific channel, where a listener can hear people asking about boat rides to Tofino, or even someone selling fresh baked cupcakes and turnovers. The two-way radios are in almost every home, in vehicles and many people carry portables as they venture out. One man walking down the road pointed to his radio saying someone was just talking about a wild animal on the loose. ""There's a cougar wandering around, a cougar!"" he exclaimed before continuing his walk. But cell service means the radios will be used less. On a tour of the harbour on a boat used for search and rescue, emergency co-ordinator Alec Dick said the new cell service should help keep people safe on the ocean. ""Your highway is a paved highway. Ours is a water highway,"" he said, explaining how people here jump in a boat like people in the city use their cars. But the local waters with rocky islets and open Pacific Ocean to the west are sometimes dangerous. The community jumped into action in 2015 when a whale watching boat, the Leviathan II, sank. Six people died, but Ahousaht rescuers saved 21 others.  Cell service wasn't available, causing co-ordination problems with authorities in Tofino, where the hospital and other emergency services are based. ""It'll make it quicker to communicate with the people we need to communicate with,"" said Dick, who is pleased it adds another layer of protection for people in the community and on the water. The tower was put up by Telus at a cost of about $500,000, part of an ongoing program to help connect 178 Indigenous communities across the sprawling province.  About 90 per cent of the Indigenous communities in B.C. now have cell service, but the expense of building towers means isolated areas with small numbers of people still lack coverage. A Telus executive said millions of dollars have already been invested, but it's expensive to service long stretches of lightly travelled highways that would generate little additional revenue for phone companies. ""Getting from community to community you'll see some of the highways still have gaps in terms of connectivity, and we're working on that,"" said vice-president of consumer health Juggy Sihota. ""We're looking at government on how we can work together to close those gaps."" Back in Ahousaht, people are quickly getting used to the new service. ""I'm just going to text my mom,"" said Xavier Smith, who wants to tell her he's been interviewed by CBC. And to prove it he takes a selfie with the visiting news crew on his phone and sends it off to her. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/life-changes-instantly-as-cell-service-switched-on-in-ahousaht-1.5401854,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tofino-whale-watching-ship-sinking-leviathan-ii-coroners-report-1.4523190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/50-million-improve-internet-rural-indigenous-1.5381469 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/millions-for-internet-and-cell-phone-service-in-rural-communities-1.5221517,N/A

511,John Last,2020-01-18T11:00:00.914Z,"N.W.T. premier, health minister say little in response to foster families' allegations","Neither the N.W.T.'s premier nor its minister of Health and Social Services was prepared to offer a response Friday to allegations of widespread mismanagement at the territory's Child and Family Services division, including abuses by front-line workers. On Friday, CBC published a letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. In subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. The letter was first sent to Health Minister Diane Thom Monday evening by the Foster Family Coalition. She responded with a generic email pointing to the department's progress in completing a self-imposed three-year improvement plan, and making no mention of the letter or its allegations. On Tuesday, CBC requested an interview with Thom. She issued no statement until Friday, when a four-line statement attributed to the minister said she ""will not comment on [the concerns raised] until we have a chance to … hear directly from [the coalition] and build dialogue going forward."" ""Making sure that children and youth in care are safe and supported is something we take very seriously,"" the statement read. Tammy Roberts, the executive director of the Foster Family Coalition, confirmed the department reached out to her Wednesday to arrange a meeting. She said no date had yet been set. Reached by phone on Friday, Premier Caroline Cochrane said she had ""been running non-stop"" and had not read coverage of the letter. ""I do know that if you're talking about the foster family association [sic] than that would be a better question to ask the appropriate minister … Diane Thom,"" she said. While deferring specifics to the department, Cochrane went on to say that ""the government cares."" ""Actions are taking place,"" she said. ""However, the world does not change in a short time."" Asked what she would say to foster parents, Cochrane, a former social worker, said she ""value[s] the support that they provide to children and to our communities.

512,Michael Gorman,2020-01-23T13:18:23.983Z,N.S. remains committed to Lahey Report as province's forestry industry is in limbo,"Nova Scotia's forestry minister says he remains committed to implementing the Lahey Report on forestry practices, even as the industry is in the midst of significant challenges. Iain Rankin had previously said he hoped a new forest management guide, a key part of the report by University of King's College president Bill Lahey, would be ready by the end of last December. But that process was delayed when it was announced Northern Pulp would be shutting down its Pictou County, N.S., operation after failing to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment facility. On Thursday, the company announced in a news release it had begun issuing lay-off notices to 90 non-union salaried employees at the pulp mill. The earliest layoffs will take effect on Jan. 31. Rankin said he expects the advisory committee working on the new guide to meet by the end of February. He said he wanted to give the industry time to focus right now on the necessary transition efforts as a result of the pending closure at Northern Pulp. ""We wanted to put a high priority on that, making sure people were taken care of working in the forestry industry, but we are absolutely committed to adopting the Lahey Report and ecological forestry,"" he said. The minister said he remains optimistic the new guide can be completed early this year. Work on other aspects of the report's recommendations, which call for a more ecological approach to forestry and a reduction in clear cutting on Crown land, remains on track, said Rankin. ""I know a lot of people are waiting for the guide, but in fairness to industry, there has been some significant change in their lives,"" he said. ""I still believe that we can have significant progress by the end of this fiscal year when we'll be evaluated [by Lahey on our progress on achieving the recommendations]."" Rankin is also keeping tabs on efforts to transition an industry that's about to lose its most important player. Part of that process is finding new markets for low-grade wood chips and finding them soon, as rumours swirl about the viability of some sawmills in the province. The minister said time is the biggest challenge right now. Port Hawkesbury Paper has agreed to take more chips and Rankin said Nova Scotia Power could also take more for biomass energy. Still, finding a home for the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chips Northern Pulp used to purchase each year won't be easy. Although some industry members are pushing for an expanded use of chips at Brooklyn Energy near Liverpool, Rankin said there are a variety of considerations for such a move. ""We want to make sure that we're doing what's right for [power] ratepayers, what's right for the environment, what's right for all involved, but specific to that piece, that's owned by Nova Scotia Power and they'll make that determination,"" he said. Access to fibre is also an important consideration for sawmills and Rankin said he's heard from some outfits that want access to some of Northern Pulp's Crown land allocations once the company stops operating. ""I think quite rightly they're looking out to make sure that they have at least the amount of fibre allocation that they had through the Northern Pulp licensing,"" he said. ""So we're considering all options when it comes to the sawmills that had those exchange agreements in the central region."" As efforts continue to try to cushion the blow of Northern Pulp's closure to the industry, Rankin promised ""a number of initiatives"" that would be announced soon to help people in the industry and ensure that a workforce remains in the province for whenever new options and opportunities become available.

513,Ryan Patrick Jones,2019-12-31T00:20:54.884Z,"Conservative Party brand seen as 'old, traditional' survey finds","As Conservatives prepare to choose their next leader, a new survey of how voters perceive the party and its main competitor should give party members something to think about. The survey found that while the values of the Conservative Party are easily differentiated from those of the Liberal Party, the Conservative brand is generally associated with a number of negative ideas and concepts. ""The general image on top of peoples' mind is that this is a party that is aged, is old, and this notion of tradition is strongly tied to the brand of the Conservatives,"" David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, told Power and Politics guest host Catherine Cullen. And while respondents pointed to a number of ""negative associations"" with the Liberal Party — particularly it being seen as untrustworthy and inauthentic — the majority saw the party as open, diverse and ambitious. The findings may pose a challenge for the Conservative Party as it prepares for a leadership race to replace Andrew Scheer, who resigned on Dec. 12 following a disappointing election result.  Coletto's firm, in collaboration with conservative strategists Dennis Matthews and Kate Harrison, conducted the ""brand assessment"" of the two main political parties using market research techniques normally used to measure the reputation of corporate brands. Fifteen hundred Canadians of voting age, selected randomly from an online platform, were asked to associate words, phrases and images with the Conservative Party of Canada and the Liberal Party of Canada. When asked which words people associate with the Conservative Party, the three most common terms volunteered were ""old,"" ""tradition,"" and ""closed.""  The report also found that voters associate the Conservative brand with the oil and gas industry, the military and religion, but not with diversity, equality or climate change. Voters generally see the Conservative Party as cautious and restrained, the survey found. ""While being seen as realistic and restrained can be a virtue, the party's perceived lack of ambition is a challenge,"" Coletto said. The survey also found major issues with the Liberal brand. Words such as ""liar,"" ""dishonest"" and ""corrupt"" featured prominently in a list of the top 30 words people associate with the party.  Dennis Matthews, a former Conservative strategist who helped design the survey, said the Conservative brand has become a barrier standing in the way of people voting Conservative, and that it's in need of an update. ""Brands go through this all the time and they have to find a way to sort of retool or refresh themselves,"" said Matthews. ""The Conservatives have hit a point here where they haven't really gone through that process since the early 2000s, when Prime Minister Stephen Harper came onto the scene."" Matthews said the party's brand issues can't simply be solved by choosing a new leader. Instead, he encouraged party members to refocus on attracting a broader swath of the electorate. ""This really requires some rethinking of policies and particular stuff that would appeal to the parts of the country that are growing and changing the fastest,"" said Matthews ""By this, I'm thinking urban and suburban Canada, but also finding a way to just insert yourself into culture and be a bit more contemporary."" One of the most striking findings of the survey, Coletto said, is the difference in perception between Conservative supporters and the party's accessible voters — those who would consider voting Conservative in the future. ""When you compare what Conservative voters think about the party versus what accessible voters, or the rest of the population thinks, it's almost night and day,"" said Coletto. The views of accessible Conservative voters are very similar to the general public's, in that they see the party as ""old, traditional, closed-minded, bad, elitist and untrustworthy,"" the report said. In contrast, Conservative supporters see the party as ""trusting, caring, honest, realistic and good."" A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said the party has a history of inclusion and that Canadians of all backgrounds have long been welcome in the party. ""Conservatives believe in equality of opportunity and ensuring everyone has the chance to fully participate in the life and governing of our country,"" said Cory Hann. ""Our party is about to have a competitive leadership race where candidates will have the opportunity to share their vision for the future of our party."" Abacus Data said its survey was conducted online with 1,500 Canadian adults selected randomly from a set of partner panels on the Lucid exchange platform between Dec. 10 and 12.

514,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-22T23:21:13.084Z,"As U.S. threatens retaliation over digital taxes, Canada waits for OECD talks","As the U.S. continues to threaten other countries with retaliation if they proceed with a digital services tax, Canada's trade minister says the question of how to ensure profitable search engines, social media platforms and online retailers pay their fair share can only be tackled on a multilateral basis. France is preparing to target internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook with a three per cent tax on the revenues from their digital business in that country. Canada may eventually follow France's lead — but for now, it's not prepared to go it alone. Speaking while in transit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Wednesday, Small Business Minister Mary Ng said her government is looking at this issue in terms of what's in the best interests of Canadian businesses. ""I do think it's important to tackle this on a multilateral basis,"" she said. ""You do need to work through those processes."" Taxing multinational tech firms was part of the Liberals' re-election platform, which committed to ""work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations."" The proposal would tax the proceeds of online advertising and user data sales for digital firms with global revenues of more than $1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than $40 million. The Liberal platform projected $540 million in new revenue in 2020-21 from ""making multinational tech giants pay their fair share."" But Canada may not be able to proceed with its plans and start banking that kind of income this spring. Taxing multinational tech firms is easier said than done. Digital businesses models cross borders: a company may be headquartered and taxed in one country while it profits from its business activities in many others. That's why the 36 member countries of the OECD are trying to reach an international agreement on how to tax digital companies by mid-2020. Governments share a common concern: multinationals setting up in low-tax jurisdictions and avoiding taxes in others. Ng told CBC News Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to work though this process. Last fall, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among American industry groups urging the Trump administration to oppose Canada's adoption of a French-style digital tax. American digital companies believe they could be subject to ""double taxation,"" where they end up paying tax on the same revenue in both countries — something the tax treaty in place between the U.S. and Canada is supposed to prevent. The U.S. groups warned that the Liberal proposal could undermine American investments in the Canadian tech sector and be inconsistent with Canada's international trade commitments. World Trade Organization rules, as well as trade agreements like the recently renegotiated North American free trade deal, are supposed to prevent discrimination between foreign and domestic companies in areas like tax policy. Countries aren't allowed to create arbitrary rules to game the system in favour of their own corporations. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party also proposed taxing digital firms in the last election, said ""it makes no sense at all"" that an international foreign company could make money in Canada and not pay any taxes. Speaking during a break in caucus meetings Wednesday in preparation for the return of the House of Commons next week, Singh said that when working class people are paying their fair share, it's wrong for multinationals to do otherwise. He brushed aside the risk of retaliation. ""I don't think that we should live in fear of Mr. Trump. I don't think we should make decisions based on fear,"" he said. ""Particularly when our decisions are the right thing to do."" Talks Wednesday in Davos brought a temporary truce to a heated trade dispute over France's tax, which targets companies that have global revenues of over 750 million euros ($1.09 billion Canadian) and French revenue of over 25 million euros ($36 million Canadian). The thresholds are meant to offer French start-up companies room to grow. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he'd agreed to postpone collection of the tax until December — after the next U.S. election cycle — in return for a commitment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold off on the retaliatory sanctions President Donald Trump threatened to impose on French exports like champagne and cheese. Other European countries, including Austria, Italy, Spain and Britain, are considering similar taxes. Sajid Javid, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), told a panel in Davos Wednesday his country plans to proceed with its two per cent tax in April as a ""temporary tax"" until there is an international agreement on how to proceed. Mnuchin then told the same panel discussion that the pair needed to have ""some private conversations"" about this because such a tax would be discriminatory. ""If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on their car companies,"" Mnuchin said. More talks between Le Maire, Mnuchin and the head of the OECD, José Ángel Gurría, are expected Thursday. Gurría urged the countries to take the ""time and the space"" necessary to reach a deal and avoid bilateral confrontations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764,N/A
515,Tom Ayers,2020-01-23T10:00:00.421Z,"As CBRM violated in-camera rules, documents show governance was 'pretty sloppy,' says prof","The Nova Scotia government is making changes to its training materials for municipalities after CBC News reported on Cape Breton regional council's in-camera practices. In 2018, Cape Breton Regional Municipality admitted it breached the Municipal Government Act by dealing with its own pay in camera four times over a period of two years. There is no penalty for breaching the Municipal Government Act, but the province now says training materials for councils are being revised to specifically forbid discussing pay behind closed doors. Those training materials are expected to be provided to CBRM as soon as possible and will be rolled out to all councils after the general municipal elections scheduled for this fall. An access-to-information request by CBC for correspondence covering the two years in which council pay was discussed in camera show some senior staff were OK with it, but does not clearly say whether any staff advised against it. ""One takeaway is that the governance of CBRM is not a well-oiled machine,"" said Tom Urbaniak, a political science professor at Cape Breton University. ""It's pretty sloppy."" In 2015, CBRM had to change its practices to start notifying the public about in-camera meetings after it was discovered council had held 31 secret meetings over a span of 22 months. The municipality was not saying ahead of time when it was meeting in camera or what was being discussed, and that is not allowed under the law. In 2018, after CBRM revealed it had been discussing council remuneration in camera, officials said they believed council could do that under rules allowing in-camera discussion on personnel matters. After CBC reported that, the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a ruling saying council members are not staff or personnel. The department said remuneration for elected officials must be discussed in open public meetings. In a recent email, the department said it provided CBRM with a training session on the Municipal Government Act — including a session on in-camera meetings — in April 2018. Departmental documents don't specifically say council pay can't be discussed in camera, but the training materials emphasize that municipal government should be conducted in public as much as possible. Urbaniak said access-to-information documents from CBRM at the time do not show whether staff, the mayor and councillors understood that. ""Even though there are ambiguities in the Municipal Government Act, the expectation is that our elected officials will err on the side of transparency,"" he said. Despite that, the documents show the municipality's chief administrative officer and clerk believed council pay could be discussed in camera. The documents also show the solicitor seemed to disagree, but they also show he deferred to the clerk on that. Urbaniak said that's interesting, but isn't as important as what council members thought. The documents show very little, if any, discussion among councillors on whether they could — or should — discuss their own pay behind closed doors. ""Councils themselves have to take responsibility for their effectiveness as governing bodies,"" Urbaniak said. ""These are elected officials and they have a public trust to uphold."" The issue was discussed briefly at a public council meeting in March 2017, when the mayor decided not to refer a discussion on remuneration to an in-camera session after senior staff disagreed on whether that was allowed. In any event, council pay was discussed in camera three times after that — twice after the April 2018 training session by the province. ""There was that one little experiment with going public and then it went back into confidential session,"" Urbaniak said. ""Unfortunately, the documents don't give us a clear indication about the sequence of events leading from that public meeting to putting this back into confidential session."" Mayor Cecil Clarke said after the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a clear ruling late in 2018 that council pay must be discussed in the open, CBRM changed its practice. ""When the department had made an indication it should be public, it quickly became public and that's the standing practice and will be going forward,"" he said. Clarke said CBRM is more open than it used to be and he said council goes beyond the requirements of the legislation, for instance, by holding public budget consultation sessions. ""Council ... as far as procedures and activities, has evolved and council will evolve because some of the complexities of issues today require to have that level of openness and transparency, and that's a good thing,"" he said.

516,John Last,2020-01-27T15:18:13.533Z,Colville Lake makes pitch for local control on 1st day of Sahtu caribou hearings,"Leaders from Colville Lake, N.W.T., say the government should allow them to lift hunting quotas and replace them with local regulations guided by Dene law.  ""We're trying to make sure our way of life is relevant,"" said David Codzi, president of Colville Lake's Ayoni Keh Land Corporation. ""We've been doing this for too long to say that it's wrong."" The community's locally-developed caribou conservation plan was presented as the first act of business at a three-day ""public listening session"" on the caribou harvest, organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board. The sessions have brought more than 60 visitors to the small community of about 130 people, and have been well-attended. According to the plan, one goal is to ""avoid intervention"" by the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources to regulate harvest through tags or quota systems, which it calls an ""unprecedented colonial system of control."" In their place, the plan proposes a bottom-up management system based on mutual respect for and ""inter-dependence with ʔədə,"" the traditional name for caribou. It also says conservation efforts must be guided by the wisdom of elders and the community's traditional law, or ʔeʔa. Among the ʔeʔa principles, the plan outlines are respect for the land, sharing and a belief ""that all things have a spirit and are interconnected."" Colville Lake's caribou conservation plan proposes the revitalization of the community's traditional law through the documentation of harvesting customs, the development of new research standards, and educating youth.  The plan would significantly empower Colville Lake's local renewable resource council, which it asserts is better placed to assess the conservation needs of the herd. Government departments are too ""siloed"" to take the holistic approach to conservation possible on a local level, according to the plan. It commits Colville Lake's authorities to establish and enforce local guidelines. It would also collect and share harvest numbers with partners in the territorial government. ""Although reporting harvest numbers may be alien to the customs of the Dene, it … may serve to prevent the imposition of unacceptable harvest restrictions,"" the plan reads. If fully accepted, the plan would also obligate the government to consult with the local renewable resource council before permitting any proposed mineral and petroleum exploration on the caribou range. That range extends well outside the territory, into Yukon and Nunavut. The plan also asks that the government and exploration companies to consider reporting annually ""what they are doing on the land."" The plan must be approved by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board in its list of decisions produced from the session, due to be released Mar. 31. Then it will head to the territorial government, which will need to decide if and how to implement it under the territory's Wildlife Act. A similar local management plan produced by the community of Deline was endorsed by the government in 2016, but a submission to the hearings says ENR ""continues to consider"" aspects of the plan four years later.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearings-1.5435406,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-bluenose-east-caribou-conservation-decision-1.3741233,N/A
517,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-12-21T15:12:59.236Z,Inside the RCMP's cross-country manhunt for admitted killers Bryer Schmegelsky and Kam McLeod,"A ghosted girlfriend, a family home with guns and ammunition and french fries left scattered around a murder victim.  These are some of the puzzle pieces that RCMP investigators tried to fit together last summer in the wake of three killings in northern British Columbia, and the ensuing cross-country manhunt for Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19. The details come from a dozen warrant applications, newly unsealed following a court challenge by CBC News and other media outlets. They help complete the picture of a sprawling and confused investigation into three homicides, one where the RCMP eventually got their men — found dead by their own hands deep in the Manitoba bush — but failed to ever uncover the motivation for their brutal crimes. From the first instance, the remoteness of the crime scenes caused problems for police. After a highway maintenance worker reported the discovery of two bodies and a shot-up van near the Liard River Hot Springs on Highway 97, near the B.C.-Yukon border, early on the morning of July 15, it took officers from the closest RCMP detachment in Fort Nelson, B.C., three hours to make their way to the site. There, they found the bodies of a young man and young woman, face down in a ditch. Both had suffered multiple gunshot wounds and had been dead for hours — ""cold to the touch,"" according to a trucker who was one of the first upon the scene.  Police quickly established that the van belonged to Lucas Fowler, a 23-year-old Australian citizen who was in the country on a work visa. And they found a bank card belonging to Chynna Deese, a 24-year-old American, on the ground near the woman's body. But positive identification of the bodies took a full two days. A search warrant for the van, obtained from a Burnaby, B.C. court on the afternoon of July 15, wasn't executed until late the next morning. And then the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) demanded a warrant before it would hand over photos and passport information for the vacationing couple. (Fowler had entered the country on April 16 while Deese had arrived just days before their deaths, on July 6.)  At the crime scene, investigators uncovered some disturbing details. There were gunshot entry wounds on both the front and the backs of the bodies. And a number of bullets were found lodged in the bloody dirt beneath — an indication that the assault had continued as the couple lay helpless on the ground.  The autopsies, conducted in Abbotsford, B.C., on July 19, catalogued seven separate injuries for Deese and five for Fowler, although the particulars have been blacked out in the released warrant applications. At the time, the RCMP had no real leads. There was an hours-long gap between the last sightings of Fowler and Deese alive — from witnesses who had stopped on the evening of July 14 to offer assistance repairing their broken down van — and the discovery of their bodies early the next day. Investigators released a sketch of an unknown man who was seen talking to the couple around 10:30 that night, labelling him a ""person of interest,"" but later determined he was just another would-be helper. (After police later zeroed in on McLeod and Schmegelsky, they found footage from security cameras along Highway 97, or the Alaska Highway, that showed the pair were already long gone — hundreds of kilometres north of the murder scene on their way to Whitehorse — when the first 911 call was received early July 15.)  It wasn't until the morning of July 19, when police received a call about a burning pickup truck along Highway 37, 60 kilometres south of another northern B.C. community, Dease Lake, that the investigation started to mushroom into one of the largest manhunts in Canadian history. The first officer found a still-smoldering Dodge parked beside a bridge with camping gear, including a stove, propane tanks and the yellow nozzle of a gasoline jerry can, scattered about the area. The partially charred licence plate revealed that the vehicle was registered to Kam McLeod. The constable was preparing to leave when a motorist flagged him down to report that he had found a dead body in a roadside gravel pit, about 2.5 kilometres farther down the highway. The older, heavyset man with a white beard was lying on his back, bloodied and burned, his torn clothes revealing multiple wounds. The fact that he had been shot wasn't readily apparent. One thing that leapt out to the officer was the presence of what appeared to be scattered french fries and a red cardboard McDonald's container on the ground between his legs. The odd discovery is referred to repeatedly across the warrants, usually prefaced by a single, blacked-out word, suggesting there was something noteworthy about the state of the food. There was no ID on the body, but the man's pockets were full of change. Investigators theorized that he had still been alive when he arrived at the gravel pit because of the mud on his shoes. They found 13 items near the body, including cigarette butts, a Molson beer can, a Red Bull can, and plastic flex ties — the kind that could be used to bind a person's hands together. The RCMP now had three bodies and two crime scenes, some 500 kilometres apart. But the burned-out pickup made them fear that Schmegelsky and McLeod might also have fallen victim to a killer. Another traveller alerted police to the presence of a substantial amount of blood on the floor and walls of a rest-stop outhouse on the other side of the bridge. And there were more discoveries along Highway 37: A trash can that had been set alight, and at another rest stop five kilometres south of the third body, a black and yellow folding knife and Kam McLeod's employee ID from the Walmart in Port Alberni, B.C. The warrant to search the torched vehicle makes specific mention of firearms, ammunition and ""edged weapons,"" noting that injuries on the newly discovered body implied a knife and a gun had been used. It also expresses a belief that ""biological samples"" could be taken from the flex ties. An officer from a local detachment on Vancouver Island visited the family homes of McLeod and Schmegelsky on the afternoon of July 20. He was told that the two young men had left Port Alberni on July 12, with plans to travel to Whitehorse in search of work. They had last contacted their families on July 17 via text message. McLeod's parents described their son and his friend as ""introverted loners and gamers."" Schmegelsky's grandmother revealed that he had recently been upset about being rejected by a girl — McLeod's younger sister. Police asked if either had a gun with them and were told no, and that no firearms were missing from the family homes. However, there were also indications that the pair were cutting links with their hometown.  McLeod's girlfriend told the RCMP that he had left without saying goodbye. ""Seriously sorry, but I'm not coming back,"" he wrote in a text message sent on July 13. And when she reached him on his cellphone the next night — a few hours before the murders of Fowler and Deese — McLeod refused to say where he was and abruptly cut off the call.  The police tried to trace the pair via their debit and credit card transactions, but McLeod's last purchase had come on July 12 at a sporting goods store in Nanaimo, B.C. (It would be days before the RCMP figured out that he had bought a gun, a 7.62x39-mm SKS, a non-restricted, semi-automatic rifle, along with a box of shells.)  Schmegelsky's last purchase was $20 worth of gas at a station on the Alaska Highway early on the morning of July 18. Attempts to locate the friends by tracking their cellphones were similarly unsuccessful. Schmegelsky's phone had been out of service since July 15. And after the final text to Port Alberni on July 17, McLeod's cell remained switched off. Police would later find his bent SIM card on the ground near the third body. The RCMP were still struggling to identify the third victim when a tipster in Saskatchewan reported that two young men matching McLeod and Schmegelsky's descriptions had purchased gas at a Co-op in Meadow Lake on July 21. A local officer reviewed the surveillance tape early the next morning and confirmed that it was the missing B.C. teens — and that they were driving a new vehicle, a silver Toyota RAV4. By late afternoon on July 22, police had determined that the pair were now the prime suspects in all three killings. A Vancouver woman had called the RCMP after seeing a composite sketch of the victim that had been released to the media and posted online. She said it appeared to be her husband, Leonard Dyck, a 64-year-old botanist who lectured at the University of British Columbia. He had left home on July 16 to watch grizzly bears in the wilderness. His wife last heard from him via text on July 18. She told police that he often slept in his car while on roadtrips — a silver Toyota RAV4. The hunt for McLeod and Schmegelsky spanned over five provinces and territories and grew to involve hundreds of officers and volunteers, as well as the Royal Canadian Air Force. A total of 19 warrants were obtained.   The court submissions built upon each other, layering new details over the old.  An Aug. 1 application for access to online gaming profiles reveals that McLeod sometimes used the handle ""angelofdeath,"" while Schmegelsky at times went by ""Bryerbrown123 [KKK]."" A different filing for Mac and SSID information made the same day outlines a July 25 search of the McLeod family home in Port Alberni, describing a number of long guns locked securely in a gun safe, but two more rifles left out in the open on a bed and two additional guns stored underneath it.  As the RCMP indicated in their September report on the homicide investigations, two firearms were used to kill Fowler and Deese and one was used to kill Leonard Dyck. The gun that was used on both July 15 and July 19 was the SKS purchased in Nanaimo. The RCMP have recently disclosed that they have since determined that the second firearm used — a ""ghost gun"" made up of scavenged parts of at least five different Chinese-made guns — was also legally obtained by McLeod on July 12, along with 750 rounds of ammunition, from a small store in Port Alberni.  The warrants also provide the identity of a man who might well have been targeted by McLeod and Schmegelsky on the night of July 17, near Haines Junction, Yukon, two hours west of Whitehorse. Kenneth Albertsen, a resident of Palmer, Alaska, told police that he had just pulled over and crawled into his back seat for a nap when a slow-moving truck inched to a stop 50 metres in front of his vehicle. ""They sat there for a little while and then the passenger door on the truck opened and someone stepped out holding a long gun. And that got my attention, right away,"" Albertsen said in an interview with CBC News.  WATCH  | Palmer, Alaska, resident describes encounter with McLeod and Schmegelsky: As the man with the gun walked into the woods and started to weave his way back through the trees like he was stalking prey, Albertsen decided to make a hasty escape, noticing another young man behind the wheel of the truck as he sped past. The 54-year-old later came to believe that the pair were after the boat he was towing behind his own truck.  ""God saved me,"" he said. Albertsen's recollection of the make and colour of the vehicle didn't match McLeod's pickup, but RCMP have said that the timing, location and physical description of the men makes them believe it was Schmegelsky and McLeod. The manhunt reached its apex following the discovery of the torched remains of Dyck's Toyota outside Gillam, Man., on July 22, almost 3,000 kilometres east of the initial murder scene.  As police and volunteers manned roadblocks and scoured the surrounding bush, and military search planes patrolled the skies above, police hatched a plan to deal with the pair after their arrest. An Aug. 2 warrant application mentions a ""cell mate undercover operation,"" with hopes that McLeod and Schmegelsky will ""develop a bond"" with the jailhouse operatives and implicate themselves in the murders.  But the Aug. 7 discovery of two bodies in the wilderness, just eight kilometres from the burned out RAV4, made such a ruse unnecessary. The six videos that the pair left behind on a digital camera they had stolen from Dyck have never been released. The RCMP has described them as suicide notes, and last wills and testaments. The men admitted responsibility for the three murders, police say, but provided no explanation and expressed no remorse. The mystery of the french fries found surrounding Dyck's body also endures. If McLeod and Schmegelsky brought them along, they must have come from Whitehorse, the closest McDonald's along their route, but an eight-plus hour drive from that scene.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/northern-bc-murders-ito-1.5401732,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/schmegelsky-mcleod-homicides-manhunt-rcmp-1.5299115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/northern-bc-killings-manitoba-1.5224278 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/how-public-will-learn-more-about-triple-homicide-case-1.5241103 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pmo-letters-schmegelsky-mcleod-search-1.5288903,N/A

Cheetah Resources Pty Ltd. has agreed to a $5 million investment in Avalon Advanced Materials Inc.'s Thor Lake project. Under terms of the agreement released on Jan. 30, Cheetah Resources will gain ownership of near surface resources on two areas of the property.  Once the deal closes, Avalon president and CEO Don Bubar expects Cheetah Resources to put together a budget for a 2019 work plan. Avalon would continue to manage work programs at Thor Lake, located approximately 100 kilometres southeast of Yellowknife, roughly equidistant from Lutselk'e further east. ""In our model it could cost as little as $10 million to get this thing started,"" Bubar said. ""When you compare that to what's typical in the mining industry — hundreds of millions or billions of dollars —  it's a pretty modest capital requirement to initiate a mineral development operation."" The plan is for small-scale blasting and milling at the property with ore processing done on site. The company describes it as a ""pilot-scale development.""  The work, which could start as early as this summer, is meant to demonstrate the viability of processing the Thor Lake deposit for rare earth elements essential to the magnets market. ""High strength permanent magnets using rare earths — neodymium and praseodymium — are the key for making those electric motors for electric vehicles [that are] small size lightweight and high performance,"" Bubar said. ""It's a growing market but it's not that big yet,"" he added. ""So ideally to serve that market you want to start as modest scale, get yourself established in that market as a reliable producer of it and then position yourself to grow the business over time."" The Nechalacho rare earth elements project at Thor Lake received federal approval in 2013, but a downturn in commodities markets forced Avalon to put the N.W.T. project on the back-burner in 2014.

519,Rachel Ward,2018-07-11T15:46:06.163Z,"Humboldt crash 'real impetus' for trucking safety, driver test overhaul, Alberta minister says","In an effort pushed forward by the deadly Humboldt Broncos bus crash, Alberta's transportation minister is proposing a major overhaul of its trucking industry regulations and the province's privatized driving licensing system. Brian Mason said Tuesday the licensing system, which has been privatized for 25 years, is currently marred by frequent complaints, potential for abuse and ""a complete lack of oversight."" His department intends to make all driving examiners government employees by January 2019, pending consultations launched Tuesday immediately following his announcement.  Alberta Transportation is also proposing to close a loophole that allows trucking companies to operate without a safety certificate, and to implement mandatory training for tractor trailer, bus and school bus drivers, who now simply must pass a test.  The province had been looking at changes to the commercial trucking industry since well before the Humboldt Broncos hockey team bus crash in Saskatchewan in April, but Mason pointed to that deadly collision as his motivation for the quick timeline. ""The horrible tragedy at Humboldt was a real impetus for today's announcement. The matters that we're working on today were things that we were working on at that time,"" Mason said at a press conference at the Alberta Motor Transport Association headquarters in Calgary. ""But clearly the terrible tragedy has focused everyone on the need to do even more to make sure that our highways, our trucking system are as safe as possible."" The fatal crash involving a semi-trailer and the Humboldt Broncos hockey team bus killed 16 people and injured 13 others. The driver of the truck, a 29-year-old Calgary man named Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, faces 16 charges of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death. He appeared in court Tuesday and was released on bail. Parents of a deceased Broncos player, 16-year-old Adam Herold, are suing the driver, the company, Adesh Deol Trucking Ltd., for which the driver worked, and the bus's manufacturer. The changes were announced with support from several industry groups, but further business and public consultations will take place this month, with the goal of getting the changes in place for January. The province commissioned a third-party consultant's report in 2016 on Alberta's driver testing and licencing system. Mason characterized the report as having found ""significant difficulties with the current model,"" including poor service, improprieties and criminal activity. ""We have complaints every week and there is a complete lack of oversight,"" he told the crowd. Some complaints have addressed the availability of driving test staff, professionalism of the test staff, the high fees for tests and, he said, students being failed in order to solicit a second test fee. As a result, the province is proposing making driver examiners government employees. Driver licence services and road tests have been privatized in Alberta since 1993. ""We must address the issues that have been identified with the driver examiner process,"" Service Alberta Minister Brian Malkinson said. ""Even one instance of sexual harassment, bribery or fraud is one too many."" The minister said that despite wanting to make registry agents government staff, the province will ensure the same level of access to service in both rural and urban communities. Watch Transportation Minister Brian Mason's full comments: The province is also considering a mandatory entry-level training course for drivers applying for Class 1 (tractor trailer), Class 2 (bus) and an S endorsement, which is for school bus driving. Such training is offered only in Ontario currently, Mason said. Right now, if a driver passes the tests, they don't require further training. Industry and the public will be consulted about curriculum, training course length and the result in Ontario. Craig Couillard, president of the Association of Alberta Registry Agents, said his organization fully supports the province's proposal. Alberta also says it wants to kill a 60-day temporary safety licence offered to new carriers that allows them to continue operating while waiting for a federal safety fitness certificate. Mason said that temporary certificate has led to ""chameleon carriers,"" who operate until the federal government refuses to give them a safety fitness certificate, and then the company simply reopens under another name. Getting rid of the 60-day period will eliminate this trend, which Mason said is ""a particular problem"" in Alberta. Instead, all carriers will be obligated to prove their safety compliance before operating. The Canadian Trucking Association released a statement, following the announcement, applauding Alberta's proposed safety changes as making a good step toward eliminating the so-called chameleon operators and improving driver training.  President Stephen Laskowski said most operators ""embrace a culture of compliance by far exceeding minimal safety requirements"" but called for Canada-wide standards. The association said the alleged actions of the truck driver involved in the Humboldt crash ""should not be treated in isolation"" but instead be a catalyst for improvements to the industry. Anyone wishing to provide feedback on the proposed changes can fill out an online survey on the government's website before July 27.

520,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:29:52.848Z,Water taxi driver refuses to take reporters to Harry and Meghan's suspected B.C. home,"Miles Arsenault could have used the business. But when a Japanese television company tried to book his water taxi to visit a waterfront property believed to be Prince Harry and Meghan's new residence, Arsenault says he knew he had to decline the offer. ""It's invasion of privacy,"" Arsenault told As It Happens host Carol Off.  Arsenault is new to the water taxi business. It was only six months ago that the retired photographer opened Bay to Bay Charters in North Saanich, B.C. But business is booming in the Vancouver Island community with rumours that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are moving there as they step back from their roles in the royal family. At first, Arsenault says the television company didn't mention anything about Harry and Meghan. But when they told him where they wanted to go, he says he was suspicious. ""I didn't know at that time that it was Meghan and Harry's private residence. But I asked them if this was involving them and they admitted that it was,"" Arsenault said. ""At that point, I said, 'You're going to have to hire yourself another water taxi company.'"" Arsenault estimates the trip would have taken at least two hours and probably earned him about $300. But just knowing that he respected the royals' wish for privacy was far more valuable to him. ""It wasn't going to make or break the bank,"" Arsenault said. ""I don't want peeping Toms. If I'm sitting out on my deck, I don't want it in my life."" As a former photographer, Arsenault says he understands the temptation to try and cash-in on the royal craze. But ultimately, he doesn't want to contribute to something that Harry and Meghan are trying to escape. ""I know what it is to get the shot — the money shot,"" Arsenault said. ""Reporters, photographers, videographers — they need to make a living. But they're not going to make it on my boat."" With 25 years behind the lens, Arsenault adds that getting a decent shot of the property would be difficult to do from the choppy water. ""Probably not much of a shot in my mind,"" Arsenault said. ""I know what it takes to get a shot and that's probably the most difficult platform you can work from."" But not everyone has been so respectful. Arsenault says he has already had to turn away other offers from people keen to visit the property. ""I know that other water taxi operators are servicing the needs,"" Arsenault said. ""If that $300 turns your crank — go for it. I'm not going to lose any sleep over what they are doing."" Candid images of Meghan walking with her son, eight-month-old Archie, in a Vancouver Island park have already surfaced in some tabloids. But Arsenault says it still pales in comparison to the relentless paparazzi the couple had to deal with in Britain. ""If they were on the other side of the pond, there would have been a thousand of them in the bushes,"" Aresnault said. ""I think it's still much better than where they are from."" For the most part, Arsenault says the community is actually excited and ready to welcome the Duke and Duchess. ""They hope to rub elbows with them in the line in the grocery store,"" Arsenault said. ""They just wish them nothing but the best in their new lives."" Written by John McGill.

The Public Utilities Board ordered the Crown corporation last year to create an ""On Reserve First Nations"" customer class. It had to freeze rates on reserves while implementing a general rate increase of 3.6 per cent elsewhere. Manitoba Hydro has said the board exceeded its authority and it must provide the same rates to customers throughout the province. The Manitoba Court of Appeal says in a recent decision that Manitoba Hydro has an arguable case and will hear the appeal. Manitoba Hydro says it can't comment on the matter as it's before the courts. A date for the hearing has not been set. The board said the special rate was needed to deal with what it calls energy poverty. When it was announced, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said the rate was recognition of the hardship faced by people who live on reserves.

The 15-year old, who hails from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, shared her dismay at their lack of attention toward the issue while on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Peltier has spent her last eight years putting pressure on politicians to take climate change more seriously, while advocating for clean drinking water in Indigenous communities and serving as the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario. She has urged the United Nations General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet and confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations. While sharing the stage in Davos with fellow teen activists Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Natasha Mwansa from Zambia and Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, she heaped more pressure on politicians back home. ""It is almost like they don't believe climate change is real,"" she said. ""Climate change is a real thing and they are not realizing that."" Her remarks come amid warnings that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and as youth like Peltier are increasingly calling for the globe to band together and address climate change. Peltier said she has received some support from Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Mike Mantha and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, but has found that many of their counterparts are putting their attention elsewhere. ""They are all focused on just money and we need to be more focused on the actual things going on,"" she said. She also revealed that her age plays a role in how seriously she's being taken. ""I personally don't feel that heard from politicians....When it comes to federal government it is really hard to get their attention and be heard by them,"" she said.

It was tabled by Brian Masse, the NDP MP for Windsor West.  ""Tonight organized crime is celebrating and popping a cork,"" Masse told CBC News. ""And the Americans are laughing straight at us."" Masse said he's disappointed by the decision, claiming single-game sports betting will grow in Canada alongside organized crime. He said the profits from legal gambling would have generated revenue for the federal government. Instead, that money — estimated to be at least $10 billion a year — will be lost to organized crime and another $4 billion will be lost to offshore betting, he said. The Liberal government voted against the bill. It was an about face for the party who supported a similar bill tabled about five years ago.  Masse said he did not receive specific or ""logical"" reasons from those who voted against his bill. He said the federal Liberals aren't offering support for any private member's bills at the moment. Now that the bill has been defeated, Masse isn't able to re-introduce it.

526,Ramona Pringle,2019-04-25T18:17:20.182Z,'It's time for us to watch them': App lets you spy on Alexa and the rest of your smart devices,"It's no secret that our increasingly ""smart"" houses have become a rich source of data for companies. We know — in a general sense, anyway — that we are sacrificing some privacy for the sake of convenience. Beyond just tablets and mobile devices, many of us have televisions we can talk to, and security cameras and even coffee makers that connect to our phone, not to mention home assistants like the Amazon Echo or Google Home, which are standing by to answer every random question that pops in our head. According to Cisco Research, within the next few years there will be more than a dozen networked devices and connections per person in North America. By design, these devices are always on, and always transmitting data. However, what most of us don't know, is exactly what kind of information all these networked appliances are gathering and who has access to it. Now, researchers at Princeton University have designed a tool to help you figure out what all the smart devices in your home are really up to. As they say on their website: ""Our smart devices are watching us. It's time for us to watch them."" The rationale behind the application, called the Princeton IoT Inspector, is that consumers should know where all the information being collected within their smart houses is being transmitted. While users may understand that the trade-off in using these convenient devices is companies have access to the data they generate, they may not be fully aware of just how many different companies are linked to a single device. ""Do you have any idea what these ... devices are doing?"" the researchers wrote. ""Who are they talking to? What are they sending?"" For instance, if you're live-streaming a show on a Roku TV app, the channel you're watching could be communicating with a dozen different servers in the background, the researchers say. The app is connecting to advertisers and tracking services, all of whom have a financial incentive to monitor who is watching what, when and for how long. The Princeton IoT Inspector uses a technique known as ARP spoofing — which, it is worth noting, is usually used by bad actors trying to redirect traffic from a particular IP address so that they can gain access to it. Once the app is downloaded onto your computer (it's currently only available for macOS), the software monitors network activities of all of the smart appliances connected to your network. It shows what data each device collects, who the device contacts online, how much data is exchanged and how often. The IoT Inspector reveals just how active these devices are — even when we're not using them. An Amazon Echo, for example, home to the digital assistant known as Alexa, maintains its network connection even if it has not detected the wake word and the microphone is turned off. According to Amazon, there are several practical reasons for this, including routine maintenance activities, such as confirming the internet connection, downloading software updates and keeping accurate time. In practice, this means the home assistant is checking in with Amazon servers — as well as web-hosting services, and apps the user is subscribed to such as Spotify or Apple Music — every few minutes. ""The smart home assistants are increasingly integrating with additional services and it's going to be critical that they help ensure any partners are operating with confidentiality,"" said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive officer of the Future of Privacy Forum, a Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group focused on data privacy issues. The amount of data that is transmitted from an Echo, for example, and the number of destinations it is shared with, isn't information Amazon makes readily available. While the terms of service do refer to third parties, and how information may be shared with those parties in order to perform certain tasks, Amazon provides no mechanism by which users can track what information is transmitted and where. Although, to its credit, Alexa does respond to privacy questions, ""although at a fairly general level,"" Polonetsky said. ""Alexa, are you spying on me?"" gets a serious response. When I asked the question, Alexa answered, ""No I am not spying on you. I value your privacy."" If that answer isn't entirely reassuring, some recent news stories about what smart devices do with our personal data probably won't help either. For instance, Amazon employs thousands of people around the world to help improve the human speech comprehension of Alexa. As part of their job, those individuals receive transcripts of real conversations people have with their device. It was also recently reported that the video feeds from Ring security cameras are accessible to certain Amazon employees who don't necessarily need access to those feeds to do their jobs.  Such stories, combined with the Princeton IoT Inspector's findings, might make some users wary. After all, our homes are theoretically the final frontier of private space. Or, at least they used to be.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/pringle-smart-home-privacy-1.5109347,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/privacy-smart-speakers-google-amazon-smart-devices-1.4951026 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ces-trade-show-1.4968256 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/can-you-trust-your-home-smart-speaker-1.4955406 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/alexa-learns-quebec-french-1.5078881,N/A

Last week, a pipe burst on the upper floor of the College Street shelter while no one was there. ""It ended up leaking for a while and it caused a lot of water damage, so we won't be back in this season,"" said Rebecca Whitzman, co-ordinator for the Out of the Cold Emergency Winter Shelter. The shelter moved to the Needham Community Centre gym for two nights on the weekend and is now in the Brunswick Street Mission for one week. The shelter is serving 15 guests per night and is overcapacity, but Whitzman said no one is being turned away. The shelter's insurance company is assessing the damage and Whitzman said it would likely take months to make repairs. The space may have to be gutted and rebuilt. For the last 10 years, the shelter operated in the basement of St. Matthew's United Church in downtown Halifax. Moving to the new location was a big change. The College Street location has bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen where guests can gather and talk while staff cook meals. ""We were just commenting on how beautiful the space was, how cozy it was,"" said Jeff Karabanow, one of the shelter's founders. ""The guests were really enjoying the space. It was a very different vibe than the shelter in the past."" Karabanow said the shelter can't stay long at the Brunswick Street Mission and is exploring where to go next. One church in Spryfield and one church in Fairview have said they are open to the idea, but Karabanow said no final decisions have been made. ""We're just figuring out the transportation issue and seeing if we could get the funds to support folks coming back and forth,"" he said. Karabanow said staff are exploring with the province and the city to see if a downtown location close to their regular clients is available, but he's doubtful one can be found on short notice.

528,Anonymous,2020-01-19T23:24:52.864Z,"B.C. forest industry grasps for hope amid seven month strike, shutdowns, changes","The crisis facing British Columbia's forest industry is intensifying as markets decline, mills shut and a strike involving 3,000 forestry workers enters its seventh month.  The multiple threats are deeper than the global meltdown of 2008 and may rival the damage wrought by B.C.'s 1980s recession, setting off massive industry restructuring, says an insider who is hearing from many people on the brink of financial collapse. ""There's a whole bunch of things swirling around that's causing a whole world of hurt for people working in this industry,'' said David Elstone, executive director for the B.C. Truck Loggers Association. ""Many people are saying this is worse than 2008. Back in 2008, the industry was in rough shape but so was the rest of the world in tough shape with the global financial crisis.''  Other factors hitting B.C.'s forest industry now include low timber prices, less demand from Asian markets, U.S. tariffs, high cost structures, government fees or stumpage rates, timber supply shortages, mill closures in B.C.'s Interior and the strike on Vancouver Island, he said. ""Time will hopefully end the strike,'' said Elstone. ""Time will hopefully help us recover markets.'' Late last year, Finance Ministry budget numbers revealed forest revenues were down 11 per cent and projected harvest volumes of 46 million cubic metres were the lowest in years.  Among the mill closures was Mosaic Forest Management on Vancouver Island, which announced an early winter shutdown of timber harvesting operations, putting 2,000 people out of work indefinitely.  About 175 workers at a mill owned by Tolko Industries in Kelowna lost their jobs with the operation's permanent closure on Jan. 8. ""It goes well beyond the 3,000 workers being affected,'' he said. ""My membership, the contractors, employ the majority of the workers. It goes to the tire shops, the dealerships, the grocery stores.'' Premier John Horgan spoke at the convention Thursday, saying the government will make $5 million available for loans to help contractors in danger of losing their equipment due to the strike.  He said he was aware many of the contractors have not been able to work since last July when the strike between Western Forest Products and members of the United Steelworkers union (USW) started.  Horgan mentioned the challenges facing B.C.'s forest industry, including U.S. duties on B.C. softwood exports, mill closures in the Interior, two consecutive wildfire seasons and ongoing structural changes in the industry. But he said the strike remains deeply concerning. ""The elephant in the room is abundantly clear to everyone here,'' said Horgan. ""A labour disruption of seven months is unprecedented in B.C. history. If you haven't made a dollar since July, there's not much I can say to you that's going to give you comfort other than we are indeed in this together.''  Horgan said he has contacted both the company and the union and firmly suggested they negotiate a settlement. He said he expected some movement next week but did not elaborate. ""Western is doing everything we can to reach a mutually beneficial settlement with the USW,'' said the statement. ""We continue to take our lead from mediators, Vince Ready and Amanda Rogers, and we are awaiting word on next steps.'' Elstone said the Truck Loggers Association appreciated Horgan's appearance at the convention. ""By being there he did demonstrate he is concerned himself,'' said Elstone. ""He did say what's been going on with the length of the strike is unacceptable. I will give the premier credit for showing some strong emotion and trying to reach out and show some empathy for people who are suffering right now with their livelihoods in question with the strike and the forest industry crisis in general.'' ""They're frustrated. They're angry,'' he said. ""They want to be working and they aren't working. They're financially stressed. It was probably the most sombre truck loggers convention I've attended in all the years I've been going to them.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-forest-industry-grasps-for-hope-amid-seven-month-strike-shutdowns-changes-1.5432601,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sechelt-residents-angered-by-logging-activity-on-neighbouring-property-1.5430029 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/horgan-loans-millions-forestry-contractors-1.5430812 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mill-castlegar-wood-mass-timber-ubc-1.5400921,N/A
529,Anonymous,2020-01-21T23:53:32.293Z,Trump impeachment: Who will be making the case for and against the U.S. president in the Senate trial,"As the Senate impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump begins in earnest this week, those arguing for and against his removal from office are gearing up for a contentious battle. Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid approved by Congress as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress in the ensuing probe. Seven House impeachment managers will make their case as to why the president should be ousted. Trump, meanwhile, will be defended by several high-profile lawyers. Republican and Democratic senators will sit and listen to each side, acting as jurors. The presidential impeachment trial — only the third in U.S. history — will be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who has little actual power over the proceedings. Impeachment trial begins with clashes over rules and evidence Here are the key figures whose actions will help determine whether the 45th president of the United States will be removed from office: These seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives were chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make the case against Trump, making them de facto prosecutors: A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is chair of the House intelligence committee and the lead  impeachment manager. For many, he has become a familiar face of the proceedings, leading the investigation into the allegations against the president. He presided over the House impeachment hearings in the lead-up to the Senate trial, earning the scorn of Trump — and a nickname: ""Shifty Schiff."" Nadler is chair of the House judiciary committee, which drafted the two articles of impeachment against Trump. Nadler was also a member of the judiciary committee during president Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998. Nadler was an earlier supporter of a Trump impeachment, declaring last August that his panel would hold impeachment hearings related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. A member of the House judiciary committee, Jeffries is also House Democratic caucus chairman. The former litigator is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, and is seen as someone who could eventually replace Nancy Pelosi A former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan who also worked as a lawyer, Crow is a freshman member of Congress. He is the only manager who is not a member of either the judiciary or intelligence committees, but, as the New York Times noted, is considered a leading voice on national security. A former Houston judge and newly elected congresswoman, Garcia became one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in U.S. Congress. She has also worked as a social worker, legal aid lawyer and as a city controller for Houston. She serves on the House judiciary committee. A judiciary committee member, Lofgren, who has been in Congress for almost 25 years, is the only manager who was involved in the two other presidential impeachment proceedings, against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Specifically, she worked on the congressional staff investigation of Nixon's impeachment. (Nixon resigned before he was impeached). Demings is a member of both the judiciary and intelligence committees, but is the only manager without a law degree. However, she does have law enforcement experience. She worked for the Orlando Police Department for 27 years, becoming the force's first female police chief in 2007. Trump's lawyers will present their case for the president and will be allowed to cross-examine the impeachment managers, along with any witnesses. Cipollone is the current White House counsel, who advises the president on all legal matters. He leads Trump's defence team but has spent most of his career in commercial litigation and doesn't have extensive experience with trials. But he has worked on numerous high-profile cases, including the lawsuit against credit-reporting company Equifax after a massive data breach. The personal lawyer to Trump, Sekulow also represented the president during the Mueller investigation. Sekulow hosts a radio talk show and is chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a non-profit that advocates for religious freedoms. A former prosecutor and independent counsel, Starr's 445-page report formed the basis for the House impeachment of Clinton in late 1998. The former appeals court judge had been appointed to investigate the Clintons in relation to a real estate deal known as the Whitewater controversy, among other matters, but his probe widened to include Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Harvard law professor has been part of the legal team for a number of high-profile defendants, including O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow, Jeffrey Epstein and Mike Tyson. A self-described Democrat, Dershowitz nevertheless says he doesn't believe the actions of the president necessitate his removal from office. The former federal prosecutor succeeded Starr as independent counsel during the investigation of Clinton. But Ray declined to prosecute Clinton in connection with perjury and obstruction charges. The former attorney general of Florida and a longtime Trump supporter, Bondi joined the White House communications team late last year on a temporary basis to help shape the administration's defence strategy around the House impeachment investigation.  The former federal attorney has handled organized crime and racketeering cases, including the nine-month trial and conviction of the underboss of the New England Mafia. Raskin and her husband, Martin, were both part of Trump's legal team during the Mueller investigation. Herschmann is a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, a law firm that has represented Trump in numerous cases over the last 15 years. He's also a former assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The U.S. Constitution mandates that a Senate presidential impeachment trial be presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, a position currently held by Roberts. Appointed to the high court by George W. Bush in 2005, Roberts's role in the Senate trial is mostly ceremonial, as he has limited powers over the proceedings. He won't be ruling on objections, but he does have authority to hold someone in contempt, if, for example, a witness refuses to testify. He can rule on the relevance of material, but the Senate majority can overrule him.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966,[],N/A

It's offering a free, four-week workplace training program for women interested in entry-level positions. The LNG Canada Project will cover the costs of tuition, safety gear and learning materials for all participants, as well as airfare to and from the training session in Kitimat and accommodation for participants coming in from other areas. ""Women in British Columbia currently represent just under 5 per cent of a typical construction workforce, despite comprising 50 per cent of the working population,"" said Andy Calitz, CEO of LNG Canada.

531,Heidi Atter,2020-01-22T18:07:03.741Z,'People get quite upset': Sask. photographer hopes award-winning image of trapped sea turtle inspires change,"A Saskatchewan man's photograph of a turtle ensnared in a fishing line has captured international recognition and a prestigious photography prize.  Now he's hoping fellow Canadians will take note.  Shane Gross was born and raised in Regina and now lives in the Bahamas, where he works as a dive instructor.  In 2017, Gross took a photograph of a bleak situation, where a long-dead sea turtle was caught in a fishing line.  The image won first place in the conservation category of the 2019 International Ocean Art Underwater Photo Competition. Photographers from 78 countries entered images and over $85,000 in sponsor prizes have been awarded.  ""It was a beautiful day out on the ocean. We were diving one of our normal spots we call 'sea garden,'"" Gross said.  His girlfriend was leading a dive tour when they came across the turtle. She returned to the boat and was very emotional at the site, he said.  ""There were tears in her eyes,"" he said. ""She started telling me about this poor turtle that was entangled in the fishing line, which was also entangled in the coral, and turtles need to breathe air. So the turtle was so entangled that it couldn't reach the surface to breathe. And essentially the turtle drowned."" Gross decided that since there was nothing they could do for the turtle, they could remove the line and try to raise awareness.  Gross dived to the spot, removed the line to prevent others from getting caught and snapped a photograph. ""This type of thing happens in the ocean every day. We just normally don't get to see it. I mean, nobody wants to see that. But we have to because that's the truth,"" he said.  This was the eighth time Gross has entered the photography competition but it was the first year it had a conservation category.  ""This seemed like a very fitting image,"" he said. ""A category dedicated to images that show humans' impact on the oceans.""  Competition judge Scott Gietler, publisher of Underwater Photographer Guide, said in a news release that the winning images in the conservation category ""produce powerful emotion, and will influence a new generation of ocean conservation."" People who see the image have had emotional reactions, Gross said.  ""People get quite upset when they see it,"" he said. ""Which I think is a good thing because this is our fault."" Part of the image's ""emotional impact"" is it appears that the turtle's eyes have been eaten by a scavenger, Gross said. ""That dead stare right into the camera seems to strike people in a very emotional way."" People don't respond to statistics, they respond to individuals, Gross said.  ""I hope that this turtle becomes kind of a representative for the oceans as a whole,"" he said.  Climate change, plastics, over-fishing and invasive species are all altering ocean life, Gross said. He hopes his image will inspire people to rethink their own consumption habits and make some changes. ""[It's] an individual turtle that is a victim and died in a horrible way because of our negligence. I hope that it can inspire a few people to be better toward the planet,"" he said.  There's plastic everywhere in the ocean, even far from shore, Gross said. Near his home on Harbour Island in the Bahamas there is a beach he walks every day, he said.  ""[There are] flip flops and other plastic items washing up on the beach every single day. And there are people, their whole job is just cleaning that beach,"" he said. ""So tourists don't have to look at it."" ""You go to a beach that isn't being cleaned every day and it's just, you can barely see the sand because there's so much plastic in it,"" he said.  ""I'm still hopeful because there is still a lot of beauty,"" Gross said.  He said he sees live turtles, sharks, stingrays, octopuses and more, but there are fewer animals when compared to eight years ago when Gross first moved there.  Corporations and businesses will need to step up to create change, he said, and individual consumers can hold them accountable for it.  ""There's a lot of problems — but there is still hope,"" he said. ""I have to believe in hope."" See more of Shane Gross's work on Instagram.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-sea-turtle-photographer-award-image-1.5435786,[],N/A
532,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-23T00:14:19.891Z,"Quebec to expand assisted death to mentally ill, but few expected to qualify","Quebec plans to expand medical aid in dying to include people with severe, incurable mental illness, the province's health minister says, with guidelines to be drawn up by the provincial college of physicians. Health Minister Danielle McCann told a news conference Tuesday that people with mental health issues who aren't responding to treatment would be able to ask for the procedure — but she stressed such cases would be exceptional. The college of physicians also said it expects that few people would be affected. ""We don't expect many of these patients will qualify, because one of the other criteria that remains is to suffer from a disease that is not curable, which is not necessarily the case of all mental health situations,'' said Dr. Yves Robert, the college's secretary. ""It will really be an individual, case-by-case decision that will be done.'' On Tuesday, the Quebec government announced it would comply with a court ruling last year striking down part of its medical aid in dying legislation — specifically the requirement that someone seeking medically assisted death be ""at the end of life.'' The same Quebec Superior Court judgment invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the federal Criminal Code. To comply with the provincial law, prospective recipients would still have to be 18 years old or older, have the mental capacity to make their own decisions about medical care, suffer from a serious and incurable illness and be in constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain that can't be relieved. Speaking to reporters, McCann confirmed that severely mentally ill patients could qualify. ""The guide will be modified to include safeguards, elements that allow (for) medical aid in dying for people who have severe mental disorders and who are resistant to any treatment,'' McCann said. She spoke of possible additional criteria for the mentally ill — a psychiatrist would need to be consulted — and said the delay before medical aid in dying is given would be longer. The proposed changes follow Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin's ruling in September in a case brought by two Quebec residents who suffered from incurable degenerative diseases but did not meet the criteria for assisted death. The judge declared unconstitutional the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and the section of the Quebec law stating people must ""be at the end of life.'' The federal government has said it accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly, launching public consultations on how to implement the necessary changes. Those consultations will look at issues including whether those suffering from mental illness and ""mature minors'' should be eligible, as well as whether those who fear losing mental capacity and being unable to provide consent should be allowed to make advance requests for medical assistance in dying. A parliamentary review of the law is to begin this summer. Critics have said that assisted death for those whose only condition is mental illness raises complex moral and ethical issues. Some have argued there's a lack of evidence that mental illness is an incurable condition, and others have said more should be invested into treatment and resources for those suffering from mental illness. Robert said that in jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands that brought in euthanasia legislation before Canada, mental health cases have been a minority of overall cases. The college is just beginning its reflection on the mental health matter and will take time to consult groups and determine who would qualify. ""We are approaching a no-man's land, where nobody else was before, so to be prudent and to take the time to have a good reflection and to do one step at a time and do it in a spirit of serenity and wisdom is probably the best way to handle and treat these very delicate and complicated issues,'' Robert said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-to-expand-assisted-death-to-mentally-ill-but-few-expected-to-qualify-1.5437030,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,N/A
533,Anonymous,2020-01-14T12:00:00.272Z,Environment committee recommends plan requiring Saskatoon businesses to recycle,"Saskatoon's environment committee is recommending city council approve a plan that would require businesses to begin recycling. The recommendation would amend the waste bylaw to require businesses to have separate recycling containers. Businesses would have a year to comply. Businesses that generate food or yard waste would also need a third bin by 2022. The plan is intended to divert material away from the city landfill and prolong its life.  North Saskatoon Business Association executive director Keith Moen told the committee his organization supports the recommendation. Moen said one of the reasons for the support is that prolonging the life of the landfill will save taxpayers in the long run. ""We want to defer that decision [of a new landfill] as long as we possibly can."" The city says almost a quarter of the materials going to the city landfill are from the Industrial, commercial and institutional (ICI) sector. Katie Burns, special projects manager with the city, told the committee that most ICI stakeholders consulted by the city (62 per cent) wanted to keep the status quo approach of voluntary recycling and organics. Burns said stakeholders were concerned about space, time and the increased costs of mandatory recycling. She said the second choice for stakeholders is the recommendation going to council. Other options presented to councillors included follow-ups from city environmental officers — rather than relying solely on complaints — or ordering all businesses to submit a waste diversion plan to the city. Moen said the recommended option was easily the most amenable to businesses, saying it has, ""the minimal amount of regulatory regime and the minimal amount of cost associated with it."" Mayor Charlie Clark said knowing the NSBA is supporting the recommendation, ""gives me some hope that we can do this without a lot of consternation."" Clark said he was happy to hear that businesses felt that they had been heard during the consultation process. Burns said the recommended plan was easiest to understand, most straightforward to implement and was designed to have some flexibility in controlling costs. ""We also found it was the easiest for administration to develop and implement and therefore took the lowest number of resources."" The city's says the plan will raise the civic garbage diversion rate from 22 per cent to 27 per cent. Similar programs have been adopted in other cities like Calgary and Halifax. It the plan is approved, the city would have education blitzes to help businesses comply with the proposed bylaw amendments. The cost of implementing the plan is estimated to cost between $790,000 to $910,000. And the estimated annual cost of the program is between $220,000 to $340,000 The recommendations will be heard at the next council meeting on Jan. 27.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/garbage-landfill-recycling-saskatoon-city-council-business-1.5425300,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-business-recycling-organics-1.5419454 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-city-council-1.5381585 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/city-council-organics-pickup-1.5375361,N/A

Despite the pledge of a pre-Christmas rollout for ride-hailing in B.C., most applicants — including Uber and Lyft — have yet to receive approval from the Passenger Transportation Board (PTB). Only one company has been approved so far, and it doesn't operate in any of B.C.'s most populous cities. The company operates out of Whistler and Tofino. ""The government led us to believe this would happen before Christmas,"" said Ian Tostenson with RideSharing Now, a coalition advocating for increased choice and free-market competition for ridesharing in the province. ""But I don't think that's going to happen."" If licences aren't handed out in the next few days, Premier John Horgan risks again missing his own deadline. He originally promised to bring ride-hailing to B.C. by the end of 2017. The transportation board declined an interview and did not provide any clarity on a timeline.

537,David Thurton ,2020-01-12T09:00:00.138Z,Green leadership candidate wants the vote opened to all Canadians ,"A candidate running to become Canada's next federal Green Party leader said he wants to see the voting opened up to all Canadians. David Merner, one of the first to declare, said he'd like to see a leadership contest that allows all Canadians to vote — not just party members. ""My view is that we should open up the leadership race voting to any Canadian who wants to vote in it,"" Merner said. ""I think we should really make it a national race by allowing all Canadians to vote without having to buy a Green Party membership."" During the 2013 leadership race that elected Justin Trudeau, the Liberals opened up voting to Canadians who didn't hold paid party memberships, weren't affiliated with other parties and pledged support for the Grits. Merner is a former-Liberal-turned-Green candidate for Esquimalt-Saanich-Sooke, and said he would like to see something similar. The Greens have not yet finalized the rules for the leadership race. Those rules, interim party leader Jo-Ann Roberts said, will be made public on Feb. 3. Greens will elect their new leader in Charlottetown, P.E.I. in October. Elizabeth May stepped down from the leadership in November after 13 years on the job. She remains the party's parliamentary leader. In the future, Roberts said, the Green Party might be open to expanding the vote, but it's not likely to do so for the 2020 leadership race.   ""It's not the direction we've been going in,"" Roberts said. ""We believe that there is something to be said in a very grassroots member-driven party that the members should be choosing the leader."" Julie Tremblay-Cloutier, the other officially declared candidate, said she isn't convinced the Greens need to open up voting to non-members. But she and Merner agree the leadership race registration fee — which has not yet been announced — should be as low as possible to attract a diverse array of candidates who might not have deep pockets or fundraising networks. ""I really believe that the more ideas we have, the more that the thinking is elevated. The more, the merrier,"" said Tremblay-Cloutier, who ran for the party in 2019 in Mirabel, Que. ""It should be as low as possible, so as many people as possible can get into the race."" The last time the Greens had a leadership race in 2006, candidates paid a $1,000 entrance fee. The party's provincial cousins, the B.C.Greens, are also looking for a new leader and contenders are expected to pay $16,000 to enter the race. Roberts, interim party leader, said she isn't ready to announce the fee yet but insisted it will be ""accessible and fair."" Aside from the confirmed candidates, two others have told CBC they'll be making up their minds soon: Quebec Green Party Leader Alex Tyrrell and his justice critic Dimitri Lascaris.

538,Anonymous,2019-01-12T18:18:39.724Z,People arrested at Gidimt'en anti-pipeline camp allege inappropriate use of force,"  The agreement reached Thursday between Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs and RCMP over the enforcement of a injunction was spurred by concerns over the Mounties' use of force on people when entering the Gidimt'en camp on Monday.  ""We are adamantly opposed to this proposed project and that will never change, but we are here to ensure the safety of our people,"" said Wet'suwet'en hereditary chief Na'Moks Thursday after the agreement was finalized. Wet'suwet'en members had set up checkpoints on a remote stretch of forest service road and a bridge preventing people working on a pipeline project from accessing their traditional territory, which sits about 300 kilometres west of Prince George, B.C. The Coastal GasLink project is run by TransCanada Corp. and is meant to move natural gas from northeastern B.C. to the coast, where a liquefied natural gas project is scheduled for construction. A court injunction, granted in December, ordered people to stop preventing Coastal GasLink from gaining access to the road and bridge. RCMP began enforcing the injunction on Monday. As part of their enforcement action, RCMP established an exclusion zone, preventing access to the area by the public and media. RCMP have denied they jammed communications, preventing media and public from providing information about the situation at the camp on Monday afternoon.   Molly Wickham, Gidimt'en member and spokesperson for the camp, told CBC the enforcement action RCMP's Aboriginal liaison team had described to them earlier Monday was not what happened that afternoon. ""They painted a picture that was extremely opposite of what happened,"" she said. As at least one helicopter circled overhead, armed RCMP officers, including members of the Tactical and Emergency Response Teams, approached the gate ""in force"" said Wickham.  Some of the people at the checkpoint had locked their arms to the gate. Wickham said RCMP began pulling the gate backwards and the people attached were in danger of being injured. They attached themselves to the gate in a way I can't quite describe -- with their arms locked in to the gate. So as the RCMP came over people there was a lot of concern about their arms being broken among those at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gidimten?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Gidimten</a> camp ""They had no regard. We were pleading to them to stop what they were doing, that if they continued they would break people's arms, that people were in grave danger. And they didn't listen. They didn't care. They just looked right at us as if we weren't saying anything."" She said police were cutting off the barbed wire topping the gate and ""it was flying in peoples' faces. People were trying to cover themselves."" ""They're likely to say people were resisting or being aggressive and we were trying to desperately save those peoples' limbs."" She said police climbed over the gate and began pulling people from the gate and pinning them down, multiple officers for each individual. Watch: RCMP at the Gidimt'en checkpoint barricade She said they used more force with the men. She said she saw one man thrown down from the gate and he appeared to be unconscious.  ""I was screaming for him to answer me. I was screaming for someone to check on him,"" she said. ""He was just laying limp on the snow."" She describes it as ""chaos happening all around."" Listen: Chantelle Bellrichard talks with CBC's Frontburner about the Wet'suwet'en camps She was not injured. She was arrested and moved out of the way, but said she and other women kept challenging the RCMP with words, asking them ""Are you going to continue the violence against Indigenous women on their own territories?"" Wickham said she feels they got through to some of the officers as they wouldn't look them in the eye. ""They knew they were in the wrong,"" she said.  Rebecca Moore, a Mi'kmaw Indigenous rights advocate and a member of Pictou Landing First Nation in Nova Scotia, was also among those arrested at the gate. ""They pushed me from the gate down to the ground and I almost fell off of the bridge into the river,"" she said. ""Thankfully somebody grabbed me and picked me up because there was a lot of people around. I thought that I was either going to get stomped or that I was going to fall into the creek.""  Moore said she recalls seeing a handcuffed man lying on the ground who appeared to be unconscious, more than one person with arm injuries, and three officers restraining a man on the ground, pushing his face into the snow. ""We were not inflicting violence. We were being very peaceful and they were coming at us,"" she said. ""They were pushing us all around."" Moore said officers told her she was being arrested because she was breaking ""Canadian law,"" and that in response, she told them they were breaking Wet'suwet'en law. Both Wickham and Moore say they feel RCMP members used excessive force. In a statement to CBC, an RCMP spokesperson said the 14 individuals were arrested and processed through ""standard protocols,"" and that under the law RCMP may use force reasonable to the circumstances to implement the court's order. ""The situation was challenging for our members and despite their best efforts to resolve the situation peacefully, arrests did take place,"" the statement reads. ""One of those arrested did complain of a minor injury and was examined by EHS and was returned to the custody of the RCMP. One of our officers also had a minor injury after being hit with a stick."" In the statement, the RCMP said the officers' engagement of the camp was documented through numerous video sources and that some of the video content that can be found on social media ""clearly opposes"" allegations.  Following RCMP enforcement of the injunction at the Gidimt'en camp Monday, the hereditary chiefs were concerned about the safety of those staying at the Unistot'en camp and healing centre, where there was another fortified checkpoint. ""That will never happen to our people again,"" Na'Moks said of Monday's enforcement actions at the Gidimt'en checkpoint. After three days of talks with the RCMP, the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs reached an agreement over the enforcement of the injunction. They have agreed to allow the company access to do pre-construction work as specified in the interim injunction for the time being.

This suggests that prehistoric humans transported the deer across land and sea to colonize the islands.  Once released and established, the deer would have been harvested for food, skin and especially antler and bone, which were valuable materials for making tools.

Alianait Arts Festival flew the Toronto-based folk singer to Iqaluit and Igloolik as part of a larger effort to bring big-name musicians up north, where travel expenses often hold local talent back.  The festival's executive director, Heather Daley, says Nunavut's music scene is growing and invaded the Juno Awards this year with nominations, including The Jerry Cans for breakthrough group of the year.   Daley says it's taken the festival providing a stage, lighting and bringing in musicians from around the world that bring up the level of professionalism to help prepare those artists for the Junos.  The problem is there still aren't many opportunities for young, emerging Inuit artists to play in front of large crowds or collaborate from talent elsewhere, said Daley. ""It's about growing the Nunavut artists,"" said Daley. ""I don't think there's anywhere in Canada that it's harder for them to get known. You have to fly everywhere."" Rutledge says it's not even affordable for artists like himself to tour Canada's North. This is the first time he's performed in Nunavut, and he couldn't believe the $3,000 price tag for his airfare alone.  Within 24 hours of getting off the plane, Rutledge was taken snowmobiling, hunting and tasted muktuk – frozen whale skin and blubber. Then, he took the stage this past Saturday at Inuksuk High School in Iqaluit.  ""I feel like I've had a bit of a red carpet rolled out for me,"" said Rutledge. ""It's just such a wonderful place. I'm as interested in learning about the music up here as I am in playing my music for people up here."" The world is listening: first Nunavut Music Week festival underway in Iqaluit ""I feel a little lucky that I can bring my guitar and even though I may not speak the language, we can still sing a song together and learn from each other."" His performance was a chance to bring Rutledge's rootsy sound to a Northern audience, and for Inuit singer-songwriter Jerry Laisa, who opened for Rutledge, to sing on the same stage. Laisa hopes the show helped shine a light on his songs, all sung in Inuktitut. ""I'm hoping I'll get to play more,"" said Laisa. ""I want to inspire people someday. I want to be a good leader."" At an intimate songwriting circle the next day, local solo act Francisca Mandeya worked on her new song with Rutledge. He helped the Zimbabwe-born musician with chords to play on her mbria, an African instrument sometimes called a thumb piano. Mandeya has been living in Iqaluit for the past four years, for some of that time working on suicide prevention. She calls her music ""healing,"" and hopes it can help the community cope with socioeconomic problems. It's been challenging trying to get her music recorded, she said, because the focus right now for grants in the territory is on Inuktitut-speaking performers. This opportunity to play with a well-known musician gives her hope. ""I want to do better,"" said Mandeya. ""It feels good to have that opportunity to have people at your doorstep that have that talent. And makes it possible for people to dream, and even dream bigger than what we would normally."" Next, Rutledge is off to Igloolik, to perform and meet with the music community that's working to revive the Rockin Walrus Arts Festival after it went into debt several years ago.  Daley is helping organize the event and hopes to feature Indigenous artists from different parts of Canada, Greenland, Australia and New Zealand.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/justin-rutledge-nunavut-performance-songwriter-circle-1.4651314,[],N/A

They are launching a constitutional challenge for courts to determine whether the changes impede on human rights. The new rules include a $5,500 cap on pain and suffering payouts. Small settlement cases are being moved out of court and will now be heard by the Civil Resolutions Tribunal. In a statement, the association claims the new injury cap has the potential to discriminate against people with brain and psychiatric injuries by treating them differently. They say due to the nature of those injuries, individuals often cannot recognize the extent of their needs and communicate them. ""I felt compelled to speak out as I do not believe this government has clearly understood or described the impacts of this legislation on the citizens of B.C.,"" former B.C. attorney general and premier Ujjal Dosanjh said in the statement.

The movie The Grand Seduction tells the tale of residents of a small Newfoundland town who try to convince a visiting doctor to live there full-time. Now that story is being turned into a musical called Tell Tale Harbour by the Confederation Centre and artistic director Adam Brazier. Brazier said he's been developing the idea since 2016, but he soon realized he needed a songwriter from Atlantic Canada to write the songs for the show — so he reached out to Doyle. ""I really wanted this to be a celebration of Atlantic Canada. So finding an Atlantic Canadian voice … who not only has the tonality but understands the traditions and vernacular of Atlantic Canada … who better?"" Brazier said. Doyle said he was ""delighted"" to get Brazier's call. ""I was stoked,"" he said. Doyle said the ""big charm"" that made him want to be part of the project was the fact he has never done work like this before. ""It's a different challenge,"" he said Doyle said the best advice he received when it comes to writing music to a script is ""it's great to know what it can't be."" ""In this song we need to move the character from the bathroom out to the drug store and back to the hockey rink. OK, well that's what the song is going to be about then. It's limited, but it's also focused,"" he said. ""I'm learning as I go."" Doyle said because he doesn't come from the musical theater world, he hopes what he adds will be ""a breath of fresh air."" ""I just love getting in a room with people who have talents and skills I don't have and hoping I can contribute and that is super fun,"" Doyle said. Brazier said Doyle's creative method is unique and entertaining. ""He putters and he hums and he haws and he sings some gibberish at himself for a while and about six minutes later he goes 'wait, wait, wait, I think got it,'"" said Brazier. The musical is only in the beginning stages and another draft will be done by the end of the month. ""We're just going to keep pounding away at it, but it's our hope we can get this up on the stage sometime in the future,"" said Brazier. ""We're incredibly excited to be developing it.""

544,Jorge Barrera,2019-11-04T09:00:00.767Z,Ottawa in talks to settle First Nations child welfare class action lawsuit,"Ottawa says it has started talks to settle a $6 billion proposed class action lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of First Nations children affected by the on-reserve child welfare system. The proposed class action was filed in March with the Federal Court on behalf of First Nations children affected by on-reserve child welfare services between April 1, 1991, and March 1, 2019. The lawsuit is separate from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Ruling that ordered Ottawa to compensate First Nations children affected by the on-reserve child welfare system since Jan. 1, 2006. Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) said in a statement Friday that settlement talks were in the preliminary stages. ""We are at the early stages of the certification process and we are involved in exploratory discussions with the parties, which are confidential,"" said the statement from ISC, which is the lead department on the file. David Sterns, a partner with Toronto-based Sotos LLP, one of three law firms bringing forward the lawsuit, confirmed talks have started. ""We are having exploratory settlement discussions,"" he said. ""We are in the very early stage."" Sterns also said that Ottawa has indicated it plans to fight certification of the lawsuit. Sterns said he is now waiting for the federal government to file its legal paperwork outlining its opposition, which is expected in the coming month. ""We are in full litigation mode and we are ready to do battle with the government,"" said Sterns. Contacted by CBC News, ISC did not say whether it plans to contest the certification. A certification hearing is still months away, he said. The statement of claim alleges that Ottawa knew for years about ""severe inadequacies"" in its on-reserve First Nations child welfare funding formulas, policies and practices, but did nothing. The proposed class action lawsuit was amended recently to increase the compensation sought to $6 billion from $3 billion. The proposed class action is also seeking compensation for First Nations children who ""suffered or died"" while waiting for help from services Ottawa was legally required to provide that would be covered by the policy known as Jordan's Principle. According to Jordan's Principle, the needs of a First Nations child should always be placed ahead of jurisdictional disputes over funding for health care and other public services. The amended statement of claim also added a new plaintiff: Jeremy Meawasige from Pictou Landing First Nation in Nova Scotia, as a representative of the Jordan's Principle class. Meawasige was born in 1994 with cerebral palsy, spinal curvature and autism.  His mother, Maurina Beadle, was his primary caregiver until she suffered a stroke in 2010. The Pictou Landing band council stepped in to provide assistance but the funding from Ottawa was not adequate. The band council then applied for more funding, citing Jordan's Principle, but Ottawa refused. The council and Beadle went to the Federal Court, which ruled in 2013 that the federal government would have to pay for Meawasige's services in accordance with Jordan's Principle.  ""While Mr. Meawasige received funding for certain services after the Federal Court's 2013 decision, he has not received some other essential public services and products to this date,"" said the amended statement of claim. The original plaintiff, Xavier Moushoom, is an Algonquin man from the Lac Simon Anishnabe Nation, Que. He was shuffled through 14 foster homes between the ages of nine and 18. Sterns said the tribunal compensation order and the class action lawsuit are two separate issues.  He said receiving compensation from the tribunal order — which is governed by the Human Rights Act — would not prevent anyone from also getting compensation through a settlement of the class action. The federal government applied for a judicial review in October with the Federal Court to quash the tribunal's order, arguing that the human rights body overreached in its compensation decision. Ottawa says in court filings the tribunal's compensation order could cost the government up to $8 billion. While the federal government is fighting to quash the tribunal compensation order, it has signalled it wants a class action-type settlement process to offer compensation to those affected by the on-reserve child welfare system. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was in favour of child welfare compensation. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said in an Oct. 11 recorded conversation with Nipissing First Nation Chief Scott McLeod that Ottawa wants to compensate First Nations children affected by the child welfare system  from 1991 to today — which is essentially the time frame outlined by the proposed class action. ""We want to be at the table as soon as possible and get this thing sorted,"" said Bennett, according to a transcript of the conversation filed in Federal Court as part of the separate litigation around the human rights tribunal ruling. The transcript was attached to an affidavit filed by Cindy Blackstock, who heads the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. The society and the Assembly of First Nations filed a human rights complaint against Ottawa in 2007. Bennett also echoed an argument advanced by federal lawyers in court filings that the tribunal compensation order — which said each apprehended child should receive $40,000 — was unfair. ""They can only just give $40,000 to everybody, but that meant if somebody had been in care for a week, or somebody had been in 10 homes, abused all that time, that person ends up feeling that isn't fair and continues to be harmed in terms of re-traumatized,"" said Bennett, according to the transcript. During the recorded conversation, Bennett also referred to the Sixties Scoop and Indian Day School class action settlements finalized in the Liberal government's previous term.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/challenge-child-welfare-lawsuit-1.5343818,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/lawsuit-first-nations-child-welfare-funding-1.5043795 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/child-welfare-on-reserve-compensation-1.5272667 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/ottawa-children-tribunal-1.5315196 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/human-rights-tribunal-liberal-child-welfare-appeal-1.5308897,N/A
545,Anonymous,2020-01-25T03:49:01.689Z,"Coronavirus death toll climbs to 41, more cases reported in China","LATEST: The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 41, up from 26, as China rushes to build a hospital to deal with the deadly virus that has sickened over 1,300 globally and expands the unprecedented lockdowns of cities during the country's most important holiday. The latest deaths disclosed by the Health Commission of Hubei Province occurred in Wuhan, the province's capital and epicentre of the outbreak. The National Health Commission said Saturday more than 1,287 people in China were infected, bringing the global total to over 1,300. On Lunar New Year, transportation was shut down Saturday in at least 12 cities with a total of about 36 million people. The cities, located in central Hubei province, include Wuhan, where the illness has been concentrated, Ezhou, Huanggang, Chibi, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Huangshi, Xianning and Yichang. ""To address the insufficiency of existing medical resources,"" Wuhan authorities said in a Friday notice, the city is constructing a 1,000-bed hospital modelled after the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing. The facility will be a prefabricated structure, slated for completion Feb. 3. The SARS hospital was built from scratch in 2003 in just six days to treat an outbreak of a similar respiratory virus that had spread from China to more than a dozen countries and killed about 800 people. The hospital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins. In Wuhan, normally bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were eerily quiet on the third day of its lockdown. Masks were mandatory in public, and images from the city showed empty shelves as people stocked up for what could be an extended isolation. Train stations, the airport and subways were closed; police checked incoming vehicles but did not entirely close off roads. WATCH | China sets blistering pace to build new Wuhan hospital: In China, authorities were taking precautions around the country. In the capital, Beijing, major public events were cancelled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of Lunar New Year celebrations. The Forbidden City, a major tourist destination in Beijing, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday. On Friday, authorities said Shanghai Disneyland will be closed from Saturday to help prevent the spread of the virus. Sections of China's Great Wall will also be closed to visitors from Saturday, the Beijing government said.  Beijing city government is urging residents returning from coronavirus outbreak areas to stay at home for 14 days to prevent its spread, the Beijing Daily said Friday. Shanghai government also urged people coming to the city from ""key areas"" to stay at home or under centralized quarantine for two weeks. The country's number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus has risen to 1,287, the National Health Commission said Saturday. The health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died there after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives. Heilongjiang province in the northeast confirmed a death there but did not give details. WATCH | China tightens travel restrictions to prevent spread of virus: Initial symptoms of the virus can mirror those of the cold and flu, including cough, fever, chest tightening and shortness of breath, but can worsen to pneumonia. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections to the city, but scattered cases have occurred beyond the mainland. Malaysia said three people, relatives of a father and son from Wuhan who were earlier diagnosed with the virus in neighbouring Singapore, tested positive on Saturday. Australia confirmed its first case on Saturday, the United States, South Korea and Japan confirmed their second cases Friday and cases have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. France also confirmed its first three cases, Europe's first ones. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada. The World Health Organization (WHO) decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now. The declaration can increase resources to fight a threat but its potential to cause economic damage makes the decision politically fraught. Cases of the virus are likely to continue to rise in China, but it is too soon to evaluate its severity, WHO said Friday. ""The focus is not so much on the [case] numbers, which we know will go up,"" WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva news briefing. ""It's still too early to draw conclusions on how severe the virus is."" The WHO and its network of experts may look at treatments and vaccines against MERS for possible use against coronavirus, he said. The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels. Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. A trickle of passengers at the train station in Wuhan put on a brave face on Friday as they arrived in the epicentre of the outbreak. On one high-speed train carrying a Reuters journalist that stopped in Wuhan station on Friday afternoon, about 10 passengers got off and nobody got on before the train resumed its journey to Changsha. Although it stopped there, Wuhan had been removed from the train's schedule. ""What choice do I have? It's Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,"" said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu. Wuhan's airport is not closed, but nearly all flights have been cancelled. Three international flights arriving on Friday would leave with no passengers, an airport official said. WATCH | Streets of Wuhan eerily quiet amid coronavirus lockdown: China's biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, shut down all services in Wuhan from midday on Friday, adding that service resumption depended on government orders Hugo Guo, a 22-year-old university student who had returned home to Wuhan for the holiday, said the restrictions were not having much of an impact on him, although all his dinner plans with friends and family had been cancelled.

On Saturday, health officials in Ontario confirmed that the man, who is in stable condition at Sunnybrook Hospital, had recently travelled to Wuhan, China and fell ill upon his return. Lab results appear to show he has the coronavirus, which has sickened hundreds of people, mostly in Central China, and resulted in dozens of deaths. The virus has also been detected in several other countries, including the United States, where a Washington state man in his 30s was diagnosed on Tuesday. Ontario's health minister and chief medical officer of health were joined by several other officials during a Saturday news conference, where they presented details of Canada's first case of coronavirus. They said they were confident steps had been taken to prevent its spread and protect the public from the virus. Following the news conference, B.C.

Efforts are also being made to make sure adequate medical supplies are in place.  Health-care workers have been asked to be vigilant and to ask patients with respiratory symptoms to report their travel history. The majority of cases of the new coronavirus worldwide have been linked to people being in Wuhan, China. Dix and Henry are asking B.C. residents who may have been exposed to coronavirus — or who are experiencing symptoms associated with the disease, such as a fever and cough — to call their doctor, local health office, or 811.

Mayor Mayco Noel says ongoing upgrades on Highway 4 are forcing residents to sit in their vehicles for long stretches of time with no way to communicate because there is no cell service in that area. Noel says installing Wi-Fi at both ends of the construction zone could make it less frustrating for locals who rely on the road as the only access route in and out of Ucluelet and Tofino. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for the upgrades near Kennedy Lake, about 12 kilometres northeast of the Ucluelet/Tofino junction on Highway 4. Construction began in 2018 and Noel says it is expected to last for another 12 to 18 months. ""We are just nervous there are going to be continuous, unplanned shutdowns of the highway and we'd like to get some better communication when we are sitting in the lineup for sometimes hours on end,"" said Noel on CBC's All Points West. Noel said his concern is primarily for residents, many of whom are trying to make it to medical appointments or work, as well as contractors commuting from Port Alberni, such as plumbers and electricians, who service the west coast communities. ""We're not talking about 20 minutes of shutdowns here,"" said Noel, adding people are using roadside ditches as toilets while they wait. The mayor said if people were able to connect to the internet in the area they could also check online to see how long the closure is expected to last, information that is often posted on Facebook. He estimates it would cost about $100,000 to pay for the technology necessary to set up Wi-Fi where construction is happening, which is about a 1.5-kilometre stretch.

548,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-27T02:07:04.732Z,"Health officials expect more coronavirus cases, but say risk of outbreak in Canada remains low","Federal health officials expect more cases of the coronavirus, but say the risk of an outbreak in Canada remains low. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said officials at all levels of government are working with hospitals and international partners to prevent and respond to potential infections.  ""We're working actively to limit the spread of the virus,"" Hajdu said at a news conference in Ottawa Sunday morning after the first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus was reported in Toronto. Hospitals have an ""incredibly strong"" system to prevent and control infections, she said. Hajdu said much has been learned from the SARS virus in 2003. Since the first cases of this novel coronavirus were reported in China in December, the federal government has been in close contact with the provincial health authorities and international players to share information in a ""collaborative, responsive"" approach. WATCH: Health Minister Patty Hajdu on the federal response to coronavirus Hajdu said there is considerable misinformation being spread about the virus which ""belies the reality"" that the risk to Canadians remains extremely low. CBC News has reported that misinformation and unverified claims about the virus have been circulating on social media. While the government does not expect a chartered plane is necessary to evacuate Canadians from the Wuhan region where the outbreak began, Hajdu said Global Affairs Canada stands ready to provide support services for any Canadian trying to leave China. CBC News has learned that one Canadian will be on board a flight chartered by Washington to fly diplomats and Americans out of Wuhan. A government official said 67 Canadians are registered as being in the affected region, but because registration is voluntary, the figure does not give a complete picture of Canadians in Hubei or in China. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said despite the fact the number of cases in China is increasing, the export to other countries remains low and the risk remains low in Canada. Tam said the reported case Saturday was ""not unexpected."" Canada confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto on Saturday after receiving lab results. The patient, a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to Wuhan, China, is isolated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and is now in stable condition. ""The health system is on alert to detect potential cases and to respond promptly when they are confirmed,"" Tam said. ""It shows that our systems are working."" The case is ""presumptive"" until it is formally confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Tam said she expects the formal results of the test to confirm the virus within 24 hours. She said the man experienced symptoms on board China Southern Airlines Flight CZ311, but he apparently did not report those symptoms. Health officials are now tracing fellow passengers who were seated close to the patient — in a two-metre radius — to determine if others are affected. Family members of the patient are also being closely monitored and in self-isolation. WATCH: Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam on the coronavirus According to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others by air through coughing or sneezing, close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, or by touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands. Coronaviruses are a family of diseases that range from a common cold to more serious diseases such as SARS. The federal health department's website says symptoms of most coronaviruses are usually mild to moderate and can include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and/or fever, as well as a general feeling of being unwell. Looking for a comprehensive plan and full resources from the federal government to contain this novel <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronoavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronoavirus</a>. The NDP will cooperative in every way to help keep Canadians safe. <a href=""https://t.co/stRsWSH48u"">https://t.co/stRsWSH48u</a> Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, agreed that the first case in Canada was not unexpected, and that other cases in Canada are likely. He said it's possible that other passengers on board that flight could have transferred to flights to other provinces. The health agency's protocol is to follow up on those persons for possible symptoms over the next 14 days. The number of infections worldwide now exceeds 2,000 cases, most of them in China, which reports 56 deaths. Dr. Jerome Leis, an infectious diseases specialist at Sunnybrook, said people who are acutely ill should go to hospital, but said those with mild symptoms should reach out to public health authorities. ""We completely understand that there's a lot of anxiety and questions in the general public, and that is very understandable. I want to be absolutely clear that individuals who have questions or anxiety, the first reflex should not be to go to an emergency department,"" he said. ""The first point of contact should be with public health if there are questions or concerns."" Air Canada announced Sunday it is extending its ""goodwill policy"" to allow passengers to make alternate travel arrangements during the affected period. People can change their flight free of charge to another date or another destination, or can cancel a flight for a full refund. Risk mitigation measures now in place include messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports reminding travellers to advise border officials if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. WATCH: Why finding viral cases is easier now: ""While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health-care professional if you have travelled to an affected area of China, and develop flu-like symptoms,"" Hajdu said. Officials said the man took a flight on Jan. 21 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, then from Guangzhou to Toronto, arriving on Jan. 22. He is believed to have travelled ""privately"" from the airport to his home. Officials do not believe he took public transit. They have not said what part of the city the man lives in. Upon arriving, he told family members he felt ill and called 911. Officials say paramedics took all necessary precautions ""right from first contact"" until the hand-off to the hospital's emergency department on Jan. 23, officials say. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada annually. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said provincial health officials are putting full resources to the virus, and will be staying vigilant and informing the public ""every step of the way."" ""It's something I feel we have a good handle [on] and we're ready, but we want to see the extent of this,"" he said Sunday in Toronto. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne issued a statement Sunday reminding Canadians to pay attention to travel advisories warning against non-essential travel to Hubei, China, including the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou. Canadians already in the region should register with consular officials, which will give them access to the latest updates from the government, he said.  ""We understand the concerns of Canadians in the region and those of their families and loved ones. We are in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground,"" Champagne said in the statement. ""Canadian consular officials are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with local authorities and our international partners to gather more information and provide support to the extent possible. Canada does not have a consular presence in Wuhan."" Transport Minister Marc Garneau's office said the department has set up a dedicated team to support and respond, and has activated the Emergency Co-ordination Centre. On Friday, Transport Canada officials held a teleconference with the Public Health Agency of Canada and airline representatives, and reminding the carriers they are required, under the terms of the Quarantine Act, to report ill passengers. Transport officials have also been in regular contact with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to discuss contingencies and readiness plans.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-tam-health-china-1.5440950,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-coronavirus-preparedness-1.5439033 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-buses-1.5440899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,N/A

Demonstrators outraged by rampant government corruption and poor services burned tires and blocked main road arteries. Security and hospital officials, who requested anonymity in line with regulations, said seven protesters were killed in the southern province of Basra, near the Umm Qasr port. Security forces used live fire and tear gas to disperse the protesters. Earlier in Basra, which accounts for nearly 85 per cent of the country's crude oil production, protesters burned tires in the city centre cutting main roads. Officials said four protesters were killed in Nassiriya province, and one killed in both Najaf and Diwanieh provinces. One security official in Basra said it was ""one of the worst"" days since the start of the protest movement. At least 150 protesters were wounded. At least 342 people have died since demonstrations began Oct. 1, when thousands of Iraqis, mostly youth, took to the streets to decry corruption and poor services. The leaderless uprising seeks to overthrow the political establishment. Security forces appeared to have fired live rounds at protesters near the Umm Qasr port, killing three, according to an official from the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights, who requested anonymity in line with regulations. Protesters had cut roads leading to Umm Qasr, the country's main commodities port, halting all trade activity.

552,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-15T01:14:38.650Z,Police officer sheds tears as he describes 'gruesome' death scene at Regina murder trial,"WARNING: Story contains graphic content.  With tears in his eyes, Regina police Const. Bryceton Fink described the shock he felt when he saw Jenny McKay's body lying in a pool of blood on her kitchen floor and tried to call out to her. Fink became emotional as he testified Tuesday at the trial of Jason McKay, who is accused of killing Jenny, his wife, in September 2017. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the death of the 33-year-old woman, who was originally from New Glasgow, N.S. The police officer and his partner, Graham McDonald, had been dispatched to the Angus Street residence for a welfare check, Fink​ explained during his testimony at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench. The officers had been told that Jason McKay's mother was worried about her son, who had a history of self-harm. They were told she feared he might be intoxicated, or had used his medication incorrectly.  Fink said ​when they arrived, Jason McKay was covered in blood but assured them he was not injured.​ Fink testified that in response to McDonald's question, ""Where's Jenny?"" McKay's exact response was ""She's dead. I ​f--king killed her."" McDonald stayed with McKay as Fink entered the home, finding what he described as the ""gruesome​""​ scene in the kitchen.  Fink wiped tears from his eyes as he remembered finding Jenny, with a large knife still protruding from her chest. She was cold to the touch and had no pulse. He said what appeared to be blood was smeared on the floor and the kitchen cabinets. Crown prosecutor Adam Breker, who walked Fink through photos of the scene, paused briefly to ask if the scene was difficult and shocking to come across. Fink, his voice thick, agreed it was. Const. Alyssa Gregory was part of the Regina police forensic identification u​nit in 2017. She testified that there was a lot of blood at the crime scene, compared to what she had previously experienced. ​She noted Jenny appeared to have multiple wounds around her head and neck. ​ Gregory found and seized broken knives in the kitchen. She also documented a serrated knife on the floor by Jenny's right hand. She said she found a cellphone on the table, which was later determined to belong to Jason McKay. It contained photos of Jenny's apparently dead body. Gregory said they showed Jenny almost as police found her — except that the knife was missing from her chest in the photos, and a knife was shown ""inside the victim's mouth.""​​ Gregory said the crime scene appeared to mostly be contained to the kitchen area, where she found long strands of hair in Jenny's hands, a blood-soaked blue sweater, and a broken necklace. There was also an engagement ring and a wedding band in the pocket of her shorts. Under cross-examination by defence lawyer Thomas Hynes, Gregory confirmed that there had been no apparent effort made to clean up the blood, despite a nearby closet containing cleaning tools. During Tuesday's testimony, several video clips that showed McKay in a police car, and then at the police station, were played in the courtroom. They showed ​McKay becoming combative​ as he was questioned by police, repeatedly challenging the officers to fight him.""He wanted to fight anybody who was willing,"" ​said Const. Garth Fleece, describing McKay as increasingly ""agitated."" Fleece, who was also responsible for photographing Jason McKay's body to document any injuries, testified that McKay appeared essentially uninjured. The trial, which is being heard by Justice Michael Tochor, is scheduled for three weeks. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288,N/A

""I was stunned,"" he told CBC's Let's Go. ""It's a picture of my grandmother in her garden, so its a very symbolic image for me. I was very happy that she found her place at the museum."" But along with the elation, he was surprised to discover he was actually the first Haitian-Canadian to ever have their work acquired by the museum. He immediately felt that something had to be done to pave the way for more diverse and emerging Canadian artists to get their work displayed alongside his. That's why Mathieu created a fund to help diversify the artwork in the museum's collection. He named it after his grandmother, Marie-Solange Apollon, an immigrant who brought her family to Montreal and worked hard to build a new life. ""She was, she still is, the heart of our family,"" he said. Apollon died of cancer in 2016, but naming the fund after her will help keep her memory alive, said Mathieu. ""They can forget about me, but they can't forget about my grandmother, because they will have to say her name every time a new artist is acquired,"" he said. ""By doing that I'm making sure that her story is told."" According to the museum, the fund is the first of its kind, ""devoted solely to the acquisition of works by emerging Quebec and Canadian artists who are underrepresented in the Museum's collection."" This means eligible works must meet the following requirements: Mathieu contributed some of his own money and partnered with other donors who shared his vision of seeing more diverse representation on the walls of the gallery. He said he's still looking for other donors to join the fund and ensure it keeps going for years to come. ""If the museum is meant to be the collective memory of our societies, then I would like to open the doors, and have more people decide what's happening in there,"" he said. The fund was created in 2018 and officially announced in December 2019 after it paid for the acquisition of its first piece, a multimedia piece by Iranian artist Leila Zelli.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mfam-fund-diversity-art-1.5396845,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sharing-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts-in-20th-year-1.5294688 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/egyptian-mummies-montreal-museum-1.5263400,N/A
554,Ethan Williams ,2019-12-06T00:10:43.952Z,Regina Co-op refinery employees locked out by management,"Approximately 800 unionized employees of Regina's Co-op Refinery Complex are now locked out. A news release from refinery officials says the lockout is necessary to ensure safe operation at the plant. The lockout, which started at 5:30 p.m., comes after refinery employees voted overwhelmingly in favour of a strike last month. Unifor subsequently issued a 48-hour strike notice late Tuesday afternoon. Kevin Bittman, president of Unifor Local 594, expressed concern about employees who are filling in for workers who are on strike. He said many of the substitute employees had been shadowing their counterparts for the past few weeks to learn their jobs in preparation of job action.  ""They may be highly trained but not in the jobs they're going to be doing once we're locked out,"" he said.  He called the job shadowing ""uncomfortable"" for the union's employees. In a statement issued Tuesday after strike notice was given, refinery vice president of operations Gil Le Dressay, also expressed concerns about safety. ""A 48-hour strike notice creates an unsafe operating environment for the refinery,"" he said in the statement. ""It is vital to the safety of our operation that we control the timeline of labour action."" No one from the refinery was available for an interview Thursday. Sean Tucker, an occupational health and safety professor at the University of Regina, echoed Bittman's concerns about the inexperience of temporary workers and said fatigue could also add risk. ""If you're fatigued, you're not as sharp as you usually are,"" he said. ""A combination of inexperience and fatigue with a situation that requires a quick response to lock things down, then you have added risk of a small incident getting larger."" Tucker noted there are regulations in place to ensure the safety of employees and the public. He said inspectors from the Ministry of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety have been instructed to visit the refinery to ensure compliance during the strike.  He said future labour impasses need to be resolved in ways other than employees going on strike in order to ensure the community's safety. Currently, Unifor employees of the refinery have a defined benefit pension plan. As part of the arrangement, employees don't have to contribute a portion of their salary to their pension.  The refinery gave employees the choice of moving to a defined contribution pension plan, where they would contribute to their pensions, or staying with the defined benefit plan. The caveat of staying with that plan, the refinery said in a Dec. 3 news release, would be that employees would need to start contributing money to their plans. ""Most CRC [Co-op Refinery Complex] unionized workers, unlike most Canadians, have never had to contribute to their pension plan,"" said Le Dressay in the release. ""Unfortunately, that just isn't sustainable any longer and we have to ask them to at least contribute to their plan."" Scott Doherty, the executive assistant to Unifor national president Jerry Dias, said he feels the company has the capacity to contribute to their employees' pension plans. ""This employer [made] $2.5 billion in the last three years,"" said Doherty. ""There's no reason this employer can't afford to continue to make the pension contributions that it does."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/coop-strike-lockout-1.5385638,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/co-op-refinery-strike-vote-1.5382230 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/coop-refinery-work-camp-union-response-1.5322453 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/coop-refinery-ratify-contract-1.4054315,N/A

All 176 people on board the Boeing 737 died when the plane went down shortly after takeoff from Tehran, Iran's capital. Fifty-seven were Canadian. Among the dead with ties to B.C.: Many of those above had strong connections with the Iranian-Canadian community in Metro Vancouver, centred in the Tri-Cities and on the North Shore. Four were members of the UBC school community. ""People are really, really shocked by this tragedy,"" said Shideh Taleban, community librarian at North Vancouver City Library. ""The community is trying to be with each other, to reach out to each other, to see how they can support each other."" Dadashnejad, 26, was flying home to Vancouver after a visit with family in Tehran over the holidays. Her sister and a friend confirmed her death to CBC News on Wednesday morning. Her friend, Sia Ahmadi, said she had originally planned to fly back on Dec. 17, but missed that flight and booked Wednesday's instead after her student visa did not arrive on time. Ahamadi last spoke with Dadashnejad before she took off. He said they FaceTimed and she showed him a bracelet she was going to buy for his wife, who was her best friend. ""I just couldn't believe it. She was a great friend. She had lots of people [around her]. Everybody started talking about [the crash last night] and contacting me [asking] if it's true ... and I was like, I hope it's not,"" said Ksenia Ivanova, Ahamadi's wife and Dadashnejad's friend. ""It didn't sink in with me until this morning."" Dadashnejad had been studying nutrition at Langara College. The school's president, Lane Trotter, said in a statement he was ""heartbroken"" over Dadashnejad's death and that the college would be offering support to students. Ivanova spoke about Dadashnejad in an interview on Wednesday: The family of three — Ardalan Ebnoddin Hamidi, his wife, Niloofar Razzaghi, and their teenage son, Kamyar Ebnoddin Hamidi — were on their way home to Port Coquitlam, east of Vancouver, after a two-week holiday. Kei Esmaeilpour, a family friend and head of the Civic Association of Iranian Canadians, confirmed the deaths. ""The community are in shock and are in deep sadness. They feel ... why. Why is this happening?"" Esmaeilpour said. Esmaeilpour said Ardalan was an engineer who had worked on the SkyTrain system in Metro Vancouver. Razzaghi was a two-time graduate of UBC: the university confirmed she earned her bachelor of science degree in 2010 and a bachelor of education in 2018. She was working to become a teacher. Esmaeilpour said the couple's son, Kamyar, was a ""happy, social,"" 15-year-old boy. A couple in their 30s, Hossein (Daniel) Saket and Fatemeh (Faye) Kazerani are also among the dead. A cousin said Saket worked as a lead structural engineer at Denna Homes, a real estate development company in North Vancouver. Kazerani had worked as an assistant to a cardiologist at St. Paul's Hospital. It was originally reported that she had been a dental hygienist. Saket helped with construction of the building he and his wife would later call home. Farzad Taheri, whose father is a cousin of Saket's mother, said the couple were making their way home from holidays in Iran, where they were visiting family. He said they were self-made and moved to Canada in search of a better life. ""We're all in shock ... they were all such lovely people to everyone close, far, anyone who knew them were just so fond of them and no one can believe what happened. They deserve to be acknowledged and they have so many people who love them all over the world,"" he said. ""[The were] so kind ... always smiling. My wife was just saying earlier how even if no one was around, Daniel was always smiling."" Farzad Taheri says everyone was fond of them and no one can believe what happened Ayeshe Pourghaderi and her teenage daughter, Fatemah Pazavand, also lost their lives. Their family owned Amir Bakery, a traditional Persian bakery in North Vancouver. Arash Azrahimi, who was their neighbour for two years, said the daughter was a student at Carson Graham Secondary and sometimes worked for the family business. He said the pair were permanent residents and were excited to become Canadian citizens, often asking to borrow his computer to check the status of their immigration applications. ""They are a very hardworking family. They came to Canada for a better life and this happened​​​​​​,"" he said. Naser Pourshaban Oshibi and Firouzeh Madani were also killed. Both were in their 50s. Their daughter, Kimia Pourshaban Oshibi, 19, had returned early from their family trip to Iran — on the same route — in order to attend classes. She is an undergraduate student in biomedical physiology at Simon Fraser University.  Pourshaban Oshibi, an only child, described her mom as a kind and smart person.  ""She would make friends very, very easily and everyone would think she was their best friend,"" she said.   A grieving Kimia Pourshaban Oshibi talks about her parents: She last spoke to her a few hours before the ill-fated flight.  ""We talked about what she would do on the flight, and what she would do after and that's it,"" Pourshaban Oshibi said, her voice breaking.  The family had immigrated to Canada in 2013.  Pourshaban Oshibi and Madani are trained as family doctors and were struggling through the Canadian licensing process.  ""I would just like to make a point that all of the professionals that come here from Iran go through a really tough time to provide services for Canadians,"" she said.  ""It went through my mind that my parents had a lot of dreams and things they wanted to achieve and their time has been cut short."" The University of British Columbia (UBC) said Zeynab Asadi Lari and her brother, Mohammadhossein Asadi Lari, two of its alumni, were among the dead. The siblings, both in their 20s, had been living in Toronto. Zeynab enrolled at UBC in the BSc program, with a biology major, in 2016. A statement from the university said Mohammadhossein graduated in 2018 with a BSc in cellular, anatomical and physiological sciences with honours standing. Erica Frank, a professor and Canada Research Chair at UBC, wrote in an email to CBC that Mohammadhossein's death is ""an astonishing and excruciating loss.​​​​​​"" ""His heart and brain were both outsized and he was one of the most prescient, promising, and generous people I've known​​​​​​,"" wrote Frank. Frank wrote that she was impressed with his ""extraordinary"" work as an undergraduate, and had just submitted letters of recommendations for him to the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Harvard, and Stanford, and the two of them had planned on finalizing his application to Oxford. ""Mohammad's death is an enormous loss for public health globally,"" she wrote. In an email, Parnian Hosseini described Asadi Lari as one of her best friends. She dreamed of becoming a doctor and although she transferred to the University of Toronto, she considered Vancouver home.  ""It was hard not to laugh when she was around, she had an incredible sense of humour and made sure to keep us grounded by roasting us every now and then,"" Hosseini said. ""No matter what was going on in her life, she would always make time for others and support them through anything. She had touched the lives of so many people and we will feel her absence in our lives. Parsa Shani, an undergraduate student, said he knew both the siblings. He said he considered Mohammadhossein a role model and that he was a leader ""in the realms of science, innovation, STEM education, [and] political apathy,"" having worked with Justin Trudeau to develop Canada's youth policy. ""​It's heartbreaking to see that the two of them are gone together,"" he said.  ""We lost two treasures and from their impact in their communities to their impact in the realm of global health policy and raising youth awareness about the key issues young people face in Canada — I think we really lost two people at the forefront.""  UBC said it is offering support on campus and held a vigil on campus on Thursday night. Mehran Abtahi was a postdoctoral fellow in the civil engineering department at UBC. He joined the university in October, according to a statement from the school. He was in his late 30s. Flags at both UBC campuses in B.C., in Vancouver and Kelowna, were lowered to half-mast on Thursday. Roja Omidbakhsh was a first-year business student at the University of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Prof. Mark Colgate taught Omidbakhsh in his commerce class during her first term at the university and said she was pursuing her degree in the subject. ""Roja was very positive and had a keen interest in marketing,"" Colgate wrote in a statement released by the school on Wednesday. ""We're heartbroken that this happened and our condolences go to her family and classmates."" Mobina Rafieipour said Omidbakhsh, who was in her early 20s, was one of her best friends at the university. The two of them had met after moving to Victoria in August. She said Omidbakhsh was adjusting to life in a new country and had recently found an apartment in Victoria, where she planned on moving with another friend from Iran. Rafieipour last spoke with her the night before what should have been her flight home. ""She was a smart girl who knew how to communicate with [others] effectively, and she was always there for me whenever I needed her,"" she said.  ""I absolutely trusted her ... It's really hard for me to believe that she's gone forever."" UVic said it is offering support for students on campus. The Boeing 737, bound for the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, burst into flames as it crashed into a field not far from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport.

The flyer advertising the almost 10,000 square feet of space describes it as having ""a light industrial look and feel."" It boasts 48 parking stalls, 14 large workstations, a customised kitchen and a large boardroom.  Since 2013, the GTH was run by government employees who administered the transportation and logistics facility and attempted to sell land. However, the organization was deep in debt and had been unable to sell land for years.  So at the government's request, on October 1, 2019 Colliers International, a private commercial realtor, took over the operations of the GTH which had ten years left on its office lease at $110,000 a year.  That same month, Colliers signed a 10 year lease with the space to sMedia, a Saskatchewan company that helps auto dealers target buyers online. sMedia is paying significantly less than what the GTH owes every month. ""Signing this sub-lease will result in a loss on the lease of $278K over the next 10 years,"" says an email from Premier Scott Moe's office.  However, the government says that space was costing taxpayers money by sitting empty so this situation is preferable.  It also points out that the demand for commercial office space in Regina is down significantly from when the GTH originally signed its lease. sMedia is partly owned by Regan Hinchcliffe who is the son of Christine Tell, Saskatchewan's Minister of Corrections and Policing.  The government says she is not involved in sMedia and has no decision-making role related to the GTH.  It says the deal was negotiated between the Acting CEO of the GTH, Colliers and sMedia and was approved by the GTH board. Cabinet, the government says, had no role in reviewing or approving the deal.  ""As the agreement did not require Cabinet approval, and [Tell] has no involvement with the company, it was not believed that this matter would qualify as a conflict of interest,"" the email from the Premier's office said.  However, in light of questions raised by the media, Tell has requested a review.  ""In order to ensure the public's confidence, Minister Tell has been in communication with the Conflict of Interest Commissioner, and has asked him to review this matter to ensure there is no conflict of interest,"" the email said.  Opposition Leader Ryan Meili called for better conflict of interest rules as he criticized the Sask. Party for what he sees as a disturbing pattern. ""It seems that every time you turn around there's another friend, donor, family member or business partner of the Sask. Party that's getting a sweet deal on the taxpayers dime,"" Meili told CBC News.  Meili said any potential conflict of interest in the rental agreement should have been flagged immediately.  He said he wanted to know how Hinchcliffe learned of the opportunity to lease the property and if any other parties were given an opportunity to lease the office space.  ""Was any information shared from the minister to her son?"" Meili asked. ""Those sorts of questions need to be answered.""  Meili called for an investigation into the agreement and a full judicial inquiry into land deals that have been done at the GTH property. He also called for a strengthening of conflict of interest legislation in the province.  ""We've made suggestions in that direction already; that our conflict of interest rules are too lax, as are our lobbying rules, it's really one of the worst situations in the country,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/gth-renting-office-space-to-company-owned-by-sask-cabinet-minister-s-son-at-a-loss-1.5423173,[],N/A
558,Sarah MacMillan,2020-01-02T22:00:00.929Z,Fire marshal concludes on-site investigation of Tyne Valley arena fire,"The P.E.I. fire marshal has turned over the site of the Tyne Valley sports centre to the arena's insurance company — but the investigation into the cause of the fire that destroyed the building is still ongoing. The building was a total loss after a fire early Sunday morning.  Paul Noye, the president of the sports centre's board of directors, said the insurance company will now continue with its own investigation. Once that is complete, he said cleanup efforts will begin. With metal and debris where the building once stood, Noye said there is 24-hour security on-site, to keep the property secure and ensure safety.  At this point, Noye said he doesn't know exactly what cleanup of the site itself will look like, but he told CBC he believes it will be organized by the insurance company.  There are several privately operated construction and demolition sites throughout the province. Gerry Moore, CEO of Island Waste Management Corporation, said where the debris ends up will depend on whether it contains hazardous materials. ""If it was … melted plastics or chemicals or something, then the Environment [Department] may want it to handle those materials different than what they typically would for a demolition of a building that wasn't damaged by fire,"" Moore said.  He also said with demolished buildings, there is often the opportunity to recycle materials including metal, though he doesn't know if that will be possible in this case.  Noye said he hopes to know more details about cleanup in the days ahead.   While the board and the public await the results of the provincial investigation, Fire Marshal Dave Rossiter said earlier in the week that it might not be possible to determine the cause. In part, that's because some of the evidence was destroyed by firefighters during the effort to put out the blaze. Meanwhile, even with the debris still on-site, the community is already looking ahead to rebuilding. The board has established a project management team, with committees to focus on finance, fundraising, and construction.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-arena-fire-cleanup-1.5413061,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-fire-rebuild-planning-1.5411493 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-vallye-rink-fire-dec-2019-1.5410084 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-arena-fire-plans-1.5410511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/confederation-centre-housing-search-actors-1.5412819 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-crow-finds-home-1.5412709,N/A

560,Michelle Ghoussoub,2020-01-23T16:22:49.113Z,"Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus ","Shortly after news broke that a case of coronavirus had been confirmed in Washington state, John Elzinga, who manages an industrial supply store in Langley, B.C., noticed that boxes of his N95 face masks were suddenly flying off the shelves. ""Just [Wednesday] morning there was a big rush, out of nowhere. They were all in looking for the same thing,"" he said. ""It was unusual. You get the feeling right away that there was something else going on."" The standard-issue industrial dust masks, normally used for construction and industrial manufacturing, weren't being purchased by workers in steel-toed boots and hard hats — his usual clientele — but by ""regular off-the-street families,"" he said. One person came in and bought 30 boxes all at once. They were soon sold out. ""The good news is they're on sale. This isn't a price-gouging scenario,"" he said with a laugh, adding that some customers specifically asked if the masks would protect from coronavirus. But Danuta Skowronski, with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said the agency is not recommending that people use the masks to protect themselves — and would be unlikely to ever issue such a directive. ""That is a huge cost with no proven benefit. It could run the risk of draining our supply of masks for the real indications that we have in the health-care system, and even from an environmental perspective, it's ill-advised,"" she said. Skowronski said the one time she would advise the use of a face mask would be for someone who has symptoms and who is entering a health-care facility for treatment. Elzinga said he's previously noticed a run on face masks at his store, back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. At the time, the Public Health Agency of Canada asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks. The report found that masks can offer protection, but there's no evidence inexpensive masks can protect against flu virus particles small enough to be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract or the lungs.  It did find that the N95 masks — like those sold at Elzinga's store — are the most likely to be efficient because they filter particles smaller than one micron in size and provide a tight facial seal. On Wednesday, British Columbia's health minister and provincial health officer said officials are closely monitoring the international outbreak, which can cause pneumonia, fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. It has killed 17 people. China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has said the outbreak likely resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating.  The BCCDC has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, and public health teams have implemented screening for early detection of infections for travellers arriving in airports. Skowronski said the risk to people in B.C. remains low — and for people travelling in China, the best protection is to avoid contact with animal markets and wash your hands regularly. ""I don't want people to misinterpret the intense interest in this virus by public health as an indication that this is a serious threat to British Columbians today,"" she said. ""Rather, the reason that public health is so interested is that we are in an all-out effort to try to contain this virus and stamp it out, and that requires huge effort by public health at all levels of our health-care system,"" she said.

561,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:33:23.958Z,Democrats use words of Trump's staunchest allies to make their case in his impeachment trial,"Democrats on Thursday pressed their case for removing U.S. President Donald Trump from office by using the words of his own allies against him to make the point that his actions were impeachable.  And they worked methodically to dismantle his long-standing allegation that Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden acted improperly toward Ukraine while vice-president. However, Trump's fellow Republicans, serving as the jury in his Senate impeachment trial, showed no signs of turning against him.  On the second day of their arguments for Trump's removal from office, Democratic House of Representatives members acting as prosecutors argued that Biden was carrying out official U.S. policy when he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, because of corruption concerns. Trump and his allies maintain that Biden wanted Shokin out in order to head off an investigation into a natural gas company, Burisma, where his son Hunter served as a director. Democrats said no evidence supported that allegation. Democrats argued, instead, that Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to probe Biden and his son because he was worried about facing the former vice-president in November's election. Biden is a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. ""If we allow this gross abuse of power to continue, this president would have free rein — free rein — to abuse his control of U.S. foreign policy for personal interest, and so would any other future president,"" Rep. Sylvia Garcia said on the Senate floor. ""And then this president, and all presidents, become above the law."" Garcia argued Trump did not pressure Ukraine to investigate corruption and had supported sending military aid to the country until Biden announced his presidential bid in early 2019. She pointed out that in the months before Trump asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, polls had been showing that Biden would beat Trump in a presidential match-up. In May, she said a Fox News poll showed Biden beating Trump by 11 points. ""This clearly did not go unnoticed,"" she said. Trump's lawyers quickly argued that by bringing up the Bidens, Democrats had made their conduct a relevant subject for the rest of the trial. ""They opened the door. They opened the door and it's now relevant,"" Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for the president and a member of his defence team, told reporters at the Capitol. ""So we will address the appropriate issues as defence lawyers would."" Added Republican Senator Ted Cruz: ""Hunter Biden is not only relevant, he is now critical."" But Sekulow said Trump's team was not yet focused on whether new witnesses will be called, a matter the Senate will take up after senators have a chance to submit questions to both sides next week. The Democrats are presenting arguments that Trump should be convicted of two articles of impeachment passed by the House last month — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden last year, and impeding a congressional inquiry into the matter. The U.S. Constitution sets out the impeachment process for removing a president who commits ""high crimes and misdemeanours."" Trump's legal team argues the House charges are invalid because impeachable offences must represent a specific violation of criminal law. ""Impeachment is not a punishment for crimes,"" Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler told the assembled senators. ""Impeachment exists to address threats to the political system, applies only to political officials and responds not by imprisonment or fines but only by stripping political power."" Nadler played a video clip of one of Trump's most prominent defenders, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, arguing during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton that presidents can be impeached even if the conduct in question was not a statutory criminal violation. Nadler also played a video clip from 1998 of Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's legal team, in which he recognizes that abuse of power is impeachable. Finally, Nadler cited a memo written by Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, that made the same point. Watch that part of Nadler's presentation:  ""As our recital of the facts indicated, the articles are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence amassed by the House, notwithstanding the president's complete stonewalling, his attempt to block all witnesses and all documents from the United States Congress,"" Nadler said. ""His conduct is not America first. It is Donald Trump first."" Blocked so far in their drive to persuade the Republican-led Senate to let them call new witnesses, Democrats are using their time instead to outline an extensive narrative, complete with video clips, based on the testimony presented during hearings in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, made a fresh appeal on Thursday for Republican senators to join with Democrats in voting to allow witnesses and new evidence to be presented in the trial. Republicans control the 100-seat Senate. Four of the Senate's 53 Republicans would have to join the Democrats in order to win a simple majority vote. ""The issue of relevant evidence, documents and witnesses is going to come back up. And Senate Republicans will have the power to bring that evidence into the trial,"" Schumer told reporters. ""Republican senators — four of them, it's in their hands — can make this trial more fair, if they want to,"" he said. The case focuses on Trump's request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election, and Biden's son on unsubstantiated corruption allegations. Trump also asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a discredited theory beneficial to Russia that Ukraine was somehow linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 U.S. election. Last year, Trump temporarily withheld $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, which Democrats say was leverage for his demands. Trump's own intelligence agencies repeatedly debunked the theory, but Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, continued to push it and pursue it. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff talked about the fact many people blamed Giuliani for the theory, but suggested it demonstrates how Trump poses a grave danger to the United States.  Watch that moment from today's proceedings: During the evening arguments, Rep. Zoe Lofgren continued to walk the Senate through Trump's holding of the aid, at one point, producing an email that suggested Trump was clearly behind the hold, and that it was being concealed. Watch that part of her argument:  Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. Even if finding Trump guilty seems to be a long shot for Democrats, the trial presents an opportunity to inflict political damage on Trump ahead of the November election, with millions of Americans watching the televised proceedings. Trump, who arrived back in Washington on Wednesday night from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, condemned the proceedings as ""unfair & corrupt"" in a Twitter post on Thursday. Signs emerged on the second day of arguments that the Democratic case was losing some of the public's attention. There were empty seats in the gallery overlooking the Senate floor. Television ratings were down. About 8.9 million viewers watched the first day of arguments on Wednesday, falling short of the roughly 11 million who watched on Monday, according to Nielsen ratings data. Senators also showed increasing signs of restlessness, with many wandering to the rear of the chamber where they could check their phones and make calls. While it remains a long shot for Democrats to secure Trump's removal through impeachment, the trial gives them a venue to inflict political damage on him ahead of the November election, with millions of Americans watching the televised proceedings. Before Thursday's arguments began, some Republican senators said they had heard nothing new in the presentation made by the Democratic managers and had already decided to vote for acquittal. The Senate's schedule means Trump's defence team, a group of White House lawyers and outside counsel who will be given three days for rebuttal to the Democratic opening arguments, would likely start to present their case on Saturday. Sekulow said it was unclear whether the Trump defence would need all three days. ""We will make a determination on our presentation based on what we are responding to and based on our affirmative case,"" Sekulow said. ""I don't know if it will take 10 hours, 14 hours, 24 hours or six hours.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-trump-1.5437770,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A

565,Dianne Buckner,2019-02-03T19:11:49.407Z,Cultural funding fight with Netflix reignites age-old debate — what is Cancon anyway?,"Canadian studios and production crews are busier than ever before — thanks in part to demand from foreign streaming giants such as Netflix, Amazon and Disney-owned Hulu, who need to feed binge-watchers' voracious appetite for on-demand entertainment. But at the same time, those American behemoths are being accused of not contributing their fair share to produce Canadian content and culture. Many of the shows they're producing here are aimed at worldwide audiences, with little connection to this country or its identity, critics say. The campaign by Canadian broadcasters to force streaming companies like Netflix to contribute to the Canada Media Fund, which kick-starts Canadian productions that tell Canadian stories, has renewed the long-standing debate in this country about what exactly constitutes Canadian content. Is it more important to tell uniquely Canadian stories or to have a thriving film and television production industry north of the border? And do thrifty consumers care about either if it means they may have to pay more for the right to binge their favourite programs? Hard at work in a suburban Toronto studio, the producer of Netflix's Designated Survivor series, starring Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland, doesn't have time to even think about such concerns. Currently shooting its third season, Canadian-born Chris Grismer heads up a team of about 200 television and movie professionals — camera and sound technicians, hair and makeup professionals, directors, staging and props people. ""It's difficult to get crews right now,"" said Grismer, who grew up in Saskatchewan. ""It's difficult to even find a spot to shoot in Toronto, because everything that could be studio space has already been turned into studio space."" Supporters of Canadian culture point out that much of the boom in production here stems from the creation of American programs like Designated Survivor. Known in the business as ""service production,"" nothing that ends up on the screen will say ""Canada,"" despite it being shot here by Canadian professionals, often with Canadian stars.   In Designated Survivor, for example, the son of iconic Canadian actor Donald Sutherland plays the president of the United States, in a completely American storyline.     But the show's producer wonders what it really means, these days, to refer to content as ""Canadian."" ""Netflix itself is making a lot of shows that are made by Canadian producers and Canadian writers that I would consider Cancon in the traditional sense of the word,"" Grismer said during a short break from filming. Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa and the Canada Research Chair for the internet and e-commerce, points out the irony that even the television series based on Margaret Atwood's novel, The Handmaid's Tale — an international smash hit made in Canada for Hulu, now shooting a third season — doesn't meet the specific, detailed requirements for Canadian content and therefore can't access certain funding. The CRTC's points system recognizes the contributions of various production professionals, but not authors. ""Our system right now is among the most rigid anywhere in the world,"" Geist said. ""And so, taking a book by a famous Canadian author and trying to bring it to the screen doesn't get you any further in terms of saying that's actually a Canadian story."" With a federal government review of Canada's 30-year-old broadcast regulations underway this month — with the goal of modernizing those rules for the digital age — a chorus of critics are accusing Netflix and the other streaming services of getting a free ride in this country. ""Many players, including web giants, are not contributing to the system,"" Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly said last summer, when she announced the review. ""What we want is fairness in the system."" Unlike those web giants, Canadian distributors of broadcast content such as Rogers, Shaw and Bell are required to pay a portion of their revenues into the Canada Media Fund, an agency that uses those funds to launch Canadian programming. It's a system that has been phenomenally successful, according to Reynolds Mastin, CEO of the Canadian Media Producers Association. ""We punch well above our weight,"" he said of Canada's cultural output. ""Especially when you consider that we're right next door to the biggest global entertainment market in the world with 10 times the number of people."" Without the funding from streaming services though, he and other stakeholders fear Canadian programs such as Kim's Convenience, Letterkenny and Murdoch Mysteries, or movies like the Oscar-winning The Shape of Water, wouldn't get made. Michael Geist has a much different assessment of the situation. ""All of this is taking place in an environment where there is no Canadian content emergency,"" said Geist, who made a submission to the expert panel reviewing the regulations. ""The data tells us that the amount being spent on registered Canadian content is record-setting right now."" Geist worries that adding regulations and fees to streaming companies will increase prices for consumers. ""We know right now that Canada has some of the most expensive internet and wireless services in the world, so saying that we're going to increase fees on those services, I think, runs the risk of making those services less affordable."" He also notes that while domestic broadcasters carry an additional financial burden related to Cancon, they also enjoy certain benefits: access to cultural funding, copyright rules related to distribution, and access to wireless spectrum. In its submission to the federal government's expert panel, Netflix says streaming companies have ""enriched Canada's production sector, without government intervention."" The company says it will ""significantly"" exceed the $500 million it promised to spend on productions in Canada over five years, and will spend $25 million on initiatives ""to develop the next generation of diverse Canadian talent, with a focus on francophones, women, and Indigenous creators."" Netflix insists it should be excluded from any new proposed legislation. ""We do not subscribe to the theory that a 'regulated investment' is more valuable than a consumer and market-driven one,"" the company's submission says. It's a battle Netflix has been fighting in other countries as well. France and Germany are bringing in rules that will require the streaming giants to showcase programming indigenous to those countries on their sites. Reynolds Mastin of the producers association says the Canadian industry has reached ""a critical juncture in its history,"" and it's time to change the rules.   ""Those companies that profit from the Canadian system should also contribute to it."" The expert panel will release a summary of the 2,000 submissions it received from interested parties in June, and recommendations are expected by the fall.

566,Tony Davis,2020-01-25T14:22:52.381Z,Former NHL players coming to P.E.I. to support Tyne Valley rink rebuild,"Fundraising efforts to rebuild a P.E.I. rink will soon get help from some former NHLers. The Tyne Valley Community Sports Centre was destroyed by fire in late December. Fundraising efforts started with the Rally for the Valley, where several hundred Islanders showed up in the parking lot of the former rink and took a photo to draw attention to their Kraft Hockeyville bid. Now, Jeff Noye, the mayor of Tyne Valley, said some NHL legends will play a hockey game and all the proceeds will go toward rebuilding the rink. Noye said the hockey game will take place on Feb. 9, which will include legends like Ray Bourque who once played for the Boston Bruins.  Bourque will be headlining the game in Summerside at Credit Union Place. All the money raised will go toward rebuilding the rink in Tyne Valley. Tickets are $15 for adults and $10 for kids. ""All proceeds from everything from that game goes back to our fundraising efforts,"" said Tyne Valley rink manager Adam MacLennan. The Charlottetown Islanders are also throwing their support behind Tyne Valley with a Skate for the Valley after their game Sunday. The support Tyne Valley has had from other P.E.I. communities goes to show how ""tight-knit"" the hockey community is and Craig Foster, president of operations for the Islanders, said the team wanted to be part of that. ""We just want to do what we can to help their fundraising efforts."" Admission to the skate with the Charlottetown Islanders is by donation and all money raised will go toward the rink rebuild. ""Get some autographs, get some pictures,"" MacLennan said. ""It's not every day you get to go out and get to skate with potential future NHL players."" Charlottetown Mitsubishi will also be outside the Eastlink Centre offering test drives. For every test drive, the dealer will donate $20 to rebuild the rink. ""It's great to have local support here in Tyne Valley, but you know the support, I can tell you, has been overwhelming across the Maritimes,"" MacLennan said. The Tyne Valley fundraising committee has been busy working on a business plan and economic study, as well as preparing applications for provincial and federal government funding, MacLennan said. He said the committee is still waiting for the final word on the insurance claim for the rink. Every year, the Hockeyville competition gives one Canadian community money to upgrade its arena and host an NHL pre-season game. A top prize of $250,000 is up for grabs and the winner is announced March 28. Tyne Valley's bid to win the Hockeyville contest has gained a lot of attention. It has been supported by other Maritime communities. Celebrities with an Island connection have endorsed the bid like Trailer Park Boys and Mr. D star Jonathan Torrens. ""We've had great shout-outs from Ron MacLean, Elliotte Friedman, Doug MacLean,"" MacLennan said. MacLennan said nominations for Hockeyville end on Feb. 9 and he is hoping people continue to show their support so they make the top-four finalists. Noye said many Island communities have been supportive of rebuilding the rink. The Boys and Girls Club of Summerside has an online auction running with proceeds going to the rink rebuild. Moosehead Breweries is donating $1 from every case of beer the company sells on the Island until Feb. 29 to a maximum of $20,000.  Noye said he hopes the company is able to reach that maximum.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nhl-islanders-tyne-valley-fundraising-jan-2020-1.5439765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-arena-fire-cleanup-1.5413061 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cwf-expanding-programs-jan-2020-1.5439405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ten-thousand-villages-1.5438994,N/A

Nevertheless, officials are committed to an intense containment effort, according to Dr. Danuta Skowronski, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control's epidemiology lead on influenza and emerging respiratory pathogens. ""We know that intense efforts now to contain this virus can prevent it from establishing itself as an infection for humans forever, so it is very important to us in public health to try to contain it and stamp it out now,"" said Skowronski on Friday. The so-called novel coronavirus has largely been spreading in China's Hubei province and its capital city, Wuhan.  More than 1,287 people are confirmed to have been infected by the virus in China, with 41 fatalities. Skowronski said about two thirds of the cases are in Hubei province, and 30 cases have arisen in eight countries outside China. Health officials in France announced three new cases on Friday, marking the virus's spread to Europe. In the U.S., a second case has been confirmed in Chicago. Six countries in Asia, aside from China, have documented novel coronavirus cases. Skowronski said the majority of cases have been spread between humans, but more needs to be understood about that transmission.  ""At the current time, the risk to British Columbians is very low, but we are screening travellers returning from affected areas for symptoms, so that we can identify cases early, contain them and prevent the possibility of further spread,"" she said. The World Health Organization reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source of the outbreak was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan. Anyone travelling abroad should avoid contact with animals and wash their hands regularly, according to Skowronski.

570,Jon Hernandez,2017-08-31T00:27:38.233Z,"Forest fibres key to reinvigorating rural B.C. towns, says resource adviser","As interest in LNG projects wanes, and with the future of the mighty Site C dam called into question, a group of rural researchers are urging the province to think outside the box in hopes of reigniting some of B.C.'s rural economies. Experts point to the completed expansion of the Prince Rupert port — now the second largest container-handling port in Canada — as a promising development to help get value-added B.C. goods to the international market — specifically, goods made from forest slash and logging. ""We've got all kinds of fibre laying on the ground everywhere,"" said Grace McGregor, a member of B.C.'s rural advisory council — a group established by the previous government to come up with creative solutions to stimulate economic growth in rural B.C. McGregor and her colleagues have long advocated for the increased utilization of decomposing wood fibre ravaged by the pine beetle as well as logging waste. The fibre can be transformed into wood pellets and be used to create electricity. The resource has been heavily sought after by pellet producers in recent years; however, the slash is often burned or left behind due to accessibility issues. Critics say trucking out the fibre is uneconomical; but according to McGregor, the updated port in Prince Rupert could help reduce overall transportation costs due to its proximity to isolated woodlands and pellet factories. B.C. Forests Minister Doug Donaldson agrees. Following the B.C. NDP forming government in July, Donaldson has been tasked with creating more jobs in the forest sector and processing more logs and fibre on B.C. soil. ""We really need to improve the focus on getting more jobs out of every cubic metre that comes out of the forest,"" he told guest host Michelle Eliot on CBC's BC Almanac. ""The ripple effect that [the port] has on the north of B.C. ... it gives us a competitive advantage to have that reliable, dependable and professional infrastructure in place in order to spur development in the rural communities."" The B.C. NDP ran on a platform opposing the exporting of raw logs overseas to instead create valued-added wood products within the province, but they have yet to release an official action plan since being sworn into office.

571,Shane Ross,2019-09-22T12:25:16.536Z,'They feel like your pets': Dad shares love of beekeeping with daughters,"Troy Fraser, his smiling face covered in a mesh hat as honeybees buzz around his head, doesn't flinch as he casually flicks a dead one off his sleeve.  Honeybees die after they sting you. And Fraser had just been stung. Again. ""I'm at the point now where I don't react to them, it just feels like a sharp pinch,"" he said.  ""Getting stung is part of the business. If you're not willing to get stung then you shouldn't necessarily be a beekeeper."" The stings are well worth it for Fraser, who bought his first three hives in May and nurtured them to 14 by mid-September.  ""It's kind of like my happy place,"" he said.  ""It's one of those areas where you can be in nature and be in control of the situation, but at the same time be not in control. You open up a hive and then you see thousands of bees there, and just knowing in the back of your head that at any moment they can all come sting you or attack you."" Fraser is one of about 50 beekeepers on P.E.I., according to Dave MacNearney of the P.E.I. Beekeepers Association. He said there are about a dozen commercial beekeepers, who have more than 25 hives.  The rest are considered hobbyists like Fraser, who usually get into it to make their own honey or beeswax products or help farmers pollinate their fields. There are currently no specific rules or regulations to beekeeping, MacNearney said, though the city of Charlottetown is in the midst of passing a bylaw to ban backyard hives. Fraser keeps his hives in a south-facing, sheltered field not far from his home in Mermaid.  Beekeeping has even become a family affair for the Frasers. Two of his daughters, Lucy, 10, and Annabelle, eight, asked for beekeeping suits for their birthdays in the summer so they could accompany him to the hives. ""It may sound like I'm off my rocker but it's almost like your pet,"" he said. ""They feel like your pets, your family pet."" One time after returning home from visiting the hives with Lucy, they noticed a baby bee — which didn't yet have the ability to sting — was in the truck. ""I said, 'Well that bee's probably going to die because it's outside its hive,"" Fraser said. ""Next thing I know she's running up the street through the woods and she takes that bee back to the hive."" Lucy, who has only been stung once, said she enjoys helping her father with the bees. ""I like hearing them buzz,"" she said. She recently got the chance to mark one of the queens with a green dot. She named that one Queen Lucy, of course. Fraser said before he bought his hives, he spent about a year researching how to keep bees, watching YouTube videos and reaching out to other beekeepers on the Island.  He said he paid about $600 for his first three hives, which he bought in Nova Scotia. And there are other expenses — he got some strange looks when he left the grocery store with 60 two-kilogram bags of sugar he mixes with water to feed the bees. He said he'd eventually like to get into commercial beekeeping, especially when he retires. His girls could make lip balms and candles, he said, while he sells honey and pollination services. For now, he's happy to just learn more about bees and support anyone who might want to try beekeeping.   ""Getting into bees was kind of like a childhood fascination,"" he said. ""I always wanted to learn and study bees, but always scared to be stung. And as I grew older, just the fascination and the science geek in me wanted to take it one step further.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bees-troy-fraser-beekeeper-1.5291229,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bees-beekeepers-small-hive-beetle-pest-1.5084912 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bee-swarm-jusly-2019-1.5211109 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-honeybees-inside-wall-farmhouse-renovation-1.4708651 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-boardwalk-replacement-1.5289554 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-hemp-higher-cbd-lobbying-1.5289524,N/A
572,Murray Brewster,2019-11-23T20:19:03.191Z,Canada warned of fallout on Five Eyes relationship if Huawei allowed on 5G,"Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, is a ""Trojan horse"" that could restrict Canada's access to the critical Five Eyes intelligence-sharing community, the Trump administration's top security adviser and senior U.S. lawmakers warned Saturday. Robert O'Brien, the recently appointed White House national security adviser, painted a stark picture of Chinese intelligence gathering vast reams of data on ordinary Canadians if the Liberal government doesn't ban Huawei from helping build the upcoming 5G network. ""The Huawei Trojan horse is frightening. It's terrifying,"" O'Brien told journalists in a roundtable question and answer ahead of his appearance at the Halifax International Security Forum.  He linked developments in artificial intelligence, facial recognition advances, surveillance cameras and advanced data-gathering through wireless networks and warned of China's ability to harness all of it. ""The technology allows China to put together profiles of the most intimate details, intimate personal details, of every single man, woman and child in China. When they get Huawei into Canada or other Western countries, they're going to know every health record, every banking record, every social media post; they're going to know everything about every single Canadian."" The data-gathering already underway on Chinese citizens makes the activities of Facebook and Google ""look like child's play,"" O'Brien said, adding that countries have to decide whether ""they're prepared to surrender every single bit of data on their citizens."" Asked if Canada's intelligence-sharing relationship with allies would be put at risk by allowing Huawei into the country, O'Brien said intelligence sharing ""would be impacted if our close allies let the Trojan horse into the city."" U.S. lawmakers delivered similar stern warnings about the Chinese telecom giant at various points during the security forum. Democratic and Republican senators spoke with one voice, saying the dangers of proceeding outweigh the benefits. Canada is among a handful of select Western democracies with a decades-long intelligence-sharing arrangement with Washington. The Five Eyes countries also include Australia, New Zealand and Britain. Canada's participation could be in jeopardy, said a leading Independent on the U.S. Senate Intelligence committee. ""It would make it very difficult to have a full intelligence-sharing information with a partner who has installed a direct line to Beijing,"" said Maine Senator Angus King, who noted he was not speaking for the Trump administration, but as a committee member. The U.S. has been urging allies to reject Huawei participation in building the new 5G wireless network over fears that Chinese intelligence services could have easy access to data through the company. Some of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing partners, notably Australia, have heeded the warnings, but Canada's Liberal government is still reviewing the issue and his signalled a decision likely won't come until next year. King said there was bipartisan agreement in Washington when it comes to Huawei. ""We differ sometimes on issues, but not on this one,"" he said. ""The risks of Huawei coming into your country far outweigh any benefits."" Republican Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the foreign relations committee, urged the Canadian government to pay attention to its intelligence services and choose security over consumer convenience. ""I would hope the Canadian government — like any government — as they sort through this get briefed by their intelligence agencies as to the risks involved with signing up with a company that is fully controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,"" said Risch. ""When any information goes to Huawei or through Huawei, the Chinese Communist Party will have access to that information. Is it worth it to save a little money by buying a cheaper system?

573,Tony Davis,2019-07-28T14:19:49.396Z,Dirty dozen: 12 tires pulled from Percival River Nature Reserve during cleanup,"Staff from the Nature Conservancy of Canada along with volunteers pulled 12 tires from the Percival River Nature Reserve west of Summerside, P.E.I. on Saturday. It was part of an annual cleanup. Percival River Nature Reserve is a haven for migratory shorebirds with extensive salt marshes and surrounding forests. The nature reserve is just over 500 acres and every year the volunteers find some unique trash, said Lanna Campbell, the conservancy's program director for P.E.I. ""We found all kinds of different things… we found about a dozen tires, so vehicle tires. I'm not sure how those got there,"" she said. Campbell said common things found in the area in terms of garbage are rope, pieces of plastic foam buoys and random pieces of plastic. She said it is important to retrieve those materials to protect wildlife. The cleanup is one of several hands-on conservation events offered by the organization in the Maritimes and one of more than 60 conservation volunteer events offered across Canada. There were eight volunteers who joined the two conservancy officials at the P.E.I. event. ""We're always really thankful whenever … people come out and they donate their time, their efforts, their energy,"" Campbell said. It is great for the NCC to have volunteers come out and help the organization with cleanups, said Abigail Pavao, a conservation engagement intern for New Brunswick and P.E.I. ""It gives us and the volunteers a sense of accomplishment, getting to clean up and make a difference in this area,"" she said. Pavao also has a tip for people who might tour the area, she said people do go to the reserve and do ""their own individual cleanup."" ""Have a garbage bag handy in your car, maybe some gloves. And just whenever you see wrappers or trash or debris or something just pick it up along the way,"" Pavao said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nature-percival-river-cleanup-2019-1.5228108,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beach-clean-up-covehead-dalvay-1.5069638 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ellens-creek-plastic-1.5125709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-borden-carleton-marsh-erosion-cleanup-1.5157810 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-adopt-a-road-northside-pickers-1.5208654 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-haskap-berry-1.5221843 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sailing-around-the-world-1.5227957,N/A

575,Catharine Tunney,2019-07-25T08:13:12.595Z,"With ransomware on the rise, RCMP urging victims to 'be patient with police'","The head of the RCMP's financial and cybercrime unit is urging patience as police figure out the whack-a-mole world of online exploitation, where thousands of Canadians are hit with a ransomware attack every day. ""Just report your crime and be patient with police because we are still growing in this space,"" RCMP Chief Supt. Mark Flynn told CBC News. ""We're always catching up. That's the reality. In order to know where to go and where to target, we have to learn the behaviour. It's quite difficult to assume or guess what method somebody is going to use in the future and then be in a position to do that."" Flynn is the director general for financial crime and cybercrime within the RCMP's federal policing and criminal operations. His brief covers everything from pursuing ransomware and romance scams to sniffing out organized crime online and protecting banks' servers. His comments come as new Statistics Canada figures show a rise in fraud and exploitation in Canada. Just this week, the federal agency reported that the national rate of police-reported extortion rose 44 per cent in 2018, while the number of fraud cases grew by 12 per cent. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre estimates that nearly $120 million was lost due to mass marketing fraud (which includes extortion and phishing) in 2018. The RCMP's data, which rely on Public Safety figures going back to 2016, suggest Canadians are affected by ransomware attacks roughly 3,200 times a day. But to get a real sense of the problem, Flynn said, you can multiply most online extortion stats by 20. ""Numbers are hard to give because we also have a serious lack of reporting,"" he said. ""There is a significant underreporting of cybercrime. Some of that comes from embarrassment, fear of reputational harm."" Flynn said that major corporations don't want to lose customers and risk the public backlash. ""They don't want it to be public because of the embarrassment factor,"" he said. ""We need to bring that up to the surface, make it OK to report."" A number of municipalities across North America also have fallen victim to ransomware. Last month, the mayor of Stratford, Ont. went public after cyber criminals hijacked part of the city's computer servers and held data hostage, demanding a Bitcoin payment. Mayor Dan Mathiesen called such online criminals ""the new terrorists of the century."" He wouldn't say if Stratford had paid the ransom or planned to do so. However, town officials in Midland, Ont., have confirmed they paid a ransom to reclaim data after hackers held their computer systems hostage for 48 hours. It's not clear how much has been paid out in ransomware attacks in recent years — again, due to a lack of reporting, said Flynn.  ""People don't report to us what they pay. Even when we're investigating, there are times when it's become obvious that people have paid, but they do not report that,"" he said.  ""Our advice is not to pay. However we recognize that it's frequently a business decision to pay."" Paying out on ransomware attacks, said Flynn, doesn't necessarily mean the data will be turned over and could make individuals and institutions targets for future attacks. ""You're dealing with criminals. They will lie to you,"" said Flynn. The veteran Mountie said investigators also have to recognize that some victims don't believe police will be able to retrieve their data. He admits previous response times were ""unacceptable,"" but said the force is more limber now. ""Today the volume has gone up, the adoption of technology, the change in society has occurred so rapidly it's very difficult for policing organizations to adapt at that same rate,"" he said. ""I think we're getting closer to a  response time that's more acceptable."" A shift at the RCMP is also helping them ramp up the response team.  The cybercrime unit at RCMP headquarters in Ottawa is gaining two sister bureaus in Montreal and Toronto.  ""There's more work than they can handle already,"" said Flynn. The force is looking to hire civilian cyber experts who don't want to commit to front-line policing, he said, adding the RCMP is also more willing now to work with outsiders, including banking organizations and other police forces.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-ransomware-mark-flynn-1.5221601,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cyber-crime-rising-across-canada-1.5221330 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stratford-cyberattack-ransomware-hack-1.5170951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lucki-briefing-binde-cybercrime-1.4831340 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-march-29-2018-1.4597367/how-white-hat-hackers-are-helping-cities-fight-back-against-ransomware-attacks-1.4597498 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/small-ontario-towns-pay-ransom-after-hackers-hold-computer-systems-hostage-1.4826545 https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/police-power-privacy-rcmp-cases-1.3850783,N/A
576,Anonymous,2019-11-26T00:26:50.410Z,Canada as a middle power in an upended world: Time for a foreign policy reset?,"The world has rarely looked this inhospitable from Ottawa's vantage point. Authoritarianism, nationalism and isolationism are on the rise, even in the neighbourhood. The liberal world order is in apparent decline, or at least being severely tested. Add to that Canada's uncharacteristically craggy relationship with not one but three major global powers — Russia, China and the United States — and several lesser powers (Saudi Arabia chief among them), and things haven't entirely been going Canada's way. If, as former prime minister Lester B. Pearson once said, diplomacy is letting someone else have your way, then Canada needs to step up its diplomacy. As a middle power, there are limits to what Canada can do to influence global machinations that turn on the say-so of major powers, many of them in flux. But experts believe it can do more, and better. A growing chorus is calling on Ottawa to urgently review — and then rescript — Canada's role in light of the shifting international terrain. And if Ottawa isn't willing to lead that self-examination, then the intention is to go ahead with a ""citizens' foreign policy review"" anyway. It was the palpable sentiment at the end of a one-day think-tank in Toronto last month convened by the Canadian International Council (CIC) and Global Canada — both non-partisan, ground-up organizations that focus on engaging Canadians on Canada's role abroad. Some 150 academics, NGOs, diplomats, business leaders and interested citizens took part. ""We heard repeatedly that Canada needs a clearer, crisper foreign policy,"" said Robert Greenhill, executive chairman of Global Canada. The idea of a ""root-to-branch"" review came up when Justin Trudeau's former foreign policy adviser, Roland Paris, suggested it in the midst of the election campaign — during which foreign policy was barely mentioned beyond a Conservative Party promise to cut foreign aid by a quarter. The lone planned debate on foreign policy was cancelled when Trudeau refused to participate. The last foreign policy review, Paris points out, was held in 2005. ""We held the conference before a new government was formed because Canada's role in the world is not only the responsibility of our elected leaders and our diplomats,"" says Ben Rowswell, president of the CIC. The gathering was timed right after the election ""to remind citizens that it is up to us, as Canadians, to project our country's influence abroad."" The momentum for a review continues to build ahead of a major summit hosted by Ottawa this week, also on retooling Canada's global leadership in an upended world. The flurry of free foreign policy advice for the new government — and for Canada's latest foreign minister, François-Philippe Champagne — comes at a crucial time. The challenges of the fast-evolving global picture, which among other things has seen the U.S. withdraw from the Paris agreement on climate change, and the U.S. and Russia unravel a cornerstone nuclear arms treaty, is increasingly alarming. ""Our most critical ally is continuing to disengage globally, and sometimes that disengagement is dramatic,"" said Jennifer Welsh, professor and director of the Centre for International Peace and Security Studies at McGill University, at the one-day conference. ""It's not showing a deep interest in sustaining the multilateral system, let alone strengthening it. It's reconfiguring alliances almost daily. And it is flouting key rules."" Some of those trends, she added, are likely to outlast the Trump administration. Among other challenges Welsh outlined are the rise of nationalism, the return of proxy wars and backsliding on democracy and values such as human rights. The larger question is how and whether Canada can be influential on the world stage amid such transformation.  There is no shortage of issues to take up or resolve: from climate change, to human rights abuses, major conflicts, poverty, mass displacement, governing big tech, cyberwars, to bolstering multilateral organizations against a sustained challenge. Canada has historically made its biggest impact globally by working within multilateral organizations like the UN. But international diplomacy is nothing like it used to be in Pearson's time, and neither is the global power game itself. ""We cannot pretend that we have … the level of capacity and power that we did when we were one of the original members of the G7 with an economic base higher than that of Russia — we were a world player. It's a totally different world [now],"" said Bill Graham, one of four former foreign ministers invited for a rare discussion moderated by CBC Radio's Ideas at the CIC/Global Canada gathering in Toronto. The UN Security Council, which Canada is bidding to join next year, ""doesn't represent the global structure anymore,"" Graham said, adding, ""And Canada's been, to some extent, a victim of that."" So what's a middle power to do to help reinvent the multilateral order? What can it do? The view from abroad, from experts on Canadian foreign policy, is similar. ""I am rather pessimistic about the prospect of Canada becoming a global influencer in the upcoming years of Trudeau's second term in office,"" says Tomek Soroka, a Canadian expert and assistant professor at the Institute of American Studies at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. That skepticism has less to do with Trudeau's plans, he added, and more to do with geopolitics, the ""shift toward populism and isolationism of some of Canada's stronger and most influential allies."" Joining the Security Council is one thing — though winning that seat is by no means guaranteed. Other options proposed by the ministers include seeking out allies beyond traditional turf, and building coalitions issue by issue. ""We should be the most actively multilateralist in the world, and there is a greater need for us now than ever,"" Joe Clark, former Progressive Conservative prime minister, said. ""We have some extraordinary assets outside the developed world. There is a real risk that we will not take advantage of those assets. Africa is a case in point."" ""We better start doing a diplomacy of climate,"" said Lloyd Axworthy, foreign minister under Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien, who helped make a global landmine treaty a reality in 1997. Canada can use its reputation and ""soft power"" as a foreign policy tool, especially on standing for progressive values, says Soroka. But to do that, Canada has to be ""credible and reliable."" ""It is not easy to believe that multilateralism is a serious matter for the Canadian government when Canada's participation in foreign development aid or its participation in peacekeeping missions has for years been, euphemistically speaking, rather modest,"" he said in an email conversation. ""It is also hard to trust Ottawa's declarations to fight the climate crisis when Canada is the highest emitter of GHG per capita among all G20 members. Selling arms to such notorious women's rights violators as Saudi Arabia does not make Canada a credible defender of human rights, either."" Canada's posture on the world stage since Trudeau first declared ""we're back"" in 2015 also came in for criticism at the conference for focusing more on being a ""moral superpower"" and less on acting as a convener and consensus-builder on the world stage. Peter MacKay, foreign minister in 2007-8 and a possible contender for an eventual Tory leadership contest, called out the previous government's foreign-policy-by-tweet. Chrystia Freeland's public comments on Saudi Arabia's human rights record, for instance, unleashed a ferocious response last year. Canada is gravely concerned about additional arrests of civil society and women’s rights activists in <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaudiArabia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaudiArabia</a>, including Samar Badawi. We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/humanrights?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#humanrights</a> activists. ""You can't lecture countries, you can't hector them,"" said MacKay. ""We have seen examples of that, where this has actually harmed Canada's interest."" Similar criticism came from another former foreign minister in the room — Perrin Beatty, who is currently president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. He was among six participants who pitched ideas for a renewed foreign policy: everything from using Indigenous know-how in international development, to stepping up the engagement of Canada's diaspora, to ""greening"" foreign aid. Those ideas will now be taken to CIC events across the country for further discussion, said Rowswell. At the conference, the majority of participants backed Beatty's pitch for an urgent review of Canada's foreign policy. ""Canada's role in the world should be to do what we've historically done very well: to engage, to convene, to present innovative ideas and to build consensus,"" he said. Ideally, he said, a review would be led by political leaders. ""But if they are incapable of doing so … business, the academic world, non-governmental institutions and others like those in this room have the obligation to lead the way. ""The world won't wait for us. The stakes are simply too high."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/canada-as-a-middle-power-in-an-upended-world-time-for-a-foreign-policy-reset-1.5372192,[],N/A
577,Janet Davison,2020-01-25T09:00:27.803Z,Uncertainty remains over the future success of Harry and Meghan's new life in Canada,"The Royal Fascinator Hello royal watchers and those intrigued by what's going on inside the House of Windsor. This is your deep dive into royal news and analysis. Reading this online? Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox. The breathless headlines over Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior members of the Royal Family have subsided, but uncertainty remains about how their new life will work out for them. Harry spoke Sunday night of the ""many years"" of challenges that preceded the decision, and about taking a step forward ""into what I hope can be a more peaceful life."" Then he returned to Canada to be reunited with Meghan and their son, Archie, in British Columbia, where they had been staying over the holidays. It's not clear how much of their time will be spent in Canada, but for at least one longtime observer, there is a sense that life on this side of the Atlantic may have its challenges, too. ""My fear is that Harry is going to be lost, with not enough to do, and thousands of miles away from his family and friends and everything he has ever known,"" said author Penny Junor, who delved into his life in her biography Prince Harry: Brother, Soldier, Son. Speculation has been rampant regarding what the couple may do now that they have stepped back and seek financial independence. While they won't be using their ""Royal Highness"" titles, they have kept their associations with their private patronages. ""That is where their hearts lie, and those charities would be devastated to lose them as patrons,"" Junor said via email. ""Even without their titles, they will bring in funds and increase profile."" But there is likely to be much scrutiny of how they try to develop their own brand. ""I'm sure the tabloid press will be keeping a close eye and leaping on anything that smacks of either of them exploiting their royal connections,"" Junor said. Media and PR experts in the U.K. are already suggesting it could be an expensive and complicated battle if Harry and Meghan have to change the Sussex Royal brand that they have been promoting. David Haigh, chief executive of a brand valuation consultancy, told The Guardian that they face the ""mother-of-all punch-ups"" protecting it in global markets. ""The fact is, it's a minefield. They are going to have real problems,"" he told the paper. Earlier this week, British media reports were also questioning whether a commercial venture by one of Harry's cousins might offer a look at how Harry and Meghan will chart their own path. The Daily Mail reported that Princess Anne's son, Peter Phillips, who is not a working member of the Royal Family, endorsed milk from Jersey cows in a Chinese television ad. Following last Saturday's announcement of how Harry and Meghan would chart their new course, much attention has revolved around their ""His/Her Royal Highness"" titles and their significance. ""I think what is confusing to the public is the idea they still have these titles but they will not be using them,"" said Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal author and historian. It all sets up an unusual — but not unprecedented — scenario. The Duchess of Kent, wife of the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, stopped using her HRH a couple of decades ago. ""She pursued an independent career as a music teacher in a school and stepped away from royal duties,"" said Harris. Under King George V's letters patent in 1917, the HRH titles were restricted to children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch. ""At [that] time, King George the Fifth was eager to distance himself from some of his German relations in the House of Hanover as well,"" said Harris, ""so restricting royal titles was also a means of clearly defining who was in the Royal Family as opposed to who was more distantly related to the monarch."" If Harry and Meghan had been stripped of their HRH titles, Harris suspects it would have prompted a conversation at the palace over whether other members of the family should keep their titles. ""If Harry and Meghan formally lost their HRH, the question would arise of why does Prince Andrew have an HRH if he is not carrying out royal duties, as he's stepped back from his royal duties in disgrace."" Similar questions might arise for Andrew's daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who have the title but have never been full-time working members of the family. Harris thinks that during the next reign, it's likely Prince Charles, as monarch, will issue new letters patent restricting the HRH to a much smaller number of people, perhaps the heir to the throne and their children, ""in order to avoid these complications."" Harry's departure from the upper echelons of the Royal Family — and the fact that he will no longer formally represent Queen Elizabeth — could pose a constitutional conundrum for the United Kingdom. Harry is a Counsellor of State, one of a select group of high-ranking royals who can carry out most of the official duties of the monarch if they are unable because of illness or absence abroad. In the event of that, two or more counsellors can be appointed. According to law, the counsellors are the monarch's spouse and the next four adults in the line of succession who have reached the age of 21. ""Given that Prince Harry will no longer represent the Queen, Prince Andrew has stepped back from public life and Prince Philip has retired, only Prince Charles and Prince William are available,"" said Craig Prescott, director of Centre for Parliament and Public Law at the University of Winchester in southern England, via email. ""The risk is that their duties as Counsellors of State mean that Prince Charles and Prince William could not do the other things they are expected to do, such as representing the U.K. overseas or taking part in engagements around the U.K."" WATCH | Commentator Katie Nicholl discusses the future of the British monarchy All this means that unless legislation (the Regency Acts 1937-1953) is amended, ""the monarchy may not be able to meet all the expectations placed on it, which questions Prince Charles's idea of slimming down the monarchy,"" Prescott said. Maybe it would be easier, Prescott suggested, ""if the load was shared and those next in the line of succession, such as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, take up public duties and could become Counsellors of State, or other royals who still fulfil their duties, such as Prince Edward or Princess Anne, become Counsellors of State even though they are further down the line of succession."" Buckingham Palace did not respond to a request for comment this week. Prescott said it had been rumoured last year that the palace approached Downing Street about changing the legislation. ""But apparently they were more concerned about changing the law on how and when a regency can be declared rather than looking at the issue of Counsellors of State. However, the two issues really should be considered together."" While Harry and Meghan have been the focus of public attention in the past two weeks, other members of the Royal Family have been out and about on engagements often focused on issues of significance to them. Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, launched a U.K.-wide survey that aims to improve early childhood, a major area of focus for her. Prince Charles was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he spoke about the world needing a ""paradigm shift"" in how it deals with climate change, and met Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old climate activist from Sweden. The Prince of Wales meets environmental activist <a href=""https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@GretaThunberg</a> at <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/wef20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#wef20</a>. <a href=""https://twitter.com/wef?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@wef</a> <a href=""https://t.co/FruEgY17mi"">pic.twitter.com/FruEgY17mi</a> Charles is also making his first official trip to Israel and the West Bank this week.

""Minority governments can end abruptly and unexpectedly,"" said Scheer, who will stay on as leader until the members choose a new boss on June 27.  ""Canada needs a Conservative government so there will be no free ride for the Trudeau government this session."" Former Quebec premier Jean Charest, former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose and current MP Pierre Poilievre — all potential front runners — decided they won't launch bids this week. MacKay will formally unveil his campaign on Saturday, while current MP Erin O'Toole is also expected to launch his in the coming days.

About five to 10 per cent of Métis people can speak Michif — the language of Métis people — according to the Gabriel Dumont Institute (GDI). The Northern Michif To Go app, released by GDI, looks to change that. Vince Ahenakew, the principal of Rossignol High School in Île-à-la-Crosse, praised the new app and said it will keep Michif alive. ""Michif is the language of our region, our area. It's a mixture primarily of Cree and French and a little bit of English,"" Ahenakew told CBC Radio's Morning Edition. Michif has evolved over the past 242 years, according to Ahenakew, who grew up speaking it. He learned it from his grandmother and the elders who called Île-à-la-Crosse home. Ahenakew said someone who visits the community and spends time with the older generations is likely to hear Michif, but younger generations don't speak it at the same level. That's why the community explored the possibility of creating an app to keep the language alive. ""In speaking with people, they say it's really good, user friendly,"" Ahenakew said. He said the community is undertaking several initiatives to promote Michif. Every May it hosts a four-day gathering to celebrate the language. Both schools in Île-à-la-Crosse teach Michif from Kindergarten to Grade 12 and the school division made it a requirement for graduates to have a Michif credit before finishing school. There's also evening language classes that are open to all according to Ahenakew. ""Our hope is that it catches fire and all these young guys start to speak the language and start to use it,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/michif-app-aims-to-inspire-1.5089019,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/angus-andersen-teaches-intuktitut-1.4881065 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-first-nations-are-turning-to-technology-to-preserve-language-1.4928611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/indigenous-language-app-1.4970376 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/kanesatake-mohawk-language-app-1.5014478,N/A
581,Pete Evans,2019-04-27T16:36:00.727Z,Plant-based eating goes mainstream as Beyond Meat targets Canadian grocery shelves,"A California company that was overwhelmed by demand for its meatless fast food burger is hoping to capitalize on the rising trend of vegetarianism and sell directly to Canadian grocery stores starting now. Founded a decade ago in California, Beyond Meat first captured the attention of Canadians when the company signed a deal with burger chain A&W last year for a plant-based burger — one they claim looks and tastes like traditional patties, but is made entirely from vegetable-based proteins. A&W was flooded by so much demand for the product that most locations sold out almost instantly, and has had trouble maintaining supply ever since. But Beyond Meat is pushing ahead with more expansion, confident those supply issues have been handled.  After focusing on getting its products into some 27,000 restaurants around the world, Beyond Meat has now turned its attention to selling directly to consumers. It has struck deals with major food chains like Loblaws, Sobeys, Metro and Longo's that will see the company's plant-based burger patties sold in thousands of Canadian grocery stores. ""On the heels of our successful launch with A&W ... retail is the natural next step for our brand,"" CEO Ethan Brown said in a release announcing the move. Robert Carter, a Toronto-based consumer analyst with NPD group, said Beyond Meat tapped into what was a slowly growing movement toward plant-based eating, and became a leader almost overnight. ""I had seen the underpinnings, but even I didn't expect it to be as popular as it is,"" Carter said in an interview. Canada, the wait is almost over. The <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeyondBurger?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BeyondBurger</a> is coming to the meat case!<br><br>Learn more here ➡️ <a href=""https://t.co/PYqsI7ibFj"">https://t.co/PYqsI7ibFj</a> <a href=""https://t.co/eeuWR0Xh9K"">pic.twitter.com/eeuWR0Xh9K</a> While fast growing, Beyond Meat is far from the only company in the space. Market research firm Mintel estimates that the market for meat alternatives has almost doubled between 2013 and today, and restaurant chains have been trying to tap into that trend. Burger King partnered with Impossible Foods to create the Impossible Whopper, a meatless alternative to the chain's iconic offering. So far, it is only available in select markets, but it too has seen strong sales and is expected to become a permanent offering. And earlier this month, Canada's Maple Leaf Foods announced plans to spend $310 million to build a huge plant-based protein food processing facility in Shelbyville, Ind., which will produce the company's Lightlife products, a line of plant-based food items. ""We own the leading brands in the North American refrigerated plant-based protein market,"" CEO Michael McCain said of the venture. All of these companies are hoping to cash in on the growing trend towards plant-based eating, which has hit something of a tipping point because of consumers millennial-aged and younger. While they may be ahead for now, Beyond Meat ""needs to capture as much as they can,"" Carter said, ""because the big players are going to get in on this game very quickly."" He said it's a market opportunity because younger consumers are much more aware of the food they eat, and want to consider the environmental and social impacts — on top of the taste and price. ""These guys have got a product that is so on trend right now,"" he said, referring to the company's eponymous burger. He said partnering with a fast food chain was a savvy opening move because it gets the product into the hands of potential testers who likely wouldn't ordinarily consider buying it uncooked on a shelf. Even calling it ""plant-based,"" as opposed to the outdated term ""vegetarian,"" has helped Beyond Meat win over consumers who'd never consider themselves to be the latter. ""The messaging has been very well done,"" Carter said. Vegetarians aren't the company's target market.  ""Whether you're a hardcore carnivore or a strict vegan, you should be able to have our burgers, enjoy what you're eating and feel great afterward,"" said Brown, Beyond Meat's CEO. Nova Scotia-based chain Sobeys is first out of the gate on the grocery side in Canada, with the burger available in every region where the company operates as of Friday. Other chains will follow next month, Beyond Meat said. Sylvain Charlebois, a professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University, said the move away from meat is very much a trend — and Beyond Meat has jumped to the head of the pack — for now. ""Rarely in Canada have we seen a supplier orchestrate such a well-coordinated, timely invasion of a market through careful management and marketing,"" he said. ""Now grocers are drinking the proverbial plant-based Kool-Aid, all at once."" His only beef is that he'd like to see a Canadian-made product growing so rapidly on Canadian shelves. ""It's an American product, fostered and propelled by American entrepreneurial spirits,"" he said. ""Our way of thinking regarding food innovation suppresses any chance for a company to come up with a project like this. There are glimmers of hope, however, as startups are erupting all over the place and will bring a proper dosage of innovation, in due course.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/beyond-meat-vegetarian-1.5110666,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/new-food-guide-meat-dairy-industries-1.4988632 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-e-waste-elizabeth-may-1.5104341 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/aw-cage-free-1.3487744 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/vegetarian-or-flexitarian-how-much-meat-do-you-really-want-to-give-up-1.2713709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/michael-abramson-the-vegetarian-butcher-king-of-meat-free-bbq-1.2699028,N/A
582,Kazi Stastna,2020-01-25T03:13:07.851Z,"As they head into Day 4 of impeachment trial, Democrats hope to leave senators wanting more","As the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump enters its fourth day in the U.S. Senate, stamina is waning. Among viewers at home, interest has dropped off — from about 11 million viewers to a little less than eight million, a mere six per cent of those expected to vote in the November 2020 election. In the halls of the Senate, the press corps is getting restless, still chasing every media availability but privately cursing the long hours they've put in covering a trial that has stretched beyond nine hours each of the past three days. On the Senate floor, while some senators keenly flip through massive binders of supporting documentation, highlighting relevant sections, others slouch, yawn or slip in and out of the chamber, where strict rules dictate they're only allowed to consume milk or water. Democrats are hoping they can sustain the punishing pace for at least one more day as they wrap up their case against the president Friday and make a final push to convince the Senate and the American people that Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival was a brazen abuse of power intended to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. Hour 23 of redundant impeachment arguments. For those following at home: Drinking game—every time House Dems say “drug deal” or “get over it”...drink a shot of milk! ""It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest,"" said Jerrold Nadler, one of seven Democratic legislators, or so-called managers, prosecuting the case, Thursday. ""It is a shocking corruption of the election process. And it is without doubt a crime against the constitution, warranting — demanding — removal from office."" WATCH | Jerrold Nadler lays out the case for abuse of power: The Democrats have been using video clips of testimony from the House impeachment hearings last year and Trump's own statements to methodically weave a director's commentary of sorts, chronicling a by now familiar story: Trump's withholding of $400 million US in military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and revive a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. ""This is actually a very effective use of the House evidence because it digests the moments that constitute evidence for the Democrats,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication at the University of Pennsylvania who runs FactCheck.org. And while much of the testimony was familiar to anyone who paid attention during the House hearings, several senators from both sides of the aisle admitted they were hearing some of it for the first time. ""This may have been the first time that they have heard the entire case presented sequentially,"" Jamieson said. ""And they are having a very different experience than the public has had, because very few in the public are watching from one o'clock until whenever the proceedings [end]."" Although several of Trump's defenders in and outside the Senate denounced the presentation as same old, same old, Republicans might end up using their own samples of House testimony to rebut the Democrats' case when they begin presenting their defence Saturday.  It would be a mistake for the lawyers representing Trump to discount evidence of misconduct altogether, said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on constitutional law and the legislative process at the North Carolina School of Law.  Instead, they should clearly spell out how the Senate should assess whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offence. ""Merely saying all he did was perfect is shameful. It is false and leads any neutral observers to lose confidence in their case,"" said Gerhardt. Gerhardt was a witness for both sides in the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and in the Trump impeachment hearings in the House, and Nadler played some of his testimony at the start of Thursday's session. He says he regrets that there are no joint witnesses in the current impeachment process. ""The breach between the parties is much worse than it was 20 years ago, and it was bad then."" The importance of hearing from additional witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, has been a key focus for the Democrats. It will likely come up again in their final day of arguments as they attempt to prove the second article of impeachment and show that Trump obstructed Congress by stymying the inquiry into how he handled the Ukraine matter. They'll need to convince at least two Republicans (along with the two independents, who are expected to vote with Democrats) to get the 51-member majority they need to vote in favour of calling of witnesses once Trump's defence team presents their case. Adam Schiff, the congressman leading the prosecution, has goaded senators over the past two days, hinting at the incriminating details that might be in the diplomatic cables and other subpoenaed documents that the Democrats have also requested but that the White House has thus far refused to release.  ""They're yours for the asking,"" he told senators on the first day of arguments. WATCH | Adam Schiff calls on senators to demand the release of subpoenaed documents: ""As they built the narrative, they would establish what they knew, argue that it was strong enough to impeach based on what they knew and then say, 'But wouldn't you also want to know this?'"" Louis Seidman, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center, said of the Democrats' strategy. It's a strategy that seems to be tapping into public sentiment. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken Jan. 20-23 found that 66 per cent of Americans, including 45 per cent of Republicans, agreed that the Senate should call new witnesses to testify. ""They have to sustain public support for witnesses. In fact, get it to increase if they can, because that puts pressure on the susceptible Republicans who might be willing to vote that way,"" Seidman said. Rick Scott, of Florida, is one of those Republicans. But he told reporters Thursday that Democrats had their chance to pursue witnesses during the House hearings and could have gone to court to fight the president's refusal to comply with their subpoenas. He and other Republicans have, however, said they want Hunter Biden to testify about his association with Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he was a paid member of the board from 2014 to 2019. Trump and other Republicans have alleged Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to dismiss the country's prosecutor general in order to shield Burisma from a corruption investigation. In their arguments Thursday, Democrats tried to debunk that theory and show that Biden's actions were part a wider international effort to root out corruption.  ""The whole idea of a fair trial is you bring in relevant witnesses,"" said Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her way into the Senate chamber Wednesday. ""Relevant witnesses here are people who know what Donald Trump did and what his intent was and what its impact was on our national security and on the security of the Ukraine. Hunter Biden doesn't have any knowledge of that or any bearing on that."" Her fellow presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar said she's been keeping the pressure up on her Republican colleagues, urging them to at least agree to hear from witnesses, even if they don't vote to remove Trump from office.  ""Why are you here if you're not going to stand up?"" she said she told senators. Democrats used strong language in their presentation to the Senate to characterize Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to announce investigations that the House managers said served only his own interests: ""plot,"" ""scheme,"" ""unprecedented coverup."" (He countered with some of his favourite terms: Nadler was a ""sleazebag""; Schiff a ""con job"" and the trial ""a hoax,"" he said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.) They went to great lengths to underscore the gravity of the charges and the historic nature of the process, repeatedly invoking the so-called Framers of the Constitution. ""Impeachment is not for petty offences,"" Nadler said on the second day of arguments. ""It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or unpopular. "" And if there was any doubt about just how sombre of an occasion it was, the opening words of the sergeant at arms at the start of every session were there to remind us: ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."" As were the stern security staff who were quick to reprimand reporters and lookers-on for the smallest infraction, handing them a photocopied list of rules, with the one they've violated emphatically underlined: no cellphones, no talking, no eating, no leaning, no standing. WATCH | Adam Schiff they'll be authors of their own decline if they don't hold Trump accountable: In advance of their final day of arguments, the managers presenting the Democrats' case issued a warning to those who might be convinced Trump abused the power of his office but hesitant to remove him. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,"" Schiff said near the end of another nine-hour-plus session. ""For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won."" But it will take more than that to convince Trump's most vocal defenders in the Senate that he must go. ""When it comes to replacing this president nine months-plus from the election, you've got an uphill battle with me, because I really do believe that the best group people to pick a president are the voters,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters. Even Seidman, who supports the impeachment process, thinks a vote to remove Trump would be risky and potentially destabilizing given that a percentage of Americans would find such a process tantamount to a coup d'état. It's also highly unlikely to happen, contingent as it is on a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats hold 47 of 100 seats. But that doesn't necessarily mean the impeachment process is a futile exercise, said Seidman. ""There is the impact that this has on the American people, on Trump's chances for re-election, on his historical reputation, on how much political power he has going forward,"" he said.

583,Adam Hunter,2019-11-06T23:30:15.090Z,Sask. government to form committee to study class size and composition,"Saskatchewan's education minister is forming a committee to study Pre-K to Grade 12 class size and composition in the province. The Provincial Committee on Class Size and Composition is scheduled to host its first meeting before the end of the month and may consist of nine education sector partners, including: ""I have heard from parents, teachers and staff that our classrooms are more complex than ever,"" Minister of Education Gordon Wyant said.   ""I look forward to the work of this committee helping to develop solutions to guide class size and composition planning in our schools."" The government said the committee will ""construct a framework on class size and composition with the intention of implementing recommendations for the 2020-21 school year."" Wyant said he expects that some recommendations may require additional money. He said he will share those needs with cabinet in preparation for the upcoming budget. Class size and composition have been major talking points for the STF and the opposition NDP. The STF has demanded the two issues be a part of ongoing collective bargaining talks. Wyant has maintained that those issues are best negotiated at the local level and not the bargaining table. The two sides don't even agree how big classes are. The Ministry of Education told media in April that the average class size in Saskatchewan is 19, but the union says classes range from 22 to 40 children. STF President Patrick Maze said the province is ""sidestepping the bargaining process and demonstrates bad faith bargaining"". ""Half of Saskatchewan's teachers said the issue of class size and composition was as important as their own compensation and the Federation remains committed to addressing this through provincial collective bargaining,"" Maze said Wednesday. Collective bargaining continues next week. ""Government only announced this committee after we brought the issue forward and presented solutions — including a fund dedicated to provide necessary supports in classrooms — at the bargaining table. This alone is evidence of the need to address this through provincial collective bargaining,"" Maze said. Wyant said the committee will go ahead with or without individuals or groups that were invited to participate. Negotiations between the STF and the province have played out in public as well. The provincial government proposed a two per cent salary increase in 2020 and 2021 and a $1,500 lump sum payment to each teacher. The Saskatchewan Teachers Federation's ask is for the two per cent raise this year and a three per cent raise for the next two years. They also want to see a contract of employment for substitute teachers and smaller class sizes. The NDP has called the situation in Saskatchewan classrooms ""a crisis."" It is a claim Wyant refutes, although he does not disagree that increasingly complex classrooms are a challenge for students, teachers and parents. NDP education critic Carla Beck has been travelling around the province in recent weeks with NDP Leader Ryan Meili holding education town hall events. One is scheduled for Wednesday night in Regina. Beck said the need to tackle class size and composition is ""very high around the province"" and requires quicker action than a committee studying the issue allows. She called for mid-year funding to address classroom needs. Last weekend, the NDP announced at its annual convention a plan to cap Kindergarten to Grade 3 classes province-wide. Beck said the party has not costed the pledge to cap class size, which would likely require hiring of additional teachers. On Monday, the STF released results of its Education Re-Imagined report, which features 12 calls to action, following nearly a year of discussion and public consultation. The STF, NDP and the ministry of education have done their own separate education surveys in recent months.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-class-size-composition-committee-1.5350181,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/committee-recommends-12-actions-for-modernizing-sask-education-system-1.5347703 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/classroom-size-contract-talks-teachers-1.5289690 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/stf-moe-cba-public-1.5287695 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-class-size-1.5131249,N/A
584,Tony Davis,2020-01-25T14:22:52.381Z,Former NHL players coming to P.E.I. to support Tyne Valley rink rebuild,"Fundraising efforts to rebuild a P.E.I. rink will soon get help from some former NHLers. The Tyne Valley Community Sports Centre was destroyed by fire in late December. Fundraising efforts started with the Rally for the Valley, where several hundred Islanders showed up in the parking lot of the former rink and took a photo to draw attention to their Kraft Hockeyville bid. Now, Jeff Noye, the mayor of Tyne Valley, said some NHL legends will play a hockey game and all the proceeds will go toward rebuilding the rink. Noye said the hockey game will take place on Feb. 9, which will include legends like Ray Bourque who once played for the Boston Bruins.  Bourque will be headlining the game in Summerside at Credit Union Place. All the money raised will go toward rebuilding the rink in Tyne Valley. Tickets are $15 for adults and $10 for kids. ""All proceeds from everything from that game goes back to our fundraising efforts,"" said Tyne Valley rink manager Adam MacLennan. The Charlottetown Islanders are also throwing their support behind Tyne Valley with a Skate for the Valley after their game Sunday. The support Tyne Valley has had from other P.E.I. communities goes to show how ""tight-knit"" the hockey community is and Craig Foster, president of operations for the Islanders, said the team wanted to be part of that. ""We just want to do what we can to help their fundraising efforts."" Admission to the skate with the Charlottetown Islanders is by donation and all money raised will go toward the rink rebuild. ""Get some autographs, get some pictures,"" MacLennan said. ""It's not every day you get to go out and get to skate with potential future NHL players."" Charlottetown Mitsubishi will also be outside the Eastlink Centre offering test drives. For every test drive, the dealer will donate $20 to rebuild the rink. ""It's great to have local support here in Tyne Valley, but you know the support, I can tell you, has been overwhelming across the Maritimes,"" MacLennan said. The Tyne Valley fundraising committee has been busy working on a business plan and economic study, as well as preparing applications for provincial and federal government funding, MacLennan said. He said the committee is still waiting for the final word on the insurance claim for the rink. Every year, the Hockeyville competition gives one Canadian community money to upgrade its arena and host an NHL pre-season game. A top prize of $250,000 is up for grabs and the winner is announced March 28. Tyne Valley's bid to win the Hockeyville contest has gained a lot of attention. It has been supported by other Maritime communities. Celebrities with an Island connection have endorsed the bid like Trailer Park Boys and Mr. D star Jonathan Torrens. ""We've had great shout-outs from Ron MacLean, Elliotte Friedman, Doug MacLean,"" MacLennan said. MacLennan said nominations for Hockeyville end on Feb. 9 and he is hoping people continue to show their support so they make the top-four finalists. Noye said many Island communities have been supportive of rebuilding the rink. The Boys and Girls Club of Summerside has an online auction running with proceeds going to the rink rebuild. Moosehead Breweries is donating $1 from every case of beer the company sells on the Island until Feb. 29 to a maximum of $20,000.  Noye said he hopes the company is able to reach that maximum.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nhl-islanders-tyne-valley-fundraising-jan-2020-1.5439765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-arena-fire-cleanup-1.5413061 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cwf-expanding-programs-jan-2020-1.5439405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ten-thousand-villages-1.5438994,N/A
585,Benjamin Blum,2020-01-27T05:10:01.907Z,"For Canadian basketball, Kobe Bryant was both an icon and adversary","Kobe Bryant achieved international stardom during his storied NBA career — but his impact on basketball in Canada was particularly unique. Bryant — who was killed in a helicopter crash Sunday in Calabasas, Calif., along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others — was simultaneously an inspiration to countless Canadian athletes who would go on to professional careers and a tormentor of the country's NBA teams as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. Here is a look at Bryant's relationship with basketball in Canada — both as a friend and a foe — as tributes to the late basketball icon continue to come in. Before the recent success of the Toronto Raptors, yellow jerseys adorned with either the No. 8 or 24 were ubiquitous whenever Bryant came to town. But Bryant's most iconic moment against the Raptors came in Los Angeles in 2006, when he dropped 81 points on Toronto. Bryant's 81 are the second-most points scored in an NBA game, behind only Wilt Chamberlain's 100 points scored as a member of the Philadelphia Warriors in 1962. The performance is even more stunning due to the fact it came a month after Toronto held him to just 11 points. Even games at what was then-known as the Air Canada Centre could have been mistaken for Lakers home games due to Bryant's transcendent stardom. And for Raptors fans, who for years were starved for any semblance of celebration, a missed shot at the buzzer by Bryant in 2010 was cause for celebration. Bryant — who owned a 24-9 record against the Raptors — would go on to finish his career as the third-highest scoring player in league history, a mark that was surpassed by current Laker LeBron James on Saturday. Watch: Kobe Bryant's last game in Toronto But what about Canada's other NBA team, the late Vancouver Grizzlies? Well, Bryant notched his first-career triple-double in 2001 against the team, which later relocated to Memphis. Bryant was an 18-time NBA all-star during his career, and his final all-star appearance in 2016 was cause for celebration. The festivities were held in Toronto that season, and the weekend for all intents and purposes turned into the Kobe show. Watch: Kobe Bryant honoured before final NBA All-Star Game After the video aired in the arena, NBA legend Magic Johnson took the microphone to laud Bryant even further and eventually introduce a second tape of Bryant's moments, with the retiring Los Angeles Lakers great narrating parts of it and other All-Stars offering him words of thanks. Bryant then addressed the crowd, as they chanted his name at a deafening level. Bryant said he's ""been extremely fortunate to play the game I love and be in the NBA for more than half my life."" He ended his remarks by saying, ""Thank you so much — and now I've got to go get loose."" Bryant checked out of the game with just over a minute remaining, leaving to a standing ovation, hugs from players, and more chanting of his name. The West easily defeated the East by a whopping score of 196-173. Throughout his 20-year career, Bryant left his mark on many basketball players whom eventually made it to the NBA — including several Canadians. Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray grew up in Kitchener, Ont., idolizing the five-time NBA champion. Murray, who was drafted seventh overall by the Nuggets in 2016, told the Denver Post that he admired Bryant's famous ""Mamba mentality."" ""It was his drive to win, it was his never give up on plays, his confidence level in himself and what he could do, his belief in his team, just everything,"" Murray said. After learning of Bryant's death, Murray tweeted: ""I'm trying to process but I just can't man."" Watch: Raptors TV analyst recalls a huge, sometimes polarizing figure in Kobe Bryant Surreal day.

Here's the moment Will Barton informed Jamal Murray about the news. <a href=""https://t.co/D46C6pH4yV"">pic.twitter.com/D46C6pH4yV</a> Toronto's Andrew Wiggins has said he watched Bryant's game voraciously as a child and modelled his game after the star. Wiggins, who plays for Minnesota, would wind up scoring on his idol during a game in February 2016. After knocking down a fadeaway jump shot with Bryant defending, Wiggins — who was drafted No. 1 overall by the Timberwolves in 2014 — turned to him and said: ""I got that from you."" Andrew Wiggins backs down Kobe Bryant, nails fadeaway <a href=""https://t.co/gjlzN4YXlf"">pic.twitter.com/gjlzN4YXlf</a> The admiration was mutual. After a game against the Timberwolves in 2014, Bryant said that playing against then-19-year-old Wiggins was ""like looking at a reflection of myself 19 years ago."" Bryant even had a few Canadian teammates during his illustrious career — notably Rick Fox, who won three consecutive titles in Los Angeles with Bryant in the early 2000s. Fox, a small forward from Toronto, was a solid contributor during the team's title run in 2000 and developed into a key starter for the Lakers' next two championship victories. Reserve centre Robert Sacre, a one-time member of the Canadian men's national basketball team, also played for the Lakers during the latter part of Bryant's career. But the highest-profile Canadian to share the court with Bryant was two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash. While a member of the Phoenix Suns, Nash and Bryant faced off three times in the NBA playoffs, with the Suns winning two series. At the end of his career, Nash elected to team up with Bryant in Los Angeles, but injuries to both players limited their on-court time together. ""My heart is broken for Kobe and his family,"" Nash tweeted on Sunday. ""I'll never forget the battles but what I really admired was the father he was to his girls.

Rescue teams from neighbouring provinces were dispatched to the affected areas, working in the dark with floodlights. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said troops were on standby to help. TV footage showed rescuers pull out one injured person from the rubble of a collapsed building in the district of Gezin, in the eastern Elazig province. Around 30 were believed to be trapped inside collapsed structures in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, who travelled to the afflicted area together with Soylu, said 13 people were killed in Elazig, including two people who suffered heart attacks, and five others died in Malatya. A total of 553 people were hurt, including 11 who were in serious condition. Some 30 buildings had collapsed from the quake in the two provinces, according to Murat Kurum, the environment minister. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter that all measures were being taken to ""ensure that the earthquake that occurred in Elazig and was felt in many provinces is overcome with the least amount of loss."" The quake struck at 8:55 p.m. local time, at a depth of 6.7 kilometres near the town of Sivrice in Elazig, the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said. It was followed by several aftershocks, the strongest with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1. Elazig is some 750 kilometres east of the capital, Ankara. People in Elazig whose homes were damaged were being moved to student dormitories or a sports centre amid freezing conditions. Elazig Gov. Cetin Oktay Kaldirim told NTV television that a fire broke out in a building in Sivrice, near the epicentre, but was quickly brought under control. Soylu was at a meeting on earthquake preparedness when the quake struck. The Kandilli seismology centre in Istanbul said the quake measured 6.5., while the U.S. Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 6.7, and said the quake affected not only Turkey but also Syria, Georgia and Armenia. Different earthquake monitoring centres frequently give differing estimates. NTV said the earthquake was felt in several Turkish provinces and sent people running outdoors in panic. Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people. A magnitude 6 earthquake killed 51 people in Elazig in 2010.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/earthquake-eastern-turkey-1.5440232,[],N/A
587,Mark Gollom,2020-01-22T09:00:00.310Z,Prince Harry and Meghan's arrival could mean 'new grounds' for Canada's privacy laws,"British paparazzi may soon come face-to-face with Canada's privacy laws as the arrival of Prince Harry and Meghan has already prompted a warning to the U.K press to back off or face legal action. But it's unclear what legal recourse the royal couple will have to keep news photographers away from their family. David Fraser, a Halifax-based privacy lawyer, says, when it comes to privacy claims in Canada, he hasn't found any related to celebrities and paparazzi. The lawsuits here that relate to invasions of privacy, most recently, deal with large-scale business data breaches, or hidden cameras, he said. ""So this is relatively new grounds that we're looking at, maybe because we don't have the same sort of paparazzi culture or the same sort of celebrity culture in Canada. But so far, a claim like this has not been made or at least hasn't gone to a published decision,"" he said.  ""It's not something that's really been tested a whole lot in Canada. We don't have a paparazzi culture."" Buckingham Palace announced Saturday that the prince and his wife will give up public funding and try to become financially independent. The couple is expected to spend most of their time in Canada while maintaining a home in England near Windsor Castle in an attempt to build a more peaceful life.  Video from Sky News showed Harry landing at Victoria's airport late Monday. The prince, Meghan and their eight-month-old son Archie were reportedly staying at a mansion on the island.  Lawyers for the couple sent a letter to British new outlets, accusing photographers of ""harassment,"" and claiming that paparazzi have permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island residence, attempting to photograph them at home using long-range lenses. They also allege that pictures of Meghan — on a hike with Archie and her two dogs, trailed by her security detail, on Vancouver Island on Monday — were taken by photographers hiding in the bushes.  ""There are serious safety concerns about how the paparazzi are driving and the risk to life they pose,"" the letter read. When it comes to privacy issues in Canada, there are a few ways Canadians can take action, says Iain MacKinnon, a Toronto-based lawyer.  One can argue ""intentional infliction of mental stress"" in which the conduct of the defendant has to be proven to be flagrant and outrageous; calculated to produce harm, and results in visible and provable illness, he said. There's also what's known as ""intrusion upon seclusion"" in which the defendant's conduct must be intentional or reckless and have invaded the plaintiff's private affairs ""without lawful reason."" Also, a ""reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish,"" MacKinnon said. And there's public disclosure of private facts, when one publicizes an aspect of another's private life — without consent — that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. The publication also would not be of legitimate concern to the public. ""And Meghan Markle walking her dog in a public space … would not fall under any of those,"" MacKinnon said. They may seek recourse under the B.C. Privacy Act which specifically says it's a violation for somebody to willfully and without a legal basis violate the privacy of someone else, and allows for someone to sue the alleged perpetrator. In making that determination, a judge is required to take into account the circumstances of the situation, the relationships between the parties and other people's rights and interests. There is an exemption, however, for journalistic publications and if the matter is of public interest.  ""Up until now, certainly when they've been part of the Royal Family and are highly public figures and are paid, their whole and entire lifestyle is paid for by public funds, then that's certainly one justification for arguing that what they do is a matter of public interest,"" MacKinnon said. ""As they may recede from public life and become more private citizens, that argument may be more difficult to make. But certainly today, this is headline news, them leaving England, leaving the Royal Family, moving to Canada. It's tough to say that this is not a matter of public interest."" Most people won't consider it to be highly offensive that someone took a picture of Meghan in public park because there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy, MacKinnon said. ""Now, if they're shooting with telephoto lenses into a house where Harry and Megan are staying and they're photographing them in their private lives inside a house, that might be a different story."" Fraser says, under the act, an invasion of privacy can also include surveillance. ""It's really going to depend upon the exact circumstances of what's alleged. But it certainly sounds like a group of photographers, paparazzi following them around might fit into the category of surveillance,"" he said. Fraser said even if one is in a public place, there's still an expectation of privacy. Being in a public park, there's a significantly reduced expectation of privacy. But when it comes to a photographer hiding in a bush, a court might say it's arguable that one has an expectation of privacy if they are in a place, looking around, not seeing other observers and somebody has hidden themselves, Fraser said. ""There would also probably be an element of kind of additional intrusion based on the fact that the person has hidden themselves and is covertly trying to surveil somebody,"" Fraser said. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms doesn't give anybody a particular privacy interest among individuals — only against the state. It does, however, provide a right for freedom of expression, which would be the right that the photographers have, Fraser said. ""So any court considering these issues would have to balance those interests which includes the rights of journalists to collect information, to disseminate that information, against a particular privacy interest."" Still, Fraser believes Harry and Meghan could find a ""level of sympathy"" in the courts  ""Given that, it seems that they're moving from the United Kingdom to Canada, least part time, in order to get away from this glare and get away from these invasions of privacy,"" he said.  It's unlikely that the royals would see a big cash windfall in the event their legal claims were successful. Privacy damages are relatively low or modest in Canada, Fraser said.  ""But I would expect that an injunction so a court order requiring the paparazzi to stay away might be something that they would seek as well."" And as MacKinnon noted, Harry and Meghan, through their lawyers, are probably attempting to set new ground rules. ""My guess is that they're trying to draw a new line in the sand here with both the Canadian media [and], more likely, the Fleet Street tabloids.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/prince-harry-meghan-privacy-laws-1.5435154,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-privacy-laws-harry-meghan-1.5434741 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-her-majesty-prince-harry-meghan-security-costs-canada-1.5434579 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harry-meghan-lose-royal-titles-1.5432208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-canada-jobs-1.5429202 https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-harry-victoria-meghan-archie-1.5434247,N/A
588,Alex Cooke,2020-01-26T10:00:00.778Z,Hop to it: Rescue group holds 'bunny blitz' adoption event,"Folks looking for a fluffy new friend will get the chance to meet some adoptable bunnies Sunday afternoon. The first rescue group in the Maritimes focused on the long-eared lagomorphs — 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue — is holding a ""bunny blitz"" in Halifax. More than a dozen of the twitchy-nosed animals can be scoped out by potential new owners. Denise Halliday, a volunteer with the organization, said they decided to hold the event following their first successful blitz in September. ""It's quite the day,"" she said. ""It's really interesting to have people come in and go, 'Oh my gosh, this is how many rabbits you guys have!'"" Halliday said the rabbit rescue was started nine years ago ""basically just because there was nowhere for rabbits to go."" Since then, she said the volunteer-run group has rescued and found new homes for more than 700 bunnies. Right now, there's about 17 rabbits up for adoption, but she said the group normally has between 20 and 30 in its care — though it can change suddenly if they take in a pregnant female.  The rescue doesn't have an actual shelter, so its volunteers foster the bunnies in their own homes. People can view available rabbits and apply for adoption through the 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue website. Halliday stressed that while the group wants to help the rabbits find homes, anyone looking to adopt needs to be aware of what's involved. ""They're living, breathing, sentient creatures, and if you're adopting, it needs to be a well-thought-out family decision that everyone is on board [with] and everyone is part of,"" she said.  ""The life expectancy is 10 to 14 years. So, you know, it's a long-term commitment."" Halliday said the rescue organization isn't just trying to find homes for abandoned bunnies. They're trying to keep bunnies from being abandoned in the first place. ""Finding them homes, it's really a Band-Aid,"" she said.  She said around 90 per cent of the rabbits they take in are found outside, which means they were likely dumped by someone who got bored or decided they were too much work. But Halliday noted that rabbits aren't native to Nova Scotia — only hares are — and said domestic rabbits can't fend for themselves or find food in the wild. ""It's the same as dumping a cat or dog. They can't survive outside by themselves,"" she said. She also said it's a bad idea for parents to get their child a pet rabbit because kids don't have the capacity to care for them properly. Halliday said bunnies are social creatures that like to be kept in pairs and that they shouldn't be cooped up in a cage all day. ""Having them in your kid's bedroom in a cage on top of the dresser, they're not going to be happy, they're going to miss that social aspect of being part of the main area, part of the family,"" she said. In fact, the rescue also discourages giving rabbits as gifts in general, so it closes down around Christmas and Easter. But she did say bunnies can make ""amazing"" family pets if the parents know the responsibility falls on them. The 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue bunny blitz is taking place at the Citadel Community Centre on Trollope Street Sunday afternoon from 3-7 p.m. Halliday said anyone is welcome, even those who aren't in the market for a new pet. She said people can come and find out more about what the rescue does and how to care for a bunny. ""Or if you just want to come snuggle,"" she said.

589,Marc Delbes,2019-12-28T01:54:02.697Z,Mikael Kingsbury wins top male athlete of the year honours,"Mikael Kingsbury is truly a dominant force. Kingsbury has nine wins in 11 World Cup starts the past two years. And the native of Deux Montagnes, Que., whose career average surpasses one victory for every two events (63 wins in 114 starts), shows no signs of slowing down. In February, Kingsbury won the moguls and dual moguls at the 2019 freestyle world championship — a goal that was close to his heart after a disappointing performance two years earlier in Spain. After capturing an eighth consecutive Crystal Globe as season champion, Kingsbury is also a repeat winner of the Lionel Conacher Award, given annually to Canada's top male athlete. Kingsbury received 15 of 71 votes (21.1 per cent) in a Canadian Press survey of sports editors, reporters and broadcasters in newsrooms across the country. Tennis player Denis Shapovalov, Edmonton Oilers centre Connor McDavid, St. Louis Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly and Winnipeg Blue Bombers running back Andrew Harris each got six votes. Tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime (3 votes) and Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray (1 vote) also made the list. Tennis player Bianca Andreescu was named female athlete of the year Thursday. The team of the year will be announced Saturday. Kingsbury said it was ""super special"" to regain top form in Utah after a disappointing performance in 2017. ""I didn't have the world championships I wanted in Spain, and in the 2019 season the world championships were in Deer Valley, and this is kind of where my dream started in mogul skiing,"" he said. ""When I watched my first Olympics on TV, it was in Deer Valley on that course."" WATCH | Kingsbury takes gold in 100th World Cup start: Voters recognized his accomplishments. ""He continues to dominate his sport as nobody has before,"" wrote Sylvain St-Laurent, head of sports for Le Droit d'Ottawa, to explain his vote for Kingsbury. ""I don't think it's wrong to say he's the best freestyle skier in the world and he can even be considered the best of all time, given his accomplishments,"" wrote Anthony Bruno of Global News. Another legend of the sport said Kingsbury's mental strength makes him so dominant. ""His passion for the sport, above all,"" said retired skier Jean-Luc Brassard, who won gold in moguls at the 1994 Olympics. ""He's also someone who has an insatiable pleasure to compete, not to mention his exemplary diligence in training."" Michel Hamelin, the moguls team trainer who has known Kingsbury since he was 10 years old, noted Kingsbury's ability to adapt to different circumstances. ""In moguls, it's difficult because the courses change constantly,"" he said. ""So, to win competition after competition the way Mick does, I find that exceptional."" Hamelin said the secret to Kingsbury's longevity at the top of the sport also reflects his undiminished love of taking on challenges. ""Like a kid who has fun with toys, Mick does that with his sport,"" Hamelin said. While he has fun in competition, the 27-year-old takes nothing for granted. ""I love watching videos of my sport. I have videos of all the World Cups since 2002, and I know the descents of all the winners,"" he said. Kingsbury also appears to be immune to pressure. ""I love competition. You see a lot of skiers training, but its a different story on course because of the stress and the pressure to do well,"" Kingsbury said. ""Me, I'm fueled by pressure, by competition. ""In the summer, what I miss the most is not skiing, it's being in the starting gate, the last to go, having all the spotlights on me and having the feeling that I can stand out."" Kingsbury appears to take pleasure in having a target on his back. ""We still have a few little things he hasn't tried yet in competition, whether it's jumps with grabs, a little higher amplitudes, with one more spin,"" Hamelin said. ""We should be going in that direction this year."" Kingsbury, for his part, says he still has goals to reach. ""In World Cups, it's far from a perfect record,"" he said. ""I'm not saying I'm going to win every race, but continuing to take risks, to ski to the best of my abilities and stay consistent,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/freestyleskiing/mikael-kingsbury-moguls-gold-ruka-finland-1.5409151,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/freestyleskiing/mikael-kingsbury-moguls-gold-ruka-finland-1.5388267 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/bianca-andreescu-injury-asb-classic-1.5408742 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/freestyleskiing/mikael-kingsbury-moguls-world-cup-opener-finland-1.5383569,N/A
590,Adam Miller,2020-01-26T18:39:10.076Z,Why Canada's 1st suspected coronavirus case is 'a world of difference' from SARS,"News that Toronto has its first suspected case of coronavirus may come as a shock to Canadians, but health officials have been preparing for this exact scenario for weeks.  ""We knew that there was going to be a case in Canada. We knew that there was probably going to be a case in Toronto,"" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, told CBC News.  ""It was just a question of time.""  The unidentified patient is a man in his 50s who was taken to Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with symptoms after travelling from the Chinese city of Wuhan to Guangzhou and then to Toronto on Wednesday.  Officials said he had limited external contact with people in Toronto when he arrived at his residence, before being taken by paramedics to hospital in stable condition. ""No one would be surprised if this is a positive case,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.  ""It appears that this may have arrived on our doorstep and we're ready.""  McGeer, who contracted SARS in 2003 while working as a physician on the front lines of the epidemic, says she believes the risk to the public with this case is low.  ""I'm not concerned about transmission from this case at all in Toronto,"" she said, adding that Toronto Public Health officials have already begun the process of contacting people who may have come in contact with the patient.   ""There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.""  McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.  There are two types of transmission with a coronavirus like this: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission,"" the World Health Organization in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said at a news conference Saturday that officials would be looking to identify passengers on the flight the patient took to Toronto who were within three rows for potential risk.  Bogoch said that while the suspected case is not unexpected, by no means does it indicate that there is a wider outbreak in Toronto.  ""I think that people should just go about their lives as they normally do,"" he said. ""But also be aware of the news and follow the situation closely as things change.""  Canada has already ruled out several suspected cases of the coronavirus in Quebec and Bogoch said that is an indication that the systems in place are working.  ""Thankfully, those weren't cases, but at least it demonstrated that people knew what to do and where to go if they had symptoms suggestive of infection with this coronavirus,"" he said. ""It almost was a bit of a test of the system.""  Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director for infection prevention control at Sunnybrook Hospital, said the patient was immediately isolated for further investigation, placed in a negative pressure room with protective equipment and was in stable condition.  Watch: How officials are dealing with public fear over coronavirus Bogoch said the work is not just being done inside the hospital, but preventing further transmission in the community and beyond.  ""This is one case, this is still an evolving situation and of course we might get additional cases as well,"" he said.  ""But we are prepared and the system appears to be working.""  We still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, which had a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""We are in a very, very different place than when we were responding to SARS,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, president of Public Health Ontario. ""One of the things that is very different is that we know what the virus is. We have a fast, reliable test and that really is a game changer."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the epidemic that killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003.  Compared with the 2003 SARS outbreak, the flow of information worldwide and speed at which diagnostic tests have been developed has improved dramatically.  ""The speed with which people identified SARS was amazing for 17 years ago, but it still took weeks,"" McGeer said. ""Here, the problem was recognized the last week of December, tests were available around the world 10 days later.""  Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. McGeer said health-care workers were ""unprepared to take precautions"" during the SARS epidemic due to a lack of diagnostic tests and experience with outbreaks. ""If you had told people before SARS that a new disease would emerge in China and cause outbreaks in Toronto, they would have laughed you out of the room,"" she said. ""And the situation now is very different. We know what these risks are. We know how they're going to come at us and what you've seen is the perfect example of that working.""  McGeer said the patient clearly received information that he needed to contact authorities when he had symptoms arise, which he did, and the sample was identified by officials within a day.  ""Everybody took the right precautions,"" she said. ""It's a world of difference.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-health-officials-reaction-1st-case-coronavirus-canada-1.5440803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-social-media-misinformation-1.5440334 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,N/A

592,Amanda Pfeffer,2019-05-15T09:26:48.647Z,"Hate crime unit never existed, Ottawa police say","The Ottawa Police Service says it never had a dedicated hate crime unit — despite plenty of evidence that it did, and disbelief from anti-racism advocates who say they've worked with its officers. Questions about the hate crime unit arose last week after someone scrawled racist graffiti on a black family's Ottawa home. When CBC asked police whether the hate crime unit was looking into the incident, a spokesperson initially said the unit had been retired. According to a follow-up statement attributed to Supt. Chris Renwick of the criminal investigations directorate, ""The Ottawa Police Service does not have a Hate Crime Unit, in fact we never had a dedicated investigative unit for hate crimes."" Instead, Renwick said, criminal acts ""motivated by hate are assigned and investigated by our General Assignment Units (GAS).... Our Security and Intelligence Section (SIS) can offer investigative support to the GAS investigators during an investigation [into a crime] which is motivated by hate or extremism."" In yet another clarification the following day, Renwick explained that a constable position was created in the early 1990s ""to address hate crimes,"" but that the position ""has an intelligence focus and not an investigative one."" Investigating hate-motivated crimes remains the job of general assignment officers, Renwick explained. That appears to contradict specific references to a hate crime unit in public statements and media reports dating back years, including a reference on the OPS website and in an internal policy document obtained by CBC. According to numerous reports, a hate crime unit was created in 1993 in response to the 1989 death of Château Laurier waiter Alain Brosseau, who was murdered while walking home by attackers who mistakenly identified him as gay. At the time, the investigative unit was billed as the first of its kind in Canada. In 2008, then mayor Larry O'Brien heaped praise on the unit on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of its creation, declaring Jan. 15 Hate Crime Awareness Day in the capital. According to an OPS policy document created in 2002 and amended most recently in January 2017, there is a ""hate crime unit"" that's responsible for collecting data, tracking trends, educating OPS members and others about hate crimes, supporting Crown prosecutors, and liaising with affected communities. According to the document, the unit was led by a section head whose responsibilities included ensuring ""that a complete investigation is carried out."" The document suggests the unit included more than one officer. There are also numerous references to a hate crime unit on the police service's own website, including this one, which advises people reporting a suspected hate crime that their complaints will be ""forwarded to the Hate Crime Section for investigation. An investigator from the Hate Crime Section will contact you."" Complicating matters is that several police sources tell CBC the hate crime unit did exist, but has not had dedicated officers assigned to it in more than a year. News that police are now saying the section never existed came as a shock to activists who thought they'd been working with a specialized hate crime unit all along. ""I was very taken aback,"" said Aisha Sherazi, a past member of the police-community liaison group COMPAC, which was recently disbanded and replaced with the new Community Equity Council. COMPAC members had frequent interactions with officers belonging to what they thought was a hate crime unit, Sherazi said. ""So Ottawa police has had this hate crime unit, and it's very important to communities who are marginalized routinely. There's that safety net, that feeling that something is going to be taken seriously,"" Sherazi said. Sen. Vern White, a former Ottawa police chief, said if the hate crime unit has in fact been disbanded, it's likely due to lack of resources. ""The police do not have the resources to manage the number of complaints they have — not just when it comes to hate crimes — I think it's across the board,"" White said. White said he's not sure a dedicated hate crime unit is necessary, as long as hate crimes are being properly investigated by general assignment officers. But Sherazi and other anti-hate advocates believe a dedicated unit is more important now than ever. In 2017, Statistics Canada reported a sharp increase in hate crime in cities across Canada, including Ottawa. Ottawa's hate crime rate was 9.3 per 100,000 residents in 2017, compared to 9.1 in Toronto. The Canadian average for metropolitan areas was 6.9. Amira Elghawaby, an Ottawa human rights advocate and founding board member of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, said a dedicated unit is critical to connect small incidents to larger trends, particularly in the current context. She noted that the 2017 mosque shooting in Quebec City that killed six and injured 19 was preceded by a spike in relatively minor hate-motivated attacks on the same community. Elghawaby said if a hate crime unit has indeed been disbanded, the community should have been involved in that discussion.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-police-hate-crime-unit-1.5130282,[],N/A
593,Anonymous,2020-01-24T20:55:21.569Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence can keep working","An obstetrician at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital accused of sexual wrongdoing by two female patients whose final day of work was supposed to be Friday is now allowed to continue working. On Thursday, the Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons announced Dr. Manivasan Moodley would face a hearing over allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. As a foreign-trained doctor, Moodley is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship was being withdrawn, and his last day of work was supposed to be Friday. However, the college announced today that another sponsor had come forward, which means Moodley will be able to continue practising medicine. His hearing over accusations of professional misconduct and incompetence is scheduled to begin next month. On Thursday night, about 80 people rallied outside the Cape Breton Regional Hospital to show their support for Moodley. College registrar Dr. Gus Grant said the significant public response to the allegations against Moodley nearly scared off the two female complainants at the heart of the misconduct hearing. ""All would agree that Dr. Moodley is owed due process and the college is going to deliver due process,"" said Grant. ""All would agree, also, that these women are owed safety, freedom from intimidation and privacy.""   He said the public outcry in support of Moodley failed to consider the complainants' point of view, and that could have derailed the hearing. ""The least fair outcome would be if these allegations were dismissed simply because the complainants chose not to give evidence,"" Grant said. However, the complainants are still ready to proceed with the hearing, he said. The registrar also said it is important to separate Moodley's license troubles from the allegations against him. Grant said without a sponsor or supervisor, Moodley simply couldn't practice, and the decision to withdraw or step forward as a sponsor is up to those individuals. Moodley was not available for an interview, but in an email, said he was grateful for the support of the community, his colleagues and patients. ""I now know for sure that I am part of this community and that as much as I will provide unique care for them, they will stand up for me if ever I am challenged again,"" Moodley said. Dr. Margaret Fraser, head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said she was very pleased with the extension of Moodley's licence. She said Dr. Jeremy Hilliard had stepped forward to sponsor Moodley and Dr. Angus Gardner has agreed to be his supervisor. ""I think it's the right decision to allow him to continue until the college process has been gone through,"" Fraser said. She also said it's not clear if the rally and other public support helped Moodley get his licence renewed. ""I don't know if that had any effect, but certainly it was heartening for Dr. Moodley to see that his patients supported him and that his colleagues supported him in this difficult time."" Grant said comments on social media had also weighed on the complainants' minds this week. Although some were in favour of Moodley, others suggested Cape Breton must be desperate for doctors if the community was rallying to support a physician facing serious sexual allegations. Fraser said that's not a fair comment. ""This man is being judged in the court of public opinion,"" she said. ""No decision has been made regarding his licensing. No decision has been made regarding his culpability in this matter ... so until the college has gone through its process, it is unfair to judge this man prematurely."" The college alleges that in the case of one complainant, Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in a sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. In the case of another complainant, the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace.

595,Bethany Lindsay,2018-07-20T23:50:30.832Z,Here's (some of) what's wrong with B.C.'s taxi system,"Anyone who's ever waited — and waited and waited — to grab a cab home to the suburbs at closing time on the Granville Strip knows there's a serious taxi problem in B.C. For some people, the problem is obvious — the province doesn't allow Uber, Lyft or any other ride-hailing services that might fill the service gap. But a technical report released this week by transportation expert Dan Hara, who holds a PhD in economics, suggests the roots of B.C.'s taxi troubles go much deeper than that. It reveals complaints from just about everyone who has a stake in personal transportation and analyzes how the current regulatory system erects roadblocks to improvement. Mohan Kang, president of the B.C. Taxi Association, said he hasn't read Hara's full report, but he's optimistic about the changes that are recommended, including an immediate 15-per-cent increase in taxi fleets across the province. ""Dr. Hara has touched some of the important issues,"" Kang said. ""The taxi industry should be prepared to be competitive and to serve the general public better, and he's an expert in those things."" Hara recommends a slew of fixes to the current system, including throwing out the requirement for a Class 4 driver's licence, funding more accessible taxi service, developing a usage-based insurance option for part-time drivers and establishing a provincial authority to issue chauffeur permits. Here's why he says it's necessary to overhaul the current system:  Where to begin? There's the fact that any driver who picks up passengers at the airport needs to have a chauffeur permit for multiple municipalities, which means multiple criminal record checks. There are local regulations in cities like Vancouver which, for the most part, only allows pickups by Vancouver taxi companies. Then there's the Passenger Transportation Board, an independent tribunal that reviews applications from taxi operators and issues licences. The current legal framework allows competitors to argue against those applications, saying there are already enough taxis in service. According to Hara, that means that instead of determining how many taxis are actually needed, the PTB is left to act ""as a referee and judge in a contest between applicants and competitors who oppose the application."" And of course taxis still need municipal licences, so city councils can block any new applications, as Vancouver has done in the past.  In downtown Vancouver on a Friday night, it can take more than an hour to clear out the lines of people waiting for taxis, a situation that sometimes leads to drunken brawls, according to Hara. Resort communities like Whistler and Kelowna, on the other hand, are more likely to have problems with seasonal shortages. That's because the PTB only issues licences for a fixed number of taxis in specific operating areas, usually well below what's needed during peak times, Hara says. But he adds that cab companies also have trouble finding enough drivers because of the need for a Class 4 licence — something that would take three years for a new immigrant to obtain. Meanwhile, disabled passengers in cities complain they're frequently told that no accessible taxis are available when they need a ride, and smaller communities often don't have any accessible cabs at all.  The current system isn't making drivers happy, either. To begin with, insurance is too expensive — as much as $32,000 a year, according to Hara. Some of the cabbies he spoke with also mentioned the high rates they pay to lease or rent taxi licences, and said they might prefer driving for a ride-hailing company.  Many of the details in Hara's report were lost in the uproar over the news that ride-hailing likely won't be available in B.C. until the fall of 2019 — just the latest in a series of delays. The latest timeline takes into account ICBC's estimate that it will need at least six to 12 months to develop the right approach to insuring drivers for ride-hailing services, and that can only happen after a change in legislation. But Hara's report suggests that another major sticking point has been figuring out how to cushion the financial blow for those who hold or lease expensive licences to operate existing taxis. In other parts of the world, taxi regulation has remained unchanged even after the introduction of ride-hailing, leaving companies with limited ability to compete while they watch the value of their businesses decline, according to Hara. He writes that any new system needs to protect ""the value of historic investments"" made by drivers and taxi companies. To that end, Hara recommends that all new vehicles be required to pay a fee per trip in an attempt to level the playing field.

596,Anonymous,2020-01-24T18:46:45.253Z,Canadian Wildlife Federation expanding programs to engage youth,"The Canadian Wildlife Federation is expanding two programs to offer youth further opportunity to explore and connect with the wild. The recently launched Wild Outside program is designed to connect teens aged 15 to 18 with the outdoors with the aim of developing conservation initiatives in their hometowns. The Canadian Conservation Corps targets those aged 18 to 30 and aims to help participants gain hands-on conservation experience and the opportunity to connect with CWF partners across the country. Wild Outside — a free program — launched earlier this month in Charlottetown, Halifax, Calgary and Toronto.  ""We just want to get youth excited about nature and conservation,"" said Irene MacAulay, Charlottetown's youth leadership specialist with the federation. ""For those youth that are already excited about nature and conservation we want to give them the tools to make an impact."" The plan is to spread the program to 16 more cities and more than 1,000 young Canadians this year. ""Starting off we're going to be doing some pretty regular conservation projects like making bat houses and doing litter cleanups,"" she said. Then participants will have the opportunity to connect with climate leaders in the region to see what particular organizations are looking for, MacAulay said. ""It'll be like a collaboration between like maybe scientists who actually know what is going on and youth who can see creative ways to fix problems."" She said there will be skating, biking and kayaking available to participants. For Charlottetown, she said the group is looking for 10 to 15 participants. ""Bigger cities have bigger groups,"" she said. MacAulay said more people are spending time on cellphones and less time outside and at the same time are becoming ""more and more stressed out about the environment."" ""We want to give them like an outlet for all this stress and anxiety about climate change,"" she said. The Wild Outside program requires participants to dedicate 120 hours over a year. MacAulay said the program wants to hold onto participants as long as possible, but people can take part for shorter periods of time. MacAulay was part of the Canadian Conservation Corps program earlier this year and through that she decided to take on her role with the Wild Outside program. ""We did a sea-kayaking adventure in Tofino. That was a big part of the conservation corps, that was 10 days,"" she said. She said after that the group spread out across Canada for various projects. Some went to the Yukon to study salmon spawning. ""I got to go to Peterborough where I worked at a conservation day camp all summer,"" she said.

It is an effort to tide them over while they search for new buyers for their wood. Jeff Bishop, executive director of Forest Nova Scotia, helped create the new program. He said much of the money would go to forest workers dealing with payments for equipment. By freeing up loan payments, Bishop said there might be money to pay workers or to cover other business expenses.  But Bishop said it would not help everyone in the industry who is struggling with big bills. ""That's the hard part of looking at a program like this, that looks at assistance,"" said Bishop. ""You know, when you look at it, there's going to be people that it's just not going to help. ""You hope that it helps as many people that are are willing and able to stay working in the sector."" The Nova Scotia government is guaranteeing the loans, meaning taxpayers will be on the hook if any of that money cannot be repaid. The province is setting aside roughly $5 million for the program. It's the latest aid to be rolled out by the McNeil government in recent weeks to try to cushion the blow from Northern Pulp's decision to shutter its mill in Pictou County. The company will need to cease operations in a week to comply with a law enacted five years ago mandating the closure of the provincially owned effluent treatment plant that has processed the mill's wastewater for a generation. According to a news release issued Friday afternoon, the loans will be available through the 16 credit unions that offer the Small Business Loan Guarantee program. Bishop said the plan was to create a line of credit that people could access for up to a year. Then that money would need to be repaid over the three following years.

598,Susan Bonner,2020-01-25T15:50:34.410Z,Holocaust survivor in famous Auschwitz liberation photo says rising anti-Semitism 'scares me',"Miriam Ziegler sees it as a call of duty: She's going back to a place of horror to honour those who did not make it out — and to remind the world what unchecked hate can do. On Jan. 27, the 84-year-old Canadian will stand alongside dozens of other Holocaust survivors from around the world as they gather in Poland to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. ""All the six million… I feel I have to honour them,"" said Ziegler. She was nine when the Russians liberated the camp, making Ziegler one of the youngest people to have survived Auschwitz. The number of survivors dwindles every year, which means this year's ceremony is likely to be the last major international gathering of its kind. More than 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Nazi regime made it the key killing ground for its plan to exterminate the Jewish people. It was surreal to meet Ziegler in her lovely condo in north Toronto. An elegant and proud mother and grandmother, she surrounds herself with family photos and mementoes of a life well-lived in Canada. She recounted the trauma and terror she endured as a child during the Second World War in Poland. It's painful to relive. For years, she didn't even tell her own children. And for years, Ziegler herself didn't know that she had appeared in one of the most famous and haunting photos from the end of the war. The image shows Ziegler standing among a group of children behind the wire at Auschwitz. Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on Jan. 27, 1945. The photo appeared in newspapers worldwide. The image is deceiving — the children don't look emaciated, like other concentration camp prisoners. That's because they are wearing several layers of clothing under their striped prison garb. The Germans had fled Auschwitz a few days earlier, and the kids had scavenged leftover clothing from the abandoned barracks in order to stay warm.  Ziegler, second from left, is wearing an old, oversized coat and holds out her arm.  At the time, the Russian soldiers were asking the children their names. In response, Ziegler showed them her tattoo: prisoner number A16891. ""In the camp, they didn't call you by name. They only knew you by number,"" said Ziegler. ""So I wanted to show the Russians."" Before they abandoned the camp, German soldiers led tens of thousands of prisoners on a march out, telling them they would be taken to safety. Ziegler and a cousin joined the line, but a great aunt intervened and told the children to stay behind. She told Ziegler, ""'No! You are not going. If you have to live, you can live here. You are not well enough to march.' And she dragged us [back] and she saved our lives, because [the soldiers] killed everybody ... On the march, they killed every single person."" That's how a group of hungry, sick, freezing children found themselves at the gates of Auschwitz to greet the Russians. Ziegler remembers the moment clearly. ""Of course — I remember everything since I was four years [old]."" Ziegler wants to put the memories that have tormented her to good use while she can. The Holocaust can be hard to comprehend, especially for a generation that has never known war. But she's been amazed at how young people respond. After speaking to a class of high school students, Ziegler was overwhelmed with thank-you notes explaining how her story had helped make the horror real for them. The students told her that reading a book about it was one thing, ""'but to meet a person that went through it and the way you told it... We never believed it before. Now we believe it.'"" Ziegler was four when she saw her first murder: Nazis shot and killed a buggy driver that her mother had hired to try to take Miriam to safety in the countryside, outside their hometown of Radom, Poland. Before that, she'd been a happy child in a large, wealthy extended family that owned several large clothing and general goods stores. But beginning in the late 1930s, Ziegler lived in hiding, sometimes with her parents, sometimes with strangers. She was hidden in farms, work camps or compounds. She was taking refuge in an attic with several people during one particularly gruesome Nazi raid. ""I heard them coming up the stairs. I hid myself under a pile of rubbish and clothes. I pushed myself underneath and covered myself. And they shot everybody in that attic... I was lucky. This was my first real escape from being killed."" In 1944, her family was taken to Auschwitz. She remembers the train trip, the crowded cattle cars filled with terrified people. When they arrived, she was separated from her parents. Tattooed. Shaved. And then sent to the showers.  She was eight years old. ""By that time, we knew already about the gas chambers. From the ghettos in the camps, we knew that this is what they were doing. They were killing everybody and we didn't think we would come out from the showers."" Ziegler lived a year in daily fear, but she survived. She would later learn her mother, grandmother and an aunt had also survived. But not her father. ""He was taken away. I never saw him again. He was put through the gas chamber."" In the final months of the war, the infamous gas chambers at Birkenau were shut down. But Ziegler says the medical experiments continued, and she did not escape that. She doesn't remember much beyond that she was taken to a room one day with instruments and people in white lab coats. And she remembers the pain. She knows it won't be easy to return to the scene of this trauma in the coming days. When she attended the 70th anniversary in 2015, she caught a glimpse of herself in a film clip taken on the day the camp was liberated. ""A ghost,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it. I didn't believe it was me."" What happened to Ziegler as a child was unfathomable to the woman watching. The 2015 trip took a physical toll on her that lasted months. She fell ill when she returned to Toronto. At the time, Ziegler was caring for her husband, Roman, another Holocaust survivor, who suffers from Alzheimer's.  The Auschwitz anniversary experience left her weaker, but Ziegler said she has no choice but to do it again. She sees hatred on the rise again in the world and wants to speak out. ""It scares me. And that's why I want as many people as I can to tell my story to. I wouldn't want anybody to go through what we went through, it doesn't matter what nation. And that's why I'm scared.""

Mike Girardin and Jesse Reimer, who work for Racka Roofing, based in Blumenort, Man., heard Teresa Byra scream, but first thought it was children playing. ""We decided to investigate and the closer we go to the river, it became more apparent that this was a woman in danger,"" Girardin said. The roofers are now being called heroes for rescuing Byra, who had fallen through thin ice on the Red River near Selkirk, Man., about 35 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. ""Not a lot of thinking happened. I ran over there and grabbed her arm because she was literally hanging onto a little ice ledge and there were large chunks of ice floating down the river,"" Girardin told CBC's Marjorie Dowhos Thursday. The men pulled Byra out of the water, but the ice was so thin near the shore, all three of them fell into knee-deep water. ""It's a little surreal thinking about it now. We didn't realize the danger we put ourselves into, but it kind of worked out for everyone,"" Girardin said. Once the trio were safe on shore, Girardin and Reimer put Byra in her car to warm up and waited for paramedics to arrive to make sure she didn't have hypothermia, but she was OK. As for the men, they were just cold and wet. ""We were soaking wet. All of our winter clothes were turning to ice at that point, so we decided we were going to shut it down and go home,"" Girardin said. ""We had to go to Walmart to buy new socks before we went home."" Byra said she's shaken after her brush with death. She was on a dock Tuesday to take photos for a memorial she was making for a friend who died, when she slipped on the ice. ""The water was open where I fell and it just carried me down, probably 20 or 30 feet with the current, I'm not sure,"" she said. Byra was screaming for help when she saw Girardin and Reimer coming down the hill. ""It looked like they were coming in slow motion. I thought they weren't going to make it in time, because the bigger ice was coming,"" she said. Teresa Byra describes her heroic rescue: Once they pulled her out, they had to drag Byra to the car, she said. ""I couldn't walk. I had no feeling in my legs or my hands. It was terrible,"" she said. The next day, Girardin and Reimer were back on the roof to finish the work they started when Byra returned with her daughter and grandchild to see them. ""I introduced them and I said, 'This is what you saved me for. My kids still have me, my grandkids still have me.' I have four kids and I have four grandkids and one stepdaughter,"" Byra said. ""I said … 'You guys are my heroes. You're my guardian angels."" Girardin said he's never done anything like it before. ""We keep hearing the word 'hero' thrown around, and it's a little surreal,"" he said. Girardin and Reimer are being recognized by the local RCMP detachment for their heroism in what was a life-or-death situation. The men are nominated for two Canada-wide awards, the Royal Canadian Humane Association's bravery award and the St. John's Ambulance lifesaving award, Const. David Wong said. ""I feel strongly that these two gentlemen definitely deserve some recognition of some sort,"" Wong said. ""If I could give them the awards today, I would."" The dock where Byra slipped and fell was cordoned off, Wong said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/hero-roofers-rescue-red-river-1.5359421,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/dog-rescue-winnipeg-firefighters-1.5349165 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/man-rescued-fire-home-west-end-winnipeg-1.5349569 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/deer-rescued-st-jean-baptiste-1.5353871,N/A
600,Anonymous,2020-01-15T22:58:04.245Z,What we know about Iran plane crash victims who called Toronto home,"Parents with children, university students and professionals from across the Greater Toronto Area were among the 176 victims of an ill-fated Ukrainian airliner that was downed in Tehran on Jan.8. Fifty-seven Canadians are among the dead, with a total of 138 passengers headed to Canada. Here is how family, friends and colleagues are remembering the dozens of victims with ties to Toronto. Mojtaba Abbasnezhad, a first-year international PhD student at U of T, was among those killed. Pooya Poolad told CBC News that Abbasnezhad, his close friend and classmate, was an Iranian citizen and was living in Toronto while studying electrical engineering. Poolad was supposed to be on the trip to Iran with his friend but had to cancel. He says he was in Toronto texting with Abbasnezhad, who also went by Soroush, at the airport before his flight home.  Maryam Agha Miri, her husband Shahrokh Eghbali and their daughter Shahzad Eghbali were heading home from a family wedding in Iran when they were all killed.  Shahzad was a Grade 3 student at Darlington Public School in North York, the Toronto District School Board confirmed. Shahrokh had his master's degree in electrical engineering from Northern Illinois University and worked in software development and information technology. Maryam had a degree in accounting from a university in Iran.  Shahrokh's niece says their family and friends are devastated by the news.  ""It's one thing to lose a loved one unexpectedly,"" Marjon Eghbali, said. ""To lose multiple loved ones ... It just all feels so senseless and there's so many emotions of devastation and anger.""  Marjon and her family were saddened by the plane crash whey they first heard about it, but didn't know they were directly impacted.  ""It wasn't until my cousin called in the middle of the night and said, 'They're thinking it was Uncle Shahrokh's plane that came down,'"" she said.  ""We spent the entire night just looking over the Internet for any information."" It wasn't until the passenger list was released that they had ""the confirmation.""  ""It still doesn't seem real,"" Marjon said. ""My family feels the same, just numb, it's a lot to process.""  Mohsen Salahi and Mahsa Amirliravi had been teachers at Cestar College in North York for three years, the school said in a statement. ""Mohsen and Mahsa were fantastic teachers, touching countless students' lives during their time here at the college. But they were also tremendous individuals, forming strong bonds with many staff and faculty, and they will be greatly missed by fellow instructors, the academics team, and the college as a whole,"" the college said.  Michael Soeizi became a friend of the couple after meeting Salahi while studying at Ryerson University and playing soccer together. ""All I remember is how humble he was, how nice he was, how faithful he was,"" Soeizi said of Salahi. Now he's struggling to make sense of their loss. ""God takes the better people much sooner than the others."" The brother and sister are being remembered as bright lights among the University of Toronto community. Those who knew them say both were always ready to help lift up the students around them and to make the world a better place. The pair were instrumental members of the STEM Fellowship, a not-for-profit organization meant to equip students with real-world skills in the sciences. Mohammad Asadi Lari had just embarked on a lifelong dream to become a doctor. His ambition didn't surprise his friend Ahmed Hasan, who said Asadi Lari had been working on a simultaneous medical degree and doctorate. ""I feel resentful that someone who had so much that he wanted to give to the world, who had so much that he wanted to accomplish, was unfairly taken away,"" Hasan said. ""It just breaks me to think that now he can't complete that."" Zeynab Asadi Lari stood out from the start, her first-year biology professor Fiona Rawle told CBC News. The first day of class, Zeynab immediately went and introduced herself to her professor, asking questions that distinguished her from other students. ""She was always asking why,"" Rawle said.  Zeynab had been especially concerned with improving mental health services for students and mentoring those who needed assistance around her. Because of the way she brought people together, those who knew her said her absence will be immediately felt by her peers.  ""As a professor, one of our greatest joys is to get to watch students pursue their dreams and I have this incredible sadness that I won't get to watch Zeynab pursue her dreams,"" Rawle said.  Omid Arsalani told CBC News he found out early Wednesday morning that his 30-year-old sister, Evin Arsalani, was among those who died. She was traveling back to Ajax, Ont., with her husband, Hiva Molani, 38, and one-year-old daughter Kurdia. Arsalani says the trio arrived in Iran on Dec. 8 for a wedding, and the last time he spoke to his sister was Jan. 2 — her 30th birthday.  ""She was happy, she saw family members, all the people in the family she hasn't seen in years,"" Arsalani said. When he boarded the plane, Mahmoud Attar, 69, was planning to bring some things back from Iran for his eldest daughter to decorate her new home in North York, his sister Zohreh Attar said. Attar was retired and called Richmond Hill, Ont., home. He'd been living there since 2007. He had two daughters.  ""That's how Mahmoud was. He was always thinking about others, never himself,"" said his sister. Zohreh said she had been concerned about the possibility of war in the days leading up to the plane disaster. Before takeoff, she says, she texted her brother to tell him to be careful. ""He had a passion for all people,"" said Zohreh. ""He was active, he was happy. He loved life and he loved Canada."" Mohammed Amin Beiruti was a PhD student at the University of Toronto studying computer science. A professor said Beiruiti was designing technologies for Next Generation Internet, a project aimed at improving transparency, inclusivity and privacy online. ""He was a very kind, caring and peaceful young man, and wanted to make the world a better place,"" said Yashar Ganjali. ""He told me he was interested in technology since he thought it can ease the lives of human beings, and he wanted to have a role in that."" Asghar Dhirani, from Markham, was a respected tour leader in Toronto's Shia Muslim community, who along with his wife Razia, had taken more than 1,000 Muslims on pilgrimages to revered sites in Iran, Iraq and Syria. Dhirani's children, Arif and Rehana, had been awaiting their parents' arrival in Toronto Wednesday. His wife made it home safely on a different flight.  ""My dad was my best friend,"" Rehana told CBC News in a tearful interview Wednesday. ""He was a hero, not only to me but to many people."" Hamidreza Djavadi, known to neighbours as Sam, and his 17-year-old son Kian were on their way home to Canada after visiting Iran during the Christmas break, according to a cousin.  Before boarding, Kian had texted a friend to say he was waiting for his plane and would be in touch when he arrived. He never did. Juan Castro, a former employer and friend of Kian's, told CBC News the pair lived with family in Mississauga, but spent summers in the London, Ont. area.  ""He was just an excellent worker,"" Castro recalled. ""When he started working for us, his mom came by the next day and told us he has folded up his uniform T-shirt and placed it under his pillow because he was so excited."" Behnaz Ebrahimi had travelled to Iran with her nine-year-old son, Rahmtin Ahmadi, to visit her mother, a friend told CBC News. Behnaz was a member of the Ontario Public Services Employees Union who worked as a property valuation analyst, the union said in a statement. She'd studied at the University of Tehran where she received a degree in computer engineering. In Toronto, she became a contract property inspector, completed a degree at Seneca College and was one exam away from completing her Canadian Residential Appraiser designation. ""Her coworkers knew her as a kind-hearted person and a dedicated mother,"" the union said. ""She will be dearly missed."" Aurora, Ont.-based dentist Parisa Eghbalian and her daughter Reera Esmaeilion were also identified by family as victims of the crash. ""She was a wonderful woman,"" Hamed Esmaeilion said of his wife. ""And I still love her."" In an interview with CBC News, Esmaeilion described his daughter Reera as a bright and athletic. He said she spoke English, French and Farsi fluently and also excelled in soccer. ""She was the best girl in the world, I think."" Mohammad Mahdi Elyasi was a mechanical engineer who helped teach English to refugees, his friend Mohammed Yadegari said. The pair met about two years ago and became fast friends, even establishing a startup to help Canadian farmers. ""He was not just a friend to me. He was like my brother,"" said Yadegari. ""Now I am alone in this world."" Elyasi had studied at both the University of Toronto and the University of Alberta. He had applied for permanent residency in Canada and had been waiting about one year before his life was cut short. ""He didn't have a passport, he wasn't a citizen of Canada, but he always cared about Canada ... He was looking for peace,"" said Yadegari.  Faezeh Falsafi was travelling with her two children Dorsa, 17, and Daniel, 8, at the time of the crash. She held a master's degree in mechanical engineering, said her husband Alireza Ghandchi, who was not travelling with his family due to work. His son, Daniel, was ""very cute with a nice laugh,"" Ghandchi said. His daughter, Dorsa, was just days away from turning 18, he added. She was an artist, animator and performer who loved Queen and the film Bohemian Rhapsody. ""I intend to play Queen songs at the funeral for my daughter,"" he told CBC News while fighting back tears. Faraz Falsafi moved to Toronto to pursue a career after earning a master's degree in computer science at McGill University in 2014.  His friend Alborz Zamyadi remembers him as a skilled computer engineer who loved exploring forests like the Mont-Tremblant provincial park, spending hours outdoors in search of the perfect photo. The two met at a dinner party in 2015 and quickly became close. ""It was actually a gang of four of us. We were so close and doing a lot things together,"" he said. His longtime friend Alireza Teimoury said Falsafi was returning from a family event in Iran when the plane went down.  Shakiba Feghahati first moved to Canada with her husband, Shahin Moghaddam, seven years ago. They had been married 14 years. On Dec. 10, she and their son, Rosstin, left for Iran to visit family — it was one day after Rosstin's birthday. ""It was her first and last flight"" since moving to Toronto, Shahin said through tears.  ""She was my angel ... my support, my everything in life,"" he said. ""We built our dream house together shoulder-to- shoulder and day by day in these years we built our life, full of memories, good memories."" Their son Rosstin was ""super smart,"" spoke four languages, loved volleyball and emojis and was always laughing. Shahin is now left to retrieve their bodies — the only thing he says will give him any measure of peace. ""How precious they were... I'm just sorry I couldn't be with them forever."" Iman and Parinaz Ghaderpanah were volunteers with the non-profit Iranian-Canadian group Tirgan. They were in Iran to help raise money for an upcoming arts festival, spokesperson Mehrdad Ariannejad confirmed. Iman was self-employed and worked in the mortgage industry, Ariannejad said. Ariannejad worked directly with Parinaz and called her ""energetic, positive, warm and very dedicated. She and her husband were deeply in love and both were very active in community affairs."" Parinaz was an employee at the Royal Bank of Canada, the bank confirms. Friend Michael Soeizi said Parinaz was a fixture at volunteer and community-run events. ""She was very ambitious about her work,"" he said. ""She was always energetic, she was always there to support."" Kiana Ghasemi, 19, was on her way to Toronto to study at George Brown College. She was about to begin her first semester in its computer programmer analyst program.  Ghasemi had visited Toronto in past summers, but wanted to make the move to live in the city permanently, her cousin Dorsa Ghasemi told CBC Toronto.  ""She was in love with Toronto,"" Ghasemi said. ""She was coming with lots of hopes, dreams, goals."" Mahdieh Ghassemi, 38, was an award-winning architect,who designed numerous Toronto-area stores, churches and other buildings, a friend told CBC News. Ghassemi had studied architecture in Iran. After coming to Canada, she worked to re-establish her credentials, quickly rising up the ranks because of her skills. Her children, Arsan, 11, and Arnica, 8, were also killed in the crash.  Suzan Golbabapour was a Toronto-based real estate agent and personal trainer, and ""a bright light within our community,"" her employer Re/Max says. ""Our condolences to all that had the pleasure of knowing Suzan,"" Re/Max said in a statement, adding Golbabapour will be ""greatly missed by her friends, family, colleagues and clients."" Saharnaz Haghjoo had been an employee of YWCA Toronto since 2015 and helped newcomer women and girls get the services they needed to settle in Canada.  Her daughter Elsa Jadidi was at a campus of the Brampton-based Wali ul Asr Islamic school. Haghjoo ""was a great supporter of the school and always made it a point to express her gratitude and appreciation to Elsa's teachers,"" the school said in a statement. Elsa, it said, ""was a wonderful girl who was always smiling and will [God willing] continue to do so in heaven."" Sadaf Hajiaghavand was a student at York University studying human resources, who also worked as a model and host. Friends remembered her infectious laughter and always impeccable sense of style. ""She used to just laugh. The happiest person I knew in Toronto,"" said Khashayar Arjangi, a friend of Hajiaghavand's who also worked at a grocery store where she used to shop. Arjangi said the two were planning to have a cooking competition before her death. ""We planned to do something for a year,"" he said. It's never going to happen anymore."" Sharzhad Hashemi, 45 and her daughter Maya Zibaie, 15, were returning home to Toronto from Iran after visiting family. Hashemi's husband and Zibaie's father Mahmoud Zibaie described his daughter as ""very lovely, well educated"" and the pillar of his family. They moved to Canada in 2016 and hoped to stay in the country permanently. Northern Secondary School identified Maya Zibaie as a Grade 10 student. ""Maya was kind, happy and well-liked by her peers. She was new to Canada, enjoyed attending high school and often shared with staff how excited she was about her future and reaching her academic goals. Maya will be sorely missed,"" principal Adam Marshall said in a statement. Shadi Jamshidi, 32, and a friend had been joking about choosing the cheapest possible flight from Tehran back to Toronto. That friend, Hamid Mehr, booked a pricier flight. Jamshidi opted for a Jan. 8 seat on the Ukrainian airliner. ""I even joked about that she was a cheap person and she was looking for cheap flights, and we laughed about it. Now that's not a joke anymore,"" Mehr told As It Happens host Carol Off. Jamshidi was a technical sales consultant in Mississauga, Ont. — a permanent resident working toward her Canadian citizenship. She had been in Tehran visiting her father.  ""She was a lovely person all around, the sort of person you would like to be around, the sort of person that would cheer you up and who would be always there for you. It's so hard to think that such a person is gone,"" Mehr said.  Mohammad Jebelli, 29, worked as a medic in Iran and earned a doctorate in medicine from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. He volunteered in Iran as a family and emergency care physician and also screened children for diseases at primary schools. Jebelli came to Toronto in 2018 to pursue a master of health science in translational research, the University of Toronto said in a statement. He was scheduled to graduate later in 2020 and intended to eventually pursue his Canadian medical license. ""This was a young man who was quiet, gentle, soft-spoken. He was bright and clever and asked good questions and was curious about the world,"" said Joseph Ferenbok, director of the U of T program. ""He did everything for everybody, and didn't think of himself."" His friend Mohammad Mozafarihashjin is remembering him as ""kind to everyone around him.""

Karamimoghadam, who had a master's degree in environmental engineering, had been anxious about the tensions with the U.S. and the safety of her relatives in the region. '""I'm worried for my parents, I'm worried for my brother, I'm worried for the people of Iran,'"" Karamimoghadam said, according to Kirby. ""Just come back to Canada,"" Kirby tried to reassure her. ""Just get on the plane and come back."" On the day of the crash, Kirby learned her best friend — with whom she shared a birthday — would never be coming home. ""I don't want to believe it,"" she told CBC News through tears. ""She was very kind... I can't believe I'm using the past tense."" Masoud Shaterpour Khiaban was in the process of moving to Canada to begin post-graduate studies in business administration at York University when the plane went down. Students say Khiaban had already communicated with them online to learn more about the program and life in Toronto.

601,Anonymous,2020-01-25T16:34:28.151Z,Pharmacists seek bigger role in helping Islanders quit smoking,"Pharmacists on P.E.I. say they want to be more involved in helping Islanders quit smoking.  Last month, the province launched a new smoking cessation initiative. To join the program, Islanders have to visit a health centre and get a prescription from a family doctor or nurse practitioner.  The P.E.I. Pharmacists Association said pharmacists take on that work in other parts of the country. By not allowing pharmacists to fill that role, the province is putting more pressure on nurses who are already overworked, said Erin MacKenzie, the group's executive director.  ""We have 50 pharmacists right across the province in various communities,"" she said. ""And, also, the pharmacists can assess and prescribe medication without having to refer back to a physician or nurse practitioner for smoking cessation products if they are deemed necessary."" MacKenzie said she's heard from both pharmacists and patients who have said that the P.E.I. program has too many barriers.  ""We feel that … it's kind of a missed opportunity maybe to help pharmacies alleviate some of the barriers, particularly in this nursing crisis,"" she said.  She said the group has spoken with the province about its concerns and hopes there'll be more consultation and involvement the next time a smoking cessation initiative is launched. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-pharmacists-asking-for-bigger-role-to-help-smokers-quit-1.5440610,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-winter-survival-guide-january-2020-1.5435261 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-alan-doyle-musical-jan-2020-1.5440304,N/A
602,Amina Zafar,2020-01-25T14:53:02.561Z,Why tracing the animal source of coronavirus matters,"Alongside treating people infected with the new coronavirus, tracing those they've been in contact with and learning how the virus is transmitted, there's another pillar for controlling infectious diseases: searching for its animal host. Scientists have named the new virus that's caused hundreds of confirmed infections 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The outbreak started in Wuhan, China and travellers have brought the virus to other countries. So far, the virus seems most closely related to coronaviruses from bats. Many of the patients in Wuhan had a link to a large seafood and live animal market. That origin suggests spread from an animal to a human, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.  Viruses in non-human animal hosts tend to invade a certain type of animal cell without harming people. In the case of avian influenza, for example, the virus gets into the intestines and respiratory tracts of birds. Occasionally, a virus jumps the species barrier to infect human cells. ""We're always on the lookout for the strange ones like SARS,"" says Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinary professor at the University of Guelph who is interested in novel coronaviruses from the perspective of emerging and infectious diseases. ""We always worry about bats as the original source, but what made it go from a bat to a person? Is there an animal in between and is that something we need to be paying attention to, or is it just human-to-human transmission?"" Animals can be hosts both to viruses that only affect them, and viruses they can spread to humans. For SARS, civet cats and raccoon dogs were found to carry and spread the virus, as well as domestic cats and ferrets, he said. ""If we don't know what the host range is, we should assume that it is more than just humans until we prove otherwise because we don't want to miss a potential source of an infection."" Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in Britain, where he studies infectious diseases and tropical medicine, noted that this coronavirus has crossed from animals to humans. ""That does not happen often, and it is without doubt very serious,"" Farrar said in a Science Media Centre commentary. According to Weese, the majority of emerging diseases have animal origins. The more humans interact with different species and wild environments, the more the risk increases, he said. Conversely, keeping animal habitats and human habitats apart helps to reduce the risk, Weese said, while acknowledging that isn't completely practical. Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist who teaches medical students about environmental change and human health at the University of Toronto, went to the market in Wuhan linked to the first cases of this new coronavirus about 18 months ago. While there, he counted about 50 species including snakes, turtles, wild rabbits, foxes, Asian palm civets and frogs. ""You've got these extremely stressed animals in really tiny, contained spaces that are clearly unwell,"" Bowman recalled. ""You've got high-powered hoses blasting water constantly and so you've got urine and feces — everything is merging between species sitting in the sun. You can imagine the potential for recombination of viruses."" Bowman said he's loath to criticize another culture's consumption habits. But in his opinion, China's laws of wildlife trade are not well enforced. Today, we publish the first clinical data from individuals confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCov from Wuhan, China.

Ebola is spread in different ways and causes different symptoms than respiratory infections, but the Ebola virus is currently spreading person to person in Congo. Just as a coronavirus can originate in animals, people can be exposed to the Ebola virus by eating bushmeat, such as primates. After SARS killed 44 people in Canada, health officials here and internationally invested in preparing for outbreaks, Bowman said. ""I think we've learned a lot,"" he said. ""But if we don't deal with the heart of the problem where these things can emerge, it could easily happen again.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-zoonosis-1.5440146,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-coronavirus-cases-1.5439889 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,N/A

It is an effort to tide them over while they search for new buyers for their wood. Jeff Bishop, executive director of Forest Nova Scotia, helped create the new program. He said much of the money would go to forest workers dealing with payments for equipment. By freeing up loan payments, Bishop said there might be money to pay workers or to cover other business expenses.  But Bishop said it would not help everyone in the industry who is struggling with big bills. ""That's the hard part of looking at a program like this, that looks at assistance,"" said Bishop. ""You know, when you look at it, there's going to be people that it's just not going to help. ""You hope that it helps as many people that are are willing and able to stay working in the sector."" The Nova Scotia government is guaranteeing the loans, meaning taxpayers will be on the hook if any of that money cannot be repaid. The province is setting aside roughly $5 million for the program. It's the latest aid to be rolled out by the McNeil government in recent weeks to try to cushion the blow from Northern Pulp's decision to shutter its mill in Pictou County. The company will need to cease operations in a week to comply with a law enacted five years ago mandating the closure of the provincially owned effluent treatment plant that has processed the mill's wastewater for a generation. According to a news release issued Friday afternoon, the loans will be available through the 16 credit unions that offer the Small Business Loan Guarantee program.

604,Anonymous,2020-01-16T22:40:08.557Z,"Province taking an 'odd' approach to privatizing cannabis sales, says professor","An Ontario business professor says New Brunswick should consider allowing cannabis retailers to sell their product within other stores, rather than forcing operators to sell their product in stand-alone locations. Michael Armstrong, an associate professor of operations research at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., said it's difficult for stand-alone stores to stay afloat in a province like New Brunswick.  ""You have a relatively small population that's relatively rural, so it's difficult for a stand-alone store to make money,"" Armstrong said.  Cannabis retailers in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland have fared better because they've opted to allow retailers to sell cannabis within another store, typically a liquor store. ""They don't have a lot of fixed costs to cover that way, which means they don't have to sell very much cannabis.""  Cannabis sales in New Brunswick have trailed other provinces in recent months. In the second quarter of this year, sales were $10.7 million, which was a $1.5 million loss. Third-quarter results for Cannabis NB sales will be released later this month, but the company told CBC News that sales totalled $4.9 million for December 2019. The province issued a request for proposals in November for a single private operator to take over sales. On Monday, the government released the names of eight private operators that submitted proposals to obtain a legally backed monopoly on cannabis sales.  The eight companies that submitted proposals are:  The government will evaluate the proposals and is expected to announce a single private operator in the spring. After that, the government will begin negotiations on a deal with the successful bidder. If negotiations fail, the government will explore other options.  Armstrong said the New Brunswick government's decision to offer a private operator a monopoly is ""a very odd approach for a government to take."" Other provinces have opted for a public-sector monopoly and placing the government in charge of sales, or have turned cannabis sales over to the private sector and are relying on competing retailers to maintain a stable market.  ""If you have a private-sector monopoly, then you have neither of those checks on the system and that could lead to problems.""  Armstrong doesn't think the switch to privatization will improve New Brunswick's market. He cautioned that without a change in government legislation allowing cannabis retailers to sell their product within an existing store like NB Liquor, the private sector will face the same problem selling its product. ""Unless the government wants to change the legislation, it's still going to face the same problem. How do you sell enough cannabis from a stand-alone store to make business?"" Armstrong also said the switch to privatization will likely leave the black market with a larger share in cannabis sales. ""There's still a black market in New Brunswick just like every other province and just like in every other province the legal industry has to compete against that,"" he said. ""The black market will just keep on serving whatever the legal industry doesn't or cannot profitably serve.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cannabis-privatization-nb-government-1.5429281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cannabis-sales-statistics-canada-nb-1.5404926 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cannabis-nb-privatized-black-market-jobs-1.5360380,N/A
605,Anonymous,2020-01-25T03:49:01.689Z,"Coronavirus death toll climbs to 41, more cases reported in China","LATEST: The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 41, up from 26, as China rushes to build a hospital to deal with the deadly virus that has sickened over 1,300 globally and expands the unprecedented lockdowns of cities during the country's most important holiday. The latest deaths disclosed by the Health Commission of Hubei Province occurred in Wuhan, the province's capital and epicentre of the outbreak. The National Health Commission said Saturday more than 1,287 people in China were infected, bringing the global total to over 1,300. On Lunar New Year, transportation was shut down Saturday in at least 12 cities with a total of about 36 million people. The cities, located in central Hubei province, include Wuhan, where the illness has been concentrated, Ezhou, Huanggang, Chibi, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Huangshi, Xianning and Yichang. ""To address the insufficiency of existing medical resources,"" Wuhan authorities said in a Friday notice, the city is constructing a 1,000-bed hospital modelled after the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing. The facility will be a prefabricated structure, slated for completion Feb. 3. The SARS hospital was built from scratch in 2003 in just six days to treat an outbreak of a similar respiratory virus that had spread from China to more than a dozen countries and killed about 800 people. The hospital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins. In Wuhan, normally bustling streets, malls and other public spaces were eerily quiet on the third day of its lockdown. Masks were mandatory in public, and images from the city showed empty shelves as people stocked up for what could be an extended isolation. Train stations, the airport and subways were closed; police checked incoming vehicles but did not entirely close off roads. WATCH | China sets blistering pace to build new Wuhan hospital: In China, authorities were taking precautions around the country. In the capital, Beijing, major public events were cancelled indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of Lunar New Year celebrations. The Forbidden City, a major tourist destination in Beijing, announced it will close indefinitely on Saturday. On Friday, authorities said Shanghai Disneyland will be closed from Saturday to help prevent the spread of the virus. Sections of China's Great Wall will also be closed to visitors from Saturday, the Beijing government said.  Beijing city government is urging residents returning from coronavirus outbreak areas to stay at home for 14 days to prevent its spread, the Beijing Daily said Friday. Shanghai government also urged people coming to the city from ""key areas"" to stay at home or under centralized quarantine for two weeks. The country's number of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus has risen to 1,287, the National Health Commission said Saturday. The health commission in Hebei, a northern province bordering Beijing, said an 80-year-old man died there after returning from a two-month stay in Wuhan to see relatives. Heilongjiang province in the northeast confirmed a death there but did not give details. WATCH | China tightens travel restrictions to prevent spread of virus: Initial symptoms of the virus can mirror those of the cold and flu, including cough, fever, chest tightening and shortness of breath, but can worsen to pneumonia. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections to the city, but scattered cases have occurred beyond the mainland. Malaysia said three people, relatives of a father and son from Wuhan who were earlier diagnosed with the virus in neighbouring Singapore, tested positive on Saturday. Australia confirmed its first case on Saturday, the United States, South Korea and Japan confirmed their second cases Friday and cases have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. France also confirmed its first three cases, Europe's first ones. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada. The World Health Organization (WHO) decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now. The declaration can increase resources to fight a threat but its potential to cause economic damage makes the decision politically fraught. Cases of the virus are likely to continue to rise in China, but it is too soon to evaluate its severity, WHO said Friday. ""The focus is not so much on the [case] numbers, which we know will go up,"" WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva news briefing. ""It's still too early to draw conclusions on how severe the virus is."" The WHO and its network of experts may look at treatments and vaccines against MERS for possible use against coronavirus, he said. The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels. Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns of the cities will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's Communist Party-led government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. A trickle of passengers at the train station in Wuhan put on a brave face on Friday as they arrived in the epicentre of the outbreak. On one high-speed train carrying a Reuters journalist that stopped in Wuhan station on Friday afternoon, about 10 passengers got off and nobody got on before the train resumed its journey to Changsha. Although it stopped there, Wuhan had been removed from the train's schedule. ""What choice do I have? It's Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,"" said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu. Wuhan's airport is not closed, but nearly all flights have been cancelled. Three international flights arriving on Friday would leave with no passengers, an airport official said.

606,Anonymous,2020-01-24T20:55:21.569Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence can keep working","An obstetrician at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital accused of sexual wrongdoing by two female patients whose final day of work was supposed to be Friday is now allowed to continue working. On Thursday, the Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons announced Dr. Manivasan Moodley would face a hearing over allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. As a foreign-trained doctor, Moodley is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship was being withdrawn, and his last day of work was supposed to be Friday. However, the college announced today that another sponsor had come forward, which means Moodley will be able to continue practising medicine. His hearing over accusations of professional misconduct and incompetence is scheduled to begin next month. On Thursday night, about 80 people rallied outside the Cape Breton Regional Hospital to show their support for Moodley. College registrar Dr. Gus Grant said the significant public response to the allegations against Moodley nearly scared off the two female complainants at the heart of the misconduct hearing. ""All would agree that Dr. Moodley is owed due process and the college is going to deliver due process,"" said Grant. ""All would agree, also, that these women are owed safety, freedom from intimidation and privacy.""   He said the public outcry in support of Moodley failed to consider the complainants' point of view, and that could have derailed the hearing. ""The least fair outcome would be if these allegations were dismissed simply because the complainants chose not to give evidence,"" Grant said. However, the complainants are still ready to proceed with the hearing, he said. The registrar also said it is important to separate Moodley's license troubles from the allegations against him. Grant said without a sponsor or supervisor, Moodley simply couldn't practice, and the decision to withdraw or step forward as a sponsor is up to those individuals. Moodley was not available for an interview, but in an email, said he was grateful for the support of the community, his colleagues and patients. ""I now know for sure that I am part of this community and that as much as I will provide unique care for them, they will stand up for me if ever I am challenged again,"" Moodley said. Dr. Margaret Fraser, head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said she was very pleased with the extension of Moodley's licence. She said Dr. Jeremy Hilliard had stepped forward to sponsor Moodley and Dr. Angus Gardner has agreed to be his supervisor. ""I think it's the right decision to allow him to continue until the college process has been gone through,"" Fraser said. She also said it's not clear if the rally and other public support helped Moodley get his licence renewed. ""I don't know if that had any effect, but certainly it was heartening for Dr. Moodley to see that his patients supported him and that his colleagues supported him in this difficult time."" Grant said comments on social media had also weighed on the complainants' minds this week. Although some were in favour of Moodley, others suggested Cape Breton must be desperate for doctors if the community was rallying to support a physician facing serious sexual allegations. Fraser said that's not a fair comment. ""This man is being judged in the court of public opinion,"" she said. ""No decision has been made regarding his licensing. No decision has been made regarding his culpability in this matter ... so until the college has gone through its process, it is unfair to judge this man prematurely."" The college alleges that in the case of one complainant, Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in a sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. In the case of another complainant, the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace.

607,Wallis Snowdon,2020-01-24T16:34:41.830Z,'Doing squats the whole time': Chinese lion dance brings good fortune and sore muscles ,"For Catherine Wong, lion dancing is both a passion and a challenging feat of physical fitness.  The traditional form of Chinese dancing is a sport and it's physically demanding, with jumps, high kicks and acrobatics,  Wong said. ""It's a lot of upper body strength but, because of the stances and everything, it does tend to burn out legs quite a bit, too,"" Wong said in an interview with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. ""It's almost like you're doing squats the whole time.""  Wong, 31, is a fixture at Hungmon Athletic Club in central Edmonton where she coaches students in weekly lessons.  In Wong's classes, students learn to mimic the movements of the big-maned wild cats.  A chain of dancers perform inside each ornate costume, moving to the tap and clang of heavy percussion — a drum beat said to chase away evil spirits.  The silk-and-tasseled lions scratch, lick and shake, with only the feet of the dancers visible below the fabric creature. ""There's definitely a learning curve,"" she said.  ""The head has to manipulate that whole piece at the front and you have to be able to do fine motor skills like blink the eyes and move the mouth and the ears and things like that. ""You have to look lively and look like a lion and not like a person that is struggling to hold up a heavy head.""  The dance is performed on big occasions and Wong and her class are preparing for a hectic day of performances across Edmonton during Saturday's Chinese New Year celebrations.  ""Culturally, it's a way to ward off bad spirits,"" she said. ""So it's a way to start your new year with good fortune.""  Wong wasn't always a dancer. Her first passion was martial arts. She has a black belt in tae kwon do but stopped training in her teens when her school closed down. At 18, during her first year at university, she discovered lion dancing through a friend on campus. It seemed the perfect fit.  ""It used to be a way for kung fu schools to show off their skills so all the stances are based in martial arts,"" she said. ""It seemed really interesting so I decided to check it out and I just fell in love with it."" To help co-ordinate the different stunts and martial arts stances involved, the dancers are connected by a belt inside the costume. A lion is normally operated by two dancers. To lift the tail of the lion, the dancer in the back of the chain will shake the belt as a signal to the other dancer. The person in front then swiftly jumps backward, tucking their legs into their chest. The back partner then grabs their legs, balancing them on their shoulders, creating the illusion of a raised tail. The back dancer, also known as the ""tail,"" is usually in charge, Wong said.  ""We choreograph bits of it but lion dance is also a bit of a freestyle,"" she said.  ""You have to be used to moving in unexpected ways and knowing your surroundings and knowing where your other lions are in a limited vision.""  ""They might kind of 'backseat drive' you into where they want you to go."" Lion dance, which has various distinct regional types, is centuries old and steeped in tradition. It dates back to the Tang dynasty from 618 to 907 when it was often performed by the emperor as one of the official imperial court dances.  Women were originally forbidden from performing and some ""very superstitious"" people are still wary of female dancers, Wong said. Slowly, however, that perspective is changing, Wong said.  ""It was seen as bad luck to have females dancing,"" she said.  ""Now it doesn't really seem like as big of an issue.""  ""We still hear about some teams where females don't dance. They might be on instruments but they won't perform in a lion. But the overall community is moving toward females being accepted into performing. It's nice to see that shift.""  The dance is powerful to watch and exciting to perform, and Wong said everyone is welcome to don the lion costume and give it a try.  ""It's a chance to learn more about a culture ... and it's so much fun.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/lion-dancing-chinese-new-year-edmonton-1.5438870,[],N/A

609,Kazi Stastna,2020-01-25T03:13:07.851Z,"As they head into Day 4 of impeachment trial, Democrats hope to leave senators wanting more","As the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump enters its fourth day in the U.S. Senate, stamina is waning. Among viewers at home, interest has dropped off — from about 11 million viewers to a little less than eight million, a mere six per cent of those expected to vote in the November 2020 election. In the halls of the Senate, the press corps is getting restless, still chasing every media availability but privately cursing the long hours they've put in covering a trial that has stretched beyond nine hours each of the past three days. On the Senate floor, while some senators keenly flip through massive binders of supporting documentation, highlighting relevant sections, others slouch, yawn or slip in and out of the chamber, where strict rules dictate they're only allowed to consume milk or water. Democrats are hoping they can sustain the punishing pace for at least one more day as they wrap up their case against the president Friday and make a final push to convince the Senate and the American people that Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival was a brazen abuse of power intended to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. Hour 23 of redundant impeachment arguments. For those following at home: Drinking game—every time House Dems say “drug deal” or “get over it”...drink a shot of milk! ""It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest,"" said Jerrold Nadler, one of seven Democratic legislators, or so-called managers, prosecuting the case, Thursday. ""It is a shocking corruption of the election process. And it is without doubt a crime against the constitution, warranting — demanding — removal from office."" WATCH | Jerrold Nadler lays out the case for abuse of power: The Democrats have been using video clips of testimony from the House impeachment hearings last year and Trump's own statements to methodically weave a director's commentary of sorts, chronicling a by now familiar story: Trump's withholding of $400 million US in military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and revive a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. ""This is actually a very effective use of the House evidence because it digests the moments that constitute evidence for the Democrats,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication at the University of Pennsylvania who runs FactCheck.org. And while much of the testimony was familiar to anyone who paid attention during the House hearings, several senators from both sides of the aisle admitted they were hearing some of it for the first time. ""This may have been the first time that they have heard the entire case presented sequentially,"" Jamieson said. ""And they are having a very different experience than the public has had, because very few in the public are watching from one o'clock until whenever the proceedings [end]."" Although several of Trump's defenders in and outside the Senate denounced the presentation as same old, same old, Republicans might end up using their own samples of House testimony to rebut the Democrats' case when they begin presenting their defence Saturday.  It would be a mistake for the lawyers representing Trump to discount evidence of misconduct altogether, said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on constitutional law and the legislative process at the North Carolina School of Law.  Instead, they should clearly spell out how the Senate should assess whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offence. ""Merely saying all he did was perfect is shameful. It is false and leads any neutral observers to lose confidence in their case,"" said Gerhardt. Gerhardt was a witness for both sides in the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and in the Trump impeachment hearings in the House, and Nadler played some of his testimony at the start of Thursday's session. He says he regrets that there are no joint witnesses in the current impeachment process. ""The breach between the parties is much worse than it was 20 years ago, and it was bad then."" The importance of hearing from additional witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, has been a key focus for the Democrats. It will likely come up again in their final day of arguments as they attempt to prove the second article of impeachment and show that Trump obstructed Congress by stymying the inquiry into how he handled the Ukraine matter. They'll need to convince at least two Republicans (along with the two independents, who are expected to vote with Democrats) to get the 51-member majority they need to vote in favour of calling of witnesses once Trump's defence team presents their case. Adam Schiff, the congressman leading the prosecution, has goaded senators over the past two days, hinting at the incriminating details that might be in the diplomatic cables and other subpoenaed documents that the Democrats have also requested but that the White House has thus far refused to release.  ""They're yours for the asking,"" he told senators on the first day of arguments. WATCH | Adam Schiff calls on senators to demand the release of subpoenaed documents: ""As they built the narrative, they would establish what they knew, argue that it was strong enough to impeach based on what they knew and then say, 'But wouldn't you also want to know this?'"" Louis Seidman, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center, said of the Democrats' strategy. It's a strategy that seems to be tapping into public sentiment. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken Jan. 20-23 found that 66 per cent of Americans, including 45 per cent of Republicans, agreed that the Senate should call new witnesses to testify. ""They have to sustain public support for witnesses. In fact, get it to increase if they can, because that puts pressure on the susceptible Republicans who might be willing to vote that way,"" Seidman said. Rick Scott, of Florida, is one of those Republicans. But he told reporters Thursday that Democrats had their chance to pursue witnesses during the House hearings and could have gone to court to fight the president's refusal to comply with their subpoenas. He and other Republicans have, however, said they want Hunter Biden to testify about his association with Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he was a paid member of the board from 2014 to 2019. Trump and other Republicans have alleged Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to dismiss the country's prosecutor general in order to shield Burisma from a corruption investigation. In their arguments Thursday, Democrats tried to debunk that theory and show that Biden's actions were part a wider international effort to root out corruption.  ""The whole idea of a fair trial is you bring in relevant witnesses,"" said Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her way into the Senate chamber Wednesday. ""Relevant witnesses here are people who know what Donald Trump did and what his intent was and what its impact was on our national security and on the security of the Ukraine. Hunter Biden doesn't have any knowledge of that or any bearing on that."" Her fellow presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar said she's been keeping the pressure up on her Republican colleagues, urging them to at least agree to hear from witnesses, even if they don't vote to remove Trump from office.  ""Why are you here if you're not going to stand up?"" she said she told senators. Democrats used strong language in their presentation to the Senate to characterize Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to announce investigations that the House managers said served only his own interests: ""plot,"" ""scheme,"" ""unprecedented coverup."" (He countered with some of his favourite terms: Nadler was a ""sleazebag""; Schiff a ""con job"" and the trial ""a hoax,"" he said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.) They went to great lengths to underscore the gravity of the charges and the historic nature of the process, repeatedly invoking the so-called Framers of the Constitution. ""Impeachment is not for petty offences,"" Nadler said on the second day of arguments. ""It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or unpopular. "" And if there was any doubt about just how sombre of an occasion it was, the opening words of the sergeant at arms at the start of every session were there to remind us: ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."" As were the stern security staff who were quick to reprimand reporters and lookers-on for the smallest infraction, handing them a photocopied list of rules, with the one they've violated emphatically underlined: no cellphones, no talking, no eating, no leaning, no standing. WATCH | Adam Schiff they'll be authors of their own decline if they don't hold Trump accountable: In advance of their final day of arguments, the managers presenting the Democrats' case issued a warning to those who might be convinced Trump abused the power of his office but hesitant to remove him. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,"" Schiff said near the end of another nine-hour-plus session. ""For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won."" But it will take more than that to convince Trump's most vocal defenders in the Senate that he must go. ""When it comes to replacing this president nine months-plus from the election, you've got an uphill battle with me, because I really do believe that the best group people to pick a president are the voters,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters. Even Seidman, who supports the impeachment process, thinks a vote to remove Trump would be risky and potentially destabilizing given that a percentage of Americans would find such a process tantamount to a coup d'état. It's also highly unlikely to happen, contingent as it is on a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats hold 47 of 100 seats. But that doesn't necessarily mean the impeachment process is a futile exercise, said Seidman. ""There is the impact that this has on the American people, on Trump's chances for re-election, on his historical reputation, on how much political power he has going forward,"" he said.

610,Éric Grenier,2020-01-23T09:00:00.978Z,Quebec is up for grabs in the Conservative leadership race — and it's a prize worth grabbing,"Jean Charest is out — which means Quebec is wide open in the Conservative leadership race. And with every member's vote in the province likely to carry a disproportionate weight, it's a vacant playing field that every candidate will want to occupy. The roster of contestants for the Conservative leadership is far from final. But the list of names it won't include is getting longer. On Wednesday, former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose ruled herself out. In an interview with Radio-Canada on Tuesday, Charest — the former Quebec premier and leader of the Progressive Conservatives in the 1990s — said he would not mount a bid for the leadership. Charest likely would have had lots of appeal in Quebec, as well as the ability to sign up a significant number of new members there. But with Charest now ruling out a run, the race could end up with no candidate from Quebec among the top contenders. The two Conservative MPs with the highest profiles in Quebec — Alain Rayes, Andrew Scheer's Quebec lieutenant, and Gérard Deltell, a former journalist and the last leader of the Action Démocratique du Québec (before it dissolved itself into Premier François Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec) — already have ruled themselves out. Richard Décarie, a former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper, is working on a leadership bid as a social-conservative candidate. He's from Quebec — but the province's aversion to social conservatism will limit his appeal there. Pierre Lemieux and Brad Trost, two social conservative candidates, together took just nine per cent of the vote on the first ballot in Quebec in 2017's leadership race. So Quebec could be a political vacuum that the other candidates have to fill. They would be wise to try — because Quebec's party members offer a lot of bang for the buck. All 338 ridings across the country carry equal weight in the Conservative leadership vote. Each riding is worth 100 points, and those points are distributed according to each candidate's share of the vote. In other words, the candidate who wins 10 out of 20 votes in one riding ends up with the same amount of points as the candidate who landed 1,000 out of 2,000 votes in another riding. Ridings with lower numbers of party members offer candidates a chance to do a lot with a little. The last leadership race offered a good illustration. Nearly 29,000 Conservative members living in Alberta cast a ballot in 2017 — an average of 848 members in each of Alberta's 34 ridings. In Quebec, meanwhile, there were just 9,669 voting members spread out across the province's 78 ridings — an average of 124 members per district. Every vote in Alberta was worth an average of 0.12 points. Every vote in Quebec was worth 0.81 points — nearly seven times as much. Even these numbers were skewed by the regions of Quebec that had a higher concentration of members, such as the West Island of Montreal or runner-up Maxime Bernier's Beauce riding; Beauce alone was responsible for over 1,000 votes. The 34 ridings in Quebec with the fewest members delivered a total of 1,600 votes in the 2017 leadership race — an average of 48 per riding. Each vote cast in those seats was worth over two points apiece. He may or may not end up being the main beneficiary, but former cabinet minister Peter MacKay can take some credit for this voting system. It was one of the conditions of the merger that created the modern Conservative Party. MacKay, as leader of the Progressive Conservatives at the time, insisted on it — and he's defended it at party conventions ever since. If MacKay does emerge as the winner, strong results in Quebec could prove to be decisive. The former Nova Scotia MP might not have as much support in places like rural Ontario and in Western Canada — where there are lots of Conservative Party members and where the old Reform Party and Canadian Alliance had significant support. But it isn't clear yet which candidate is best positioned to become Quebec's top choice. A recent survey by Abacus Data suggests that every candidate still has some way to go. The poll, conducted Jan. 16-17 with a sample of 302 respondents in Quebec, found that 46 per cent of respondents there did not know enough about MacKay to have an opinion. That figure rose to 63 per cent for Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre and 72 per cent for both 2017's third-place finisher Erin O'Toole and fellow Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu. About 13 per cent of Quebecers said they had a positive impression of MacKay, compared to 11 per cent who had a negative one. That split was six to eight per cent for Poilievre and five to three per cent for O'Toole. Considering the small sample size, this suggests no one is likely to have the inside track in Quebec from the get-go. The endorsement of Quebec's 10 Conservative MPs will be highly coveted. They did appear to make a difference in 2017, with those of Rayes and Deltell being among the most valuable. Winning Quebec won't be important just for the contestants in this leadership race — it also will likely be a major factor in determining the eventual winner's chances of becoming the next prime minister. Conservative support in Quebec collapsed after Scheer's poor performance in the first of two French-language debates in October's federal election campaign, significantly reducing the party's chances of forming government. Conservative members motivated by a desire to avoid a third consecutive loss likely will be asking themselves which of the contenders can make the most gains in Quebec. Charest showed some promise on that score. The candidate Quebecers settle on as their next best option will have a leg-up on the competition.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-quebec-1.5434633,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,N/A

Scotty, the largest Tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered, is now on display at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum (RSM) after decades of work. 70 million years in the making: Sask.'s Scotty the T-rex to be unveiled at Regina museum Sask. T-rex Scotty is officially biggest ever discovered Peter Menzies, director of RSM, had a convincing answer when asked why people should come visit Scotty. ""Because it's the biggest, baddest thing that ever lived."" The king carnivore was discovered in the badlands just outside of Eastend, Sask. in 1991. Researchers believe the T-rex stood 13 metres long and weighed an estimated 8,800 kilograms. Wes Long worked on the original discovery site and helped dig up some of Scotty's bones. He's also a curatorial assistant at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum. ""It's just fantastic,"" he said at the unveiling. ""Just the hard work by many people to get the thing all dug out of the hill, plastered up, and then hauled into the lab ... When you finally see it standing on two legs, it's just like, wow."" Long said Scotty is also the longest living T-rex on record at 30-years-old. Seven-year-old Hailey Maternal Mullin was impressed by the prehistoric predator. ""I think Scotty looks cool because I like dinosaurs and I like to learn about them,"" she said eagerly. She was just one of many kids who came to the event, along with their parents. Menzies said he hopes that's a lasting trend. ""This is a generational moment for the museum. It's changed the esthetic, it's changed the feel, it's changed the architecture, it's modernized it incredibly,"" said Menzies. ""I also think this it's a big moment for the city. How often do you get hometown boys finding the greatest, biggest, baddest thing the world has ever seen?"" Scotty was about 65 per cent intact, according to Ryan McKellar, the museum's curator of invertebrate paleontology He said the exhibit could spark a bigger interest in paleontology. ""We have had an exhibit in Eastend for the last five or six years — the T-Rex Discovery Centre — now we get to display it in Regina and tell a slightly different story."" He said the exhibit will look at things like the natural habitat of a T-rex and their feeding habits. The previous record holder for largest T-rex, Sue, was about 8,400 kilograms and 12.3 metres long.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/scotty-t-rex-regina-museum-1.5141335,[],N/A
612,Anonymous,2019-02-24T12:00:38.090Z,Home remedies in P.E.I.'s Bygone Days,"Reginald ""Dutch"" Thompson's column The Bygone Days brings you the voices of Island seniors, many of whom are now long-departed. These tales of the way things used to be offer a fascinating glimpse into the past. Every second weekend CBC P.E.I. will bring you one of Dutch's columns.  Islanders weren't able to visit the neighbourhood walk-in clinic for colds, flu and other minor ailments 100 years ago.  Instead many used remedies concocted at home — some that have even stood the test of time, like fish oil supplements.  Ralph Cooke fished off Cape Wolfe in western P.E.I. for many years, catching cod that weighed more than 45 kilograms (100 pounds). Their livers were always saved to make homemade cod liver oil, Cooke said, which he and his 10 siblings took daily.  Nowadays blueberries are recognized as a healthy food with lots of antioxidants. Ben Clow at Clow's General Store in Murray Harbour North was years ahead of his time making and drinking his own homemade blueberry wine, said his nephew Roy Clow.  ""He was a big, big man, about six foot four, and a big square-built man — he'd weigh close to 300 pound. And he was good on his feet too, light on his feet,"" said Clow.   ""He bought blueberries from the ladies in the country and he shipped them to Charlottetown in boxes. He had one of them whiskey kegs, a 45-gallon keg, a hog's head they call them."" Clow would put 30 pounds of blueberries in the keg with 20 pounds of sugar, then wash his feet, get in the barrel and stomp on the berries. ""I seen him doing it and he was laughing to kill himself,"" Clow recalled. His uncle would leave the concoction in the sun for 30 days before drinking it. ""You talk about strong! He gave me a glass — I was only a little fella, and he set me drunk. I was drunk as hell when I went home,"" Clow said.  Clow's uncle Ben also dosed himself with a heaping tablespoon of Epsom salts in cold water every week, and was never sick and lived to an old age. Bessie Ching was born in 1912 and lived to be 96. She recalled some home remedies from her area in northeastern P.E.I. ""For a cold I would have a teaspoon of sugar with a drop of Minard's liniment. It didn't kill you but stopped you coughing,"" Ching said. Minard's liniment was invented and manufactured in Nova Scotia beginning in 1860 and is still sold today, according to its web page — its main ingredient is camphor.  Her mother rubbed goose grease mixed with turpentine on Ching's chest for a cold, something Ching continued with her children.  ""We never took our kids to the doctor — if they had a sneeze now they run somewhere. But in horse and wagon days you couldn't do that, you had your own remedies,"" Ching said.  She also made mustard plasters for her husband, who had pneumonia several times.  ""We didn't have nothing really. We would walk to school, and for our lunch ... they made the biscuits then pretty big, or a bannock, and we put molasses on it, stuck it together and wrapped it in a piece of brown paper or a newspaper,"" Ching said. They'd put glass bottles of milk — often recycling those old liniment bottles, she said — in a brook near the school to keep cool.  ""At dinner time we'd run to the hill and have our molasses biscuit and our bottle of milk. That was lunch, and it was good."" Jean MacCann's family ran the post office in Covehead where a tin of goose grease was always kept handy. ""For earache or colds, I'd take a halibut liver oil all year long, one a day, and I'm never troubled with colds,"" MacCann said. She shared a cold remedy from a local minister: half a teaspoon of baking soda for two days ""dries the head up, nothing to it."" MacCann's daughter also created cough syrup by fermenting spruce buds for a year.  Tommy Duncan was born in Mill River in 1900 and lived to be 100 years old.  ""If you had something the matter with your feet they'd put salt herring on them,"" Duncan said. His father also bathed young Tommy's feet, which were sore from going barefoot, in water boiled with bark from alder trees. His wife Pearl Duncan believed that was a cure her father-in-law had learned from the Mi'kmaq.   Pearl also recalled treating their son George with a last-minute home remedy.  ""He was about four or five, he took bronchitis. I didn't know what in the name of time to do. I got a piece of salt pork and put it on his chest. In the morning it was pretty near cooked, [and] he was alright,"" she said.  ""They used to get the dead chickens and put their feet in them, for high fevers,"" said Rose Deighan, who was originally from Newfoundland and married Charlie Deighan from Summerside. ""They'd slit the chicken and put one for each foot,"" to draw out fever, she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-remedies-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.5026152,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-rum-running-1.4839501 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-clothes-1.4820909 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ghost-stories-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.4869191 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-harvesting-bygone-days-western-canada-train-1.4905818 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-lloyd-gates-bygone-days-thompson-1.4886176 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-telephones-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.4979246 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-islanders-want-day-bridge-toll-1.5023409 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tea-sommelier-katherine-burnett-1.5008519,N/A

UBC Okanagan associate professor of social work Shirley Chau says immigrants in Kelowna struggled both to find work in their areas of expertise and to achieve a sense of belonging. ""It puts into question for them whether they made the right move to move across the globe to be here,"" Chau told Radio West guest host Josh Pagé. ""They have a sense of confidence their credentials counted."" ""It's very confusing, and if you're a person who's bringing your family with you, you're the mother, you're the father, if you have children, those costs add up in terms of setting up a home and being able to financially support your family.""

Chau says she wanted to use the photos as part of her research as a way to help study participants tell their stories with less of a filter.

614,Andrew Lupton,2019-06-13T09:00:00.963Z,London street preachers turned up in Port Stanley and it didn't go well,"Two men already facing mischief charges for confronting people while spouting scripture on London's streets turned up in Port Stanley last week.  And while the community is used to welcoming thousands of visitors to the quaint lakeside village, many residents who spoke to CBC News say they'd prefer the pair stick to the streets of London.  Last Friday the duo of Matthew Carapella and Steven Ravbar showed up in Port Stanley. They quickly resumed the behaviour that has made them notorious in London: approaching passersby — women in particular — to admonish them for their attire.  ""They were telling me I was dressed like a man because I was wearing shorts,"" said Jen Slack. ""And I said 'Actually, these are women's clothes. If I walked into any women's clothing store, you're going to find shorts that are exactly like these.'""  Slack owns Erie Fun Tours, a local business that shuttles beach-goers between London and Port Stanley.  She said shortly after Carapella and Ravbar showed up last week, people began to post complaints on local Facebook pages, some sharing stories about being confronted by the men.  Slack would prefer the pair stay out of Port Stanley, which she said is known for being welcoming and inclusive to all. ""I don't want that kind of vibe around here,"" she said. ""We all enjoy each other and celebrate each other. I feel like they preach hate, and we don't want that here.""  Slack says she ""has a thick skin"" and isn't personally bothered by the comments about her attire, but worries that negative comments could cause harm to someone else.   Ann Stevens is another Port Stanley resident and merchant who'd be happy if the street preachers didn't return.  She says the men stood outside of her Little Beach Shop on Main Street and confronted several customers on their way in.  ""They asked them if they had been saved yet, did they find Jesus? That kind of thing,"" she said.  Stevens is worried if the men make a habit of coming to Port Stanley in the summer months, they could make other visitors uncomfortable.  The men are known to confront women for wearing skirts, high heels, or makeup. Stevens worries about how they'll respond to women in bathing suits, a common sight in a community known for its sandy beaches.  The men appear to have spent only one day in Port Stanley last week, but it was enough to trigger five complaints to Central Elgin's bylaw enforcement office. A Central Elgin spokesperson said bylaw enforcement officers are investigating the complaints, and that the men's actions could contravene the municipality's public nuisance bylaw.  The Port Stanley visit is just the latest chapter in the street preacher's history of confrontation in recent years.  The men follow the teachings of a dead U.S. preacher named William Branham. In London, Ravbar and Carapella face charges under both the city's public nuisance bylaw as well as charge of mischief. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/street-preachers-port-stanley-1.5172937,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-street-preachers-1.5095811,N/A
615,Mike Crawley,2020-01-24T09:00:00.711Z,How the hospital in Christine Elliott's riding copes with overcrowding,"When Health Minister Christine Elliott needs to see Ontario's hallway medicine problem in action, she doesn't need to travel very far, as one of the province's most overcrowded hospitals is in her riding.  Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket is one of Ontario's largest, with 502 beds. It's also among the hospitals most frequently filled beyond capacity, according to an investigation by CBC News into the hallway healthcare situation province-wide. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health show that Southlake was over capacity for all but seven days in the first half of 2019. In that time period, the hospital's average daily occupancy ran at 110 per cent. That did not improve in the second half of the year, according to figures provided by the hospital, averaging 113 per cent. A visit to Southlake this month reveals patients housed in a range of what are officially called ""unconventional spaces,"" including a former exercise gym. Here the beds are separated by portable surgical screens, the makeshift nursing station is a collection of desks and tables mostly covered with medical supplies, and there's no bathroom, so patients have to walk down the hall.  Patients who spoke to CBC News in the exercise room said it was better than staying in Southlake's crowded emergency room, but less than ideal.  ""The elderly people, it's got to be real tough on them,"" said patient Ron Dane, who spent two days in the ER before getting an overflow spot in the gym. ""Obviously, there's a long way to go to get up to the standard of care that we should really expect.""  The nursing manager who covers the overflow areas at Southlake doesn't disagree with him.  ""This is not the optimal place to be providing care,"" said Tammy Rogers, who also manages the rehab and neurological units' discharge planning group. ""We don't have the same access to the equipment as you would on a set-up acute medical floor.""   Rogers praises her nursing team for their dedication.   ""I am forever thankful to them for the work that they do every day,"" she said during an interview in a kitchenette that's become the latest spot to put patients, a space that staff call the pantry.   ""I know it's not easy for them to come here to work when we're opening up a pantry or putting patients in the hallway, that's not why they became a nurse,"" she said. ""They give it 150 per cent. They still provide excellent care to our patients and I'm sure at the end of the day they're not always happy with what's happening.""  Rogers said there have been patients in the hallway on her floor daily for the previous two weeks.  No one on Southlake's staff is content with the overcrowding, from the nurses to the hospital's chief executive.  ""It's a very difficult situation for patients,"" said Arden Krystal, the hospital's president and CEO.  ""When I see patients in areas such as our gym, I think about how would I feel if that was my Dad in that bed,"" Krystal said in an interview with CBC News.  ""I wouldn't feel that good about it. I would be disappointed.""  The perpetual overcrowding at Southlake means hospital staff are daily putting anywhere from 20 to 50 patients into spaces that were not intended for patient care.  But that's not the only way the hospital tries to cope with the demand for beds.  Like many hospitals in Ontario, Southlake has large numbers of older patients occupying beds who don't actually need acute care, but can't leave the hospital because they need more care than they can receive at home. They're known as ""alternate level of care"" patients (ALC).  Last March saw the launch of a program called Southlake@home, designed to provide enough support to ALC patients outside the hospital walls so that they could be discharged more promptly. The hospital partnered directly with home-care providers, a community support service agency, and family doctors to ensure the necessary services were made available. The program has helped more than 200 patients make the transition out of the hospital, and has reduced their re-admission rates.  ""We've had great success with that,"" said Krystal. ""But no sooner do we get some people home than there's a whole pile more waiting to come in."" The key challenge for Ontario hospitals, said Krystal, has been figuring out how to cope without additional bed capacity. ""No matter how great a job we do in moving people into the community and keeping them healthier, the sheer growth that we've had in Ontario means that we need more hospital beds,"" she said.   The number of acute-care beds in the province has essentially remained the same for 20 years, while the province's population has grown by three million.  Elliott — who is the Progressive Conservative MPP for Newmarket-Aurora as well as Premier Doug Ford's health minister —  says the government would like to see the Southlake@home program replicated in other hospitals around the province.

616,Raisa Patel,2020-01-25T22:22:32.985Z,Peter MacKay officially launches bid for Conservative leadership,"Former Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay formally launched his bid to replace Andrew Scheer on Saturday in his home province of Nova Scotia, where he first began his political career more than 20 years ago.  MacKay made the announcement in his former riding of Central Nova at the province's Museum of Industry.  ""Over four years ago I stood in this very room with family and friends, including Prime Minister Harper and many of you who are here again today, and announced that I would be leaving politics,"" MacKay told supporters. ""It was a tough decision."" MacKay also called attention to divisions within the Conservative Party and referenced his role in establishing the party in 2003, when he merged the Progressive Conservatives with Stephen Harper's Canadian Alliance.  ""We've all lived through the realities of what can happen when Conservatives are not united. We know firsthand how important it is that we do our part not to divide ourselves, our party or our nation,"" MacKay said.  ""If divided, we falter, we fail. And I've done my part and I've played my part in uniting the Conservative family into one big blue tent."" Mackay revealed his intention to enter the leadership race Jan. 15 with a four-word tweet, putting to rest months of rumours about whether he would run for the party's top job. I'm in. Stay tuned. MacKay — who served in three cabinet roles under Harper before leaving politics in 2015 — reflected on his political career in his speech. ""Some of the proudest moments of my life are seeing what Canadians have accomplished both at home and abroad,"" he said. ""As Minister of National Defence I was deeply honoured to do my part in supporting the men and women in uniform."" He also explained how his time as Justice Minister was shaped by his earlier work as a crown prosecutor.  Watch: Peter MacKay says Conservatives need to earn Canadians' trust:  MacKay made no mention of climate change in his speech, though he said Canadians are ""stewards of the environment"" and that the ""country and our planet face big challenges.""  He closed his speech with a reference to Canada's LGBTQ community.  ""I stand here before you today with my heart on my sleeve, for every Canadian, whoever you love, wherever you live,"" MacKay said just before leaving the stage. On Tuesday, MacKay was one of many Conservative MPs who criticized prospective leadership candidate Richard Décarie after the former Harper adviser called being gay a ""choice"" on CTV's Power Play.  Watch: Peter MacKay on why he's running Mackay's launch comes on the heels of several significant leadership drop-outs, including Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre, who abruptly exited the race on Thursday, saying he was committed to spending more time with his family.  Former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose revealed the day before Poilievre's exit that she had made the difficult decision to remain focused on her private sector work.  Former Quebec premier Jean Charest also pulled out of the race earlier in the week. The evolving list of leadership hopefuls positions MacKay as one of the most well-known contenders.  Before Saturday's announcement, MacKay had already garnered support from a bevy of current and former Conservative MPs and prominent provincial politicians.  He told CBC News he hopes to run in Central Nova again if possible.  His father Elmer MacKay, who previously held the riding for much of the 70s and 80s, said his son's recent absence from political life made him a stronger candidate.  ""I told him that he had to do the very best he could for as many people as he could and I think he's going to do just that,"" he said. ""I think he did the right thing by taking a break and assessing things from the point of view from someone who wasn't in Parliament. Now he can come back with a renewed sense of purpose."" The last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party has enlisted former Conservative MP Alex Nuttall as his campaign manager and Michael Diamond as director of communications. Nuttall previously helped Maxime Bernier organize his bid for the Conservative leadership race in 2017, while Diamond ran Ontario Premier Doug Ford's successful 2018 campaign. MacKay, MP Marilyn Gladu and MP Erin O'Toole are the most prominent Conservatives to announce leadership runs so far. O'Toole posted a concisely worded announcement tweet of his own Saturday and is expected to formally mount his second bid for party leadership Monday.

617,Heidi Atter,2020-01-09T19:45:53.581Z,"Indigenous youth, RCMP officers come together for Regina workshop focused on building relationships","A group of high school students and police from around Canada were in Regina this week for a youth leadership conference, aimed at fostering better future relationships between young Indigenous people and police. Fourteen Indigenous Grade 9 to 12 students from across the country attended the Wednesday workshop at the Regina RCMP Academy. Each was accompanied by an RCMP mentor from their community. Together, the mentors and mentees worked on community action plans around youth crime and victimization, in addition to attending sessions and hearing from guest speakers.  Isaiah Daniels, a 15-year-old from Swift Current, Sask., who attended the conference, says it's important to have mutual respect between officers and youth. He says he's had his past issues with police, and is working to get his life on the right track. ""I wanted to see what it was like to be on the other side,"" he said.  Daniels befriended Swift Current Const. Tony Curti, who is now Daniels's RCMP mentor. Daniels says he's learned a lot about the police as a result. ""I just thought that cops were bad guys and you should never be around them,"" Daniels said.  Then he met Curti. ""He talked to me like I was a regular person.… It changed my perspective on a cop,"" he said. ""Without the vest on … they're regular people underneath."" Daniels said young people like him may have had negative experiences with police in the past, or may have been told negative things by family members. But he says building up relationships can help. ""Kids get nervous when they're around cops, and are scared of cops,"" he said.  ""And I want [officers] to learn that our respect is not given, but earned,"" Daniels said. ""You have to earn your respect to be seen differently in other people's eyes.""  Daniels said drugs are the big issue he hopes to focus on in his community. He hopes to inspire young people in Swift Current to stay away from drugs. Const. Curti said he's also learning things each day by talking to youth like Daniels. Among other topics, Curti said he and Daniels have talked about the drug problem.  ""It's a supply and demand situation, right?"" Curti said. ""It's out there. We have to get rid of that demand."" Instead of just telling kids ""drugs are bad,"" Curti said they should focus on community engagement and foster respect between police and youth.  ""They won't do drugs, they won't commit a crime just for respect,"" he said. ""I think it's going to take some time."" Curti said police officers, and adults in general, sometimes make assumptions about how youth are feeling and what they are going through. Actually talking to young people can be eye-opening, he said. ""[Daniels] respects me enough to try to talk to me quite frankly, which is exactly what I needed,"" Curti said.  In the future, Daniels hopes to start an outreach group that can give kids an opportunity to get involved in activities that would get their minds off of their problems. ""Life's a struggle, you know.… Some people turn to drugs, and I don't think that's a good thing,"" he said. ""For me, I just want to see old age,"" said Daniels. ""I want to see my own grandchildren grow up and I want to change their minds, too."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/rcmp-youth-leadership-workshop-1.5420897,[],N/A

619,Kelly Crowe,2020-01-24T09:03:49.903Z,Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses,"For a few hours on Thursday, it appeared the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had spread to Saudi Arabia with reports that a nurse in Asir was infected.  But it was a case of mistaken virus identification, quickly corrected. The unfortunate nurse was actually infected with a different but equally frightening coronavirus: MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS-CoV), which made the leap from animals to humans in 2012, creating a brand new human disease. It was a vivid reminder that for almost a decade there has been a threat from another highly pathogenic never-before-seen virus. MERS was only the second coronavirus ever known to leap from animals to humans and cause a deadly illness. The first of these notorious bugs was SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS-CoV), which swept the world in the spring of 2003, killing nearly 800 people, including 44 Canadians. With scant information about the novel virus that has just emerged in China, experts are reviewing the experience of SARS and MERS for important clues about what to expect. ""The interesting thing about this is that we're really not sure which way it's going,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""We first thought, well, there really wasn't much transmission from human to human."" Now that it's clear the virus can spread between people, Fauci said the next question is how easily it will spread. ""The real question right now is will it get better at going in what we call 'sustained transmission' from human to human. Because if it doesn't, then we have a very good chance of pretty quickly getting our arms around it and, by public health measures, essentially stopping it."" Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, is a veteran of the SARS and MERS outbreaks, and he's blunt about the current situation. ""This is a bad disease. It makes people very sick and it can kill you. And so I think that is an important combination. But  the ultimate case fatality rate is still yet to be determined."" In other words, experts still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, with a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""I know how this picture is starting but I don't know how it ends. And so I think that's the question we're all asking,"" said Osterholm. The SARS and MERS viruses followed different paths. SARS began in China in the fall of 2002 and spread around the world quickly. By spring 2003, it had travelled to 37 countries including Canada, sickening more than 8,000 people. Still, SARS lacked the ability to spread easily between humans. ""It never really developed the capability of having sustained vigorous transmission from person to person,"" said Fauci. ""There was clearly person-to-person transmission but it wasn't like influenza. You had thousands of cases but not millions of cases."" And after nine frightening months, SARS was extinguished, apparently forever. ""SARS was actually a huge public health success in that we were able to control, contain and eliminate that virus,"" said Dr. Catharine Paules, who co-authored a new paper with Fauci about coronavirus infections published this week in JAMA. ""But then in 2012 we had the emergence of a second animal coronavirus in the human population."" MERS first appeared in Jordan in 2012 with cases showing up in 27 countries over eight  years. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control states that all of the MERS cases are linked to travel or residence in countries around the Arabian Peninsula. There was a major outbreak of MERS in a South Korean hospital in 2015 where 186 people were infected and 36 died. So far, public health agencies have been able to limit the human-to-human spread of MERS but they have not been able to eradicate the virus. That's because MERS has become the camel version of the common cold. ""The camels will be sneezing or coughing and they sort of sneeze or cough this virus onto people; that's how we think it's transmitted,"" said Paules. In the case of SARS, animal-to-human transmission was eliminated when live-animal markets stopped selling small mammals, including palm civets, which were found to be carrying the SARS virus. ""Once we realized that palm civets were the primary animal species transmitting it to humans, and the markets were eliminated, we literally shut off the faucet of new infections coming into humans,"" said Osterholm. The animal reservoir for the new virus is so far a mystery. Experts are extremely skeptical about early reports of an association with snakes. ""I know there was a recent publication that came out about snakes, but that's hotly being debated right now as we aren't even sure that reptiles can get infected with coronaviruses,"" said Paules. ""I think many of us thought that that was in error and not likely to be the source,"" said Osterholm. ""But at this point, we have no data otherwise from the Chinese to know what might have been the animal reservoir."" ""If you want to put some money on it, you'd get a bat involved,"" said Fauci. ""SARS went from the bat to the palm civet cat to the human, and MERS went from the bat to the camel to human. I don't have any idea what the animal is for this one but I would not be surprised if a bat was involved somewhere."" There are also major questions about the transmissibility of the new virus. Scientists still don't know how the virus spreads, although Fauci said environmental tests revealed traces of the virus at the market in Wuhan, China. ""They did environmental samples and it was able to be seen on some of these inanimate objects in the fish market,"" he said. ""Though no one has yet done the definitive experiment of seeing whether it stays alive on a doorknob or not; I wouldn't be surprised if it did last for a limited period of time on inanimate objects."" Fauci said it appears to take about six days for someone who has been infected to show symptoms, but it's not clear whether the virus can be spread by someone who does not appear to be sick. ""But there are anecdotes; for example, the individual from Seattle who got infected does not remember coming into contact with anyone that was sick, nor does he remember coming into contact with any animals, nor did he feel that he had any exposures. Yet he got infected."" A grim aspect of all three diseases is the phenomenon of the super-spreader — a person who, for some reason still not well understood, is able to infect a large number of people. ""That's one of the big mysteries,"" said Osterholm.  ""Super-spreaders have been individuals who have been severely ill and even people who've been moderately ill. Why they're putting out so much virus is just not clear."" In the case of MERS, Osterholm said one person in a South Korean emergency room was able to infect 82 people in 2015. In the case of SARS, one super-spreader in Beijing was responsible for a chain of infections in 76 people. It's been reported that one man in Wuhan infected 14 hospital workers, which could be the first evidence of a super-spreader in this outbreak. But because it happened during surgery, the infection could be related to the surgical procedures. ""I think we have to still be a little bit careful, because this individual actually had had surgery, and any time you intubate somebody, you know you may very well have induced a higher rate of spreading the virus,"" said Osterholm. One of the encouraging aspects of the SARS story is that the virus was contained, said Osterholm, pointing to Canada, where most of the more than 400 infections and 44 deaths happened in and around Toronto. ""While Canada suffered miserably because of what was going on in Toronto, there weren't even any cases in Calgary, and Winnipeg,"" he said. ""So what we need to get people to understand is that we can't say this isn't going to come to every country in the world. It's unlikely, but it could. But when it does, it's going to likely be largely an institution-based outbreak like a hospital."" ""So that just helps give people a sense that we're not all going to die from this,"" he said. At her hospital in Hershey, Pa., Paules is part of a team that trains regularly to respond to an emerging viral threat. She said some of the strategies developed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks are already being used, including the closing of animal markets and airport screening. ""Some of those things have been able to get up and running very quickly, probably because of the lessons learned from SARS,"" said Paules. China was able to sequence the new virus and get that critical genetic code to the world quickly. Diagnostic tests have been developed, which means cases can be identified and isolated to contain the spread. ""I think some of the things from SARS and MERS that have really helped us here is how quickly the Chinese authorities were able to globally circulate the sequence of this virus,"" said Paules, who echoes Osterholm's point that most people don't have to worry about this virus. ""I would be concerned if I was in some of these areas in China. I would not myself probably decide to travel to any of those areas right now. But here sitting in my office in Hershey, Pennsylvania, I have a low concern that this virus is going to impact me personally, although I'm concerned for the global community.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562,[],N/A
620,Michael Gorman,2020-01-25T14:27:54.180Z,Feds end talks that could have seen N.S. buy land for golf course development,"The federal government is no longer negotiating with Nova Scotia's Lands and Forestry Department for the sale of surplus Crown land that could have become part of a proposed golf course development. Lighthouse Links Development Company wants to build as many as three golf courses in Little Harbour on the province's Eastern Shore. As part of that proposal, the company is trying to buy Crown land from the Nova Scotia government. The province was also negotiating, on the company's behalf, to buy 17 hectares of land Ottawa deemed surplus. Had the province planned to use the land for a public purpose, it could have had the property for one dollar. Because the golf course development doesn't fit the category, the two levels of government were considering a sale for $167,500. But a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada recently says those negotiations are off. ""Public Services and Procurement Canada is in discussions with [Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service] on the transfer of the land,"" Helena Sergakis said in an email. ""If finalized, the property on Nova Scotia's eastern shore would remain in the federal inventory. The Province of Nova Scotia has been notified."" Chris Miller, executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said he is delighted, but not surprised, by the news. ""The Trudeau government has been a leader on land conservation in Canada and it would have been shocking to me if they had sold off an ecological hotspot for a golf course."" Negotiations will continue between the province and company, however, for 285 hectares of provincial Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. Last March, the government removed the land from the pending legal protection list in the Parks and Protected Areas Plan. The move allowed Lands and Forestry to enter into negotiations with Lighthouse Links, which hopes to acquire the land to merge it with property the company already owns in Little Harbour. Miller and others have expressed concern about the land being delisted without consultation. Even after the move was complete, Owls Head remained listed on the government's website as pending protection for about 10 months. But a spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said Friday that public feedback on the matter would be considered before any deal is complete. As part of the letter of offer between the province and company, Lighthouse Links is required to develop a public engagement plan. It must be reviewed by the department. In an email, the company's lawyer said they are early in the planning stages for public engagement. ""My client will be looking for opportunities to engage with key stakeholders and the community as this proposed project proceeds, particularly as it relates to protection of the environment,"" said Sean Glover. ""Lighthouse Links remains committed to working with the community and government to preserve the legacy and beauty of the Little Harbour community."" Before a sale could be finalized it would need to be approved by the provincial cabinet. A spokesperson for the province said feedback from the public would be considered as part of those discussions. But Miller said he takes no comfort in the process because the government did no consultation before delisting the property. ""I don't trust that they'll do the right thing,"" he said. He and others worry the development would destroy an ecologically sensitive area that is home to several endangered species and a globally rare ecosystem. Miller said the outcry over the potential development also shows that people aren't OK with Crown land along the coast being sold when so little of Nova Scotia's coastline remains public. Earlier this week, Miller's organization set up a website that allows people to send a letter to Premier Stephen McNeil calling on him to protect Owls Head and keep it in public hands. ""Already 1,000 letters have gone in,"" said Miller. ""That's a very large response in a very short period of time.""

621,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:08:14.631Z,Indigenous pipeline supporters slam human-rights advocates over Coastal GasLink stance,"A collective of First Nations who support the liquefied natural gas industry in British Columbia say human rights advocates failed to do their research when they called for the Coastal GasLink pipeline project to be halted. The First Nations LNG Alliance has issued open letters to the B.C. human rights commissioner and the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination over statements they made about the pipeline. The commissioner and committee both called for the project to be stopped in the face of opposition from Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, who say the project has no authority without their consent. Both said the free, prior and informed consent of all affected Indigenous groups should be granted before any project is allowed to proceed. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline's 670-kilometre path but the Wet'suwet'en chiefs say within their territory, those councils only administer small reserves and it's the hereditary chiefs who hold jurisdiction over a broader area covering 22,000 square kilometres. Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, says in the letter to human rights commissioner Kasari Govender that the pipeline was approved through a democratic process that Indigenous people participated in freely, and neither the committee nor commissioner consulted supportive Indigenous groups before taking a position. No one could be reached for comment at the UN committee and Govender was not available for an interview Tuesday. ""It is disheartening to see that the input from 20 First Nations, who participated extensively during five years of consultation on the pipeline, and have successfully negotiated agreements with Coastal GasLink, is so easily dismissed by the B.C. Human Rights Commission,"" Ogen-Toews says in one of the open letters. Ogen-Toews was elected chief of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation, representing 255 members on and off reserve lands, for six years. The Wet'suwet'en First Nation covers a smaller area than the Wet'suwet'en Nation, over which the hereditary clan chiefs claim authority. The letter accuses Govender of ignoring the social and economic benefits already realized by workers and communities from the project. More than one-third of work on the project has been completed by Indigenous people and Coastal GasLink has earmarked $620 million in contracting opportunities for First Nations in the province, it says. The letter also accuses both the provincial commission and the UN committee of issuing public statements without talking to supportive First Nations. ""Both groups know nothing about the importance we place on finding a way out of endlessly trying to manage poverty, and finding the kind of opportunities for our First Nations people that non-Indigenous people have enjoyed for centuries,"" the letter says. The UN committee also called on the federal government to stop two other major resource projects, the Site C dam and Trans Mountain pipeline expansions. Na'moks, a spokesman for the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, has said they will never consent to the project. The chiefs issued an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink after the B.C. Supreme Court extended an injunction on Dec. 31 to the company. The RCMP has established a checkpoint along a logging road that leads to a pipeline work site, as well as two camps and a small settlement established by supporters of the hereditary chiefs.

622,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-24T00:00:00.569Z,"Crapaud could be 'perfect model' of rural health care on P.E.I., says minister ","Minister of Health and Wellness James Aylward says his government is committed to filling a doctor vacancy in the Crapaud area — and that it's ""looking forward to setting Crapaud up as a perfect model"" for health care in rural P.E.I. The statement comes one day after community volunteers appeared before the province's health and social development committee, describing their ongoing two-year struggle to fill the position, and an apparent lack of commitment from the province to maintain a doctor in the community. Aylward said Thursday filling the position for a doctor based out of Crapaud has ""always been our plan,"" since the PC government came to power following the April 2019 provincial election. ""What we would envision for a community like Crapaud, for example, would be a full-time physician complemented with a nurse practitioner complemented with an RN that would visit the community who maybe specializes in COPD,"" said Aylward. There has been some confusion recently — expressed by members of all three political parties in the legislature Wednesday — over what the Dennis King government's plan might be to provide primary health care in rural communities. Community members in Crapaud built their own new 3,000-square foot clinic building and purchased the necessary medical equipment. That building is currently home to a walk-in clinic and a single nurse practitioner. Members of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc. told a committee of MLAs Wednesday they were advised by the province's deputy minister of health of a new direction in primary care, with clinics operating with a minimum of four to five physicians working under the same roof. But Aylward said Thursday that's not a policy his government is pursuing — that it remains committed to Crapaud and other rural communities operating with only one physician. With a ""standalone practice, like in Crapaud for example, we want to ensure that the doctor is supported by other health-care professionals"" such as nurse practitioners and registered nurses, Aylward said. And if communities want to advertise their own doctor vacancies to try to find a physician to fill them, ""full steam ahead,"" he said. The South Shore group told the committee they were asked by the province not to include that the vacant position was in Crapaud in ads they were running. They continued to do so regardless. ""I'm not sure where that came from, it may have been the previous administration,"" said Aylward. When contacted by CBC, Matt MacFarlane, co-chair of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc., said ""it's great to hear"" that the current government has planned all along to fill the doctor vacancy in Crapaud. ""That plan has never been communicated to us as the plan,"" he said. ""So at this point it's certainly wonderful to hear, finally, a commitment to placing a doctor in Crapaud and we'd love to hear a little bit more about the government's plan for rolling that out.""

Wolke, 79, drove 26 hours to watch a game at a high school basketball tournament. He owns a cottage in Port Hilford, Guysborough County, and spends his summers there. It was at the 2018 Stan Rogers Folk Festival in Canso when he met the MacLeans, a local family. When Wolke saw there were no mesh nets on an outdoor basketball court used by kids in the community, the former coach said he had to step up. He bought some nets and gave them to the MacLeans. ""When I got back to the cottage that day I decided I would drive up to Antigonish and I bought a few nets,"" Wolke said from his home in Ohio. ""I'm a big advocate of kids being outside doing something versus sitting around and being bored."" That was just the beginning of the relationship between the retired coach and young basketball players in the remote community more than three hours northeast of Halifax. He delivered more gifts the following summer as Wolke continued to spread goodwill through basketball. ""This time he had two basketballs and more basketball nets,"" said Amanda MacLean. MacLean is a teacher at Canso Academy. Her son, Druhan, is a member of the school basketball team and her husband, John, is an assistant coach. ""It just goes to show you that there really are good people in this world,"" Amanda said. After Wolke returned to Ohio he stayed in touch with the family. He learned many of the boys who played on those no-net basketball hoops 18 months ago are now playing for the high school team in Canso. Wolke wanted to see the Canso Academy Seahawks in person. Two weeks ago, he and two friends made the drive to watch them play in a tournament in Guysborough, not far from his cottage. ""We actually left a little early because a storm was coming,"" said Wolke, who saw the Seahawks win a semifinal game and advance to the tournament final. ""They played a really good game. They looked really good."" Prior to that game, only a few of those players had ever met the man who donated the equipment that many of them had used on their outdoor court. Wolke had a special surprise when he addressed the team in their dressing room. ""The boys knew he had something with him in a box but they didn't know what it was,"" said Amanda. ""When he opened up the box there were beautiful Canso Academy Seahawks T-shirts for each of the players and coaches."" Wolke said he had the shirts made for free by a friend in Cincinnati. But his gesture has had an impact on the boys team. ""To have somebody who is literally hundreds of miles away take the time and want to share his time and experiences is just tremendous,"" said Brandon Dort, the team's head coach. ""It's all about life lessons and Ernie has really been an amazing model of how you can give back through sport."" For many years there was no high school basketball team in Canso. But, three years ago, a young team came together. That group is now having a successful season and hopes to win a regional championship and qualify for provincials. ""I'll be rooting for the Seahawks from down here in Ohio but I doubt I'll drive back up to watch them,"" joked Wolke, who says he's already thinking of what he can give the team next year.

624,Darren Bernhardt,2019-12-28T12:00:00.792Z,"Long, winding history of skating on Winnipeg rivers dates to 1872","Ice-glazed eyelashes and cold air cutting through nostrils are winter rites of passage, after strapping on skates to scratch patterns on Winnipeg's frozen rivers. The trail along the Red and Assiniboine rivers, a short walk down from The Forks market, draws tens of thousands of people annually. But that Zamboni-cleared path has only welcomed skaters since 1990. The sound of steel blades carving the ice, however, has echoed between those eroding riverbanks for 147 years. ""And I think that'll continue well into the future. It's quite alluring for anybody whose interested in skating to be on the river,"" said local historian, Bruce Cherney. ""You can see the sights of the city while you're just skating along. You can see the buildings, you see the bridges and you can see the tree lines."" The activity dates back to a time when fewer than 1,000 people lived in and around the wooden walls of Fort Garry, an area known as the Red River Colony. It was 1872. The colony was just two years removed from the Louis Riel-led Red River Rebellion, which helped lead to the formation of Manitoba as a province. A smaller settlement, which had sprouted from a single general store a decade earlier, was swiftly growing a quarter-mile from the colony. Known as Winnipeg, this collection of shacks was located at the junction of two muddy fur-runner trails — later to become known as Portage Avenue and Main Street. It didn't take long for the village to become the business and banking centre of the region, which also made it a focus for news. The first-ever edition of the Manitoba Free Press rolled off the press in 1872, operating out of one of those shacks on Main. Charles Napier Bell, who was part of the Wolseley expedition — a military force sent from Eastern Canada to confront Riel in 1870 — is said to have introduced ice skating to the area. He was a 16-year-old with a taste for adventure when he joined the expedition as a bugler, according to the Manitoba Historical Society. After the military took control of the Red River Colony — Riel and many followers fled just before the troops arrived — Bell spent a couple of years hunting and trading along the Saskatchewan River. He came back in 1872 and settled in the Winnipeg village. That winter the 18-year-old Bell — who would later become president of the Canadian Club of Winnipeg as well as a founder of the Manitoba Historical and Scientific Society — took to the frozen river with skates brought from Ontario. The activity was well established out east and Bell was an avid skater already. His smooth control captivated onlookers. ""He was one that showed the people how to skate,"" said Cherney, who published columns in the Winnipeg Real Estate News for three decades before retiring in 2018. The activity quickly caught on and Bell was joined by other militiamen who had come from Ontario and were stationed at the Osborne barracks, near the current Manitoba Legislative Building.  The troops cleared a space on the Assiniboine River and topped it with a canopy to keep it clear of snow, anointing it as Victoria Rink, in honour of the Queen, who was the cherished symbol of the British Empire, Cherney noted.  In January, 1873, the Manitoba Free Press reported that ""winter skating is the biggest thing on ice, and the defenders of our country have erected … a magnificent skating rink."" Skates were being ordered from stores out east as Winnipeggers embraced the thrill of gliding on ice. They also started looking to adopt ideas from Eastern Canada, where rinks were lit by gas lamps and used for skating competitions and winter carnivals. ""Urged on by Bell … they wanted to have their own dedicated and safer skating facility,"" Cherney wrote in an article for the Real Estate News. By late 1873, the village of Winnipeg and the Red River Colony, with a combined population of 1,869, merged to incorporate the entire region as the city of Winnipeg. The boundaries, which included 2,000 acres of land, went east and south the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The western limit ran along present-day Maryland Street and to the north it was bounded by Burrows Avenue. When the first council meeting was held Jan. 19, 1874, on the second floor of a new building at Portage and Main, the population had boomed to 3,700. In November, 1874, construction began on Winnipeg's Amphitheatre, a seasonal rink on the Red River at the foot of Post Office Street (now Lombard Avenue). According to Cherney, it was set to have lighted and heated dressing rooms for men and women. It was also designed with a suite for the ice keeper to live in while taking care of the facility. ""The whole arrangement will be well conducted and will inevitably become a popular resort for the long winter evenings. The rink is covered by a self-supporting roof,"" the Free Press reported. But no sooner had the rink come under construction when much of it came down in a heap. A stretch of mild weather shifted the supporting beams, which had been set on the ice, Cherney said. ""The fate of their first attempt could also be attributed to the novelty of constructing the first indoor rink in Winnipeg,"" he wrote in his article. The builders surveyed the damage and found the rooms and ice-keeper's suite intact. So they adjusted the plan and began rebuilding around that, setting the support beams on shore instead. The Free Press, undefeated in its enthusiasm, declared the rebuilt structure to be the ""first skating rink ever built in Winnipeg or the Red River Settlement"" and assured it would be the centre of attraction during the day as well as night. The following winter, the first river skate of the year was so highly anticipated that the Free Press reported on it. It was Nov. 13, 1875. Bell ""started the skating season with a flourish across the ice,"" said Cherney. As its popularity boomed, so did the dangers as people started to spread out across the river and into territory used by companies that harvested large sections of ice. The blocks were removed in winter and stored in huge buildings, or icehouses, until warmer months. They were then cut into smaller chunks and delivered to homes and businesses for refrigeration. Newspapers in the late 1800s warned skaters to be on the lookout for areas where ice cutters might be plying their trade, Cherney said.. There were also natural hazards. Shortly after Bell's flourish in 1875, the Free Press reported two boys skated into an air-hole that same month. They were rescued by another boy who took off his coat and used it to pull the boys out. ""Conditions would change quite dramatically over the course of the years but somehow they coped, somehow they stayed on and I guess they were extremely careful, too,"" Cherney said. ""They would know where where to go and where not to go. When you only had the option of river ice [to skate on], you had to be careful."" By 1875, plans were underway for Winnipeg's first indoor rink built on land. Once again named the Victoria Rink, it was built on Annie Street (now Patrick), off of Logan Avenue. About seven years later, yet another Victoria Skating Rink was was built at a location more familiar to Winnipeggers — the corner of Portage Avenue and Donald Street. It's not clear if that spot is the same corner where Bell MTS Place now stands but it was in the vicinity. The advent of hockey contributed to another boom in skating's popularity, as well as the building of more rinks around the city. In the winter of 1886-87, there were reports of ""hoky"" or ""hocky"" or ""hockey"" being played on the Red River, Cherney said. Winnipeg lawyer Patrick Anderson Macdonald gets credit for that. One of the founders of several sports organizations in the city, including the Assiniboine Curling Club and the Winnipeg Rowing Club, he also brought the first hockey sticks to Manitoba, according to the Manitoba Historical Society. He returned with them after a visit in 1885-86 to Montreal and helped form the city's first team, a club from which the Winnipeg Victorias men's team was formed in 1889. The momentum that carried skating to such a popular level also propelled the Victorias to become Stanley Cup champions in 1896, the first Western team to do so since the trophy was established in 1893. Before being taken over by the NHL, the Stanley Cup was awarded to Canada's best amateur hockey team. And the Victorias' names are also etched on a long-removed plate from the trophy for the years 1901 and 1902. ""It should be also noted that winter sort of forces us to become proficient in the winter sports,"" Cherney said. As Winnipeg grew and expanded and neighbourhoods moved further from the rivers, community centres developed. Indoor and outdoor rinks became more accessible, and reliable, and the crowds on the rivers dwindled. The past two decades, however, have seen a resurgence thanks to the modern river trail established around The Forks. ""I think it's a little bit of a nostalgia — being out in the open. Part of it is freedom,"" said Cherney. ""You can skate in for, basically, kilometres if you so choose. This is not the confines of skating around in circles in an indoor rink."" Prior to The Forks clearning its path, organizers of the Festival du Voyageur used to clean off parts of a bend in the Red, near Whittier Park. At the same time, a community group called River-Borne — a blend of River Avenue and Osborne Street — used to make skating available on the Assiniboine near the legislative building. ""It's been an ad-hoc community thing by many groups for many years,"" said Amelia Laidlaw, a spokesperson with The Forks. ""Then we took it over."" Depending on how soon the water freezes and how early spring arrives, the trail can be open for anywhere from a few weeks to three months. Last year was a record 76 days, whereas there is uncertainty it will happen in 2020. Mother Nature also determines its length, which can range from a couple of kilometres to setting a Guinness Book of World Records length of 9.3 km in 2008. That was the year ""when the uptake really happened,"" said Laidlaw. ""That's when it really turned into something.""  The publicity from setting a Guinness record brought out the crowds and they've never stopped coming.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/river-skating-winnipeg-history-1.5400778,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/things-you-might-not-know-about-portage-and-main-1.1262369 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-history-confederation-1.4169341 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ode-winter-poems-songs-manitoba-1.3919323 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-lessons-for-other-winter-cities-1.3989995 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grand-rapids-winnipeg-biz-tourism-1.3455211 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-jets-take-practice-outdoors-to-assiniboine-river-1.2548663 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-forks-river-skating-trail-risk-peril-1.5394427 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/forks-river-trail-72-days-1.5050150,N/A
625,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-24T23:51:00.154Z,Defence-witness pharmacology expert testifies Jason McKay had alcohol-induced amnesia,"A pharmacology expert testified Friday that he believes Jason McKay suffered from alcohol induced amnesia, but noted he was forming some of his opinion based on what McKay said. McKay is on trial at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench, accused of fatally stabbing his wife Jenny in 2017. He pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Steven Richardson, a pharmacology expert, was called to testify as an expert by the defence.  Richardson said McKay was unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions when he allegedly stabbed Jenny because of alcohol-induced amnesia — sometimes called blackouts. Richardson suggested a combination of Sertraline (an antidepressant) and alcohol led to this state. McKay testified Thursday that he took antidepressants daily and that he drank four cans of Twisted Tea and some red wine on Sept. 5, 2017. McKay said that after his first sip of red wine he began to experience multiple blackouts. He said he remembered stabbing his wife twice with ""a dagger"" after hearing voices, although no ""dagger"" was recovered from the crime scene.   Richardson said there are no scientific studies on how Sertraline might act affect the blood alcohol level, but he was confident there would be some sort of interaction.  ""If someone's in an amnesia period, they would have no judgment,"" Richardson maintained under cross examination on Friday. He said that's because brain cells responsible for creating long-term memories are also involved in judgment. Richardson said people are still capable of thoughts, ideas and plans in an alcohol-induced amnesia state, but plans would be carried out without an ""appropriateness filter.""  When asked by the Crown to point the court to the scientific evidence to back that up, Richardson he couldn't. He said his opinion was based on an understanding of brain functioning.  McKay testified his blackouts extended to his time with police after his arrest. He said he couldn't remember police interviews on the eve of Sept. 6, or the next morning.   Richardson said it's possible McKay was still suffering from alcohol-induced amnesia during the evening — about 13.5 hours from the time McKay was arrested. He admitted he had been assuming that McKay continued to drink wine. ""Are you just assuming things that tend to favour Mr. McKay's recollections?"" asked Crown prosecutor Adam Breker.  ""I do not know scientifically whether he was suffering,"" Richardson said, adding he was relying on McKay's behaviour after he was told Jenny was dead by a police officer, which he felt was consistent with someone who could not remember.  ""I have to take his word for it.""  However, Richardson did say he didn't think McKay would still be suffering from the amnesia on the morning of Sept. 7, 2019  — an interview McKay said he cannot remember.  Richardson said there is not yet scientifically acceptable means to assess if alcohol induced amnesia has occurred, so the only way to know is to talk to someone and ultimately trust their account. Closing arguments are expected to take place on Monday afternoon.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/pharmacology-expert-jason-mckay-defence-1.5440296,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-testifies-second-degree-murder-trial-1.5438479 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-murder-trial-voir-dire-1.5436612,N/A
626,Deana Sumanac-Johnson,2019-11-10T09:00:00.260Z,Holocaust holograms: how survivors' stories live on through new technology,"As Holocaust Education Week wraps up, those trying to preserve the memories of the genocide that took the lives of six million Jews during the Second World War are in a race against time. The survivors, whose powerful testimonies provided younger generations with first-hand accounts, are getting older and dying. Meanwhile, a study done this year by the Azrieli Foundation suggests one in five Canadian young people have either not heard of the Holocaust or aren't sure what it is. The solution, for many individuals and organizations, has been to supplement traditional records such as memoirs and documentaries with presentations in new media and technology.  ""Our world is changing, and we have to meet people where they are if we're really going to have an impact,"" says Kori Street, a Canadian and a senior director at University of Southern California's Shoah Foundation. The foundation, established by filmmaker Steven Spielberg and dedicated to preserving the stories of the victims of the Holocaust and other genocides, has been working on a series of interactive two- and three-dimensional testimonies of  survivors.  ""We're losing these individuals,"" said Street. ""We wanted to give that ability to ask survivors questions available in perpetuity to students in this generation and the next."" Pinchas Gutter understands the urgency. An 87-year-old Holocaust survivor with bright blue eyes and a broad smile, Gutter, who lives in Toronto, flew to Nova Scotia this week to make a public address at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21. He also talked to several groups of school children. It's busy, exhausting work, both physically and emotionally, but it's Gutter's life's purpose. Born to a Jewish family in Poland, Gutter was just 10 when the Nazis killed his parents and his twin sister in a single day, leaving him alone in the Majdanek concentration camp. ""It's so important that we must make every effort and do as much as we can and tell the world as much as we can, to try and impart that knowledge, that first-hand witness knowledge, while the time is still there."" Still, Gutter knows he won't be able to bear witness forever. So he volunteered for several high-tech projects to translate the power of that testimony. He was the first of 22 Holocaust survivors so far to sit down for the Shoah Foundation's Dimensions in Testimony. Recording the three-dimensional  volumetric video meant Gutter had to sit still, for hours at a time, as more than 100 cameras recorded multiple angles. Gutter's testimony is interactive; during the recording, he answered over 1,000 questions museum visitors might have. They ranged from simple: ""What is your favourite colour?"" to more complicated, like ""How did your rebuild your life after the war?"" Since 2017, these interactive testimonies have travelled to Holocaust museums around North America, including  the Neuberger Centre in Toronto. Most places show them as high-definition two-dimensional video on a flat screen, though some have also shown them as ""Pepper's Ghosts,"" hologram-like projections many people find particularly affecting. The plan is to show them as true holograms once that technology is widely available at museums, which Kori Street calls ""future-proofing."" ""It's not about technology for technology's sake. They connect with the human story,"" says Street. Museum visitors ""forget that it's a system, they are talking to a human being, they are asking someone questions.""  Indeed, at the Fisher Museum in Los Angeles, where visitors can see Gutter's interactive testimony, university students who asked him questions were impressed. Celine Lai welled up as she watched the virtual Gutter wipe away tears when she asked him if he had any regrets. He answered that he missed his family and was particularly distraught that he could not remember the face of his twin sister Sabina. ""He expressed emotion on his face, and when you listen to him, I feel like he affected my emotions. I was really impressed with his answers; you can feel his love for his sister,"" said Lai. Not all experiments with modern media to translate the horror of the Holocaust have been equally successful. Earlier this year, Israeli tech enterpreneur Mati Kochavi poured millions of dollars into a project called Eva Stories. A series of 70 Instagram stories, it was a fictionalized account of the life of Eva Heyman, a real teen who perished in the Holocaust. The premise was ""What if a girl in the Holocaust had Instagram?"" So in these mini-movies, the actor portraying Heyman wears 1940s clothes but takes selfies in a park and sends emojis to a boy she has a crush on.  The project divided opinions. Many praised its ingenuity in emphasizing the similarity between a teen Holocaust victim and teens today, and the fictional Instagram account of Eva had 200,000 followers on the day it launched. But some were outraged at what they saw as disrespect, with one critic arguing ""the path from 'Eva's Story' to selfie-taking at the gates of Auschwitz-Birkenau is short and steep."" Street agrees that using technology to tackle such sensitive subject matter has its drawbacks. She says Dimensions in Testimony was initially ""met with great suspicion. 'What are you doing? How are you doing this? This will never work.'"" She and her colleagues at the Shoah Foundation have learned, she said, how to be transparent about how they're using the technology. ""This is a system. This is a testimony. This is a different way of you being able to interact with it in the same way that a fictionalized story using social media, Instagram, you have to understand the medium of Instagram."" Gutter has not yet committed his story to social media but he has participated in a critically hailed virtual reality project called The Last Goodbye. In it, he returns to Poland to take viewers on a harrowing journey inside Majdanek. ""You may be wearing earphones and goggles, but at the same time, you're actually walking with the person. You're in Majdanek, you're not in the room where you think you are, because you lose yourself,"" says Gutter. ""People don't read as much as they used to do, people don't listen very much, they don't interact, so the only way to do it is use new technology to be able to impart everything that you want them to do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028,[],N/A
627,Sara Minogue,2020-01-21T20:23:24.880Z,Giant Mine's remediation team still has a to-do list,"The Giant Mine remediation team opened public hearings in Yellowknife on Monday with some big promises.  ""The project will provide value to residents, and return a site that is greatly improved,"" said project director Chris MacInnis.  MacInnis also laid out the stakes of any delays to the cleanup: anywhere from $15 to $20 million in extra costs to the taxpayer for every year the cleanup is delayed.  The team is presenting its final closure and remediation plan to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board this week in the hope of obtaining a 20-year water licence and a five-year land use permit. It's the last major hurdle before the $1-billion cleanup finally begins.  But MacInnis made it clear that the final closure plan may not be completely final.  ""It is only with the confidence of an approved final closure and reclamation plan that the project can complete the final detailed design,"" MacInnis said. ""We have proposed a phased approach to submissions that will present these detailed designs to the board for approval to allow active remediation work at the Giant Mine site to start in 2021."" In other remarks, Natalie Plato, the remediation team's deputy director, explained that the team had yet to file a quantitative risk assessment, ordered by the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board. She promised that would be done by February, before the water licence is issued.  She also said a planned stress study, part of the team's health effects monitoring, had yet to take place. The study is expected to look at how stress related to the possibility of arsenic exposure may affect human health. Plato said they don't believe this should be a condition of the water licence, as it will not affect project design, but rather, how the project engages with the public. The board will hold four more days of hearings — on top of months of presentations — to determine whether that phased approach can satisfy all parties who want to see the work done right. More than 100 people attended Monday's session. At least one interested person is confident the project is going in the right direction. Ed Sangris, Dettah chief for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, opened his remarks by saying that Giant Mine ""significantly and fundamentally changed the people of the Yellowknives Dene.""  And while Sangris said it was a little strange to be holding hearings after so much important work at the site had already happened, such as the dismantling of the roasting complex and the removal of the headframe (both deemed safety priorities), he's optimistic about the process.  ""Giant Mine has never benefited the Yellowknives Dene. We were not consulted and we did not receive any compensation from Giant,"" he said.  ""With this process, we have the opportunity … to return to what was taken from us, the opportunity to reconcile with the past, the opportunity to change."" The hearings continue on Tuesday. Members of the public who want to ask questions or make comments can attend one of two evening sessions, Tuesday and Wednesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-remediation-to-do-list-1.5434166,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-cleanup-compensation-claims-1.5367353,N/A

MacDonald says her fiancé noticed their two Seas-Doos and the trailer they were on weren't in the driveway that night, but assumed contractors working on their Mount Moriah home moved them to the backyard. It wasn't until the next morning they knew something wasn't right. ""They were nowhere to be found,"" said MacDonald. ""So that's when we called the police."" MacDonald took to social media where she posted photos of the Sea-Doos and trailer on a local classifieds website. It wasn't long before they had some information to go on. ""A lady called from Porter's Lane in Curling (in nearby Corner Brook). I guess she had discovered a Sea-Doo had been left there,"" MacDonald said. The woman told MacDonald the thieves ran into trouble trying to make off with the stolen goods. ""I guess they got a flat tire along the way when they left the house because one of the tires on the trailer was low and I don't think the thieves realized,"" she said. ""But once they got so far they had a blowout so they had no choice but to pull off the road."" The woman told MacDonald she saw some men trying to get the Sea-Doos off the trailer and into the back of a dark green Ford pickup. ""I guess once they got the flat on the trailer they had a pickup truck so their only option was to take one and put it in the pan of the truck,"" MacDonald said. One of the Sea-Doos was found with the trailer right where the truck was seen. MacDonald said other than a bit of damage to the trailer, she expects to be able to use them again once they're released from police. Social media helped find the second Sea-Doo earlier this week. A wildlife officer tweeted about an abandoned Sea-Doo he found on Lady Slipper Road near Corner Brook, but that one was in hard shape. ""They scrapped it. They took the motor and all the parts off it,"" she said. ""They were just after the parts."" As of Friday, the RCMP said there were no arrests and remains under investigation. Still angry about the theft, MacDonald admits she also feels let down. ""[It] just frustrates me that my fiancé works away and works for what he got, you know, and we've never had it easy either. What we got we worked for,"" she said. ""For someone else to come into my property and take something that belongs to him doesn't make me happy.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/sea-doos-mount-moriah-social-media-1.3857158,[],N/A

""We don't accept this risk."" Shawnigan Lake is a 45-minute drive from Victoria, B.C. The watershed serves the 12,000 people of Shawnigan Lake and acts as a backup water supply for various communities in the Cowichan Valley Regional District.  The landfill, located in an old quarry in the hills above the community, received a permit in 2013 to accept and store up to 100,000 tonnes of contaminated soil each year. Contaminated soil is typically caused by industrial activity but does not include hazardous waste. The province pulled the permit in 2017 after it said owner Cobble Hill Holdings Ltd. failed to provide documents proving the company had financial security in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit. The decision to revoke the permit also followed years of protests and several court battles over the facility. Now, two years later, the province has decided on a landfill closure plan that does not involve removing the soil. It will instead be monitored by the province.  ""This is a site that is above that drinking watershed, sitting on top of groundwater with surface water wrapping around it. It was never an appropriate location for contaminated soil and that soil should not stay there,"" said Furstenau. George Heyman, B.C.'s minister of environment and climate change strategy, says the final closure plan is intended to protect the environment and drinking water. It has been reviewed by the ministry's technical staff, is based on science and was reviewed and checked by three sets of qualified professionals and firms, he says. ""There were reasonable ways to protect the environment and the water supply that didn't involve removal of the soil,"" Heyman told Gregor Craigie, the host of CBC's On the Island.  A concern with the contaminated soil is 'leaching,' where rain seeps into the ground, dissolving chemicals in the soil and transporting them into underground water supplies. There are groundwater monitoring wells onsite to track water quality. However, at the moment, none of them are shallow groundwater monitors. Shawnigan Lake residents have raised concern about this. The ministry's hydrogeologist also said the current monitoring wells under the site are too deep to assess the impacts the soil has on the shallow aquifer that sits under the landfill site. Shallow monitors could better assess that. As part of the new closure plan, there is a condition that shallow groundwater monitoring wells be installed.  ""Should those reveal anything, and we don't expect them to, but should they, there will be ample time to address it by adjusting the closure plan or taking measures to prevent any leaching."" Monitoring is cheaper than removal, which would require a minimum of $11 million to conduct, according to the ministry.  Listen to both interviews here With files from On the Island, All Point West and Megan Thomas.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/soil-landfill-contaminated-vancouver-island-shawnigan-lake-1.5198872,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/court-ruling-halts-contaminated-soil-dumping-in-shawnigan-lake-1.3950333 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-government-suspends-permit-for-soil-dumping-near-shawnigan-lake-1.3956584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/shawnigan-lake-soil-dump-warning-1.3669829,N/A
630,Adam Carter,2020-01-10T17:22:35.482Z,Families of Iran plane crash victims facing uphill battle to recover remains,"Manant Vaidya knows the tragedy of losing loved ones in an airline disaster better than almost anyone. And in the wake of the plane crash in Iran that killed all 176 passengers on board, his heart is aching this week. Vaidya endured the same anguish these families are now facing; he lost his parents, sister, brother-in-law and two nieces last year when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed shortly after takeoff from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. Now the Brampton, Ont., man is once again seeing news stories of entire families wiped out. ""Those families looked just like the family I lost,"" he said. ""It all came back to me."" Vaidya has also lived through a logistical nightmare that the victim's families are now starting to navigate: Trying to recover their loved one's bodies and bring them home for funerals. Many of those who died in this week's crash were Muslim, and Muslims customarily must bury their loved ones as quickly as possible after death — something that proves almost impossible in a complex incident like this. WATCH | Manant Vaidya says he wishes no one would ever lose family in an airline disaster again Experts also say that repatriating the bodies of Canadians killed in the crash will be hampered by heightened military tensions and the fact that Canada severed diplomatic ties with Iran years ago. ""There's a lot of psychological trauma the families now have to endure,"" said Liyakat Takim, a religious studies professor at McMaster University in Hamilton. ""The trauma is just unbelievable for them."" Takim is also feeling that trauma first-hand; he was close friends with religious pilgrimage tour leader Asghar Dhirani, who died in the crash. ""I keep thinking about his last moments … it keeps coming in my mind,"" he said. Authorities have said the bodies and remains recovered from the site of the crash have been taken to the coroner's office for identification. Hassan Shadkoo's wife, Sheyda, was one of the victims. Speaking to CBC News from Toronto's Pearson International Airport Wednesday night, he said that instead of his wife returning to him, he was headed to Tehran to retrieve her remains and be with her family. ""I wish I didn't exist now,"" he said. Mohammad Tarbhai, a relative of crash victims Alina and Afifa Tarbhai, told CBC News that authorities need to carry out DNA testing, and he isn't expecting their bodies to be released for at least a week. Vaidya's experience shows that, in all likelihood, reclaiming the bodies of the Canadians who died won't be a simple process. He flew to Ethiopia after the crash last March, hoping to identify and retrieve his family's remains from that crash site. He quickly learned that would be impossible with an ongoing investigation. The only thing he was able to take was soil. ""That's all that was left to me,"" he said. Vaidya, who is Hindu, brought that soil to India, and was able to use it to perform end-of-life rituals. ""As long as you have the soil and you have the thoughts in your heart and mind … that is how we got the closure initially,"" he said. It wasn't until November that he was able to return to Ethiopia to officially recover his family's remains and bring them to India for final cremation. Muslim families dealing with this tragedy won't be able to observe normal customs, Takim said. Usually, a dead person's body would be washed and wrapped in a white shroud before prayers and a burial, he said, which would take place as soon as possible after death. ""The normal procedure would not be applicable in these cases,"" said Takim, adding that a precedent does exist for longer waits for burials in extenuating circumstances, such as when a post-mortem examination is necessary. This whole situation is undoubtedly very traumatic for the families involved, he said. ""Their loved one has not died a normal death."" Vaidya stressed that the families of the Iran crash victims should reach out to Global Affairs Canada. ""They were very helpful,"" he said. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne spoke to his Iranian counterpart earlier this week and stressed ""the need for Canadian officials to be quickly granted access to Iran to provide consular services, help with identification of the deceased and take part in the investigation of the crash,"" according to a readout of the call. The readout didn't say whether Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif agreed to Champagne's request. Champagne said Thursday that despite Canada's rocky relationship with Iran, he's been reassured that Canadian investigators will get visas to enter the country. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday that intelligence now indicates the Ukrainian aircraft that crashed outside of Tehran was shot down by an Iranian missile, possibly unintentionally. Iranian officials have denied the allegation. ""We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,"" Trudeau said Thursday during a news conference in Ottawa. ""The news will undoubtedly come as a further shock to the families who are already grieving in the face of this unspeakable tragedy,"" he said. The crash happened just hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Iraqi bases housing U.S. soldiers, in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to order the targeted killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. In a report released Wednesday, the Iranian aviation authority said that it has invited ""all the states involved"" to join a growing team investigating the plane crash. The organization's initial report into the crash said a fire broke out on the Boeing aircraft immediately before it hit the ground. adam.carter@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-body-recovery-funerals-1.5421321,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-toronto-victims-1.5418882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-plane-crash-canada-access-investigation-1.5421352,N/A

These are no ordinary ribs. These are muskox ribs, and they are huge. ""They are so big they remind me of the Flintstones,"" said Nicky Richards. Richards lives in Norman Wells, N.W.T., and loves to hunt and cook wild meat with her husband Stuart Pope. Anytime they can get muskox, they don't hesitate. There's just so much meat. ""A lot of the time we will cut them in half so they are easier to manage,"" Richards said. ""But I like when they are big like that, there's a lot of meat on them."" Muskox look big, but looks can be deceiving. Her husband is a proficient hunter and she has hunted them herself too. They have seen a lot of muskox. ""They look big because they are so furry,"" she said. ""They're very tough animals, sometimes it takes a lot to get one down."" Every time they get a muskox, they are sure to use all of the meat.  ""The wild meat that we eat is 80 per cent of our diet."" Her husband Stuart made these big, delicious looking muskox ribs, and according to Nicky, the recipe was simple.  ""I asked him, like, 'Oh my goodness these are so good, what did you do?' And he said, 'Soya sauce, Worcestershire sauce and maple syrup.'"" she said. ""He just baked it in the oven all day long and kept braising with that little bit of sauce and it just made it perfect."" It was so simple, she said it just made sense to share it on the CBC's Facebook recipe page. Lindsay McKay said, ""Oh my good Lord"" when he saw the picture. When group member Will Chiksi saw the ribs he said, ""Unreal! Looks amazing."" And, Christine Hasler says the picture was an eye opener. ""I didn't know they could be hunted ... Learn something new every day."" Richards says one of the great things about living in Norman Wells is that people in the community love to share. She says hunters share meat when they come down from the mountains. Now she's taking it a step further, and sharing it with people and the new friends she's making in our Facebook group.  ""There was never really any opportunity to share this stuff until I had seen the Facebook page. Seeing other people's recipes, I just thought I'd share what we had too.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/muskox-ribs-arctic-kitchen-recipes-norman-wells-1.5352206,[],N/A
632,Sara Fraser,2020-01-18T12:00:00.708Z,8 reasons to try cross-country skiing this winter,"Now that there's plenty of snow on the ground, P.E.I. is looking like a winter wonderland — perfect for making tracks with cross-country skis.  Whether you prefer to head out on ungroomed areas, or enjoy a machine-groomed track, there are plenty of places to ski on P.E.I.  CBC asked a couple of seasoned skiers why it's their absolute favourite thing to do in winter, and how it can benefit just about anyone.  Strap on your own skis and blaze your own trail through the snow. It's best, when possible, to ask property owners if it's OK to use their property. Or, several places across P.E.I. offer groomed trails for free or for a fee.  Mark Arendz Provincial Ski Park at Brookvale has 24.5 kilometres of groomed recreational trails, 7.5 kilometres of competitive trails and a biathlon trail, plus ski rentals. The recreational trails are for all skill levels through beautiful countryside, and there is a nordic lodge to change.  The non-profit Souris Striders Ski Club on the Souris Line Road in Souris may be P.E.I.'s best-kept secret, with 21 kilometres of scenic groomed trails on 40 hectares of land — three kilometres of the trails are lit until 10 p.m. every night — and a lodge for changing and rentals. There are four trails: groomed, classic, skate, and snowshoe.  In Summerside, Heather Moyse Park and Rotary Friendship Park both have trails groomed for free cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Charlottetown maintains groomed ski trails at Victoria Park and Belvedere Golf Course for free public use. Ski trail maps are available at the parks and recreation department at city hall. And Mill River Resort at Mill River in western P.E.I. has three trails including more than eight kilometres of groomed trails and ski rentals, and one of the trails is lit until 9 p.m.  Cross-country skiing puts you on a trail through nature. You could see birds, bunnies, foxes and more as you whoosh quietly through the woods and fields.  ""It's a great way to just detach from the world and kind of recharge,"" said Sarah Flynn, the event co-ordinator for the Souris Striders. She said on an outing last week she was struck by the peaceful beauty of ""trees and beautiful white snow and birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking on trees — it was just lovely.""  ""The air is so crisp and clean,"" said Albert Flavell, 50, an avid cross-country skier and fatbiker from Summerside. He's also in charge of grooming trails in the parks in Summerside.  Even on stormy days, wooded trails can be quiet and peaceful, he said.  ""Whether it's the birds or the squirrels or just the smell of the spruce, it's a great place to be,"" Flavell said. ""Being outside definitely plays a huge role in my mental health, for sure."" ""It's an excellent workout,"" said Flynn. ""Cross-country skiers actually have some of the higher levels of physical fitness, and it's a great way to improve your cardiovascular health.""  Flavell straps on his skis three or four times a week.  ""If you want to push the pace, you can really get your heart rate up and have a great workout,"" he said. For a tougher workout, he hits the competitive trails at Brookvale (it also has easy and intermediate trails). Those looking for a flat, easy trail can try Rotary Friendship Park in Summerside, he suggests.  Skiing can be a mild or strenuous workout, depending on the pace the skier wants to set.  If you enjoy speed, skate-skiing rather than the classic old-school in-track skiing can be quite fast and exhilarating, Flavell said.   Flynn and Flavell said cross-country skiing can be a very social activity. Even if you arrive alone, you can find others on the trail to have a chat if you like.  The Souris club is starting a new night-skiing activity Tuesdays from 7 to 8, and everyone is welcome.  ""Sometimes people don't have time during the daylight hours to go but they want to go in the evenings, but it's a little bit scary to go in the dark,"" said Flynn. They'll use the club's three kilometres of lighted trails. Flavell enjoys going with a group of skiers, who often strap on headlights at night for a moonlight ski and share potluck snacks.  Because cross-country skiing is for all abilities and fitness levels, it can be great for families of all ages.  ""My mum starting taking me out when I was about five years old and we're still skiing together in the evenings, and this is 20 years later,"" said Flynn. ""It's a great way to bond with your children and teach them something new and teach them how to take care of their bodies."" A day pass for the Souris Striders trails is $5, or pay $10 for a year-round pass. Rentals are $5 per day, and there are plenty. Organizers said they only run out of skis one day a year: Islander Day, which this year falls on Feb. 17. The club keeps the fees low by fundraising. Mill River's fees start at $5 for a day pass to $35 for a family day pass with rentals, and season passes for trail use starting at $50 for students/seniors to $125 for a family.  The trails in Charlottetown and Summerside are free to the public. Tickets to use the trail at Brookvale are $10 to $12.50 for a day pass, or $98 to $126.50 for a season pass. Rentals are available from $9 to $14 per day.  ""For the enjoyment you get, it's pretty cheap,"" said Flavell. ""It definitely is a cheap sport.""  To purchase a good entry-level ski package of bindings, boots and poles should start at about $200, while a high-end carbon set can run to several thousand dollars, said Flavell — but either could last you a lifetime with only minor maintenance.  Cross-country skiing is probably one of the safer winter sports, said Flynn, compared to alpine skiing or hockey.  Flavell said he used to be a runner, but said skiing is much easier on his joints, so he is less prone to injury.  Cross-country skiing can change your mind from hating winter to looking forward to seeing the snow coming down steadily, asserts Flynn. ""I know a lot of people struggle with how long the winters can seem or how cold and frigid they are,"" Flynn said.  ""It's different when you have something you enjoy ... it makes the winters go by so much faster, it actually feels short because it's just so much fun to get out there!""  Looking for more information? There's a Facebook group called P.E.I. XC SKI where cross-country skiers on P.E.I. share information on trail conditions, plan socials, advertise skiing lessons and more. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cross-country-skiing-benefits-1.5424928,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outdoor-rinks-1.5424651 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-7-tips-for-winter-blues-1.4973390 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/outdoor-exercise-mental-physical-benefits-1.4958302 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-winter-fun-1.5009455 https://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/how-to-build-your-own-backyard-skating-rink-1.5421107 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-kensington-snowmobile-1.5422883,N/A
633,Andrew Kurjata,2018-01-09T14:00:00.845Z,B.C. spruce beetle outbreak now largest in recorded history,"The outbreak of spruce beetle infestation in north-central B.C. rose to record-breaking levels in 2017, and the latest government data shows no sign of it slowing down. Aerial surveys revealed 340,000 hectares of forest are now impacted by the beetle — more than 45 times the pre-outbreak levels of 7,653 hectares recorded in 2013. ""This is a significant concern,"" said Jeanne Robert, the regional forest entomologist for the Omineca and Northeast regions with B.C.'s Ministry of Forests, calling the outbreak ""larger and more severe than we have seen in the past."" Robert explained that spruce beetle outbreaks are normal, but changing weather patterns and warming winters are likely contributing to the severity of the current situation. Spruce beetles are native to B.C., but normally only feed on fallen or weakened trees. Only during serious and prolonged infestations, do they become capable of killing healthy trees. The current outbreak was declared in 2015, after higher-than-normal spruce beetle numbers were recorded in 2014. Since then, the area affected by beetles has been growing exponentially. The current outbreak is centred near Mackenzie, approximately 200 kilometres north of Prince George. The infestation has spread north toward the Yukon border, west into the Smithers region, and east into the Robson Valley near the B.C.-Alberta border, as well as worsening in the Prince George-Mackenzie region. Robert said because spruce tend to grow in more ecologically diverse areas, the impact of the infestation likely wouldn't be as severe as the mountain pine beetle outbreak that destroyed over 18 million hectares of B.C. forests and continues to spread into Alberta.  However, she said the spruce beetle did have the ability to affect the province's mid-term timber supply, which is the amount of wood available for forest companies to harvest in the near future. Robert said the immediate priority is to work with local governments and forestry companies to try and mitigate the effects of the outbreak by prioritizing the harvest of trees being affected by the beetle. However, while she said the spread of the beetle is likely to continue, ""it's hard to say for sure what the overall impact will be.""

634,"Kristin Annable, Katie Nicholson",2019-04-17T10:00:00.245Z,"Stuck with $37K bill he can't read, Winnipeg man says door-to-door furnace sales should be banned","Door-to-door salespeople from a Winnipeg company allegedly persuaded a Winnipeg man to sign multiple costly contracts for home energy products, creating a mountain of debt for him and raising questions about whether such sales should be banned. ""They took full advantage of him,"" said Loretta Wolowich, whose stepbrother Claude Caya signed the contracts with Prairie Home Comfort after they came knocking on his door twice over a two-year period. ""He's illiterate — he can't read or write, so he couldn't really read. The odd word he can pick out, but that's about it.""  Caya says he had no idea that what he was signing up for would leave him in debt, and with a lien on his home worth over $30,000 and a monthly obligation of over $300 for products he is leasing. ""By the time I pay my bills and then my credit cards, before you know it I have, like, $50 to live on for groceries,"" said Caya. The 60-year-old says a salesperson from Prairie Home Comfort — a door-to-door Winnipeg company that sells water heaters, furnaces and air conditioners — came to his door in 2017 and again in 2018. He describes them as smooth talkers, who first convinced him he had lead in his water and later that his 10-year-old furnace needed to be replaced. He says it was a simple pitch — $50 dollars a month for the products he needed. He signed 10-year leases for a new furnace, HEPA filter, electronic air cleaner, and water filter.  Now he is struggling to keep up with monthly charges. Caya is among a growing number of consumers who feel they have been duped by door-to-door sales in the home energy-services sector. Manitoba's Consumer Protection Office recorded more than 60 complaints concerning home energy door-to-door sellers in 2018-19 — almost double what it received the previous year. Manitoba Hydro says it has received more than 200 complaints about Prairie Home Comfort in the past three years — more than any other door-to-door sales company. Caya's job at an auto parts refurbishment plant doesn't pay enough to cover his bills. His wife, who is legally blind, is unable to work. He began racking up credit card debt to pay all his bills until he eventually confessed to his family that he didn't have enough money to cover them all. ""Sometimes I have to use my credit card to buy groceries and my sisters are helping me out,"" he said when asked how he is able to put food on the table. Caya choked up as he described the humiliation of turning to his adult sisters for help and the gratitude he felt toward them. ""I don't know what I'd do without them,"" he said. Prairie Home Comfort is a division of Utilebill Credit Corp., a Toronto-based corporation that specializes in financing HVAC-rental programs.  ""We don't comment on our dealings with customers,"" company owner John Nassar said in an email to CBC News. ""We also don't subscribe to the court of public opinion. We are running a business. Customers have ample resources, many free, that involve services offered by government bodies. Those [who] choose not to use those services typically, from our experience, are on the wrong side of truth."" Caya's story didn't surprise former Red River College instructor Mark Boissoneault — a licensed Red Seal HVAC technician gas fitter and a Red Seal journeyman electrician with more than 30 years in the industry.  He frequently hears about companies that specialize in selling long-term leases for home energy products. But what shocked him in Caya's case was the price. He estimates the entire suite of products should cost less than $10,000, including equipment and installation.  An invoice from the company sent to Caya last year shows the full amount he owes for all four products is just over $37,000.  Boissoneault shook his head in disbelief when he saw Caya leased both a HEPA filter and an electronic air cleaner. A customer generally doesn't need one if they have the other, he said.  ""To see that [invoice] here, plus the two items that would do the same thing being sold for a ridiculous amount of money is just — I'm blown away,"" he said. ""It's shameful, really. I don't know how somebody could sleep at night and do stuff like that."" Once Loretta Wolowich learned about her stepbrother's financial situation, she took him to Creditaid, a Winnipeg-based credit counselling agency. ""My heart breaks,"" said Creditaid CEO and president Brian Denysuik, who took on Caya's case. He said reading through his paperwork was painful.  ""There's no way they could have understood what they were signing."" Denysuik was able to consolidate Caya's credit card payments and lower their interest rates, but says he can't do anything about the Utilebill charges. ""They won't work with us,"" Denysuik said. According to property records, Utilebill has a lien on Caya's home, meaning that when he sells his home, the products he leased from Prairie Home Comfort will either have to be paid off or the contracts transferred to the new buyer. ""If they've got a lien on the property, they've got a secured loan. They can't lose,"" said Denysuik. Over the past few weeks, he has been trying to get in touch with Utilebill to go over payment options and gather all of Caya's paperwork.  Caya is unclear about the terms of his lease and Denysuik says he is unable to get all the details from the company.  CBC News set up hidden cameras in a Winnipeg home to capture the pitch made by a salesperson from Prairie Home Comfort. A retired couple recruited by CBC called the company for a consultation on whether they needed a new furnace.  In the first of two visits to their home, the salesperson threw out a series of numbers for what it would cost for a new furnace — starting with the pitch that it would save them $30 to $40 a month on their hydro bill and cost them only $52 a month. However, the pitch quickly fell apart when the couple started asking questions about the pricing. The salesperson said the $6,000 furnace could be paid off in five years with a monthly payment of $50. When the couple pointed out that that only came to $3,000 the salesperson backtracked and said that it was ""just an example."" Boissoneault observed the pitch on a screen from an adjacent room. ""It's basically a low monthly payment. They don't talk about a term or amortization — it's strictly a commitment,"" he said. ""So you know, you end up never owning this stuff at that point."" The salesperson returned a second time and showed the couple an example of the agreement they would have to sign if they wanted to lease a new furnace.  After reading the fine print and repeated questioning, the couple learned that for the five-year lease to work, they would have to pay a lump sum of $5,000 at the end of the term. Caya said the first time Prairie Home Comfort came to his door, in May 2017, was under the auspice of testing his water. The salesperson poured a glass of water and put a tablet in the glass. The water immediately turned black. The salesperson told Caya that must mean there was lead in the water and he should get a water softener. ""They were smooth talkers,"" he said. ""He was saying that they were sent by water utilities because we were getting brown water."" They returned a second time in the fall and sold him on a new furnace, HEPA filter and air cleaner.  Caya's stepsister brought Caya's story to CBC News after learning he barely had enough money to pay for food after paying all his bills. ""You know he's low-income. And his wife — well, she can't see that good. And she doesn't work. And they took full advantage of him."" CBC spoke with another family who also felt duped by a high-pressure sales call at their door. Erika Parke says a salesperson for Prairie Home Comfort came to her home in 2017 and convinced her to sign a contract for an air conditioner. She was under the impression the monthly bill would be covered by a Manitoba Hydro rebate. It wasn't, so she asked them to remove the unit. The company never did, she says. ""They gave me the runaround. I would phone the number they gave me to phone and it was an answering machine,"" Parke said.  She has never paid the bill, and says she gets a monthly bill that keeps growing. As of February, she owed Utilebill more than $2,300.  Property records show Utilebill has a lien on her home. Wolowich and Caya both say they want to make sure this doesn't happen to more unsuspecting customers. ""They should not come knocking on your door and trying to sell things,"" Caya said. ""I don't think it's right."" Following years of complaints about misleading tactics, Alberta banned the door-to-door sale of home energy products such as furnaces or air conditioners in 2016.  Ontario followed suit in 2018, and Saskatchewan recently undertook public consultations as it moves to revise its Direct Sellers Act.  An interview with Manitoba Justice Minister Cliff Cullen was declined. In a prepared statement, Cullen told CBC that the direct seller marketplace ""is monitored on an ongoing basis."" He didn't specify whether Manitoba would ban door-to-door home energy sales, but stated the government would be ""expanding"" protections against direct sellers. Denysuik and Boissoneault agree the door-to-door sales of these products should be banned.  ""People are vulnerable,"" said Denysuik. ""We're seeing more and more of this. How do we stop it? How do we control? I don't know. I don't really have an answer."" Currently, the law allows Manitobans to cancel a contract within 10 days of signing it, or within one year of signing if the seller fails to comply with the agreed terms or was unlicensed. The province's Consumer Protection Office confirmed Prairie Home Comfort is licensed to sell door-to-door in Manitoba, as required under the Consumer Protection Act. A full list of who is licensed is not made public and a request by CBC to access the list was denied.  ""There should be more … requirements to the licensing because it's just not working. This isn't the first customer that's been misled and taken advantage of,"" said Boissoneault. ""It paints a dark picture on the industry.""

635,Anonymous,2020-01-26T14:10:15.149Z,Welcome to The Debbie Show: Receptionist putting on exhibit at Confederation Centre,"Debbie Muttart has been a friendly presence behind the reception desk at the Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown for almost 25 years, but now she's stepping into the spotlight. Muttart, who has seen about 400 exhibits come through the gallery over the years, was ""flabbergasted"" and ""flattered"" when she was asked to pick her favourite pieces for a new gallery exhibit called The Debbie Show: View from the Desk. ""I know every one of them by heart,"" Muttart told CBC Radio: Mainstreet P.E.I. host Matt Rainnie of the artworks in the exhibit. ""It's going to be a good one, I think!""   She's known for encouraging anyone walking by or peeking in the door to come in and have a look around — stressing art galleries are for everyone, from young children to elderly patrons.  She loves to chat with them about what pieces are their favourites and why, and educate them on the history of the pieces, which she researches enthusiastically. ""There's tons of people from all over the world come here and ask me questions — like I'm a fountain!"" Muttart said.  She has learned not only about history and styles of art, but has had the privilege of getting to know many artists from around the world in person and through their work. And The Debbie Show is eclectic. It includes an entire wall of portraits of dogs — 47 to be exact — by Canadian photographer Shari Hatt, one of the first shows ""that really stuck with me,"" said Muttart. She's a big fan of dogs, she said, and always has a hound she's adopted from the local pound. Another of her favourites is a painting of the Yankee Gale of 1851, a famous storm in the Gulf of St. Lawrence along P.E.I.'s North Shore that wrecked dozens of ships, many of them fishing schooners from New England working in the area. At least 160 crew members died, and many of them are buried in the cemetery by the Cape Tryon lighthouse in French River. ""All the Americans lost their lives, and all the Prince Edward Islanders went out to try to save them, and they lost all their lives — it just meant a lot, cause I'm from up that way,"" Muttart said.  She also picked some Group of Seven paintings — ""I just like the colour, when they're up in the range where the mountains are."" Muttart dedicates her show to the memory of her father, Ronnie MacLean Sr., who taught her to love nature. ""I learned to fish, hunt — and we loved animals,"" she said. ""My father meant so much to me, very much. He's been passed now quite a few years. And I just loved him.""  For the display, Muttart worked with co-curators Jill McRae and Andrew Cairns to choose some of her favourites from the gallery's own collection. McRae says the idea for The Debbie Show came up during a weekly meeting when staff talked about how they enjoy working in the gallery because they get to overhear Muttart's enthusiastic interactions with gallery patrons. They pitched the idea to Debbie, who loved it. Then began the process of choosing from thousands of works in the centre's collection. ""I very much agree with Debbie's taste, so the pieces that she's chosen I love,"" said McRae.  ""We have a good collection of sort of older pieces, as well as some new stuff that we haven't shown before,"" she said, noting Muttart went down into the centre's art vault, something she doesn't normally get to do.  Co-curator Cairns helped bring Muttart's choices together in cohesive groupings.  ""She's got a real eye for colour,"" Cairns said. ""A lot of the pieces, they're different but they still have a 'Debbie' touch — as she was saying, she really loves nature and animals.""  Muttart emphasized to the curators that she wanted the show to be welcoming. ""I feel the pieces really reflect that — make you feel good in the gallery!"" Cairns said.  Many of Muttart's choices are female artists including Lindee Climo and Aganetha Dyck. ""I like strong women in art,"" Muttart said.  There's a sculpture by Island artist Sarah Saunders, ""such a delicate person, yet she's a strong artist and I like that,"" Muttart said.  ""My life is a very, very good life,"" she said, adding working at the centre is her dream job. ""I've learned so much!"" She said she plans to work at the gallery ""until they take me out feet first, probably.""  The Debbie Show can be viewed at the gallery in the Confederation Centre of the Arts until April 12. Admission is free. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-confederation-centre-art-gallery-debbie-show-1.5436144,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/made-from-this-land-quillwork-1.5384150 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/poundmaker-cree-nation-hoping-to-repatriate-art-and-artifacts-after-painting-sells-for-200k-1.5372337 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/historic-shipwreck-washes-up-on-p-e-i-1.661773 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nancy-cole-un-fashion-art-1.5354655 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-festival-numbers-anne-kronborg-mamma-mia-1.5314890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-she-is-art-exhibit-1.5302511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-intersection-safety-1.5436264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-stratford-inclusivity-unesco-1.5434823,N/A
636,Michael Gorman,2020-01-25T14:27:54.180Z,Feds end talks that could have seen N.S. buy land for golf course development,"The federal government is no longer negotiating with Nova Scotia's Lands and Forestry Department for the sale of surplus Crown land that could have become part of a proposed golf course development. Lighthouse Links Development Company wants to build as many as three golf courses in Little Harbour on the province's Eastern Shore. As part of that proposal, the company is trying to buy Crown land from the Nova Scotia government. The province was also negotiating, on the company's behalf, to buy 17 hectares of land Ottawa deemed surplus. Had the province planned to use the land for a public purpose, it could have had the property for one dollar. Because the golf course development doesn't fit the category, the two levels of government were considering a sale for $167,500. But a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada recently says those negotiations are off. ""Public Services and Procurement Canada is in discussions with [Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service] on the transfer of the land,"" Helena Sergakis said in an email. ""If finalized, the property on Nova Scotia's eastern shore would remain in the federal inventory. The Province of Nova Scotia has been notified."" Chris Miller, executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said he is delighted, but not surprised, by the news. ""The Trudeau government has been a leader on land conservation in Canada and it would have been shocking to me if they had sold off an ecological hotspot for a golf course."" Negotiations will continue between the province and company, however, for 285 hectares of provincial Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. Last March, the government removed the land from the pending legal protection list in the Parks and Protected Areas Plan. The move allowed Lands and Forestry to enter into negotiations with Lighthouse Links, which hopes to acquire the land to merge it with property the company already owns in Little Harbour. Miller and others have expressed concern about the land being delisted without consultation. Even after the move was complete, Owls Head remained listed on the government's website as pending protection for about 10 months. But a spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said Friday that public feedback on the matter would be considered before any deal is complete. As part of the letter of offer between the province and company, Lighthouse Links is required to develop a public engagement plan. It must be reviewed by the department. In an email, the company's lawyer said they are early in the planning stages for public engagement. ""My client will be looking for opportunities to engage with key stakeholders and the community as this proposed project proceeds, particularly as it relates to protection of the environment,"" said Sean Glover. ""Lighthouse Links remains committed to working with the community and government to preserve the legacy and beauty of the Little Harbour community."" Before a sale could be finalized it would need to be approved by the provincial cabinet. A spokesperson for the province said feedback from the public would be considered as part of those discussions. But Miller said he takes no comfort in the process because the government did no consultation before delisting the property. ""I don't trust that they'll do the right thing,"" he said. He and others worry the development would destroy an ecologically sensitive area that is home to several endangered species and a globally rare ecosystem. Miller said the outcry over the potential development also shows that people aren't OK with Crown land along the coast being sold when so little of Nova Scotia's coastline remains public. Earlier this week, Miller's organization set up a website that allows people to send a letter to Premier Stephen McNeil calling on him to protect Owls Head and keep it in public hands. ""Already 1,000 letters have gone in,"" said Miller. ""That's a very large response in a very short period of time.""

Museum and Heritage Foundation.  The pair discovered the rock — with amphibian footprints — while strolling along the beach in the Cumberland area in July. The fossil was found on a loose rock on the ground.  ""I just looked down and saw this stone and it had prints on it,"" said Pat Sweet.  ""It was quite amazing actually, to think that you had something in your hands that could be this old. It was quite amazing really, we just couldn't believe it,"" said Bob Sweet. From there, the pair took the fossil home and called the province's archeologist.  Officials said a paleontologist examined the rock once it was turned in by the couple. The footprints resemble two known amphibians. However, the footprints are different enough that officials wonder if they could point to a whole new species previously unknown in the world of paleontology.  The footprints are thought to be from an amphibian about 25 centimetres in length, that walked on P.E.I. millions of years ago. The fossil is thought to predate dinosaurs, said Matthew McRae, curator of history with the P.E.I. Museum and Heritage Foundation.  He said the rare fossil will make a wonderful addition to the museum. ""It's super exciting to have this in our collection, this representative, and I think this just tells you how special Prince Edward Island is,"" McRae said.  ""It's one of the few sites in Canada that has land fossils from this period.""  It's important that if people do come across something they suspect could be a fossil to contact officials with the province, said McRae. Once the province is contacted, the item can be assessed by experts. The area the specimen is found in may provide important details about the find. McRae said there are currently no plans to display the fossil, but it could become part of a natural history exhibit, if a suitable location becomes available. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-fossil-museum-heritage-foundation-1.5416597,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/carbonodraco-fossil-1.5394231 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-fossil-footprints-discovered-cavendish-park-1.5027811 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-north-lake-bridge-construction-1.5416227 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594,N/A
638,Andie Bulman,2020-01-23T14:57:11.141Z,Bartering in the blizzard: How a neighbourhood managed before the stores reopened,"We'll always remember this storm.  Stories of how we tunneled through snowdrifts to free our neighbours, and collectively heralded Baby Snow as our once and future king, will be swapped for years. For me, the most significant lesson learned is that bartering and sharing are alive and well.  Like most of us, I barely left my house on Friday. I made one trek outdoors (I live in the Georgestown neighbourhood, not far from the downtown core), but mostly draped myself in blankets, played Scrabble, and prayed to the Netflix gods that we wouldn't lose power. Saturday came and our power flickered back on. I thanked the Netflix gods and the Light and Power B'ys. Then I turned on the radio. The state of emergency was already a day in effect. Roads were carless, stores were closed. The mayor warned that this could continue for at least a few days. My supplies had held up pretty good, but I made a few critical errors — most notably, I was already low on butter. I reached out to the world via Facebook. Beehak (a talented pastry chef) responded! She would be happy to trade a cup of butter for two eggs. We met halfway down Barnes Road and made the swap. It felt like something that would have happened in the 1930s. Later that day, I baked several blueberry crisps and bartered one for ground coffee and buttermilk (I wanted to make waffles). I also gave a blueberry crisp to my next-door neighbours. They had lent me snowshoes, so I could venture downtown into the carless snowglobe world. The trade seemed more than fair. I'm a creature who consumes tons of butter and after an afternoon of baking, I was low again. I emptied out my liquor cabinet and swapped vodka for more butter. Later in the day, I traded tonic water and limes for chips and tea bags.  Each time I left my house, I carried a backpack and shovel.  I stopped at neighbours' houses and pitched in along the way. The neighbourhood was alive. People were trading supplies, digging out fire hydrants, and helping each other out. I passed several bonfires, impromptu snowboarding trails and really gorgeous snow forts. I was constantly offered beer in exchange for my labour, which seemed especially generous considering what a hot commodity beer is in the barter system. I've been trying to do a dry January, so I declined each time. In one neighbourhood, a big Victorian house had set up a hot chocolate booth and from all over weary shovels stopped for a break. The snow was brutal, but compassion and sharing matched it tit for tat. Our own car was buried in a seven-foot drift. Friends, my husband and I tackled it for two hours and took a break. When I returned to my car, someone had blown it out completely. I could have kissed them — or at least given them a high five. By late Saturday, Mark Wilson, organic farmer and man about town, set up a Facebook Group called Stone Soup. It was/is a place where people could swap supplies or ask for help if their food ran out during the state of emergency. Some folks offered to trek across the city in skis to deliver toilet paper. Others baked bread and knocked on doors. I hope Mark keeps the site up, because it almost stands as a monument to both human kindness and the lack of food security we have in this province.  By Sunday, I had settled into my state of emergency routine. Shovel something for someone, catch up on missed work and emails, go for a walk and trade my supplies for other supplies, keep an eye on Stone Soup in case someone needed something that I had, and then read or play video games with my dog and husband.  Monday night, we had a neighbourhood cookout, something we haven't done before. Circular Road was like another world, never seen anything like it. Here's what it was like yesterday when ever a plow couldn't make it through the street <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/nHKZdxnYbf"">pic.twitter.com/nHKZdxnYbf</a> Luke and Nina opened up their home and carved out some snow seats in their front lawn. Others baked treats, emptied out their freezers, and dragged over their barbecues. We had a celeriac, apple and moose sausage dish; carrot ginger soup; leek and potato soup; Jim Lahey's famous no-knead bread, ribs, moose chili, nachos and more blueberry crumble. Everyone brought their babies. The good cheer was palatable. I broke my resolution of having a dry January and had a glass of prosecco. After all of the bartering and kindness, sharing a drink with my neighbours had never seemed so important.

639,Richard Woodbury,2020-01-25T10:00:00.470Z,Meet the Smithsonian astronomer who has a donair website,"Like many Nova Scotia expats, Glen Petitpas found himself craving a donair. Luckily for him, his sister had a recipe from a Halifax donair shop, so he took matters into his own hands and started making the much-loved local dish of spiced meat on a pita, sweet white sauce, tomatoes and onions. It was the mid-1990s and the Timberlea, N.S., native was working on his master's degree in astronomy at McMaster University in Hamilton. Fed up with misplacing his copy of the recipe, he started a website and posted the recipe, which meant his other expat friends could easily access it. ""It's funny, I didn't really like donairs when I lived in Halifax,"" said Petitpas, 47. ""I thought they were a little bit too strong. But for some reason, the nostalgia started when going to visit home after I first moved away and tried one. They grew on me and then it was a lot of nostalgia and true love for the flavour after awhile."" Nearly 25 years on, through different iterations, the website continues to live on. Petitpas, who has a PhD in astronomy, now lives in the Boston area and works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which operates a telescope in Hawaii. He even includes a link to his donair site on his Harvard web page. In the early days of launching the website, which Petitpas pegs as being around 1996 or 1997, he said he'd get emails from people about once a month thanking him for posting a recipe. Thanks to an increase in donair recipes online, he only gets emails about twice a year now. He said the email from the most distant Nova Scotia expat came from Singapore. Besides a recipe for donair meat, the site has two sauce recipes, as well as advice on how to handle donair offshoots like donair pizza, donair subs and garlic fingers. Petitpas doesn't make donairs often these days because he visits home regularly. ""Every time I go home, I kind of binge on them and then really don't feel like eating them again for a few months after three or four days straight of having donairs for lunch or dinner,"" he said. He thinks one of the reasons he didn't like donairs when he was younger was because many people put onions on them, which grossed him out. The combination of a sweet sauce with a spicy meat was also ""very jarring"" initially. These days, he's a meat, sauce and tomatoes kind of guy. Donairs were declared Halifax's official food in 2015. Petitpas, who is married and has a six-year-old son, said the donair love doesn't appear to have been passed on to the second generation. ""He liked them, but he's not really excited,"" he said. ""When I mentioned making them another time, he was like, 'Maybe, sure, whatever.' He was less enthusiastic.""

640,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-18T23:09:29.618Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan will give up royal titles, public funding","Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer be working members of the Royal Family and will, therefore, no longer use their royal titles or taxpayer money, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace released Saturday. ""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty and hastily called family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal Family and spending more time in North America. In a surprising Instagram message posted at the beginning of 2020, the pair called the move ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement. It will remain the couple's U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy, was the subject of scrutiny last year. Media reports revealed renovations to the building — which cost an estimated £2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)  — were coming from the Sovereign Grant, the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A | Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, Markle didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporter Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there are ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

641,Aaron Wherry,2020-01-24T20:55:01.874Z,Room at the top: Is Harper's legacy a Conservative leadership vacuum?,"Stephen Harper left behind a relatively sturdy foundation for his successor to build on. Even in defeat, Harper's Conservative party won 99 seats and 32 per cent of the popular vote in 2015. The Conservatives raised $29 million that year, $7 million more than the Liberals. What he didn't leave behind was an heir (or heirs) apparent. To the degree that it's still possible for a leader to plan for these things, the Conservative Party might be better off now had it put more thought into a line of succession. The most successful run in the history of Canadian federal politics is the Liberal Party dynasty that ran from Mackenzie King's first victory in 1921 to John Turner's defeat in 1984 — an era that was held together by successful successions. Liberal prime ministers were in power for nearly 51 of those 63 years. King himself was in power for 21 years — a feat that probably will never be matched. But while King was still in office he decided to hand power to his preferred successor, Louis St. Laurent. King had made St. Laurent his foreign minister — a role that, until then, generally had been held by the prime minister of the day — and with King's backing, St. Laurent easily won the Liberal leadership in 1948. St. Laurent held office for nearly nine years, until the Liberals were defeated by John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives in 1957. St. Laurent initially was reluctant to resign as the party's leader but, according to one account, agreed to do so when he was assured that Lester B. Pearson — recruited by King and promoted by St. Laurent — would pursue the leadership. Despite a crushing election defeat in 1958, Pearson held on to the Liberal leadership and then became prime minister in 1963. Five years later, while still in office, he decided to step aside for a new leader. Pierre Trudeau, recruited and appointed justice minister by Pearson, emerged as the frontrunner. Except for the brief interregnum of Joe Clark's government, Trudeau governed for the next 16 years. John Turner — who entered federal politics under Pearson but split with Trudeau — was unlucky enough to go next. The Liberals' run of successful successions effectively ended with his 79 days as prime minister in 1984 and the landslide victory of Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives. Jean Chrétien, who had come into Parliament under Pearson and served in cabinet under Trudeau, returned the Liberals to power in 1993. The long and destructive intra-party war between Chrétien and Paul Martin that followed offered a lesson in the unintended consequences of a party succession that isn't handled well — consequences that included the ill-fated turns of Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, two people who were ill-suited to the tasks they were given. It's possible that politics has changed too much to allow for the kind of transfers of power that sustained the Liberals for half a century. Open leadership votes have put such contests beyond the easy control of party power brokers. And there's less tolerance within parties now for leaders who lose elections, as Pearson did in 1958 and 1962. For that matter, simple hand-offs of power might deprive both parties and the country of important debates about policies and values. But the post-Harper era also doesn't seem to offer a new model for political succession. The first Conservative leadership race after Harper was noteworthy for all the candidates who didn't run. The top two contenders in 2017 ended up being someone who had never served in Harper's cabinet (Andrew Scheer) and someone who was most famous for being fired from Harper's cabinet (Maxime Bernier). The second post-Harper race will feature at least one prominent name: Peter MacKay. But MacKay may end up spending more time answering for the trouble he found as a Harper minister (the F-35 procurement, the failed attempt to put Marc Nadon on the Supreme Court, his public suggestion that the chief justice had inappropriately raised concerns about that appointment, that helicopter ride) than he does boasting of any accomplishments. With a few notable exceptions, Harper did not surround himself with a team of strong ministers known for advancing policy or handling difficult situations. (For all the attention and praise that was directed at Rona Ambrose before she ruled herself out of the race, most of her aura of credibility was due to what she did as interim party leader after 2015.) And none of those notable exceptions were able or willing to run for the leadership when Harper finally departed. Jim Prentice — the closest Harper ever had to a deputy prime minister — left federal politics in 2010 to embark on an ill-fated run at provincial politics in Alberta; he died in a plane crash in 2016. Jim Flaherty, the veteran finance minister, resigned in March 2014 and passed away months later. James Moore, a former industry and heritage minister, resigned for family reasons in 2015. Jason Kenney, perhaps the most highly praised member of Harper's cabinet, chose to pursue power in Alberta. Much has been made about the decline of ""cabinet government"" in Canada in favour of a system where only the prime minister and his office really matter. While that decline can be seen as bad for democracy, it also might make it harder to establish a healthy line of succession. At the moment, it doesn't appear that Harper will be able to take much credit for setting up any of his potential successors. In an alternate universe, Harper might have found a way to hand the party off to someone like Prentice in 2013. And even if the Liberals still won the 2015 election in that alternate universe, the party might have been willing to let Prentice stay on for at least one more election. It's too early to plan Justin Trudeau's retirement party, but he might start thinking about giving his party some options to choose from when it's time to find a new leader. When Trudeau came to office in 2015, he proclaimed the return of cabinet government. His success in that regard is debatable — particularly since Jane Philpott, one of the most competent ministers of the first four years of Trudeau's government, is out of politics and no longer a Liberal. The elevation of Chrystia Freeland to deputy prime minister might present one possible option for succession. But she needn't be the only possible heir. In 1968, when Pearson decided to step aside, Pierre Trudeau was one of eight cabinet ministers to enter the leadership race. When Harper left, the party he led was still standing — something that makes his record look better than that of, say, Brian Mulroney. But the party might be better off now if he'd left it with more potential successors.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5437504,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-quebec-1.5434633 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,N/A
642,Anonymous,2020-01-23T23:15:03.067Z,Quebec tightens rules on adventure tourism as search for snowmobilers continues,"Quebec announced stricter rules and mandatory training for tourism operators Thursday, as crews continue to search for five missing French nationals who fell through ice while snowmobiling with a guide on Lac Saint-Jean. Guides who lead excursions in off-road vehicles, including snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, will have to complete a mandatory training course before taking tourists out on an excursion. The tourists themselves will also need to complete a training course before being allowed to handle the vehicle. Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said the announcement had been planned for several weeks, but she had never imagined it ""would happen in such a tragic context."" The guide, 42-year-old Benoît Lespérance from Montreal, was pulled out of the water by Alma firefighters. He died Wednesday morning. The French nationals were still missing Thursday evening, but police told reporters they would continue their search. The search continued on Friday. On Twitter, provincial police identified the missing French nationals as Yan Thierry, 24; Jean-René Dumoulin, 24; Arnaud Antoine, 25; Julien Benoît, 34; and Gilles Claude, 58.    ""Snowmobile excursions, canoe trips and ocean kayaking are all ways of appreciating Quebec's natural beauty,"" she said. ""But they must be rigorously regulated to ensure the safety of everyone participating, be they from Quebec or abroad."" Nature and adventure tourism operators will also need an accreditation from Aventure Écotourisme Québec if they wish to apply for funding from the Quebec government. Proulx said 135 businesses already have the accreditation, but hundreds of businesses do not. While she said it is impossible to promise that there will ever be ""no risk,"" Proulx said she hopes that accidents such as the one on Lac Saint-Jean ""don't happen again."" Meanwhile, authorities continue to search for the five French tourists who went missing after their snowmobiles fell through the ice of Lac Saint-Jean Tuesday night. Quebec provincial police deployed an additional diving team to the area Thursday, after two of the snowmobiles were found underwater Wednesday evening, at the mouth of La Grande Décharge — an outlet for Lac Saint-Jean. Police found four more snowmobiles underwater in the same area Thursday. Rescuers with specialized training to work on ice, snowmobile units and a drone joined the 30 police officers deployed to the scene. Sûreté du Québec and Canadian Armed Forces helicopters also circled the area. The tourists were part of a group of eight French nationals who, accompanied by their guide, attempted to cross a snow-covered channel between the towns of Saint-Henri-de-Taillon and Alma when the ice gave way beneath them. Three of the tourists were discharged from hospital on Wednesday. The other five are still missing.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lac-st-jean-snowmobile-french-tourists-search-1.5437306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snowmobile-ice-fall-1.5435756,N/A
643,Anonymous,2019-10-29T20:10:42.076Z,U.S. federal judge blocks Alabama's strict abortion ban,"A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday blocked Alabama's near-total abortion ban from taking effect next month and called the law — part of a wave of new abortion restrictions by conservative states — clearly unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking Alabama from enforcing the law that would make performing an abortion a felony in almost all cases. The ruling came after abortion providers sued to block the law from taking effect on Nov. 15. The injunction was widely expected and will remain in place until Thompson decides the full case. ""Alabama's abortion ban contravenes clear Supreme Court precedent,"" Thompson wrote in an accompanying opinion. ""It violates the right of an individual to privacy, to make choices central to personal dignity and autonomy. It diminishes the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions. It defies the United States Constitution."" Energized by new conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama and other conservative states have attempted to enact new restrictions on abortion in the hopes of getting Supreme Court justices to reconsider Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. A number of states attempted to ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. The Alabama law went further by attempting to ban almost all abortions with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Passed by the Republican-led legislature, the 2019 Alabama Human Life Protection Act would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony punishable by up to 99 years or life in prison for the abortion provider. The only exceptions would be when there is a serious health risk to the mother or the fetus has a lethal anomaly that would cause it to die shortly after birth. None of the state bans has taken effect. Some have already been blocked, and elsewhere courts are considering requests to put them on hold while legal challenges play out. ""This is not only a victory for the people of Alabama — it's a victory for the entire nation. We said it from the start: This ban is blatantly unconstitutional, and we will fight it every step of the way,"" said Staci Fox, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast. Planned Parenthood was one of the groups that sued to block the law. Randall Marshall, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said the decision was expected. ""Abortion remains legal in Alabama. The state's repeated attempts to push abortion out of reach by enacting unconstitutional laws restricting abortions has already cost taxpayers nearly two and a half million dollars,"" Marshall said. ""This ill-advised law will cost taxpayers more money."" Supporters of the Alabama law have also said they anticipated the action but hope to eventually convince the U.S. Supreme Court to roll back abortion rights. Alabama Republican Rep. Terri Collins, who sponsored the ban, said the ruling ""is merely the first of many steps on that legal journey."" ""As we have stated before, the state's objective is to advance our case to the U.S. Supreme Court where we intend to submit evidence that supports our argument that Roe and Casey were wrongly decided and that the Constitution does not prohibit states from protecting unborn children from abortion,"" Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in statement. In a measured statement, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said the ban reflects Alabamians beliefs, but that she also supports the ""rule of law."" ""This legislation passed with overwhelming support in the Alabama Legislature and was signed into law as a testament to Alabamians' longstanding belief that every human life is sacred. We must continue doing all we can to protect life,"" Ivey said. While Alabama is sounding victory, Dayton's last abortion clinic is trying to avoid closure by pursuing a new state license and intervention by a federal court after the Ohio Supreme Court again refused to hear its appeal. That court decision Tuesday meant Women's Med Centre faced losing its license for not meeting certain state requirements regarding backup doctors and hospital transfers. It immediately asked a federal court to temporarily block the state from enforcing those requirements. The clinic argues they're unconstitutional, medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion access. Attorney Jennifer Branch says the centre has postponed surgical abortions but remains open for medication abortions. She also says it already lined up an additional backup doctor and applied for a new state license. The Ohio Department of Health said it won't comment on the pending litigation.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/judge-blocks-alabama-s-abortion-ban-1.5339887,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/alabama-abortion-bill-1.5135182 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/heartbeat-abortion-bill-signed-1.5137877,N/A
644,Samantha Craggs,2016-09-15T16:24:20.460Z,Kids voted on how to spend $1M on Hamilton street projects,"The city will spend $1 million on projects in lower Hamilton based in part on the votes of kids.  The city is earmarking 17 projects for safer streets, including pedestrian crossings, new traffic signals and repaired bike lanes.  The projects were chosen through an initiative called PlanLocal Ward 2, which saw Coun. Jason Farr put ballot boxes at local schools. He also encouraged kids to vote online.  Their votes held equal weight to the votes of adults, Farr said, because kids can identify safety problems with local streets as much as anyone.  ""They have very grown up ideas, and they know their streets just as well as their moms and dads,"" he said.  ""They're the ultimate pedestrians.""  In one case, Farr said, a child mentioned that a bush needed to be trimmed so he could see oncoming cars when he tried to cross the street.  ""I shot off an email, and we had that bush trimmed in a day,"" he said.  The $1 million is Ward 2 area-rating money. In previous years, Farr used a participatory budgeting process to determine how it would be spent.  The PlanLocal effort included voting stations at Bennetto and Dr. Davey schools. The team also sent information home with thousands of students.  More than 1,300 kids and adults voted. City council still has to approve the projects.  Farr said he doesn't foresee any problems with that.  Even Coun. Terry Whitehead of Ward 8, who has sparred with Farr over recent bicycle lanes and traffic-calming changes on Herkimer and Charlton streets, said he thought it was ""a good list."" Whitehead said waste collection and emergency services staff, among others, have had issues with the Herkimer and Charlton changes. Farr sent an email to city staff (published at the pro-transit and complete streets site Raise the Hammer) in response. Whitehead said his main issue is when changes are made that impact vehicle traffic on arterial roads. Barton and James: Restrict right turns on the red and possibly redesign the intersection for better sight lines. Charlton and James: Install ladder crossings and better signs, and evaluate adding another crossing. Cannon and Mary: Install a ladder crossing and better signs. Stinson: Resurface the street from Wellington to Wentworth to repair the bike lanes. ​Burlington and James: Install a three-phase signal. This will also happen at Ferguson and Main and Forest and John.

645,Jamie Strashin,2018-06-28T15:56:11.232Z,Making it easier for kids to play multiple sports is hard — but it can be done,"The world of youth sports is full of seemingly obvious choices backed up by years of study and research. But doing the right thing is not always so straightforward. Take the idea of being a multi-sport athlete. Countless studies and development models tell us that it is better for young athletes to play multiple sports rather than focusing on just one year-round. A recently released public service campaign titled Change it Up reinforces this important concept. It shows four elite Canadian athletes participating in sports other than the one they are best known for. The campaign is supported by the Canadian Olympic Committee, Hockey Canada, Baseball Canada and Canada Soccer. CBC Sports published a story earlier this month about the campaign and the response has been overwhelming.   In a nutshell, many parents say the idea of their child being a multi-sport athlete is a great one but, in reality, is hard to achieve. A number of factors were identified, including time, money and pressure from coaches and fellow parents. Most of the parents who responded have children that play competitive hockey, where the season typically runs from September until March, followed by tryouts for next season and spring and summer hockey. ""So whether we want to be removed from hockey longer or not, the sport is not set up to allow for that,"" wrote Darko Veselinovic, who considers his family a ""hockey family."" ""We get to enjoy baseball or soccer for the next eight weeks and then right back to hockey. If Hockey Canada really wants to help change the culture, then maybe tryouts and practices of any kind should not be allowed during the months of May through August."" Reuben Moses knows how busy the life can be. His nine-year-old son plays competitive hockey in the winter and competitive baseball in the summer in Toronto. ""It's a balancing act,"" he says. ""It's a huge commitment for myself, for my family. I spend a lot of time with [my son] and it takes away from the time I spend at home. It's a lifestyle commitment. It's not for everyone."" That's the same message Richard Monette is getting. As the head of Active for Life, the non-profit group behind the Change it Up campaign, he says he hears a common refrain: ""I would love my daughter or son to be able to play more than one sport, but his/her coach has scheduled four practices a week and two games."" ""Basically,"" Monette says, ""some parents are telling us that promoting multi-sport for kids is noble but it remains unfeasible where they live. They share that many minor sport organizations make multi-sport participation very difficult because of the way they program sport for kids at the community level."" Moses thinks it would be easier if kids did more playing outside on their own, sampling many different sports. ""Today, the world that we live in, everything is programmed,"" he says. ""You just don't see 10 kids going out to the park and playing a game of soccer. Gone are the days when there were those all-day soccer or basketball games with your friends. So if you want your kids to stay active, it does take time because you have to take them there."" Moses says the demands of playing multiple sports could be eased if his son played at a less competitive level, but that's not an option they're considering at the moment. ""It's something I'm always consulting him about ... but he appears to be very sincere, that he enjoys the competitiveness of high-level sport,"" Moses says. ""And in order to do this, you have to keep up with the Jonses with some of the extra stuff."" Some coaches demand total commitment, which makes doing another sport difficult. But not every coach is like that. As a kid, Nathaniel Brooks played the highest level of minor hockey in Toronto. He now coaches a competitive team of 10-year-old boys and is also the assistant coach for the Ryerson Rams, a collegiate team in the city. He's a proponent of the multi-sport approach. ""I think what a lot of people don't realize is the similarities between a lot of sports,"" Brooks says. ""I was playing triple-A hockey in Toronto as an 11-year-old and I told my coach I was on the basketball team. He was like, that's great, you being on the basketball team is going help you play defence on the ice."" He wants his players to feel like they have the same choices. ""I tell my kids, if you are a baseball player and we are doing hockey stuff in baseball season, I am not going to tell you that you have to come to hockey before baseball. I think that we have enough time and these kids are on the ice so much and they play so much in the winter that I think it's good to take a little bit of time off. ""I think if you have somebody giving a nine- or 10-year-old an ultimatum about a hockey tournament in June, then you need to rethink what program you are with, especially if you are a multi-sport athlete.""  At the same time, Brooks says there is tremendous pressure on coaches, coming mostly from parents, to program every moment. ""The thinking is that we are going to be playing team X during the year and that team is playing in four summer tournaments. We just can't sit there and not do anything. But I think a lot of it is irrelevant and if there's a kid that goes up to summer camp for six weeks and that's what he wants to do, great. Some kids want to skate all summer long. But it should be a choice."" There are also dangers, Brooks points out, in putting all your eggs in one basket. ""What parents need to realize is that kids that are doing [only one sport] are risking burnout more than other kids [who play multiple sports] are risking not reaching their potential."" Monette says real change won't come through top-down ultimatums from national organizations like Hockey Canada. He says it must be driven by parents, volunteers and the local organizations who deliver programs. ""If your eight-year-old daughter plays for a coach that believes it is a good thing to schedule five practices a week, and your minor soccer association allows it, and the league your daughter plays in schedules three games a week, then multi-sport participation is simply not possible for your daughter,"" he says. ""Even if Soccer Canada supports multi-sport."" Creating an environment where multi-sport athletes can actually thrive, he says, will require ""a situation in which the gatekeepers of sport, both at the top and the grassroots level, understand that kids who practice many different sports and activities at a younger age are set up for success later."" In a system organized around this notion, Monette says, ""Sports are not competing against each other to attract eight-year-old kids, but working together to create schedules to allow kids to participate in more than one sport."" In other words, everyone will have to get on board.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/kids-multiple-sports-1.4726140,[],N/A
646,Mesfin Fekadu,2019-11-20T16:19:38.539Z,"New acts rule as Lizzo, Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish lead Grammys nominations","The Grammys are screaming ""Cuz I Love You"" to Lizzo: The breakthrough singer-rapper scored a whopping eight nominations, including bids for the top four awards, making her the show's top-nominated act. Lizzo picked up nominations for album of the year with her major-label debut, Cuz I Love You; song and record of the year with her anthemic No. 1 hit, Truth Hurts; and best new artist. Like Lizzo, other new artists dominated with Grammy nominations on Wednesday: Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X earned six nominations apiece. Eilish also scored nominations in the top four categories, making the 17-year-old the youngest artist in the history of the Grammys to achieve the feat. Lil Nas X, 20, is up for three of the top four awards, including album and record of the year for Old Town Road, featuring Billy Ray Cyrus. Nominees for album of the year are: Nominees for record of the year are: While Taylor Swift was shut out of album of the year for Lover, the album's title track earned a nomination for song of the year, a songwriter's award. Song of the year nominees are: Swift earned three nominations overall, while Beyoncé — who was shut out of the top three categories — scored four. While her groundbreaking Homecoming documentary earned a nomination for best music film, its album version didn't pick up any nominations. Instead, her The Lion King: The Gift project — which features songs inspired by The Lion King, for which she voiced the character Nala — is up for best pop vocal album, competing with projects from Ed Sheeran, Swift, Eilish and Ariana Grande. Beyonce's Spirit, from The Lion King which is being pushed for Oscar consideration, is up for best pop solo performance along with Swift's You Need to Calm Down, Truth Hurts, Bad Guy and 7 Rings. A host of Canadian acts also earned Grammy nods early Wednesday, including pop singer Shawn Mendes, rapper Drake, rising singers Daniel Caesar and Jessie Reyez and Grammy regulars Michael Bublé and Northern Cree. Overall, female acts out-performed their male counterparts in the top four categories: Five of the eight album-of-the-year contenders are women, while seven of the eight song-of-the-year nominees are by women. Female musicians also rule in the best new artist category, though record of the year is evenly split. Grande, who won her first Grammy earlier this year, scored five nominations, as did H.E.R. and Finneas, Eilish's older brother who co-wrote, co-produced and engineered her debut album. Finneas' nominations include producer of the year (non-classical) and best engineered album (non-classical). Several acts picked up four nominations, including J. Cole, Gary Clark Jr., Lucky Daye, Thom Yorke, Bob Ludwig and Tanya Tucker, who in August released her first album of new songs in 17 years. British country-soul performer Yola also scored four bids, including best new artist. Best new artist nominees are: Lizzo's road to the Grammys has been a long one: The 31-year-old, who performed with Prince on his Plectrumelectrum album, grinded as an independent and touring artist for years before signing a major-label deal, releasing her first album in 2013. But this year marked her major breakthrough: Her song Truth Hurts topped the charts for seven weeks; she's wowed audiences with her live performances — including her twerking while playing the flute. She's also graced several magazine covers, earning praise for promoting body positivity and denouncing fat shaming. But Lizzo has also had her fair share of critics: Some felt she shouldn't qualify for best new artist at the Grammys since she's been on the music scene for years. Others thought since Truth Hurts was originally released in 2017, it shouldn't qualify for the 2020 Grammys. The Recording Academy said Truth Hurts qualified because the song was never submitted for contention in the Grammys process and it appears on an album released during the eligibility period for the upcoming show. Truth Hurts was co-written by Tele, Jesse Saint John and Ricky Reed, who is nominated for producer of the year (non-classical). Mina Lioness, the British singer whom Lizzo gave writing credit to after using some of her viral tweet in the hit song, didn't appear on the list of writers nominated for song of the year for Truth Hurts. Lizzo's label, Atlantic Records, told The Associated Press last week it was in the process of adding Lioness to the song's credits. Lizzo's other nominations include best urban contemporary album, best pop solo performance for Truth Hurts, best traditional R&B performance for Jerome and best R&B performance for Exactly How I Am, which features Gucci Mane and marks the rapper's first Grammy nomination. Another first-time nominee: former first lady Michelle Obama, who is nominated for best spoken word album for Becoming (Barack Obama has won two Grammys in the same category). Nipsey Hussle, who died in March and was nominated for best rap album earlier this year, scored three nominations: His song Racks In the Middle is up for best rap performance and best rap song, while Higher — a collaboration with DJ Khaled and John Legend that was one of the last songs Hussle recorded — is nominated for best rap/sung performance. The Cranberries picked up a nomination for best rock album for their eighth and final album, In the End, which the surviving members of the Irish band created using unfinished vocals from singer Dolores O'Riordan, who died last year. The 2020 Grammys will hand out awards in its 84 categories live from the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Jan. 26., in a ceremony hosted by Grammy-winner Alicia Keys.

The group wants to restore and publicly display artifacts from the Capitol movie theatre. For 50 years, the building reigned as the city's grand movie palace and doubled as a public gathering place until its bitterly-opposed demolition in 1979. ""This year [Dec. 1] marks the 40th anniversary of the demolition,"" Peggy Sarjeant, the society's president, recently wrote to city councillors. ""Memories of this grand theatre abound."" Located downtown on 2nd Avenue — where the Scotia Centre mall stands today — the Capitol boasted a massive 1,561-seat auditorium and the one-part-glamorous, one-part-gaudy decor that distinguished the ""atmospheric"" theatres built in the late 1920s. The Globe and Mail's current architectural critic recently named the Capitol one of ""10 iconic Canadian buildings that we've lost."" The theatre played first-run movies and also hosted many civic events: on-stage cooking shows for Depression-era housewives, live plays performed by University of Saskatchewan students, hypnotism shows by Reveen. When the theatre was demolished despite a ""Save the Cap"" campaign in 1979, several artifacts were stored in a city warehouse — everything from the stage's painted backdrops to the large columns that lined the theatre's carpeted ticket-line. The items remain there, gathering dust. ""These artifacts are large and impressive and, once restored, could be brought together to replicate the entrance and part of the interior of the theatre,"" Sargeant said.  ""It's time we found a home for these artifacts — somewhere the public can view them and catch a glimpse of the former grandeur of the theatre."" Sarjeant mentioned the city's planned downtown entertainment district but added, ""We're not pinpointing anything"" location-wise. Downtown arena plans should also consider entertainment district, say Saskatoon councillors Many other Capitol artifacts found their way in Saskatoon homes and businesses. A theatre ""exit"" sign bids visitors adieu at the Saskatoon Public Library's local history room, for example, and Saskatoon-area resident Richard Perry made off with rolls of auditorium carpeting that had been dumped in an alleyway during the demolition. ""The carpet was really incredible in that theatre,"" Perry said. ""So I gathered a few soaking wet pieces, threw them in my old Volvo station wagon and said, 'If nothing else, I could use it in the back of my car or something.'"" Perry's wife Verna said recapturing the theatre's opulence would be no easy task.  ""I think it would be very difficult [to] do it justice, to really give people the feeling, if they hadn't been [there],"" she said.  City councillors are scheduled to hear from Sarjeant Monday morning at city hall. It's a tough sell for Coun. Darren Hill.  ""I'm not prepared to consider any new capital projects,"" Hill said. ""However, I would not rule out displaying them in a current building. ""We have enough on our plate right now, and my priority is to see the arena and convention centre studies through."" This downtown parking lot could be a contender for Saskatoon's new arena Not that Hill doesn't have memories of the Capitol.  He remembers seeing ""Jaws"" at the Capitol when he was seven. ""I clearly remember being scared to go to the washroom at the theatre because I thought the shark would come out of the plumbing and get me!"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-heritage-society-seeks-city-council-help-to-revive-part-of-historic-capitol-movie-theatre-1.5284440,[],N/A

649,Éric Grenier,2020-01-25T15:26:26.498Z,Peter MacKay is piling up the caucus endorsements — but will they matter?,"Peter MacKay's bid for the Conservative Party leadership officially begins today and he's already starting with a big lead — at least among members of the Conservative caucus. Endorsements from MPs probably didn't play a decisive role in the party's 2017 leadership race, but they could have made a difference in what turned out to be a close contest. How important could they prove to be this time? A single tweet from MacKay saying ""I'm in"" was enough to get a few Conservative MPs to announce their support for the former cabinet minister and last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party. As of late Friday, MacKay had received the endorsements of 11 MPs. They include six MPs from Ontario (Dean Allison, Colin Carrie, Scot Davidson, Ben Lobb, Dave MacKenzie and Doug Shipley), two from British Columbia (Ed Fast and Kerry-Lynne Findlay), two from Alberta (Ziad Aboultaif and Blaine Calkins) and one from Quebec (Pierre Paul-Hus). MacKay also has received the endorsement of prominent provincial politicians such as Ontario PC cabinet minister Caroline Mulroney and Tim Houston, the leader of the Nova Scotia PC Party. Now that we know Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre will not be running for the leadership, MacKay's chief competitor appears to be Erin O'Toole, who finished third in the 2017 race and whose own campaign will launch soon. That makes Carrie's endorsement particularly notable, as the Oshawa MP backed O'Toole — who represents the neighbouring riding of Durham — in 2017. He's one of three MPs who endorsed O'Toole in 2017 and are putting their weight behind MacKay this time. It's certainly a show of strength from MacKay's campaign, one that gives an impression of momentum right from the start. But just what tangible impacts do endorsements have in leadership races — and what could their impact be in this contest? According to the rules of the Conservative leadership contest, every riding in the country is worth 100 points and candidates receive a number of points equal to their share of the vote in each riding. The 70 MPs who endorsed a leadership contestant in the 2017 race boosted their candidates by an average of 11 points in their ridings, compared to the candidates' performance in ridings in the same provinces where they did not receive endorsements. This phenomenon was pretty widespread — only five Conservative MPs out of the 70 who made endorsements failed to give their candidates a boost in their ridings. That boost could have made the difference between Andrew Scheer and Maxime Bernier, the top two finishers in 2017. Although these ""endorsement boosts"" represented only a small share of the 33,800 points up for grabs in Canada's 338 ridings, Scheer's estimated boost was larger than the margin that separated him and Bernier. Had Scheer not gotten the endorsements he did, he might not have won such a close race. Endorsements are not necessarily predictive, though. Bernier had little support within the Conservative caucus and still led on 12 of 13 ballots. O'Toole boasted the most caucus endorsements, but finished well back of Scheer and Bernier in third place. Generally, however, candidates who win leadership races in Canada receive a significant number — if not most — of the endorsements from their party's caucus. Why? It's kind of a chicken-or-egg question. Do MPs endorse the people they believe will win out of self-interest, or do MP endorsements help them win? In the end, the MPs doing the endorsing are likely a mix of bandwagon-jumpers and people willing to put in the actual work to help a candidate win. Endorsements could make a difference in the 2020 iteration of the Conservative leadership race. For one thing, with 22 more MPs in the Conservative caucus there are now more endorsements up for grabs. The length of the race also might put a premium on Conservative MPs' pre-existing networks in their constituencies. Candidates only have until April 17 to sign up new members who will be eligible to vote in June — that's just 83 days from now. In the last campaign, candidates had just over a year to recruit new members. They more than doubled the size of the membership base in the process. Unless O'Toole — who had the backing of nearly a third of the caucus in 2017 — can start to build his own roster of endorsements soon, MacKay's advantage might become self-sustaining, discouraging caucus members from backing anyone but the heir apparent. When all is said and done, no one wants to be the losing side. MacKay is already trying to demonstrate which side that is likely to be.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-endorsements-1.5438124,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5437504,N/A
650,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-27T02:07:04.732Z,"Health officials expect more coronavirus cases, but say risk of outbreak in Canada remains low","Federal health officials expect more cases of the coronavirus, but say the risk of an outbreak in Canada remains low. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said officials at all levels of government are working with hospitals and international partners to prevent and respond to potential infections.  ""We're working actively to limit the spread of the virus,"" Hajdu said at a news conference in Ottawa Sunday morning after the first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus was reported in Toronto. Hospitals have an ""incredibly strong"" system to prevent and control infections, she said. Hajdu said much has been learned from the SARS virus in 2003. Since the first cases of this novel coronavirus were reported in China in December, the federal government has been in close contact with the provincial health authorities and international players to share information in a ""collaborative, responsive"" approach. WATCH: Health Minister Patty Hajdu on the federal response to coronavirus Hajdu said there is considerable misinformation being spread about the virus which ""belies the reality"" that the risk to Canadians remains extremely low. CBC News has reported that misinformation and unverified claims about the virus have been circulating on social media. While the government does not expect a chartered plane is necessary to evacuate Canadians from the Wuhan region where the outbreak began, Hajdu said Global Affairs Canada stands ready to provide support services for any Canadian trying to leave China. CBC News has learned that one Canadian will be on board a flight chartered by Washington to fly diplomats and Americans out of Wuhan. A government official said 67 Canadians are registered as being in the affected region, but because registration is voluntary, the figure does not give a complete picture of Canadians in Hubei or in China. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said despite the fact the number of cases in China is increasing, the export to other countries remains low and the risk remains low in Canada. Tam said the reported case Saturday was ""not unexpected."" Canada confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto on Saturday after receiving lab results. The patient, a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to Wuhan, China, is isolated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and is now in stable condition. ""The health system is on alert to detect potential cases and to respond promptly when they are confirmed,"" Tam said. ""It shows that our systems are working."" The case is ""presumptive"" until it is formally confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Tam said she expects the formal results of the test to confirm the virus within 24 hours. She said the man experienced symptoms on board China Southern Airlines Flight CZ311, but he apparently did not report those symptoms. Health officials are now tracing fellow passengers who were seated close to the patient — in a two-metre radius — to determine if others are affected. Family members of the patient are also being closely monitored and in self-isolation. WATCH: Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam on the coronavirus According to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others by air through coughing or sneezing, close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, or by touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands. Coronaviruses are a family of diseases that range from a common cold to more serious diseases such as SARS. The federal health department's website says symptoms of most coronaviruses are usually mild to moderate and can include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and/or fever, as well as a general feeling of being unwell. Looking for a comprehensive plan and full resources from the federal government to contain this novel <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronoavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronoavirus</a>. The NDP will cooperative in every way to help keep Canadians safe. <a href=""https://t.co/stRsWSH48u"">https://t.co/stRsWSH48u</a> Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, agreed that the first case in Canada was not unexpected, and that other cases in Canada are likely. He said it's possible that other passengers on board that flight could have transferred to flights to other provinces. The health agency's protocol is to follow up on those persons for possible symptoms over the next 14 days. The number of infections worldwide now exceeds 2,000 cases, most of them in China, which reports 56 deaths. Dr. Jerome Leis, an infectious diseases specialist at Sunnybrook, said people who are acutely ill should go to hospital, but said those with mild symptoms should reach out to public health authorities. ""We completely understand that there's a lot of anxiety and questions in the general public, and that is very understandable. I want to be absolutely clear that individuals who have questions or anxiety, the first reflex should not be to go to an emergency department,"" he said. ""The first point of contact should be with public health if there are questions or concerns."" Air Canada announced Sunday it is extending its ""goodwill policy"" to allow passengers to make alternate travel arrangements during the affected period. People can change their flight free of charge to another date or another destination, or can cancel a flight for a full refund. Risk mitigation measures now in place include messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports reminding travellers to advise border officials if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. WATCH: Why finding viral cases is easier now: ""While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health-care professional if you have travelled to an affected area of China, and develop flu-like symptoms,"" Hajdu said. Officials said the man took a flight on Jan. 21 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, then from Guangzhou to Toronto, arriving on Jan. 22. He is believed to have travelled ""privately"" from the airport to his home. Officials do not believe he took public transit. They have not said what part of the city the man lives in. Upon arriving, he told family members he felt ill and called 911. Officials say paramedics took all necessary precautions ""right from first contact"" until the hand-off to the hospital's emergency department on Jan. 23, officials say. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada annually. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said provincial health officials are putting full resources to the virus, and will be staying vigilant and informing the public ""every step of the way."" ""It's something I feel we have a good handle [on] and we're ready, but we want to see the extent of this,"" he said Sunday in Toronto. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne issued a statement Sunday reminding Canadians to pay attention to travel advisories warning against non-essential travel to Hubei, China, including the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou. Canadians already in the region should register with consular officials, which will give them access to the latest updates from the government, he said.  ""We understand the concerns of Canadians in the region and those of their families and loved ones. We are in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground,"" Champagne said in the statement. ""Canadian consular officials are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with local authorities and our international partners to gather more information and provide support to the extent possible. Canada does not have a consular presence in Wuhan."" Transport Minister Marc Garneau's office said the department has set up a dedicated team to support and respond, and has activated the Emergency Co-ordination Centre. On Friday, Transport Canada officials held a teleconference with the Public Health Agency of Canada and airline representatives, and reminding the carriers they are required, under the terms of the Quarantine Act, to report ill passengers. Transport officials have also been in regular contact with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to discuss contingencies and readiness plans.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-tam-health-china-1.5440950,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-coronavirus-preparedness-1.5439033 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-buses-1.5440899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,N/A
651,Jillian S. Bell,2018-10-07T13:00:00.103Z,Bad weather is the least of our worries: Sask. drivers' 7 irritating sins,"My best friend's husband once told me we couldn't drive from Halifax to the Bay of Fundy because ""there might be weather.""  Saskatchewan got a whole lot of weather this week — not that that appears to influence driving habits in the least. Snow? You can outrun snow. In fact, the faster you drive, the faster the wind will clear all of that snow off your car, so don't bother buying a snow brush. Waste. Of. Money.  Ice? My tires will save me. I have four of them. Rain? What's a little hydroplaning between friends?  Low visibility? Running lights are for children. Make it a game of hide and seek.  We know it's not just winter weather that makes driving in Saskatchewan so … exhilarating. The two things that unite the people of this province are painfully long winters and cruddy driving habits.  This is my lane. There are many like it, but this one is mine. No other driver may use my lane.  I must master my lane as I master my life. I will drive faster in the right lane should someone wish to overtake me. I will drive slower in the left lane so no one can get in behind me.  Every other driver on the road should be able to tell, based on the vibrations you put out into the universe, where it is you intend to go and when you intend to go there.  Signal lights are like toilet paper: you're only meant to use them when nobody else is watching.  Driving is always a race. There is literally never a time when you should drive the speed limit. If we weren't meant to go super fast, why would we even have a statistic like ""this car goes from 0 to 100 km/h in less than four seconds?"" The gas pedal goes all the way to the floor mat for a reason: you deserve to be the first person to get to the office/your house/the restaurant/a stoplight. The best way to do this is to shotgun a coffee, a tea, a litre of water and an energy drink before you get in your car so that your bursting bladder encourages you to push your vehicle as close to the speed of light as possible. Sir Isaac Newton's first law of motion is that an object will remain in motion at a constant velocity if all other external forces cancel each other out. The only place these laws don't exist is when you're driving. Cruise control is for grannies and whiners. If you're going at a constant velocity, you're losing. The proper way to drive is to speed up and slow down randomly, preferably when there are other drivers in your immediate vicinity.  Driving can be a lonely and often dull experience. Dogs provide distraction and entertainment value in the car as well as companionship.  You don't want your dog in the back seat or the passenger seat or the bed of the truck. It's best to hold your dog on your lap where it can pretend to drive, because we all know the one thing a dog finds fulfilling is piloting a 1.8-tonne machine through asphalt mazes.  If you do not have a dog, you may use a cat or a bird. Human companions can be used as lap buddies, but remember to always use protection.  Art is subjective. Painting is a form of art. How do they get those lines on the road that indicate lanes? They paint them.  Therefore, lanes themselves are a form of artistic impression and every driver should be able to individually interpret what a ""lane"" is. Feel like driving right down the middle of the road, with the lane markers slipping by directly under the centre of your vehicle? Want to hug that centre line with a tire? You should totally do that.  When stopped at a red light (or a train or pedestrian crossing), it's good practice to continually inch your vehicle into the intersection rather than remaining at a full stop. This gives you ""the edge"" over other drivers as soon as you're able to move again. It also ensures you will be Getting There First (see #3).  Saskatchewan Government Insurance is making a big push against distracting driving in October. CBC Radio's The Morning Edition host Stefani Langenegger asked listeners earlier this month for the worst cases they've seen. The examples are more outlandish than anything I could come up with. CBC wants to know: what's your driving pet peeve? <a href=""https://twitter.com/SLangeneggerCBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@SLangeneggerCBC</a> This past Monday at 5pm, in downtown Regina, I looked over and saw someone driving while holding and eating out of a full size white corningware casserole dish.

652,Amina Zafar,2020-01-24T10:00:15.274Z,'Just incredible:' Mass quarantines take China into uncharted territory,"China's move to lock down 10 cities to control the spread of a new coronavirus is unprecedented in modern history and its effectiveness is hard to predict, public health experts say. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, the train station and airport were shut down on Thursday, while ferry, subway and bus service ground to a halt. Trying to contain a city of 11 million people is ""new to science,"" said Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in China. ""We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.""  Similar measures were announced in other cities, all in central China's Hubei province. Mass gatherings were forbidden just as hundreds of millions of people prepared to travel and celebrate the Lunar New Year. ""That's just incredible,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital. ""The equivalent would be shutting down transportation to a comparable sized city like London, United Kingdom on Dec. 23."" But its effectiveness depends in part on how many ""chains of transmission"" have occurred.  Like branches of a tree trunk, each chain of infection represents one person infecting someone else. Many chains of infection usually means more people are infected and an outbreak is widespread, he said. If there have already been secondary chains outside Wuhan, then shutting down the transportation might slow the spread of the virus, but not stop it in its tracks. Bioethicist Kerry Bowman of the University of Toronto says quarantines can be effective in the early stages of an outbreak.  The rub is, in this case, the quarantine pits individual freedoms against an entire city's. ""This may be acceptable to people if it's short term,"" Bowman said. For China, the question becomes who does the quarantine serve, says Ann Carmichael, a professor emerita of history at Indiana University who studies quarantines during the 17th century outbreaks of plague in Europe.  Back then, she says, people would be killed for the tiniest infraction of public health laws, like not burning clothing as ordered. The word ""quarantine"" comes from the Italian quaranta giorni (""40 days""), which referred to a period of isolation placed on ships and people in a bid to control the Black Death.  These days, says Carmichael, ""I think what the Chinese government is always thinking about is — when does panic make it worse, and what is a measured response?"" she said. Panic is a possible side-effect of a quarantine, says Dr. Tom Solomon, who heads the U.K.'s Health Protection Research Unit on emerging infections. He says stopping all public transport from a city can be counterproductive. ""It can increase the level of panic and just cause people to flee by other means,"" Solomon wrote in a recent commentary.  It can also send people into hiding. Solomon gave the example of the village of Eyam in north England where, in the Middle Ages, residents built a wall during an outbreak of plague and didn't leave until it ended. Back then, outbreaks of plague, cholera and yellow fever provided a reason for one country to interfere in another's affairs. It wasn't until the 19th century that countries began to co-operate more officially on global health problems.  And today, says Carmichael, the world needs answers to questions — like whether this new coronavirus is poised to cause a pandemic, like the 1918 influenza.  More recent infections prompted a range of responses. During HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization did not get involved in quarantines or border restrictions, Carmichael said. During the SARS outbreak in Ontario, hospitals and long-term care homes practised a form of quarantine — with daily temperature checks for staff and a ban on visitors. In contrast, after SARS, Canada helped to revise International Health Regulations to avoid unnecessary restrictions on travel and trade. Carmichael said part of the history and practice of quarantine is ""keeping in"" — detention, confinement and isolation. The other is ""keeping out"" — border security, masks on persons and aggressive hand washing. Health officials in Canada and the U.S. continue to emphasize hand hygiene.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/quarantine-coronavirus-1.5438652,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155,N/A
653,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-24T18:51:25.357Z,"Texas murder suspect arrested in Halifax remains detained, refuses to leave cell","An American murder suspect nabbed in Halifax will remain detained until February, when he'll have another hearing to determine whether he's admissible to Canada, a member of the Immigration and Review Board ruled Friday. Derek Cameron Whisenand was scheduled to appear before the board Friday morning for both a detention review and an admissibility hearing, but refused to leave his cell in Halifax. A board member maintained Whisenand's detention on the basis he was a flight risk and a danger to the Canadian public. Dianne Tordoff also agreed to proceed with a hearing on admissibility on Feb. 11, regardless of whether Whisenand has secured counsel by then. The admissibility hearing scheduled for Friday was adjourned because Whisenand had the right to be present. ""But if a person refuses to attend, the board must proceed with celerity — we can't just keep postponing the hearing,"" Tordoff said. Whisenand, 28, is a suspect in the June 2019 death of a 78-year-old man in Eastland County, Texas, about 170 kilometres southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He has been detained since his Dec. 30 arrest, which came after police responded to a call about the shoplifting of work boots at a Walmart in the city's Bayers Lake area. A police report filed as an exhibit in connection with his detention said Whisenand had been living in a tent in the woods with his dog near the busy shopping district. According to the report by Halifax regional police, he was arrested after leading officers on a foot chase and only stopped after a constable threatened to use her Taser on him. The police report alleged the fugitive was wearing brand-new beige work boots that still had the price tags on them. He was evasive with Halifax officers and gave a false name — Christian Bates — before the officer found a tattered U.S. social security card with his real name on it, without a birth date, the report states. After giving police his date of birth, he allegedly pleaded with them to let him go on a promise to appear so he could fetch his dog at the campsite. Police confirmed they found a tent, clothing, dishes and dog food in a wooded area not far from where the alleged theft took place. The dog was seized by animal control officers. Whisenand was subsequently turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency and has refused to answer questions from immigration officials. In July, RCMP warned that he had illegally crossed into Canada near Haskett, Man., sometime during the week of June 24. Authorities in North Dakota said Whisenand's vehicle was found about three kilometres from the Canadian border. Whisenand hasn't explained how he got to Nova Scotia, but he was believed to have gotten a ride from the border to Winnipeg, then headed towards Atlantic Canada. He has no family or friends in Canada and has been detained at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. Whisenand didn't participate in his initial hearing on Jan. 2 and told the board at the second one on Jan. 8 that he wished to consult with a lawyer before proceeding on the issue of admissibility. Michel Gallant, a CBSA hearing officer, said Friday that officers have tried to interview Whisenand, but he's rebuffed their attempts. Gallant also said the U.S. consulate in Halifax will provide an emergency travel document if Whisenand is ultimately ordered removed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/new-stamp-commemorates-black-hockey-league-1.5437722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/northern-pulp-mill-boat-harbour-government-environment-1.5437969 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,N/A
654,Bethany Lindsay,2018-07-20T23:50:30.832Z,Here's (some of) what's wrong with B.C.'s taxi system,"Anyone who's ever waited — and waited and waited — to grab a cab home to the suburbs at closing time on the Granville Strip knows there's a serious taxi problem in B.C. For some people, the problem is obvious — the province doesn't allow Uber, Lyft or any other ride-hailing services that might fill the service gap. But a technical report released this week by transportation expert Dan Hara, who holds a PhD in economics, suggests the roots of B.C.'s taxi troubles go much deeper than that. It reveals complaints from just about everyone who has a stake in personal transportation and analyzes how the current regulatory system erects roadblocks to improvement. Mohan Kang, president of the B.C. Taxi Association, said he hasn't read Hara's full report, but he's optimistic about the changes that are recommended, including an immediate 15-per-cent increase in taxi fleets across the province. ""Dr. Hara has touched some of the important issues,"" Kang said. ""The taxi industry should be prepared to be competitive and to serve the general public better, and he's an expert in those things."" Hara recommends a slew of fixes to the current system, including throwing out the requirement for a Class 4 driver's licence, funding more accessible taxi service, developing a usage-based insurance option for part-time drivers and establishing a provincial authority to issue chauffeur permits. Here's why he says it's necessary to overhaul the current system:  Where to begin? There's the fact that any driver who picks up passengers at the airport needs to have a chauffeur permit for multiple municipalities, which means multiple criminal record checks. There are local regulations in cities like Vancouver which, for the most part, only allows pickups by Vancouver taxi companies. Then there's the Passenger Transportation Board, an independent tribunal that reviews applications from taxi operators and issues licences. The current legal framework allows competitors to argue against those applications, saying there are already enough taxis in service. According to Hara, that means that instead of determining how many taxis are actually needed, the PTB is left to act ""as a referee and judge in a contest between applicants and competitors who oppose the application."" And of course taxis still need municipal licences, so city councils can block any new applications, as Vancouver has done in the past.  In downtown Vancouver on a Friday night, it can take more than an hour to clear out the lines of people waiting for taxis, a situation that sometimes leads to drunken brawls, according to Hara. Resort communities like Whistler and Kelowna, on the other hand, are more likely to have problems with seasonal shortages. That's because the PTB only issues licences for a fixed number of taxis in specific operating areas, usually well below what's needed during peak times, Hara says. But he adds that cab companies also have trouble finding enough drivers because of the need for a Class 4 licence — something that would take three years for a new immigrant to obtain. Meanwhile, disabled passengers in cities complain they're frequently told that no accessible taxis are available when they need a ride, and smaller communities often don't have any accessible cabs at all.  The current system isn't making drivers happy, either. To begin with, insurance is too expensive — as much as $32,000 a year, according to Hara. Some of the cabbies he spoke with also mentioned the high rates they pay to lease or rent taxi licences, and said they might prefer driving for a ride-hailing company.  Many of the details in Hara's report were lost in the uproar over the news that ride-hailing likely won't be available in B.C. until the fall of 2019 — just the latest in a series of delays. The latest timeline takes into account ICBC's estimate that it will need at least six to 12 months to develop the right approach to insuring drivers for ride-hailing services, and that can only happen after a change in legislation. But Hara's report suggests that another major sticking point has been figuring out how to cushion the financial blow for those who hold or lease expensive licences to operate existing taxis. In other parts of the world, taxi regulation has remained unchanged even after the introduction of ride-hailing, leaving companies with limited ability to compete while they watch the value of their businesses decline, according to Hara. He writes that any new system needs to protect ""the value of historic investments"" made by drivers and taxi companies. To that end, Hara recommends that all new vehicles be required to pay a fee per trip in an attempt to level the playing field.

655,Anonymous,2020-01-15T11:00:00.724Z,"Quebec City mosque to be safer, with 'classic and modern' look, after $1.2M renovation","The brown brick and opaque windows of the Quebec Mosque will be replaced in 2020 by a clean, bright façade, marking a new chapter for Muslim worshippers in Quebec City. The building in the borough of Sainte-Foy is currently undergoing major renovations, estimated at $1.2 million, that will make the place of worship safer and create more space for the growing number of worshippers, according to the mosque's former president, Mohamed Labidi. ""It is comforting — after everything we went through, we need to have some happy moments,"" said Labidi. It will be three years on Jan. 29 since six men were killed and five others injured when a gunman entered the mosque and started shooting into the crowded room. Even before the tragic event, renovations had been in the works, but Labidi said the attack only reinforced the ""need to make the building safer."" In the months that followed the shooting, electronic access codes were added to the front doors, which until then had been unlocked, as the building was always open to the public. The current renovations are expected to be completed by the end of June. Additional entranceways will allow people to circulate more freely. A ""buffer zone,"" with a large foyer, will also separate the entrance from the main prayer room. The expansion will make room for approximately 300 additional worshippers, on the building's three levels. ""On Fridays, all our floors are full. It's hard to find an empty space, so it's necessary,"" said Labidi, who is now on the mosque's board of directors. He said the mosque already had ""a comfortable cushion"" of funds at its disposal to begin construction work but is still raising money across Quebec and Canada. The organization had to juggle the renovation with another major project, the establishment of a Muslim cemetery in the region. That project, a $200,000 investment, was officially approved by the city in December 2019. The mosque currently looks like a nondescript commercial building. Once it is remodelled, it will include architectural elements more in tune with its religious vocation, according to Kamel Kheroua, an architectural adviser on the project.  Ornate designs over the doorways will add a ""classic and modern"" look to the mosque, said Kheroua. A minaret will soon tower over the front entrance, mirroring the ruins of the steeple of the former parish church, Notre-Dame-de-Foy, the burnt-out shell of which stands across the street. ""We were inspired by the church next door. It will build a kind of link, in a way,"" Kheroua said. The ruins of the church, destroyed in a fire in 1977, will also be the site of an art installation promised by the city in 2019, which is to be inaugurated in the coming months. The memorial will be set up on either side of De l'Église Street and will include stone pillars to honour each of the six shooting victims: Ibrahima Barry, Mamadou 'Tanou' Barry, Khaled Belkacemi, Abdelkrim Hassane, Azzedine Soufiane ​​and Aboubaker Thabti.  This Jan. 29 will mark three years since the shooting.  The third anniversary will focus on citizens rather than political speeches, according to the organizers of the event, called Commémoration citoyenne de l'attentat du 29 janvier 2017. The first two anniversaries, held outdoors in 2018 and inside a pavilion at Université Laval in 2019, included speeches from Mayor Régis Labeaume and other politicians and dignitaries. Organizers are hoping this time for a ""more intimate"" event, ""to focus on what brings us together,"" said spokesperson Maryam Bessiri. The gathering will be held at Saint-Mathieu Church on Ste-Foy Road at 6 p.m., on Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2020. Traditional food from North Africa and Guinea, the places where the victims were born, will be served throughout the evening, said Besiri. ""We figured that food is something that bring people together.""  The event is free and open to the public, but seating is limited.

656,Adam Miller,2020-01-26T18:39:10.076Z,Why Canada's 1st suspected coronavirus case is 'a world of difference' from SARS,"News that Toronto has its first suspected case of coronavirus may come as a shock to Canadians, but health officials have been preparing for this exact scenario for weeks.  ""We knew that there was going to be a case in Canada. We knew that there was probably going to be a case in Toronto,"" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, told CBC News.  ""It was just a question of time.""  The unidentified patient is a man in his 50s who was taken to Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with symptoms after travelling from the Chinese city of Wuhan to Guangzhou and then to Toronto on Wednesday.  Officials said he had limited external contact with people in Toronto when he arrived at his residence, before being taken by paramedics to hospital in stable condition. ""No one would be surprised if this is a positive case,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.  ""It appears that this may have arrived on our doorstep and we're ready.""  McGeer, who contracted SARS in 2003 while working as a physician on the front lines of the epidemic, says she believes the risk to the public with this case is low.  ""I'm not concerned about transmission from this case at all in Toronto,"" she said, adding that Toronto Public Health officials have already begun the process of contacting people who may have come in contact with the patient.   ""There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.""  McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.  There are two types of transmission with a coronavirus like this: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission,"" the World Health Organization in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said at a news conference Saturday that officials would be looking to identify passengers on the flight the patient took to Toronto who were within three rows for potential risk.  Bogoch said that while the suspected case is not unexpected, by no means does it indicate that there is a wider outbreak in Toronto.  ""I think that people should just go about their lives as they normally do,"" he said. ""But also be aware of the news and follow the situation closely as things change.""  Canada has already ruled out several suspected cases of the coronavirus in Quebec and Bogoch said that is an indication that the systems in place are working.  ""Thankfully, those weren't cases, but at least it demonstrated that people knew what to do and where to go if they had symptoms suggestive of infection with this coronavirus,"" he said. ""It almost was a bit of a test of the system.""  Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director for infection prevention control at Sunnybrook Hospital, said the patient was immediately isolated for further investigation, placed in a negative pressure room with protective equipment and was in stable condition.  Watch: How officials are dealing with public fear over coronavirus Bogoch said the work is not just being done inside the hospital, but preventing further transmission in the community and beyond.  ""This is one case, this is still an evolving situation and of course we might get additional cases as well,"" he said.  ""But we are prepared and the system appears to be working.""  We still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, which had a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""We are in a very, very different place than when we were responding to SARS,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, president of Public Health Ontario. ""One of the things that is very different is that we know what the virus is. We have a fast, reliable test and that really is a game changer."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the epidemic that killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003.  Compared with the 2003 SARS outbreak, the flow of information worldwide and speed at which diagnostic tests have been developed has improved dramatically.  ""The speed with which people identified SARS was amazing for 17 years ago, but it still took weeks,"" McGeer said. ""Here, the problem was recognized the last week of December, tests were available around the world 10 days later.""  Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. McGeer said health-care workers were ""unprepared to take precautions"" during the SARS epidemic due to a lack of diagnostic tests and experience with outbreaks. ""If you had told people before SARS that a new disease would emerge in China and cause outbreaks in Toronto, they would have laughed you out of the room,"" she said. ""And the situation now is very different. We know what these risks are. We know how they're going to come at us and what you've seen is the perfect example of that working.""  McGeer said the patient clearly received information that he needed to contact authorities when he had symptoms arise, which he did, and the sample was identified by officials within a day.  ""Everybody took the right precautions,"" she said. ""It's a world of difference.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-health-officials-reaction-1st-case-coronavirus-canada-1.5440803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-social-media-misinformation-1.5440334 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,N/A

658,David Burke,2020-01-27T10:00:00.697Z,Lure of big money not enough to break Nova Scotia cold cases,"A Nova Scotia program that offers up to $150,000 to those who can provide information on major crimes isn't attracting many callers. That's led criminologist Michael Boudreau to say it might be time to scrap the program. In the almost 14 years since it started, the Rewards for Major Unsolved Crimes program has received 163 tips, according to the Department of Justice. That's about 12 tips per year on average. ""That's somewhat surprisingly low,"" said Boudreau, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at St. Thomas University in Fredericton.   The program began as a tool to help police solve cold cases by offering a substantial cash reward. The program seeks tips on unsolved homicides and missing persons cases considered suspicious. The money is awarded for ""information that leads to the arrest and conviction of a person(s) responsible for a major unsolved crime,"" according to the department's website. Only three tipsters have actually been awarded money in that time. Two were given $150,000 while a third received $100,000. The latest award, in 2018, went to a caller who was paid $100,000 for a tip that led to the arrest of Elmer Higgins. Higgins faced a double murder charge in the 2012 deaths of Earle Stewart and Matthew Hebb in Sheet Harbour. But Higgins had a chronic health condition and died awaiting trial.  In 2014, the program paid $150,000 to a person who came forward with information in the 2011 Melissa Peacock homicide. Peacock's body was found in Upper Stewiacke in 2012. Dustan Joseph Preeper and his brother, Joshua Michael Preeper, are serving life sentences in that case. Another reward in the same amount was handed out in March 2016 in connection to the 2010 murder of Ryan White in Halifax. That same year, Kale Gabriel was sentenced to life in prison for the second-degree murder of White. There are 101 unsolved cases that are part of the program, from the 2018 shooting death of Ryan Nehiley in Halifax to the 1985 double homicide of Jack and Micheline Hulme, in Lunenburg County. ""Overall, over this long period of time, that's a fairly low success rate,"" said Boudreau. ""Why is the province continuing to operate the program? Maybe they need to revisit it because it doesn't appear to be working that effectively.""     But he said many programs that offer money for crime tips in Canada have the same problem. ""Arguably, from a more pessimistic perspective, these are not very effective programs, but they allow governments to say, 'Well, we're doing something to try and help,'"" said Boudreau.  One of the reasons more tips don't come in, according to Boudreau, is that most people aren't that interested in the money. He said most people phone in tips for altruistic reasons and because they want justice. As a result, most tips come in shortly after a crime is committed. Once a case goes cold, few tips come in despite the potential for a big payout, he said.  Despite the low numbers, the province still views the program as a success.      ""If this program has assisted victims families find closure when a person has come forward with information leading to the arrest or conviction of a suspect — if the program can assist even one of those families with finding closure — then we would define that as a success,"" said Heather MacDonald-Chisholm, a case manager with the Department of Justice. But she said the program can be improved. Part of that could be a higher public profile to generate more calls. ""The Rewards for Major Unsolved Crimes program does give police another tool to help solve crime. So while a person may feel like a tip might not be of value, it's really important if they have any information to call,"" she said. While Boudreau questions how well rewards programs work overall, he said they do have some benefits.  ""If this program of offering money for tips keeps the public engaged and aware of the case maybe that's a good thing. If it jogs someone's memory … but often times that just doesn't happen.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rewards-major-unsolved-crimes-cold-cases-nova-scotia-1.5437685,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-woman-at-centre-of-flawed-rape-investigation-files-lawsuit-1.5439077 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/connaught-halifax-shooting-man-seriously-injured-1.5441377 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fasd-support-families-diagnosis-treatment-1.5438348 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-power-customers-storm-outages-reason-winds-1.5440084 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ohio-basketball-coach-pays-visit-brings-gifts-to-canso-team-1.5439003,N/A
659,Evan Dyer,2020-01-13T20:37:43.928Z,Canada considers new international push to oust Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro ,"Canada is considering convening a high-level meeting of the Lima Group to refocus efforts to bring about a democratic transition in Venezuela following days of drama at the National Assembly in Caracas.  The man Canada considers Venezuela's legitimate president, Juan Guaido, was able to take his seat in the legislature this month in spite of attempts by the government of Nicolas Maduro to keep him out. And the move to prevent opposition deputies from taking their seats by surrounding the building with police appeared to backfire on Maduro, when it was condemned by Latin American governments normally considered sympathetic to Venezuela's ""Bolivarian revolution."" A Canadian official speaking on background told CBC News that Ottawa interprets the decision of the Mexican government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to sign one of two Lima Group statements condemning the Maduro government as a sign that the hemispheric coalition Ottawa helped build to oppose Maduro hasn't completely fractured. Venezuelan paramilitary police used force to try to keep the opposition majority out of the National Assembly, injuring four deputies slightly and tearing Opposition Leader Guaido's suit jacket. But they seemed reluctant to go beyond pushing, shoving, and trying to bar doors. When a crush of opposition deputies finally succeeded in pushing open the main door of the legislative palace, police gave way. Guaido and his supporters — all elected in the last Venezuelan election to be recognized by Canada as legitimate — rushed into the chamber and quickly swore Guaido into office for a second term as president of the National Assembly. The opposition has argued that, under Venezuela's constitution, Guaido's role as assembly president also makes him president of the republic, because the claims to office of Maduro and his vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, are based on the results of a fraudulent election in 2018. Canada, which also rejected the results of the 2018 election, supports that position. The Maduro regime's reluctance to use greater force against the pro-Guaido deputies may reflect the fact that the U.S. has repeatedly warned Venezuela that any move to arrest or harm Guaido would cross a red line. ""I think you would see even additional action far beyond what we have pushed out to date"" if there were a move to detain Guaido, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Cuba and Venezuela Carrie Filipetti, told reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Colombia on Tuesday. The events cap a year in which the opposition began strongly, but then seemed to lose momentum, as regional shifts of power brought cracks to the Lima Group alliance of nations. The Lima Group was set up in August 2017 in response to a violent crackdown on dissent in Venezuela. It united Canada with the biggest nations of Latin America: Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Colombia, but excluded the United States. That exclusion reflected an important difference of opinion: the U.S. was unwilling to rule out the use of military force to eject the Maduro government, while Lima Group members said they were committed to peaceful change. Taken together, the Lima Group governments and the U.S. represented about 95 per cent of the people of the hemisphere, while the Maduro government enjoyed the support of a handful of smaller nations: Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia and El Salvador (along with Russia and China). But 2019 would bring changes that took some of the heat off Maduro.  When Guaido took the presidential oath on Jan. 23, 2019, he received an avalanche of recognition from about 60 countries. Canada was the second to extend recognition, but Lima Group founding member Mexico, the world's most populous Spanish-speaking country, held back. That was because eight weeks before Guaido's assumption, a new president had taken Mexico in a new, leftward, direction. President Andres Lopez Obrador (often known as AMLO) replaced Enrique Peña Nieto, whose government had a mostly positive relationship with the Trudeau government and was an early backer of the Lima Group. AMLO gave an early sign that Mexico's position would be changing when he invited Maduro to personally attend his inauguration. Another Lima Group dropout was Argentina, where voters turned against Trudeau ally Mauricio Macri, and restored to power a Peronist government that has historically been close to Maduro and former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez (and had once received a suitcase full of cash as an illegal campaign contribution from its friends in Caracas).  The inauguration of that new government last month effectively took Argentina out of the Lima Group. But the decision to bar elected deputies from their seats seems to have been a bridge too far for some of Maduro's Latin American allies. Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard joined the chorus of condemnation over this week's attempted closure of Venezuela's elected assembly, saying ""the legitimate functioning of the legislative branch is an inviolable pillar of democracies."" Argentina's Foreign Minister Felipe Sola condemned the closure of the National Assembly as ""exactly the opposite"" of what the Maduro government should be doing. ""To use force to prevent the functioning of the National Assembly is to condemn oneself to international isolation. We reject this,"" wrote Sola. Diosdado Cabello, a leading figure of the Maduro government and host of a nightly program on Venezuelan state television, denounced the former allies in harsh terms. ""If the ambassador of Argentina or Mexico said some 'Guai-idiocy', we're still here and we don't need Argentina or its foreign minister. They'll see where they end up in history. Whether they choose to defend the people, or if they choose to be on the side of those who live slavishly following imperialism,"" said Cabello. Meanwhile U.S. Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams appeared to exult in the new divisions among governments that had previously supported Maduro. ""Maduro must be asking himself today, 'Do I have any allies left?' (Argentina and Mexico) are not going to support those kinds of measures. They're going to denounce those kinds of measures. ""He is left with Cuba, Russia, China, and a few odd dictatorships around the world, but he is losing the support not only on the right, not only in the centre, but on the left in Latin America."" If the Maduro government's new allies proved disappointing, the regime also lost some of its strongest old allies. President Evo Morales of Bolivia — perhaps the closest Maduro ally after the Cuban Communist Party — fled his country in November following violent protests alleging electoral fraud. But if this month's events seemed to turn in Guaido's favour, it doesn't change the fact that Maduro remains in control not only of Miraflores, the presidential palace, but also of the country's armed forces and national police. People have continued to flee Venezuela at a rate of about 3,000 to 5,000 per day, said William Spindler of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees office in Panama. ""The latest figures we have are for December 5,"" he told CBC News, adding that the number of 4,769,000 Venezuelan refugees is almost certainly an underestimate ""because it counts only those who have registered with governments."" Canada has also received several thousand Venezuelan asylum claims. Despite the humanitarian crisis, the opposition has been hurt by corruption scandals. About 10 members of the opposition bloc in the assembly, once 110 members strong, have switched sides to support the government. Deputies have not been paid in almost four years, and some say they have received offers of payments between $750,000 and $1 million US from deputies loyal to the Maduro government if they agree to ""jump the gate"" as Venezuelans refer to changing sides in the country's polarized political conflict. Many current and former opposition deputies are in exile, in prison, in hiding, or have sought refuge in foreign embassies to avoid arrest. Luis Parra was expelled from Guaido's party after he was implicated by Venezuelan investigative news site Armandoinfo.com for a campaign to help regime-affiliated businessmen escape sanctions for their role in profiteering from Venezuela's hunger crisis. Congressmen who wrote letters on behalf of those businessmen are known in Venezuela as the ""CLAP deputies."" (Venezuela's food rationing program is known by its Spanish acronym CLAP, and the monthly rations that millions of Venezuelans depend on are called ""CLAP boxes."") Guaido and other opposition leaders moved swiftly to expel the CLAP deputies, but the scandal nonetheless disillusioned Venezuelans weary of the venality of their political class. The failure to deliver on the high hopes of change he sparked last year has also chipped away at Guaido's approval rate, which fell from over 60 per cent in Spring to about 40 per cent by the end of 2019, according to respected Caracas polling agency Datanalisis. (Maduro's approval is lower — about 14 per cent according to the same pollster.) But there are signs a renewed effort could be underway.  Just before Christmas, the U.S. Senate passed the VERDAD Act (Venezuela Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance, and Development Act of 2019), which assigns $400 million US to the Venezuelan opposition and to humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans both inside and outside the country.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-venezuela-maduro-1.5418058,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-s-guaido-enters-legislative-1.5417403 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/maduro-crackdown-venezuela-1.5416440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-refugees-south-america-1.5359306 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/venezuela-s-juan-guaido-loses-control-congress-1.5415649,N/A
660,Anonymous,2018-07-27T11:47:03.603Z,'Grain-free' dog food may be linked to deadly heart disease,"Unusual cases of potentially deadly heart disease have been cropping up in dogs fed dog food containing legumes and potatoes that is often marketed as being ""grain free,"" prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to investigate. Canine dilated cardiomyopathy affects a dog's heart muscle and often leads to congestive heart failure.  Affected dogs may seem tired, weak, lose weight and even collapse suddenly. They may also develop irregular heart rhythms that could predispose dogs to sudden death, according to the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Certain large dog breeds are predisposed to the disease, including Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Irish wolfhounds, St. Bernards and Doberman pinschers. But the FDA said it's concerned about reports from veterinarians of the disease in other kinds of dogs. They include golden and Labrador retrievers, a whippet, a shih tzu, a bulldog, miniature schnauzers and some mixed breeds. ""These reports are highly unusual as they are are occurring in breeds not typically genetically prone to the disease,"" said Dr. Martine Hartogensis, deputy director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine's Office of Surveillance and Compliance in a brief released earlier this month. According to the veterinary cardiologists who made the reports, the affected dogs consistently ate foods containing peas, lentils, other legume seeds or potatoes as their main ingredients for months to years. ""That's why the FDA is conducting an investigation into this potential link,"" the briefing said. It urged pet owners and veterinarians to report DCM cases in dogs not normally predisposed to the disease. It added that it has been in contact with pet food manufacturers and the veterinary community to discuss the recent reports. ""In the meantime,"" it said, ""the FDA continues to recommend that changes in diet, especially for dogs with DCM, should be made in consultation with a licensed veterinary professional."" Grain-free dog food has become popular in recent years, despite its premium price. Dr. Kevin McIntosh, a veterinarian and owner of the Algonquin Animal Hospital in Ottawa, said he's noticed its rise in the past five or six years. ""There's a perception that it's a healthier thing to feed, it's more natural, it's closer to what they would eat if they were wolves,"" he told CBC's Ottawa Morning Thursday. ""Certainly, the marketing that's out there really reinforces that.""  He said the FDA investigation is still preliminary and not all dogs fed a grain-free diet end up with heart disease. ""But it's a good conversation to have with your veterinarian — is my dog one of these at-risk breeds? And maybe should I think about switching away until we know for sure.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/dcm-grain-free-dog-food-1.4762533,[],N/A
661,Bethany Lindsay,2020-01-04T22:22:47.380Z,"Some B.C. salmon runs face 'meaningful chance of extinction' after landslide, despite rescue mission","Scientists fear that some Fraser River salmon populations could be wiped out completely following a landslide that has blocked part of the critical B.C. migration route for the last year. Federal government scientists told the Pacific Salmon Commission there is a ""meaningful chance of extinction"" for three salmon runs after the Big Bar landslide, according to a copy of a PowerPoint presentation, dated Oct. 16, obtained by CBC News. That includes the Early Stuart sockeye and the Mid-Fraser and Upper Fraser Spring 1.3 chinook populations.  The landslide prompted officials at multiple levels of government to organize a rescue mission that saw thousands of salmon, which are very vulnerable to stress, lifted by helicopter across the rocks that blocked their migration route. But despite that effort, prospects are dismal for the salmon in the upper reaches of the river, according to Dean Werk, president of the Fraser Valley Salmon Society. ""We're talking about virtually a collapse — a total collapse — of the salmon stocks above the Big Bar slide,"" Werk told CBC. ""This is devastating to the wild salmon population. Some of those upper river streams were supposed to be the largest component of this year's sockeye run."" The landslide sent massive chunks of rock crashing into the river north of Lillooet, creating a five-metre high waterfall and impassable obstacle for migrating salmon. Satellite imagery has confirmed that the slide happened in October or November 2018, but officials at Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) say because of the remote location, it wasn't reported until June 23. In an attempt to save this year's salmon runs, more than 60,000 fish were captured, stored in tanks, and then lifted past the obstruction by helicopter over the summer. Some others eventually managed to swim past without human help. According to Werk, at least half of the fish that were transported past the landslide died before they made it to their spawning grounds. Though he's yet to see final numbers from the federal government, it's his understanding that some streams upriver from the slide have seen less than 10 per cent of their projected returns.  Werk says the federal government should declare a state of emergency and make saving the salmon of the upper Fraser a priority. The first step, in his mind, would be removing the obstruction. ""If we do not look after coming up with a very fast solution over the winter months … this is going to be compounded two seasons in a row,"" Werk said. He wrote to the federal government on behalf of the Fraser Valley Salmon Society earlier this month, pleading for action before the 2020 runs. The federal and provincial governments, along with multiple First Nations, were all involved in the effort to save the 2019 salmon run. A DFO spokesperson said it's too early to confirm how many fish made it back to their spawning grounds, but acknowledged that some runs are expected to have low numbers this year, in part because of the Big Bar slide. ""While some early estimates on 2019 returns are circulating, work is ongoing to finalize the scientific evaluation around the fish migration, spawning and mortality data, which will be released once completed,"" Louise Girouard told CBC in an email. Even without those concrete estimates, the overall picture for Fraser River salmon looks bleak. In September, the federal government department drastically dropped the number of expected 2019 Fraser River sockeye returns to a little more than 600,000, down from an earlier projection of close to five million.

662,Adam Miller,2020-01-26T18:39:10.076Z,Why Canada's 1st suspected coronavirus case is 'a world of difference' from SARS,"News that Toronto has its first suspected case of coronavirus may come as a shock to Canadians, but health officials have been preparing for this exact scenario for weeks.  ""We knew that there was going to be a case in Canada. We knew that there was probably going to be a case in Toronto,"" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, told CBC News.  ""It was just a question of time.""  The unidentified patient is a man in his 50s who was taken to Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with symptoms after travelling from the Chinese city of Wuhan to Guangzhou and then to Toronto on Wednesday.  Officials said he had limited external contact with people in Toronto when he arrived at his residence, before being taken by paramedics to hospital in stable condition. ""No one would be surprised if this is a positive case,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.  ""It appears that this may have arrived on our doorstep and we're ready.""  McGeer, who contracted SARS in 2003 while working as a physician on the front lines of the epidemic, says she believes the risk to the public with this case is low.  ""I'm not concerned about transmission from this case at all in Toronto,"" she said, adding that Toronto Public Health officials have already begun the process of contacting people who may have come in contact with the patient.   ""There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.""  McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.  There are two types of transmission with a coronavirus like this: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission,"" the World Health Organization in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said at a news conference Saturday that officials would be looking to identify passengers on the flight the patient took to Toronto who were within three rows for potential risk.  Bogoch said that while the suspected case is not unexpected, by no means does it indicate that there is a wider outbreak in Toronto.  ""I think that people should just go about their lives as they normally do,"" he said. ""But also be aware of the news and follow the situation closely as things change.""  Canada has already ruled out several suspected cases of the coronavirus in Quebec and Bogoch said that is an indication that the systems in place are working.  ""Thankfully, those weren't cases, but at least it demonstrated that people knew what to do and where to go if they had symptoms suggestive of infection with this coronavirus,"" he said. ""It almost was a bit of a test of the system.""  Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director for infection prevention control at Sunnybrook Hospital, said the patient was immediately isolated for further investigation, placed in a negative pressure room with protective equipment and was in stable condition.  Watch: How officials are dealing with public fear over coronavirus Bogoch said the work is not just being done inside the hospital, but preventing further transmission in the community and beyond.  ""This is one case, this is still an evolving situation and of course we might get additional cases as well,"" he said.  ""But we are prepared and the system appears to be working.""  We still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, which had a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""We are in a very, very different place than when we were responding to SARS,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, president of Public Health Ontario. ""One of the things that is very different is that we know what the virus is. We have a fast, reliable test and that really is a game changer."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the epidemic that killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003.  Compared with the 2003 SARS outbreak, the flow of information worldwide and speed at which diagnostic tests have been developed has improved dramatically.  ""The speed with which people identified SARS was amazing for 17 years ago, but it still took weeks,"" McGeer said. ""Here, the problem was recognized the last week of December, tests were available around the world 10 days later.""  Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. McGeer said health-care workers were ""unprepared to take precautions"" during the SARS epidemic due to a lack of diagnostic tests and experience with outbreaks. ""If you had told people before SARS that a new disease would emerge in China and cause outbreaks in Toronto, they would have laughed you out of the room,"" she said. ""And the situation now is very different. We know what these risks are. We know how they're going to come at us and what you've seen is the perfect example of that working.""  McGeer said the patient clearly received information that he needed to contact authorities when he had symptoms arise, which he did, and the sample was identified by officials within a day.  ""Everybody took the right precautions,"" she said. ""It's a world of difference.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-health-officials-reaction-1st-case-coronavirus-canada-1.5440803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-social-media-misinformation-1.5440334 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,N/A
663,Kate Kyle,2019-12-03T12:00:00.370Z,Adults in the N.W.T. can soon get diagnosed at a new FASD clinic,"Eric Wardell has long suspected he has Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), but he's never been diagnosed. The 51-year-old who lives in Yellowknife says he's been told by relatives his mother drank when he was in​​ the womb. ""Nobody understands me, nobody thinks I'm smart enough,"" said Wardell.  ""I know it's there ... I would like to hear it from someone else's perspective. 'This is what we know about it Eric,'"" he said about getting formally diagnosed. Now adults like Wardell, will soon have the option to get a clinical FASD diagnosis without leaving the Northwest Territories. The N.W.T's Health and Social Services Authority is launching the Adult FASD Diagnostic Clinic, which is expected to open in Yellowknife in February. For many decades, Wardell said he cycled in and out of jail and battled addictions.  ""I got ripped off in life. I didn't ask for this,"" said Wardell, who still struggles with managing his attention span and impulses, but he's learning to adapt.  He said getting a formal diagnosis could help him. ""I would love to see that."" FASD is a lifelong disability caused by exposure to alcohol before a baby is born. An FASD diagnostic clinic and support program for youth 17 years old and younger has been offered in Yellowknife for a decade, diagnosing roughly 100 people. Now, the Health Authority says it's important to help adults, too. ""We've missed a huge population of people,"" said Shawna Pound, the territory's adult FASD program co-ordinator. The territorial government has never studied how many people have FASD in the N.W.T. In Canada, the rate is about four per cent of the population, according to the Canada FASD Research Network. Rates are even higher in vulnerable populations. The N.W.T.'s new adult clinic, which will operate on a budget of $57,000 annually, aims to complete10 to 12 assessments next year. Referrals can come from Health and Social Services, government and non-government workers, family, even self-referrals. The diagnostic team includes neuropsychologists, speech and occupational therapists and a physician. Confirmation of the mother's use of alcohol is key for getting accepted into the clinic. Pound explained that this information can come from the mother, other relatives, or medical and court records. The assessment, which takes about three days, is confidential and examines the brain's 10 domains, including attention, memory, and reasoning.  Clients leave with a detailed picture of how their brain functions and tailored recommendations on how to best support them in their community. As a caregiver of young people with FASD, Yellowknife's Tammy Roberts sees the difference getting an FASD diagnosis can make. ""Being able to see the results from the testing as a caregiver is extremely important,"" said Roberts who has fostered many young people with FASD over the last 30 years. ""If I see the results from this showing that they have huge deficits in their memory, I'm going to put tools in place and supports in place ... instead of constantly struggling to get them to remember things,"" said Roberts. ""Any adult now [who] is not receiving support — I can imagine they would be struggling immensely,"" she said. Nearly a dozen people have been referred to the adult diagnostic clinic since September. The Health Authority isn't clear on how big the demand for the clinic will be. ""We are trying to make people as comfortable as possible,"" said Pound, the adult FASD program co-ordinator.  ""People seem to be very motivated to to find out why things might be a little bit more difficult for them in different areas,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/fasd-nwt-diagnostic-clinic-1.5381729,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jennifer-tourangeau-overcomes-1.3576267,N/A
664,Saša Petricic,2020-01-24T04:40:59.676Z,Beijing struggles to keep up with a virus  — and a nation on the move,"At Beijing's central railway station, the crowds stream in, ticket in hand, suitcase in tow, surgical mask in place. This last item has become an integral part of this year's Lunar New Year celebrations. ""I'm very worried about the virus,"" said Zhang Luyao, a twenty-something on her way home to China's north. ""It's spreading really fast, and there are so many people around me."" Indeed, tens of millions of people are on the move this week, travelling across China and abroad.  It's the largest annual human migration on earth. And this year, it may exacerbate a very human vulnerability: infection from the new strain of coronavirus, now potentially being spread by all the travellers.  On Wednesday, the Chinese National Health Commission underlined the ""risk of further spread of the epidemic"" by all the movement of people. The virus would have opportunities to infect many more people, through coughing, sneezing or breathing, said the Deputy Director of the Commission, Li Bin — and would alter and mutate. The new coronavirus likely came from wild animals, almost certainly transferring to humans at a wholesale seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. Many of those initially infected had been at the market, and the vast majority of confirmed cases now are still in Wuhan and the province around it, Hubei. In a dramatic move on Thursday, China effectively quarantined Wuhan, cutting air and rail service to the city of 11 million people and closing down public transit within it. A government edict said citizens should not leave Wuhan unless they had ""special conditions.""  The World Health Organization commended China for ""minimizing risks locally and abroad"" with the move. But is it too late? Infections have already been showing up in many parts of the country, from Beijing to Macau, Shanghai to Shenzhen. And abroad in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The first North American case is in Washington State, a man who recently travelled to China. The number of these cases has grown by hundreds this week, and some days, the deaths attributed to the virus has doubled. Unusually for China, the number of cases have all been announced in daily briefings and hourly updates, and carried in state media over the past days. Some people have been left reeling, feeling numb from the speed and scale of the outbreak — and helpless. Pang Zifen sat on a suitcase Wednesday in front of the Beijing railway station with her young son. Both wore masks.  ""We don't normally wear these,"" she said with a sigh, ""and I'm not sure how useful they are. But I want to protect my son and I just don't know what else to do.""  As the easiest form of protection, masks have been selling out at stores across China.  Still, there are those who don't believe they are being told the whole story. ""I don't that trust what I see,"" said He Wen, a 27 year-old traveller at the Shanghai railway station. ""I think the number of the infected could be far more than that reported."" Online, there's been anger as well, though censors have been removing many negative comments on China's controlled internet. One post under the name 'Phoenix' said ""hiding the virulence of the virus or the number of people infected is a cover-up! We must hold them accountable, no matter how high the responsibility goes."" There is reason for suspicion.  In 2002, when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared in China's southern Guangdong province, it took three months for state media to report on it. And even then, the message was to reassure people that it wasn't a serious problem.  Meanwhile, the country was dealing with more than 1,800 confirmed cases and close to 80 deaths. SARS went on to kill almost 800 people worldwide, with experts blaming China's slow response for making the problem worse. SARS is also a coronavirus, closely related to the new strain.  Beijing eventually admitted it was a mistake to try to hide the SARS outbreak, and China's Health Minister and the mayor of Beijing were removed from their positions. There was little news about the current coronavirus in its early days as well, until this week when Chinese state media reported that President Xi Jinping told his officials that ""people's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed."" Information began to flow. But so has China's mass migration. The crowds at the Beijing railway station are as big as ever. So is the demand for masks… and the sense of worry on the faces of those who wear them. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/beijing-struggles-keep-up-with-virus-1.5437234,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/china-chinese-new-year-winnipeg-coronavirus-1.5437059 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,N/A
665,Amina Zafar,2020-01-28T00:12:13.627Z,Coronavirus in Canada: What are the next steps to contain the disease here?,"Canada's second presumptive case of coronavirus has been identified. On Monday morning, health officials announced the wife of a man who had travelled to Wuhan in China and was being treated at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is presumed to have the virus. ""Since arriving in Toronto with her husband, this individual has been in self-isolation,"" said a statement issued by Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.  ""We are working alongside Toronto Public Health, who has been in regular contact with the individual during their self-isolation period,"" said Williams. ""Given the fact that she has been in self-isolation, the risk to Ontarians remains low."" The first patient, announced on Saturday and who has since been confirmed to have the virus, is a man in his 50s and is currently in stable condition at Sunnybrook.  Watch | The National looks at what is known so far about Canada's 1st presumed coronavirus case: His wife, whose case remains ""presumptive"" until test results are confirmed by the National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg, is at home and not in hospital, a provincial health official told CBC News.  ""As we understand it, her case isn't as severe as her husband's and isn't in need of hospital care,"" the official said.  The next steps for Canada's coronavirus patients include two weeks of monitoring in isolation and quarantine for those who've been in close contact with them, infectious disease physicians say. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Monday that when a new virus first emerges, a second sample is sent for testing ""so that we can provide quality assurance and standardize those tests."" While standardization is important, she said, ""Ontario will act based on their test results. So they're not waiting until the Winnipeg test comes back to actually manage people from a clinical perspective or contact tracing so everything like that happens when Ontario has got that positive."" On Saturday, Tam said the man who became Canada's first case showed mild symptoms on a flight from Guangzhou to Toronto. Tam said the latest scientific data suggests that people transmit the virus when they're in close contact with others. ""It's really fellow travellers or family members travelling with a patient that are [at the highest risk],"" Tam told a news conference on Sunday. Toronto Public Health officials will provide travellers who were within a two-metre radius of the patient on the plane with information.   Tam said airline staff who may have served the man will also be informed. ""What I would like to emphasize is that for other people on the flight, or in the airport or not in close contact with the patient, is that they should not be overly concerned,"" Tam said. CBC News spoke to a passenger who said he was on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311, which took off on Tuesday to Toronto from Guangzhou. Despite Tam's reassurance, the passenger from Toronto, who didn't want to be identified because of the stigma associated with the coronavirus, said he was going to self-quarantine on his own initiative for two weeks. ""I am worried,"" he wrote to CBC News on Chinese microblogging site Weibo. ""I am worried for me and my family."" The risk of outbreak in Canada remains low, Tam said in reiterating that if someone has travelled to the affected area in Wuhan and has fever or flu-like symptoms, they should call a doctor. China's health minister said the transmissibility of the virus ""shows signs of increasing.""  Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor in the department of medicine at the University of Toronto who studies infectious diseases with a focus on antimicrobial stewardship at Sinai Health System, said he's concerned about how the Canadian public could respond to China's health ministry information on how people might be infectious when not showing symptoms. In China, officials strive for people to self-quarantine based on exposure to a high-risk place such as the live-animal market in Wuhan or being in close contact with someone known to be infected. ""What they're trying to do [in China] is tell people you can't just go by your symptoms,"" Morris said. ""If you've got an exposure history risk then you may be contagious even though you don't have symptoms. That may be wise especially where the prevalence of the disease is high. ""I don't think it's applicability is there for … many of the other countries in the world, including Canada."" Morris said he's telling family and friends outside of health-care settings in Canada they don't need to do anything differently. In the U.S., Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said to expect more cases to be reported in the U.S. in the coming days. Like Tam, she described the risk to the public as ""low at this time."" ""We need to be preparing as if this is a pandemic, but I continue to hope that it is not,"" Messonnier told reporters. Dr. Jerome Leis of Sunnybrook said day-to-day business at the hospital continues as normal. ""It is not affecting the care we provide for all of our other patients."" Since there are no specific treatments for the virus, currently known in scientific circles as 2019-nCoV, the man will receive supportive care to relieve symptoms, Morris said. The patient will be kept in isolation until infectious disease physicians consider the risk to the general public negligible, Morris said. Before that, they may conduct virus studies to check that he is no longer contagious. ""He's been rapidly processed, appropriately processed and the degree of risk reduction has really been quite impressive,"" Morris said. ""If you think of what it's like today compared to how we were 17 years ago with SARS, that change is dramatic and hopefully that's going to substantially reduce the risk to the public."" Paramedics who transported the patient wore protective equipment such as masks. At the hospital, the patient was put in special isolation in a negative pressure room with a vacuum to suck all of the air out and filter out any infectious particles. Standard public health protocols include tracing ""close contacts"" of a patient with the virus, such as those living with the sick person. In Canada, close contacts are asked to self-isolate at home so public health officials can observe if they get symptoms or not. According to the CDC, people who have ""casual contact,"" such as going to the same grocery store, ""are at minimal risk for developing infection.""

Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Board of Health, says he has ""full confidence"" in the city's Medical Officer of Health and the Toronto Public Health team, and will continue to work closely with them to ensure the public remains protected and informed. ""While I understand that this news may cause some fear and concern for Torontonians, it is important to know that we have a strong and capable public health system in place for just this reason, and the risk of contracting the virus in Toronto remains low,"" Cressy said in a statement. ""Toronto Public Health has a strong and experienced communicable disease surveillance program. They do this work each and every day."" Public health officials announced Saturday afternoon that a man in his 50s who had travelled to Wuhan, China, became ""quite ill"" within a day of arriving in Toronto. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and placed in isolation. Watch | Health officials outline how Canada is responding to the coronavirus: On Sunday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer said the man, who remains hospitalized, is currently in stable condition.  Tam said authorities are now working to help track some of his fellow passengers, but said the case demonstrates that the country's public health protocols are working. She said federal authorities, together with Toronto Public Health, are in the process of reaching out to those who were within a two-metre radius to the man to ensure they know what to do if they become ill. ""The patient has been managed with all appropriate infection and prevention control protocols, so the risk of onward spread in Canada is low,"" Tam said at a morning news conference in Ottawa. ""The TPH team is working with the affected individual and their health-care team to follow up with all known contacts who may have been exposed to the virus,"" Cressy said.  ""TPH is co-ordinating closely with provincial and national health agencies, hospitals, airports, and community agencies."" CBC News spoke to a passenger who said he was on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311, which took off on Tuesday to Toronto from Guangzhou. ""I am worried,"" he wrote to CBC News on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo. ""I am worried for me and my family."" The man from Toronto, who did not want to be identified because of the stigma associated with the coronavirus, said he was returning to Canada after visiting family in Guangzhou for the last few weeks. He did not visit Wuhan. He said he hasn't exhibited any symptoms of the coronavirus. He said he called Public Health Ontario Sunday morning after reading on social media that he might have been on the same flight as the patient. ""I didn't know what I should do,"" he said. Health officials told him the risk to Canadians remains low. He was told to continue to follow the usual health precautions and to seek medical care if he starts developing symptoms. Still, he said he's going to ""self-quarantine"" and will refrain from going out in public for the next two weeks. Messages suggesting that CZ311 passengers should isolate themselves began popping up on Chinese social media on Saturday night, shortly after Ontario confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto. The messages have since been shared thousands of times in the last 24 hours. Romeo Lian says he returned to Toronto from Shanghai a week ago and he was back at Toronto's Pearson Airport on Sunday to meet his wife who's also arriving from the Chinese city. Shanghai is more than 800 kilometres from Wuhan. Lian, who was wearing a mask, says he is taking precautions to protect himself and others. ""This is a public area. If I carry the virus, I don't want to spread it to other people,"" Lian told CBC News. He also believes health authorities should reach out to everyone who was on the flight with the infected man. ""I think they should contact everybody [on] the flight. Everyone, because you know the [aircraft] has the airflow … so it's very dangerous."" Meanwhile, Mayor John Tory said the city's frontline health-care workers are the best in the world and have procedures in place to keep people safe. ""While we now have one presumptive confirmed case, our health officials are clear that the risk to residents continues to remain low,"" Tory said. ""Toronto Public Health is continuing to work closely with provincial and federal health colleagues to actively monitor the situation and respond as appropriate."" In Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, Mayor Frank Scarpitti called on the federal government to implement additional and advanced screening and detection measures at Canada's airports, including Pearson International Airport.  Scarpitti said with the confirmation of a case of coronavirus in Toronto, there is ""heightened concern and anxiety"" in Markham, which he describes as ""Canada's most diverse community."" ""The current measures introduced are less stringent than at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms,"" Scarpitti said in a statement.

Construction on the house — the first build Habitat for Humanity has done on Lennox Island — began Monday, as part of an international volunteer program called Global Village.  ""We're building a three-bedroom house,"" said Jamie MacKay, construction manager of Habitat for Humanity P.E.I. ""It's been great. Everybody's been super easy to work with. Everybody's having fun and we're making a lot of progress."" Habitat usually focuses on building homes for families, particularly those with young children. The home, located on Oapos Trail, is being built for a single mother of two.  Volunteers like Sarah Anderson Austin travelled from all over North America to be part of the project. ""It's just such an amazing experience,"" Anderson Austin said. ""It's hard to kind of put into words when you come on to a site and again there's nothing there and then we're on Wednesday ... and we've got the framing done and there is a roof up and it's actually starting to look like a house.""

668,Mark Gollom,2019-05-21T19:38:11.107Z,Abortion barriers in Canada are back in spotlight following passage of abortion bans in U.S.,"While abortion remains legal in Canada, some abortion rights advocates say women continue to face hurdles in accessing the procedure. Funding, distance to medical facilities and a patchwork of provincial laws all mean an abortion is not as easy to obtain in Canada as some may think. ""People often conflate the two, thinking that because it's decriminalized, it's very easy to access in our country — and it's not the case,"" said Frédérique Chabot, director of health promotion at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights.  ""There's been very little progress done to make sure that abortion is actually, in fact, accessible to everyone in Canada equally."" The controversial issue has gained renewed focus following the passage of abortion bans in the U.S.  Several states have in the last year passed so-called heartbeat bills, which ban abortion as soon as a heartbeat can be detected — which could be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Just this week, Alabama made it illegal for doctors to perform abortions. None have taken effect yet, and they're expected to be tied up in legal wrangling for a while. But they could make their way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where anti-abortion activists hope the new conservative majority might be inclined to overturn or drastically diminish the court's landmark abortion-rights precedent set in the Roe vs. Wade case in 1973. Meanwhile in Canada, federal Liberals have accused the Conservatives of wanting to reopen the abortion debate — something party leader Andrew Scheer has insisted he will not do.  Abortion has been legal in Canada since 1988 when the Supreme Court of Canada struck down laws against it. But for women living outside of big urban centres like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, accessing the procedure ""becomes really tricky,"" Chabot said.  Some of those barriers include funding. Under the Canada Health Act, abortion services are insured in all provinces and territories. But some provinces have placed limits on funding for the procedure.  Ontario does not fund abortions at every clinic, while New Brunswick does not fund abortions at clinics at all, only in hospitals. In its 2016-2017 annual report, Health Canada said New Brunswick's lack of coverage ""remains a concern."" The Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada (ARCC) says that's not good enough. In its interpretation of the Canada Health Act, abortion services across the country must be fully funded. And in the case of New Brunswick, the ""federal government has failed to penalize the province by withholding transfer payments."" Distance to abortion services can also be a barrier. In many remote communities, specifically northern communities, there are no abortion clinics in town and no hospitals that perform the procedure. ""So that imposes significant travel costs, you know, loss of work time, for women to get to a place where they can actually access it,"" said Karen Segal, staff lawyer for the the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF). In some regions, she said, there are only a couple of points of access. For example, in Alberta there are only two clinics: one in Edmonton and one in Calgary.  Requirements for a hospital abortion also differ across jurisdictions; provinces enforce their own health care legislation, which could include requiring a doctor's referral or gestational limits. Hospitals also often have long waiting lists. Prince Edward Island was the last holdout, refusing to provide any abortion service on the island until, following a long legal battle, the province agreed in 2016 to open an abortion clinic. Before that, women had to travel to Halifax or Moncton, N.B., with the province paying medical costs, but not travel expenses. P.E.I. restricts medical abortions to the first nine weeks of pregnancy and surgical abortions to 12 weeks and six days, though women still have the option of a later abortion by travelling to another province. ""What we've heard anecdotally is that their wait lists are so long,"" Segal said. ""Women face wait lists of five, six weeks — which, if you don't know you're pregnant right away, can mean that by the time you have your appointment, you're ineligible for abortion in the province."" Segal acknowledged that access to medical care in general can be a challenge for those living in rural and northern communities. But she believes the lack of access to abortion reflects, at least in part, an ideological opposition.  If a medical practitioner has a religious objection to providing abortion, they don't have to carry it out. So, for example, a doctor may be willing and capable of providing an abortion at a local hospital, but an anaesthetist may have a conscientious objection and refuse to assist. ""So, practically speaking, it's very hard to actually do it, because the staff don't agree and won't participate in providing the service,"" Segal said.  Other anti-abortion doctors have refused to make referrals for a doctor who will provide an abortion. But the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled just this week that doctors in the province must give referrals for medical services that clash with their religious beliefs, including abortion. Nova Scotia has found its own way around reluctant doctors. Instead of a referral, women can call an access-to-abortion helpline that's run by the provincial health-care system. Sarah Baddeley, chair of the Halifax chapter of LEAF, told CBC Radio's Information Morning that there has been some improvement in the region when it comes to access, thanks to the helpline and other changes, like better access to ultrasounds and dropping the mandatory requirement to have an ultrasound. Meanwhile, the availability of Mifegymiso — the so-called abortion pill that was first made commercially available in Canada in 2017 — has also helped with access issues, Chabot said. The drug can be taken up to nine weeks into a pregnancy, and Health Canada recently dropped a requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before being prescribed Mifegymiso. ""That means that people might not have to leave their communities to get an abortion and it's starting to be realized,"" Chabot said. But Chabot said that Saskatchewan and Manitoba remain the only two provinces that do not provide universal coverage for the pill. As well, many pharmacies across Saskatchewan do not stock the drug.  In Manitoba, women can get the abortion pill for free at three health centres, otherwise they must cover the cost — around $350 — themselves.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/abortion-access-canada-us-bans-1.5140345,https://www.cbc.ca/1.5138398 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/alabama-anti-abortion-legislation-part-of-wave-of-state-bills-attacking-roe-vs-wade-1.5136001 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/heartbeat-abortion-bans-u-s-south-midwest-georgia-1.5132717 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-abortion-rights-1.5138417 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/andrew-scheer-trudeau-abortion-alabama-1.5140900,N/A
669,Shane Magee,2019-02-12T14:26:43.553Z,Moncton Magic attendance climbs after worries about move to Avenir Centre,"   Attendance at Moncton Magic basketball games is almost 30 per cent higher for home games halfway through the team's first season at the Avenir Centre compared to last season at the Coliseum. The National Basketball League of Canada team has averaged 1,221 fans over its last 11 home games, according to league data. That's compared to an average of 954 over the same period last season. A Sunday game against the Saint John Riptide saw 1,964 attend, setting a record for the team at the Avenir Centre.  Deputy Mayor Greg Turner is a season ticket holder and regularly attends Magic games.  ""I've seen the crowd dwindle some nights and be really strong other nights,"" Turner said. ""Not consistently good, but obviously this weekend was the highlight."" He said weeknight games have had weaker attendance, with figures dropping below 1,000 for such games in November and January.  The rise in average attendance comes in a year the team feared for its financial stability during the move to the new venue. If the team doesn't hit revenue targets, it could receive a subsidy from the City of Moncton.  The team forecast revenue of $644,682 this season had it remained at the Coliseum, according to figures provided to city council last August. The team slashed that to $310,897, with projected declines in revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, concession and merchandise at the Avenir Centre. City council voted 9-2 to cover the potential shortfall. The team did not provide an interview. It's not clear whether any of that funding will be required, which would only be provided at the end of the season after the city reviews the team's finances. Turner said councillors have not been given an update on whether city funding may be required. Isabelle LeBlanc, a spokesperson for Moncton, said in an emailed statement the city is pleased with the attendance numbers. She said the funding agreement requires updates throughout the season and is based on overall revenue to the team, not an attendance range. Any payment would be determined at the end of the season once further information is received from the team about how much ""the team would be able to receive."" Mike Storey, the team's vice-president of operations, told reporters last August that it would be a challenge to fill seats at the new venue. ""We have to quickly find a way to get more people in that building,"" he said at the time. Asked how many people would have to attend games, he said the team projected it would need about 2,000 to ""poke its head above water."" The team has eight more regular-season home games left to play. It sits atop the league in points, with 17 wins and eight losses.  Audley Stephenson, the deputy commissioner of the National Basketball League of Canada, said he's pleased to see what's happening in Moncton.  ""They're charting for growth,"" he said. ""We're not seeing this number as a ceiling … as long as they continue to be successful on the court, that will certainly help at the gate."" Though each market varies, he said the average attendance isn't far off figures for other teams.  The Magic, a new organization with different owners, replaced the Moncton Miracles before the 2017-18 season.

671,Anonymous,2020-01-27T01:31:13.837Z,"China says death toll from coronavirus now 80, warns its ability to spread 'increasing'","The death toll from China's new coronavirus grew to 80 on Monday as residents of Hubei province, where the disease originated, were banned from entering Hong Kong amid global efforts to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak. The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed from 56 to 76 overnight, health commission officials said, with four deaths elsewhere in the country. The total number of confirmed cases in China had risen to 2,744. China's cabinet said it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Hubei city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is already under virtual lockdown, with severe restrictions on movement in place in several other Chinese cities. Beijing has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. The virus, believed to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has already spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The World Health Organization (WHO) last week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus. ""My @WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak,"" he said on Twitter. Watch: Coronavirus misinformation | The Weekly with Wendy Mesley Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has six confirmed cases and said it would ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days. The ban does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts. France, Italy, Japan and the United States all said they were working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan. France said it expected to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area. Evacuees would have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France. Hubei's governor, Wang Xiaodong, said at a news conference on Sunday he felt ""agonized"" and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight. News of the press conference sparked anger on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, although social media platforms in China usually delete such sensitive content. ""He thinks one sentence of apology will be enough to solve the problem? Let's await the judgment of the people of the country,"" one user posted. China's health minister has indicated the ability of a new strain of coronavirus to spread in his country is getting stronger and the number of infections could continue to rise. Ma Xiaowei spoke Sunday after China released new figures showing the death toll from the virus. ""The transmissibility shows signs of increasing and the 'walking source of infection' [where patients have few signs of disease] has made it difficult to control and prevent the disease. ""For this new coronavirus we have not identified the source of the infection and we are not clear about the risk of its mutation and how it spreads. Since this is a new coronavirus there might be some changes in the coming days and weeks, and the danger it poses to people of different ages is also changing,"" he said. The minister declined to estimate how long it would take to bring the situation under control, but said travel restrictions and other strict measures should bring results ""at the lowest cost and fastest speed."" The U.S. has five confirmed cases, all among people who travelled to Wuhan, health officials said Sunday. Two new cases were reported Sunday — one in Los Angeles County in California and the other in Maricopa County, Ariz. The latter case was someone with ties to Arizona State University who did not live in school housing, state health officials said. The three previously reported cases were a patient in Orange County, California; a man in his 30s in Washington state; and a woman in her 60s from Chicago. The U.S. patients generally have been reported to be in good condition and were hospitalized in isolation for monitoring. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects many more Americans to be diagnosed with the newly discovered virus, which is believed to have an incubation period of about two weeks, as worldwide the number of confirmed cases nears 2,000. The CDC is screening passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan at five major airports in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. CDC officials noted Sunday that more than two dozen people who had been suspected of having the illness ended up testing negative.

672,Anonymous,2019-11-11T09:00:00.446Z,Why this N.WT. woman sees being an elder as the 'highest honour',"CBC Saskatchewan, CBC Manitoba and CBC North embarked on a months-long project to speak with elders, elders-in-training and youth from across their vast territories to learn how these knowledge keepers view their role today — and why they're more critical than ever before. Read other stories from the Walking With Elders series. Margaret Leishman is an elder living in Kakisa, N.W.T. She speaks Dene Zhatié, one of five Dene languages in the N.W.T., and is well-respected across the territory. This is a transcript of an interview she did with CBC North. It has been edited for length and clarity. To be an elder is to be a role model. I think that I've done that all my life — you know, to have lived your life and that you have to follow the protocols of your people right throughout. You become a teacher and a professor, so that you give back to your people.  For me, I never had grandparents because they died in the big flu up north here. So any elder that I saw in my life, I went to them, and that's why I gained my knowledge. An elder is a holder of all the traditional knowledge and wisdom, and they have so much information. That's what I see in the elder — also to be a well-balanced individual, meaning to live a good life, healthy life. That way, a lot of your teachings will apply. To be an elder is a privilege and an honour — the highest honour.  I was given crow boot moccasins for my birthday this year from a friend in Inuvik and the embroidery was done by a woman from Fort McPherson. Beautiful, you know, and that's honouring me as an elder. My mom used to say, to be an elder, to live a full cycle, means that you are only given a one-time privilege on this Earth — to live it. But she said if your life is taken ahead of time, you will come back to finish it, because you're placed on this Earth for a special reason. She lived to be 105, my mom. So for me, she has done her job well on this Earth and is only given one time to come. So those kind of teachings we have as elders. Today we live in a really complicated world. Youth need more contact with elders. A long time ago, visiting was one of the things that we did. We always serviced our elders in the community and looked after them. And the reward is that, in exchange, they told us stories. I would like that to happen again today. Just go visit an elder, see if there's anything you could do to help. Elders, they don't know about technology. And I think it's really good for youth to help them learn how to even use a cellphone or even making a call for them. I would like the youth to attend meetings — as many as possible — so that they know about the language. You know it's not just the language. It's our way of life. There's so much that goes into a language when you speak.  I just don't speak for the sake of speaking Dene Zhatié. Everything is, 'I'm giving it to you, to give you a better understanding and awareness.' And people don't know that. They just speak without thinking.  I would like to go back to the old way of communication. And it's really good for the youth to know that now, too, because you know that would make their lives a lot easier too. And especially being who they are. The identities are important. It's very important.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/elder-meaning-margaret-leishman-1.5318133,https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/cambridge-bay-elders-annanas-camp https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/letter-to-grandchildren-elders-screen-1.5344577 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/syllabic-dictionary-nelson-house-1.5350905,N/A
673,Priscilla Hwang,2019-02-26T03:07:48.446Z,"Pap smears, STIs and flu: What the N.W.T. gov't didn't tell you about a stolen laptop","This story is Part 1 of 3 on the stolen laptop files.  The number of people whose personal health information was put at risk after a laptop was stolen last year is much higher than the N.W.T. government initially reported, and the data breach affects people from every province and territory in Canada, according to internal documents obtained by CBC News. Last May, a laptop belonging to an employee with the territory's Department of Health and Social Services was stolen from a locked vehicle during a business trip in Ottawa. The laptop — used to do statistical analysis — was unencrypted but had a strong password, the Health Department said in announcing the breach last summer. It contained health data for a majority of N.W.T. residents. The N.W.T. government, which has a long history of health data breaches, has been silent about the stolen laptop since the public announcement in late June — more than six weeks after the theft. One other health data breach has happened since. A health department spokesperson declined CBC's request for an interview. The department launched an internal investigation after the laptop theft, which is also being reviewed by the territory's privacy commissioner. The N.W.T. privacy commissioner told CBC she recently received the department's report and aims to complete her own investigation by May. But documents reveal key updates and unreported details about the privacy breach. The information is contained in more than 350 pages of internal government emails and documents obtained by CBC through the Access to Information and Privacy Act. They date from May 9 — the day of the theft — to July 17, 2018, and suggest the laptop contained health data from as far back as 2009. ""We have no way to isolate what data was lost [or was] vulnerable to the breach or who were the subjects of the data,"" the chief health privacy officer said in an email on June 19. The department later relied on the employee's memory of all potential datasets that may be on the laptop, to do their analysis. Here's what the documents further reveal: Less than a week after alerting the public in late June, the Health Department found that 39,145 N.W.T. residents could be affected by the breach — up from the 33,661 figure that was publicly reported. Counting non-residents and unidentified individuals, the total number of people potentially affected exceeds 40,000. The N.W.T. has a population of about 41,800 people, according to 2016 census data. The increase was due to finding information that was previously missed, the department said in the documents. The department also said that upon further analysis, the risk of identity theft ""significantly decreased."" About 47 per cent of N.W.T. residents whose information was contained in the datasets are at ""no risk"" of identity theft, according to the documents, as they were just identified by health-card numbers. But the remaining 53 per cent could be at risk because their names, dates of birth and/or health-card numbers were stored on the laptop. The documents also reveal that information about specific diseases, tests and vaccinations was potentially stored on the laptop. More than 50 per cent of all the records for N.W.T residents were in a tuberculosis surveillance dataset. With duplicates removed, the second highest number of records were for flu vaccinations. Thousands of other records were related to HPV vaccinations, C. difficile (colon infections), pap smears, whooping cough, blood tests for tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections and antibiotic-resistant diseases, among others. Other information potentially on the laptop included: ethnicity, X-ray results, history of sexual partners, dates of death and ""risk status."" The internal documents say the tuberculosis blood test data was definitely on the laptop, while other data are categorized as ""very likely"" or ""likely"" to be on the laptop. In their initial report to the department, the employee who lost the laptop listed the names of the sources, or information systems, used to extract datasets that ""may have still been stored"" on the laptop. Among the systems listed is the Health Management Information System (HMIS), ""which includes demographic information on 100 per cent of N.W.T. residents,"" according to the documents. The documents note that HMIS is regularly updated and is ""the most up-to-date source"" for residents' names, dates of birth, communities of residence, sex, health-card numbers and ""other important indicators."" It's unclear whether HMIS was on the laptop, as the employee suggested they ""rarely"" worked with the system. At the end of their report, the employee reiterated: ""I cannot with absolute certainty rule in or out the complete list of files absolutely on or not on the [laptop] at the time of the theft."" Information on at least 257 people from every other province and territory was also stored in datasets on the laptop, according to the documents. Most of the non-N.W.T. residents potentially affected by the breach — 71 people — came from Alberta. The fewest, two, came from P.E.I. These people could have been visitors to the N.W.T., short-term workers or residents who recently moved, according to the Health Department. Here's the full breakdown by jurisdiction: The documents also note there are 634 records with errors or that are missing identifiers. Ottawa police did not formally investigate the theft, according to internal emails, as there was no video footage available from the area where the car was parked. ""Apparently the City of Ottawa police department receives in excess of 100 theft reports weekly … in the ByWard Market region,"" the employee said in one email. They say a constable told them the laptop was ""likely sold for a small sum"" and was ""likely wiped clean."" ""No investigation was assigned,"" states an internal email. ""With no leads, the case has been closed."" Part 2 of this series looks at details on the night the laptop was stolen, and whether the health department has adequate security training. The third story looks at why an unencrypted laptop was being used by health department staff. Do you have any stories or tips about health information breaches in the N.W.T.?

674,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-27T10:00:00.524Z,N.S. premier calls doctor licensing rules 'disheartening',"Nova Scotia's premier says the colleges that regulate physicians need to modernize and be more flexible if they want to make patient care a priority and keep more doctors in the province. Stephen McNeil made the comments after reading a CBC News report about Dr. Ajiri Ikede. The physician, who is from Prince Edward Island and currently works in Ontario, is giving up his licence to work in Nova Scotia. He's frustrated by the way the College of Physicians and Surgeons issues a late fee before a medical licence expires. He pointed out that Nova Scotia's college is just one of two in Canada that charges fees this way, and it collected nearly $50,000 because of the rule. This year, about 100 physicians incurred the $487 fine. McNeil says that is just one more example of why the college needs to be flexible. ""The public out there would believe its government is the roadblock here,"" he said. ""It's not government. This is the College of Physicians that needs to make it easy for anyone who has been registered in Nova Scotia to stay registered."" While the college did not respond for a followup request for comment, it told CBC previously that the late fees are important to ensure no licences expire. It had repeatedly reached out to Ikede to remind him that a deadline was approaching. If a licence expires, the doctors cannot work. The college pointed out that patients would have been affected. But McNeil says the college needs to take down barriers that push competent doctors away.  ""It's disheartening and it's exactly the challenge that we, as a government, are facing,"" McNeil said of Ikede's frustrations. ""I think we all, including the college, should stay focused on this is about access to primary care."" Each college is independent and McNeil has no power to order changes. He has, however, long advocated for a national college, with the same fees and rules for every province. He suggests provincial chapters could continue to address complaints and monitor physicians.  ""In my view, if everyone truly comes together, it doesn't need to take five years."" Under the current system, physicians have to have their credentials checked and pay for licences in every province where they want to work. The cost of the licence varies dramatically. New Brunswick, for example, charges $600 year. Nova Scotia charges $1,950. ""I think the colleges have to explain to their members why one is charging that fee and, in another province, they're charging much less,"" he said. McNeil believes Nova Scotia's physician shortages could be eased if more physicians from outside the province had the ability do locum work, which is essentially being a substitute. ""What I would argue — and I share the frustration that you hear in the public — is that I don't believe these organizations have modernized themselves to the mobility of its own client,"" he said. While a national registry is his ultimate goal, McNeil has spent the last few years pushing for the creation of an Atlantic agreement. It would allow physicians to share a registry in the Atlantic provinces. ""There's ongoing conversations about it. And my understanding is that there's been progress made on at this point. But we're still a ways away from any kind of announcement around that."" Doctors Nova Scotia is also on board with McNeil's efforts for an Atlantic, or even national licence. ""This was on our agenda,"" said Nancy MacCready-Williams, the organization's CEO. ""This is part of the administrative burden. If they want to practise in any of our neighbouring provinces, they have to go through that licensing process, which we know is a fairly comprehensive process."" She said she hasn't heard any pushback from the colleges on the proposal. ""I do know that the colleges are working on this. We're hopeful this will come to pass."" She has also heard complaints behind the scenes about late fees, but she directs those complaints to the Nova Scotia college.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-premier-modernize-doctor-licensing-rules-1.5441127,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/connaught-halifax-shooting-man-seriously-injured-1.5441377 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fasd-support-families-diagnosis-treatment-1.5438348 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-woman-at-centre-of-flawed-rape-investigation-files-lawsuit-1.5439077 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rewards-major-unsolved-crimes-cold-cases-nova-scotia-1.5437685 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-power-customers-storm-outages-reason-winds-1.5440084,N/A
675,"Robyn Simon, Emma Smith",2020-01-27T10:00:00.244Z,Advocates seek more support for people struggling with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,"Vicky Morinville's daughter has been called lazy and difficult because she was born with a disability that's largely misunderstood and hard to diagnose. An estimated four per cent of Canadians have fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), more than autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy combined, according to a national research network. FASD is a prenatal brain injury that can occur when a fetus is exposed to alcohol. It can take decades to get a diagnosis, and parents and advocates say finding support is a struggle in Nova Scotia where there's no dedicated FASD clinic, unlike some other provinces. ""These children will end up homeless or in the criminal justice system where they don't belong because these families can't access and can't advocate for other resources to help their children,"" Morinville, who lives in Cole Harbour, N.S., told CBC's Information Morning.  For Morinville's daughter, who is adopted, the signs were noticeable early on. At four months, she was having trouble turning her head, making eye contact and settling down, and was officially diagnosed at age two. She is now an adult living the care of the province. Morinville said many of the resources that are available for young children with FASD fade away once they enter school. ""It's a lot of times left up to the learning centre teacher or classroom teachers, and these teachers have enough on their plates without trying to deal with these issues as well,"" said Morinville, who has two other adopted children with the same disorder. As a child, Francis Perry was always getting into trouble but didn't know why. He recalls sitting in classrooms and being distracted by the persistent hum of the lights above his head. ""When I was trying to pay attention to what the teacher was telling me, it was like Charlie Brown's teacher,"" said Perry, who grew up in Barrington, N.S. ""So I'd just [be] looking at her lips moving and listening to the hum of the florescent light bulbs."" When Perry was 19 he finally got an answer. He was diagnosed with FASD at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, which felt ""like someone had lifted a huge weight off my shoulder."" But he soon realized there were few places in the province he could go to for help.  ""It would be nice to see some kind of drop-in centre where parents could go with their children, and to spend the day with ... someone specialized in just fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,"" said the 47-year-old who now travels across Canada sharing his story.  People are affected differently depending on where they fall are on the spectrum, according to Audrey McFarlane, executive director of the Canada Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Research Network. They might have trouble with impulse control, difficulty making good decisions, have trouble remembering or be easily manipulated, she said.  Rates of the disorder are higher in vulnerable populations, including children in welfare or foster care. Robert McInerney, a neuropsychologist with a private practice in Halifax, said apart from the IWK Health Centre, he's the only health professional in Nova Scotia who diagnoses the disorder.  That means his waiting list is growing. ""We need to be thinking more about this disorder and realizing that it affects far more people than previously thought,"" he said. McInerney said children are often believed to have autism or behavioural problems when FASD is the actual culprit. ""Treatment for FASD doesn't need to be magical or mystical, but it needs to be practical,"" he said. ""It needs to see the issues for what they are and tackle those issues head on."" Nova Scotia is not part of the national network, a member-based group that provinces pay a small fee to join. McFarlane said her group has written to the provincial government asking them to join, but is always turned down. ""Other provinces have dedicated funds and policy and services for this population both on the prevention side and on the service delivery side,"" McFarlane said, pointing to New Brunswick, which has a dedicated centre for FASD.  The Department of Health and Wellness said diagnostic and treatment resources do exist at the IWK, in public schools and through government services. ""Children suspected of having fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are referred to the IWK's Developmental Pediatrics Clinic for assessment that can involve a multi-disciplinary team including a developmental pediatrician, developmental clinic nurse, a neuropsychologist and an occupational therapist,"" spokesperson Heather Fairbairn said in an email to CBC News.  Fairbairn said supports are also available to children before they enter school through Nova Scotia's Early Childhood Development Intervention Services, and that the province provides education about the risks of FASD through the Nova Scotia Health Authority and online.  Still, families and advocates say because FASD can be so hard to diagnose, what's really needed is a dedicated clinic. McInerney said more education is also needed so that people realize the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. But he's quick to add that all of the parents he's worked with over the years had no intention of harming their babies. He believes the stigma surrounding FASD is stopping people from getting the help they need.  ""It drives the issue almost underground,"" he said. ""People don't want to talk about it.""

676,Anonymous,2020-01-24T14:59:38.224Z,Microgrids: An idea whose time has come?,"Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.) This week: As the global population grows, so does the demand for electricity. But there are challenges, even now. More than a billion people around the world don't have access to power grids. According to the Canada Energy Regulator, 200,000 people in Canada are not connected to the North American electrical grid and natural gas distribution pipeline systems.  We're also seeing natural disasters and major weather events disrupt power supply, causing mass blackouts for days at a time. And when one part of the transmission system breaks down, it can paralyze the whole grid. Enter the microgrid. A concept that's been growing in popularity, it's a power system that can operate independently or work in connection with bigger grids.  A microgrid ""contains everything that it needs to provide power to a community,"" said Lynn Côté, cleantech lead at Export Development Canada. ""You're not building a system for a million people. You're building a system for maybe a thousand people, 500, maybe 250."" Big electrical grids connect buildings to central power sources, such as coal, nuclear and gas plants. When main components stop working, everything can be affected.  A microgrid operates as an island, which can be beneficial during times of crises like storms or outages (or for other reasons). Many are powered by a mix of renewable energy and batteries, with natural gas for backup. Microgrid power isn't necessarily more reliable, but in communities far from a larger power source, microgrids can alleviate complications because the electricity is stored, owned and controlled locally. One of the older examples is a microgrid built more than a decade ago in Sendai, Japan, which is powered by a mix of solar, gas and battery. According to Berkeley Lab, which does research on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, during blackouts caused by the 2011 tsunami and earthquake, the microgrid in Sendai provided power and heat to the teaching hospital of Tohoku Fukushi University.  ""Widespread power outages cause a lot of social and economic damage and destruction. And the climate crisis is making all of this worse,"" said Jana Ganion, energy director for Blue Lake Rancheria, an Indigenous reserve in California that launched a solar microgrid in 2015. Millions of people in California had their power shut off last fall because of wildfire risk. Meanwhile, the Blue Lake Rancheria microgrid provided electricity to thousands nearby. Setting up a microgrid can be an expensive undertaking, especially in dense urban or suburban areas with existing infrastructure. Consumers typically stick with what works, said Côté, and for the majority of Canadians, that means hydroelectric power (nuclear and coal are the next-biggest power sources). ""It's really hard for certain countries to raise the kind of capital you need [to build a power plant],"" said Côté, who has researched microgrids in remote Canadian communities. She said the ""autonomy"" a microgrid provides ""is really important.""  There are nearly 300 remote communities across Canada, many of which rely on diesel-powered microgrids for electricity generation. Over the last decade, the federal government has worked with regional entities to create greener options.  In August, Gull Bay First Nation, north of Thunder Bay, Ont., co-developed a community microgrid that uses solar, battery storage and automated control technology to help reduce diesel use, according to Ontario Power Generation. It's the first of its kind in Canada. Côté said that in addition to making remote areas more self-sufficient, microgrids could help communities access clean drinking water by providing the power to treat it.  — Isabel Terrell Our story on e-bikes from a couple of weeks back continues to fuel discussion. Some readers doubted the possibility of biking year-round in a country as seasonally variable as Canada. Other readers weren't having it. Colin Lee wrote, ""The fact is that many people bike year-round and have done so for decades in Canadian cities. I have lived in Waterloo, Toronto and Halifax and biked in winter in all three cities. The only way we're going to get more people doing so is by building more and safer infrastructure."" Deborah Baxter: ""Don't tell me that we cannot bike year-round in Canada! It is done in Iceland, and it sure as hell can be done in Canada!"" Baxter describes herself as ""a 62-year-old retired professional woman who chooses to work full-time."" She works within a two-kilometre radius of her home. ""I work late afternoon until almost midnight. And my sole means of transportation has been bicycle, apart from a very occasional cab ride."" She concluded by saying, ""I hope my two years of riding a bike year-round, largely at late night in Maritime Canada, entices many more to do so."" Kelvin Sams: ""I live in Halifax and ... I have been commuting to work on an electric fat bike. An excellent choice for icy snowy conditions. Wearing some ski goggles, a winter helmet and other suitable clothing I have been quite comfortable riding to work and more often find myself over-dressing. I have never before commuted to work by bicycle. For the first time I believe a significant portion of Canadians can commute by e-bike 12 months of the year."" Karla Braun: ""I live in Winnipeg and I'm a year-round cycle commuter."" Finally, this from Judi Varga-Toth: ""It is time to reject the myth that Canada cannot be and never will be a cycling nation. Not only can we be, but we must be. Cycling is a simple solution to many of the world's most complex problems, ranging from chronic disease and obesity prevention to mental health and productivity gains, from lowering GHGs to improving air quality, to reducing congestion and boosting the local economy."" In the face of a growing consensus about the causes and effects of climate change, many of the world's biggest fossil fuel companies (such as Shell and Exxon) have touted their investments in green energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that those promises are not backed up by action. The IEA found that on aggregate, these companies spent less than one per cent on ""low-carbon businesses."" As climate change evolves, it will affect different parts of the world in different ways. (As we've seen from recent events, for example, Australia and Indonesia have been hit by wildfires and floods, respectively.) Extreme weather will lead some people to move elsewhere. This week, the UN's human rights committee ruled it is illegal for governments to send people back to countries that face climate risks. Last week, I examined ways to reduce your home heating use. This week, I'm turning my attention to alternatives to fossil fuel heating. Nearly 70 per cent of the energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil fuels, a 2014 study estimated. Forced air furnaces and hot water or steam boilers with radiators, which most often burn fossil fuels such as natural gas, make up a majority of the primary heating systems in Canada, Statistics Canada reports. Buildings heated with fossil fuels can cut some of their emissions by reducing the need for heating through things like better insulation and reusing ""waste"" heat. If your home is hooked up to a district heating system, where a utility supplies heat directly, you may be able to tap into a variety of greener energy sources.  But if your home relies on its own individual heating system, as most do, what are the alternatives to fossil fuels — and will they work in the colder parts of this country? ""The only fuel that we can truly make 100 per cent carbon neutral is electricity,"" said Fin MacDonald, program manager of the Zero Carbon Building program at the Canada Green Building Council. In provinces with an electrical grid based mostly on hydro, nuclear or other zero-emission energy sources, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C., replacing a gas-burning furnace with an electrical heating system can nearly eliminate a home's emissions. Baseboard heaters are the most common option in use across Canada. They're powered by electrical resistance heating, just like your toaster and oven. Electric forced air furnaces, electric convection heaters and electric radiant floors also use electrical resistance heating. Baseboard heaters are popular because they're cheap and easy to install, but  electrical resistance heating is generally inefficient, said Brady Faught, green buildings engineer with the City of Vancouver. ""They're just like having a toaster running in your house all day … resulting in high electric bills."" Heat pumps are far more efficient because they simply move heat into your home, rather than generating heat. There are two kinds: Air source heat pumps, which draw heat from the air. (Yes, it can work even when it is very cold outside, just as your freezer can use its heat pump to cool itself to -18 C in a 20 C kitchen.) Ground source heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground and are sometimes referred to as geo-exchange or geothermal heat pumps. (MacDonald said the industry is trying to move away from calling it geothermal, as it gets confused with geothermal power generation.) Both MacDonald and Faught said it's possible to get 300 per cent efficiency from a heat pump — that is, you can get three kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity you put in. They're especially efficient in spring and fall.   But MacDonald said heat pumps tend to produce a lower temperature heat than burning fossil fuels, and therefore don't heat a building as quickly.  Faught said air source heat pumps can warm an airtight, well-insulated home to a comfortable temperature until it gets to about -10 C outside. In places with colder winters than that, supplementing with baseboard heaters may be necessary with conventional air source heat pumps. (Some manufacturers have brought cold climate heat pumps on the market that they say can deal with outside temperatures down to -25 C or -30 C.) In provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan, where power right now is largely generated by burning fossil fuels, homeowners who want to cut heating emissions need to go beyond electrification and also install green power generation, such as solar panels. David Turnbull, a manager at Enerspec, which does energy consulting and home inspections, warns that before investing in a heat pump, homeowners should make sure their place is as airtight and well-insulated as possible. ""The investment in these things doesn't necessarily pay off unless you've low-enough heat loss in your home to make one of these things worth it."" — Emily Chung Are there issues you'd like us to cover?

677,Jason Proctor,2019-12-05T12:26:02.619Z,Is atheism a religion? The Ministry of National Revenue is a non-believer,"They're a church of atheists, who for tax purposes, were hoping to be treated like a religion. But their arguments left three judges and Canada's Minister of National Revenue non-believers. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the bid for charitable status from the Church of Atheism of Central Canada after finding the organization failed to demonstrate the necessary elements of a belief system. The short, unanimous decision — written by Justice Marianne Rivoalen — details the philosophical legal hoops the atheists tried to jump to argue they should be treated as a non-religious, religious charity. A belief system is one of three elements the courts have found to be ""fundamental to religion."" And so the non-believers argued that they believed in something: mainstream science. ""Mainstream science is neither particularly specific nor precise,"" the decision said, noting that the Minister of National Revenue had been unimpressed with what the church described as its ""Ten Commandments of Energy."" The court decision issued last week doesn't elaborate much on the Ten Commandments of Energy. According to the ruling, the Church of Atheism of Central Canada was founded ""to preach atheism through charitable activities in the city of Ottawa, the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and whichever province shall from time to time be designated as part of Central Canada."" The Minister of National Revenue denied the church's initial application for charitable status. The church appealed on the grounds that the denial was unreasonable and in breach of rights guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Under the Income Tax Act, organizations founded for the purpose of ""the advancement of religion"" or ""certain other purposes beneficial to the community"" can be defined as charitable.  A lot of the arguments came down to the definition of the word ""religion."" ""For something to be a 'religion' in the charitable sense under the (Income Tax) Act, either the courts must have recognized it as such in the past, or it must have the same fundamental characteristics as those recognized previously,"" Justice Rivoalen wrote in the decision.  ""Fundamental characteristics of religion include that the followers have a faith in a higher power such as God, entity, or Supreme Being; that followers worship this higher power; and that the religion consists of a particular and comprehensive system of faith and worship."" The courts have protected the rights of atheists to practice their beliefs, and the church pointed out that Buddhism is ""a recognized religion that does not believe in a Supreme Being or any entity at all."" Rivoalen said she agreed that ""the requirements that the belief system have faith in a higher Supreme Being or entity and reverence of said Supreme Being is not always required when considering the meaning of 'religion.'"" But that left the belief system. The Minister of National Revenue said the church had provided ""no detailed information as to the particular and comprehensive system of faith and worship."" The church argued that a ""religion"" shouldn't need an authoritative book ""similar to the Bible"" — but the government saw that as further proof the atheists didn't ""have a comprehensive and particular system of faith and worship."" The Church of Atheism also argued that its activities were beneficial to the community ""as a religious self-help group."" But the judges said the activities provided were ""for their members only and are not rehabilitative or therapeutic.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/atheism-religion-charitable-status-1.5384686,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/what-happens-when-atheists-take-religion-seriously-1.5376823 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/keeping-faith-the-changing-face-of-religion-in-canada-1.3071353,N/A
678,Perlita Stroh,2020-01-26T09:00:00.548Z,How 3D holograms and AI are preserving Holocaust survivors' stories,"Max Eisen, 90, has lived his life by stubbornly looking ahead. He survived losing his mother and siblings in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and survived the camp himself, by focusing on getting through each day one hour at a time. He survived a 13-day death march by willing himself to keep moving his body forward a step at a time. He emigrated to Canada and started a business and a family by refusing to look back at what he'd lost. Last month, though, he spent five full days in a studio in Los Angeles not only looking back, but going over every minute detail of his life for a high-tech project that will preserve his voice long after he's gone. ""I thought this was a very powerful tool, it was important,"" Eisen says. The tool Eisen is referring to is the New Dimensions in Testimony Program. It's part of Steven Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation, which the director founded after making the film Schindler's List. For the past 25 years, the foundation has been recording the testimonies of survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides.  This new project, however, goes much further than simple recordings. Using proprietary technology, the USC initiative employs machine learning and artificial intelligence to create holograms of survivors' stories that audiences will be able to interact with and question for years to come. Eisen is the 25th person and the first Canadian to undergo the process, after another Canadian, Pinchas Gutter, piloted an earlier and less-polished version of it several years ago. The process starts on a Monday morning and goes straight through until Friday afternoon. Eisen, like others before him, has to sit in a chair in the same position and wearing the same clothes while a USC Shoah Foundation staff member peppers him with hundreds of questions about his life and experiences during the holocaust. The two are sitting in a specially constructed tent of green screens and surrounded by 26 mounted cameras that capture Eisen's responses from every angle. After the week of filming, the USC team begins the arduous editing process. They transform Eisen's week-long interview into an interactive hologram. The finished hologram will work with technology that allows users to ask it any question they want. The system will recognize words in the question and match it with an answer in its database in real time. Children and adults will essentially be talking to a person on a screen, who will look like they're listening to them and answering the questions in real time. ""When I first saw this, I sort of thought it was kind of eerie and this meant the end of life — you're only on a wall there hanging down now,"" Eisen says. ""But I've sort of come to realize this is a new technology and it could do a very big, important job."" For Eisen, participation in the New Dimensions Program is just the latest part of his personal quest to educate others about the horrors of the Holocaust.  For the past two decades, he has been giving speeches in schools and at community gatherings. He's returned to Poland many times with The March of the Living, a group that takes Jewish teenagers and adults on tours of concentration camps and ghettos in Poland. He agreed to start talking about his past only after retiring from his business in 1991. It was his granddaughter who first started questioning him about it when she began learning about the Holocaust in school.  ""I made up my mind then that I'm going to do this, I have to talk about it,"" he says. ""I did promise my father that I would tell the world what happened there, so it was time."" Eisen's mother and siblings were killed upon their arrival at the Auschwitz concentration camp in May 1944. He lost his father a few months after they arrived.  For months, he and his father had suffered on a gruelling work detail, often labouring for 10 to 12 hours a day and surviving on very little food. After his father was selected for medical experiments, Eisen never saw him again. Eisen credits his own survival to the mercy of the camp's surgeon, a Polish prisoner himself, after he was badly beaten by an SS officer. The surgeon kept Eisen in his clinic and put him to work as his assistant after he recovered from his injuries, sparing him any further labour. ""Of my entire family, over 70 people, I was one of three to survive,"" Eisen says,  Once he started opening up about his experiences in the Holocaust, Eisen has never stopped. His memoir, By Chance Alone, was published in 2016 and was the winner of 2019's CBC Canada Reads Competition. The endeavour, spreading the truth about what happened to him and those around him during the Holocaust, has now become his full time job. ""This is actually my career now,"" says Eisen. ""I was in business and I closed that book and I opened this book. And all these opportunities are just coming now and I don't refuse anybody."" His determination to educate as many people as possible about the Holocaust and the dangers of anti-Semitism is something he thinks is still relevant. This was reinforced when an image of him in front of synagogue promoting Holocaust education in 2018 was defaced with the German word ""achtung,"" which translates to ""attention"" — a word Eisen vividly remembers guards yelling at the prisoners in Auschwitz. Eisen admits reliving his past hasn't gotten easier, but says the work is too important for him to stop — and the feedback he gets from students keeps him going. ""They keep telling me, you know, 'I've been a principal in this school for 25 years, I've seen these students, they have a span of attention of 15 minutes, and they were sitting here for an hour and a half and they didn't blink an eyelash.' That's rewarding,"" says Eisen. Kia Hayes, from the USC Foundation, has been tasked with interviewing Eisen for the New Dimensions project. She and her team spent months researching every aspect of his past, a process that culminated in more than 1,000 questions for him. She says knowing Eisen could handle the gruelling interview process is why they selected him for the project. ""It's not just that the survivor can physically can sit for the five hours a day, five days a week, to tell their story. It's also, mentally and emotionally, are they able to? Do they want to? Do they feel comfortable sharing?,"" says Hayes. ""We want to know that we're not overburdening them with the amount of questions that we're asking, and that's really important to us."" The types of questions Hayes asks Eisen are interesting, too. Beyond questions about his childhood and wartime experience, her team has to think of what a child without much knowledge of history might ask of a Holocaust survivor in the future. So, questions like 'Have you met Hitler?' and 'Do you hate Germans?' are included, because of the fact that children are likely to ask them. ""They [children] are curious. They want to know things like that. So we need to make sure the questions we're building out include that level of curiosity,"" explains Hayes.  And Eisen is more than willing to answer all of those questions. He says it's essential that the stories of Holocaust survivors do not die with them, and the interactive holograms help keep the stories alive for future generations. ""It's amazing, who would've thought something like this would be possible?"" Eisen's interactive hologram is now in the editing stage and will be ready to be installed in museums and travel to schools in about a year's time. He says the experience was a once in a lifetime opportunity to preserve his legacy. ""That's why I keep doing this, and moving, and going, and talking. And this is what other survivors are doing — when we are no longer going to be here, there's got to be some other tools that these students and next generations will need to hear and see.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/holocaust-survivor-hologram-1.5436430,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/holocaust-survivor-in-famous-auschwitz-liberation-photo-says-rising-anti-semitism-scares-me-1.5429798 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/holocaust-survivor-talks-regina-saskatoon-1.5285538 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uvic-holocaust-graphic-novels-1.5434227 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rainer-hoess-auschwitz-holocaust-1.5348444,N/A
679,Kerry Campbell,2018-01-25T20:28:28.580Z,No more unsupervised breaks for P.E.I. psychiatric patients,"Psychiatric patients at the Island's three large hospitals are no longer being provided with passes for unsupervised breaks, CBC has learned.  Health PEI's chief of mental health and addictions said the change in policy took effect Tuesday. ""As of this past week, we are not going to have unaccompanied smoke breaks,"" said Heather Keizer. ""We do allow people to have supervised smoke breaks, but they have to be supervised by staff."" Health PEI has clarified the change is in effect at all three hospitals which provide treatment for psychiatric patients: Hillsborough Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Prince County Hospital. The agency has also clarified that it applies not just to smoke breaks, but all short breaks, also referred to by health care staff as ""punctuals."" P.E.I.'s Smoke Free Places Act prohibits smoking on hospital grounds within the province, but makes an exception for Hillsborough Hospital, which is allowed to have outdoor designated smoking areas for patients. But in order to access those areas, patients have to be provided with privileges to be able to take ""punctuals,"" or short breaks to have a cigarette or take a walk. A spokesperson for Health P.E.I. said passes are issued following an assessment by a psychiatrist, and can allow for supervised or unsupervised excursions. Keizer didn't specify what prompted the change, but when asked whether this was in response to a patient who recently went missing from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital she said, ""whenever a serious incident happens in a hospital setting, it really is important for us to think … about what we can do better."" There was another incident last November when a Charlottetown man was accused of assaulting two people and setting fire to a residence. Man who stabbed woman found not criminally responsible Crown prosecutors in the case said the accused was an inpatient at Hillsborough Hospital on the day of the offences and went ""AWOL from that facility while on a pass."" The man was ruled not criminally responsible for his actions. The Crown attorney's office told CBC News that, according to police, the man had been on a smoke break, although they were not aware whether the break was supervised. Health PEI has not provided information on the case in response to requests from CBC News. A security review of Hillsborough Hospital delivered in 2016 found there were 17 reports of patients being absent without permission over a period of less than a year, from Nov. 2014 to Oct. 2015. That review concluded the facility's smoking policy at the time ""needs to be reviewed, it currently creates many security breaches."" Hillsborough Hospital inquest: jury makes 14 recommendations Another report delivered in 2015 examining a suicide inside the hospital two years earlier also raised the issue of unsupervised passes. That report said patients who were confined to the hospital and required to be checked on by staff every 30 minutes shouldn't be issued passes for unsupervised breaks. The report recommended a review of the hospital's observation levels. Keizer said this week that at no time in the past had the hospital provided leave privileges to patients who were deemed ""unstable."" The president of the Union of Public Sector Employees Karen Jackson said she is concerned the need for supervised breaks could exacerbate what she feels is an existing staff shortage at Hillsborough. ""We need to ensure that our frontline workers are safe,"" Jackson said. ""Taking somebody off a unit to go out for a smoke-break leaves that unit short-staffed, and if there's anything happens on that unit during the time they're outside, then that could be an issue of safety for our staff."" UPSE represents licensed practical nurses, personal care workers and resident care workers at Hillsborough.  Health PEI said supervised punctuals take place at specific times, up to five times per day. The agency said patients not provided with punctuals are able to access secure, outdoor locations for fresh air and those who smoke are able to receive nicotine replacement therapy.  When asked by CBC News why Health PEI waited this long to change its policy in light of previous reviews, Keizer said the process of providing passes was important for patients on their road to recovery. ""Patients need to gain more and more responsibility and freedom as they're getting well on units. One of the ways that has been done historically was to provide them with more privileges in terms of punctuals … or smoking passes,"" Keizer said. ""It's an imperfect system, but it is helpful."" Keizer said the new smoking supervision policy has been implemented on a trial basis, and will be reviewed after three to four months.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-hillsborough-hospital-unsupervised-breaks-1.4502412,[],N/A
680,Anonymous,2019-04-22T23:02:51.507Z,"Shelters for victims of abuse in Canada still struggling with underfunding, capacity issues: StatsCan","New numbers from Statistics Canada show shelters for victims of abuse across the country admitted 68,106 people in 2017/18, 60.3 per cent of whom were women. Their accompanying children made up 39.6 per cent and just 0.1 per cent were men.  StatsCan did a snapshot day, meant to represent a typical day of operations at a shelter. On that day, 3,565 women, 3,137 accompanying children, and eight men were living in shelters. In all 78 per cent of short-term beds were occupied and 36 per cent of short-term facilities were considered full on that day. The study found nine out of 10 people who showed up at shelters were there due to abuse, and on the snapshot day 669 women were turned away, the majority of them because the shelter was full.  Kaitlin Bardswich, communications and development coordinator at Women's Shelters Canada, said shelters are struggling. ""They're also having to deal with staff turnover as well as over-burdened staff who are underpaid and dealing with very significant issues on a day-to-day basis,"" she said.  The StatsCan survey data appear to reinforce that. Residents said two of their main roadblocks were lack of affordable, long-term housing after leaving the shelter and low incomes or underemployment. Facilities said two of their main concerns were funding and lack of permanent housing in their respective communities.   Indigenous women and immigrant women are also over represented in shelter demographics.  Bardswich said Indigenous women are more likely to be victims of violence. Speaking of immigrant and refugee women, she said: ""They often, generally speaking, don't have the same number of friends or family in the country or in their community that they can rely on. They don't have that support system."" ""If they don't have permanent residency, [they] don't have access to social services such as social assistance, housing, healthcare."" Bardswich said she is always hoping for a bigger budget and more beds.  Jo-Anne Dusel, executive director of the Provincial Association of Transition Houses and Services of Saskatchewan (PATHS), said housing is a big issue in Saskatchewan While the province has a decent vacancy rate, women fleeing violence often have to turn to social assistance to live, says Dusel, who adds Saskatchewan had the highest percentage of full shelters on snapshot day of all the provinces.  Dusel said the social assistance in the province isn't enough to sustain a family. ""If they were a family with one or two children, they could just barely afford a bachelor apartment in Regina at the average rental rate,"" she said.  Even a family with five or more children would not even be able to afford a one-bedroom apartment on social assistance, without taking from money meant for other necessities, said Dusel. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/domestic-violence-shelters-canada-saskatchewan-1.5105376,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-clares-law-domestic-violence-1.4892606 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-city-council-votes-to-gift-2m-land-to-ywca-for-new-35m-facility-1.4999879 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/femicide-report-sask-implications-1.5000206 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/amputation-domestic-violence-saskatchewan-1.5040699 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/domestic-violence-sask-budget-2019-20-1.5072155,N/A
681,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-17T12:32:48.165Z,Hustle or slow walk? Timing of new NAFTA now up to Canada,"U.S. President Donald Trump and his trade representative Robert Lighthizer called the shots many times during the renegotiation of the North American free trade agreement. But one final question is completely out of the Americans' hands: how soon will Canada ratify? ""All eyes will be on Canada to get the job done quickly so we can all work together to implement this agreement,"" Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley said Wednesday as the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) reached the floor for debate. On Thursday, American senators voted 89-10 to send the deal over to the White House for signing, setting up Trump for a congratulatory photo op in the Oval Office as early as next week — when he may be all too happy to have something to distract from that other thing on Washington's agenda. But the deal won't kick in until 90 days after all three countries complete their ratification processes. Things are good to go in Mexico, the drama in Washington appears over and — because Canada pledged to move in ""lockstep"" with the U.S. — some people have speculated that the deal could come into force as early as May 2020. But is Ottawa in a mood to rush? There are a few things to consider before making any time-sensitive business decisions based on the revised deal taking effect. The most important thing to understand is that there is no actual ""ratification vote"" in Canada's Parliament. The federal executive (cabinet) ratifies international treaties once laws and regulations are changed to bring the country into compliance. Changing the laws and regulations required for the new NAFTA (or NAFTA 2.1, taking into account the rewrites Congressional Democrats insisted on that became the protocol of amendment signed in Mexico City last month) means passing implementation legislation. Canada had legislation in the works for the trade pact when the last Parliament was dissolved for the election. Because the bulk of the deal has not changed, Canada's drafters are not starting from scratch. As we saw in the last Parliament, a ways and means motion may come first, because there's a taxation change in this deal: the new (and unprecedented) export caps being imposed on Canada's dairy sector will be enforced with high tariffs. The protocol of amendment doesn't require substantial revisions of Canada's implementation bill, but fixing the state-to-state dispute resolution system, for example, could require new language. Parliament returns from its holiday break in ten days, on Jan. 27. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who retained responsibility for NAFTA in last fall's cabinet shuffle, tabled the protocol of amendment on Dec. 12, before the House rose. That date may matter. Or it may not. The Government of Canada's policy for international trade treaties like this one normally requires that a treaty be tabled for 21 sitting days before the House proceeds with implementation legislation. The Commons observed this waiting period a year ago, for the first version of the implementing bill. But is it required to do so again? Questions from CBC News have not yet yielded a clear answer. If this waiting period is observed, that means no legislation until mid-March. If the government skips the waiting period (and it has been waived for other deals), the House could get down to debate in late January. Two days' notice must be given before anything's introduced, so keen observers will be watching the notice paper until then. Once legislation is introduced, several factors may determine how fast it moves. At the risk of anticipating how MPs will vote (never a safe thing to do), here's what could unfold: Conservatives appear likely to offer a vigorous critique before eventually voting in favour of the new NAFTA, citing the overall national interest as they opt not to get in the deal's way. But objections raised by the Bloc Québécois and the NDP before the holidays seemed to suggest this bill would not have the support of the other two parties. Expediting legislation usually requires one of two things: all-party support, or strong-arm tactics like time allocation votes or closure to ram the bill through at various stages. Would Opposition MPs vote in favour of time allocation in a minority Parliament? Then there's the requirement that implementing legislation be reviewed by at least one committee — a committee which will no longer effectively be controlled by a majority of Liberal MPs. Will committee members undertake a long study, or a concise one? Will Senate committees choose to meet concurrently, as they have on time-sensitive legislation in the past? Finally, there's the Senate, which will be under new leadership (we don't yet know whose). When the implementation bill is sent over, will senators pass it swiftly? Or will the Senate exercise its right to oversee a thorough kicking of the tires — even if that takes months, not days? Moving anything through a minority Parliament takes strategy and negotiation. Moving quickly on a deal that's not universally loved was always going to be a challenge. And in the aftermath of the events of the past week in Canada–U.S. relations, the public's mood may not motivate the Trudeau government — which is clearly focused on other things at the moment — to spend much political capital on hustling to please the Americans.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-ratification-canada-friday-1.5429181,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/usmca-senate-passes-1.5429451 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/house-passes-new-nafta-1.5403272 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/what-nafta-changes-mean-for-canada-1.5391803,N/A
682,Anonymous,2019-11-09T20:09:55.645Z,Inuit groups have 1 week to argue delay of environmental mine hearing,"Today was supposed to mark the start of a community round table in Pond Inlet over the expansion of the Mary River Mine.  But instead, Baffinland Iron Mine's Corp. and Nunavut Inuit organizations are preparing written responses for when hearings about the mine's expansion — which adjourned on Wednesday — should begin again. The Nunavut Impact Review Board began technical hearings for the mining company's phase-two expansion project in Iqaluit on Nov. 2. That project could see the mine's output of iron ore doubled, to 12 million tonnes. It will require a railway, and a longer shipping season. The round table, planned for Nov. 8 and 9, was supposed to allow time for residents to ask questions that came from the technical hearings. But five days in to the hearings, parties were still working through day one of the agenda.  That's why Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the organization that represents Inuit in Nunavut, made a motion to adjourn the hearing for nine to 12 months.  ""It seemed that we were not going to follow a good process if we proceeded with the community round table,"" said the organization's president Aluki Kotierk. ""Community members would not have all the technical information that they rightly deserve to have.""  Baffinland agreed with the adjournment but not the length of delay.  Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. and the Qikiqtani Inuit Association now have until Nov. 15 to tell the Nunavut Impact Review Board in writing why each believe hearings should be delayed that long. The time would allow for communities to review new information in all languages.  Baffinland will file its new submission to the review board by Nov. 22. According to the Nunavut Agreement, all land development projects, like a mine, must be screened by the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Right now, the mine is allowed to ship six million tonnes of iron ore annually. But as of December that allowance will expire and Baffinland will only be approved to ship around four million tonnes.  At the hearings, Baffinland told communities and government departments that the expansion is required for the mine to prosper.  Kotierk says the mine has indicated that it can survive a delay, but the proposed timeframe is less than ideal.  ""We didn't take this [decision] lightly at all,"" said PJ Akeeagok, president of the Qikiqtani Inuit Association, which represents Inuit in the Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin) region. ""It was evident that there are many unanswered questions.""  Especially from Pond Inlet, the community most impacted by the mine, he said. Mary River is around 150 kilometres outside of the community.  ""For Inuit to have an informed decision for phase two to advance or not you need all relevant information to make that sound decision."" At the technical hearings this week the Hamlet of Pond Inlet and the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization said they strongly oppose the lack of information they said they had from the mining company. There are still a lot of unknowns about how the mine will impact the marine environment, harvester rights and food security for North Baffin communities.   ""We have to find that balance — absolutely we support the jobs it creates, the economic spinoffs the mine creates,"" Akeeagok said. ""At this point in time it was unbalanced, that was very evident."" The review board's executive director, Ryan Barry, says it should take about two weeks after these new submissions come in for the board to make a decision.   It's too early to say what new hearings would look like.  ""We certainly would expect to have those in Pond Inlet to the extent that we possibly can,"" Barry said.  He said decision to approve the the delay was not made lightly. ""We realize that any adjournment of an assessment can cause delays that can have real implications ... on the viability of a project and the employment and benefits that are associated with development,"" said Barry. ""The board unfortunately doesn't have enough information to get to a decision on this proposal at this time,"" Barry said of the mine expansion project.  In an emailed statement Baffinland said it supports the review board's process, and thanked all of the parties for their participation.

684,Kazi Stastna,2020-01-25T03:13:07.851Z,"As they head into Day 4 of impeachment trial, Democrats hope to leave senators wanting more","As the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump enters its fourth day in the U.S. Senate, stamina is waning. Among viewers at home, interest has dropped off — from about 11 million viewers to a little less than eight million, a mere six per cent of those expected to vote in the November 2020 election. In the halls of the Senate, the press corps is getting restless, still chasing every media availability but privately cursing the long hours they've put in covering a trial that has stretched beyond nine hours each of the past three days. On the Senate floor, while some senators keenly flip through massive binders of supporting documentation, highlighting relevant sections, others slouch, yawn or slip in and out of the chamber, where strict rules dictate they're only allowed to consume milk or water. Democrats are hoping they can sustain the punishing pace for at least one more day as they wrap up their case against the president Friday and make a final push to convince the Senate and the American people that Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival was a brazen abuse of power intended to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. Hour 23 of redundant impeachment arguments. For those following at home: Drinking game—every time House Dems say “drug deal” or “get over it”...drink a shot of milk! ""It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest,"" said Jerrold Nadler, one of seven Democratic legislators, or so-called managers, prosecuting the case, Thursday. ""It is a shocking corruption of the election process. And it is without doubt a crime against the constitution, warranting — demanding — removal from office."" WATCH | Jerrold Nadler lays out the case for abuse of power: The Democrats have been using video clips of testimony from the House impeachment hearings last year and Trump's own statements to methodically weave a director's commentary of sorts, chronicling a by now familiar story: Trump's withholding of $400 million US in military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and revive a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. ""This is actually a very effective use of the House evidence because it digests the moments that constitute evidence for the Democrats,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication at the University of Pennsylvania who runs FactCheck.org. And while much of the testimony was familiar to anyone who paid attention during the House hearings, several senators from both sides of the aisle admitted they were hearing some of it for the first time. ""This may have been the first time that they have heard the entire case presented sequentially,"" Jamieson said. ""And they are having a very different experience than the public has had, because very few in the public are watching from one o'clock until whenever the proceedings [end]."" Although several of Trump's defenders in and outside the Senate denounced the presentation as same old, same old, Republicans might end up using their own samples of House testimony to rebut the Democrats' case when they begin presenting their defence Saturday.  It would be a mistake for the lawyers representing Trump to discount evidence of misconduct altogether, said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on constitutional law and the legislative process at the North Carolina School of Law.  Instead, they should clearly spell out how the Senate should assess whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offence. ""Merely saying all he did was perfect is shameful. It is false and leads any neutral observers to lose confidence in their case,"" said Gerhardt. Gerhardt was a witness for both sides in the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and in the Trump impeachment hearings in the House, and Nadler played some of his testimony at the start of Thursday's session. He says he regrets that there are no joint witnesses in the current impeachment process. ""The breach between the parties is much worse than it was 20 years ago, and it was bad then."" The importance of hearing from additional witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, has been a key focus for the Democrats. It will likely come up again in their final day of arguments as they attempt to prove the second article of impeachment and show that Trump obstructed Congress by stymying the inquiry into how he handled the Ukraine matter. They'll need to convince at least two Republicans (along with the two independents, who are expected to vote with Democrats) to get the 51-member majority they need to vote in favour of calling of witnesses once Trump's defence team presents their case. Adam Schiff, the congressman leading the prosecution, has goaded senators over the past two days, hinting at the incriminating details that might be in the diplomatic cables and other subpoenaed documents that the Democrats have also requested but that the White House has thus far refused to release.  ""They're yours for the asking,"" he told senators on the first day of arguments. WATCH | Adam Schiff calls on senators to demand the release of subpoenaed documents: ""As they built the narrative, they would establish what they knew, argue that it was strong enough to impeach based on what they knew and then say, 'But wouldn't you also want to know this?'"" Louis Seidman, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center, said of the Democrats' strategy. It's a strategy that seems to be tapping into public sentiment. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken Jan. 20-23 found that 66 per cent of Americans, including 45 per cent of Republicans, agreed that the Senate should call new witnesses to testify. ""They have to sustain public support for witnesses. In fact, get it to increase if they can, because that puts pressure on the susceptible Republicans who might be willing to vote that way,"" Seidman said. Rick Scott, of Florida, is one of those Republicans. But he told reporters Thursday that Democrats had their chance to pursue witnesses during the House hearings and could have gone to court to fight the president's refusal to comply with their subpoenas. He and other Republicans have, however, said they want Hunter Biden to testify about his association with Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he was a paid member of the board from 2014 to 2019. Trump and other Republicans have alleged Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to dismiss the country's prosecutor general in order to shield Burisma from a corruption investigation. In their arguments Thursday, Democrats tried to debunk that theory and show that Biden's actions were part a wider international effort to root out corruption.  ""The whole idea of a fair trial is you bring in relevant witnesses,"" said Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her way into the Senate chamber Wednesday. ""Relevant witnesses here are people who know what Donald Trump did and what his intent was and what its impact was on our national security and on the security of the Ukraine. Hunter Biden doesn't have any knowledge of that or any bearing on that."" Her fellow presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar said she's been keeping the pressure up on her Republican colleagues, urging them to at least agree to hear from witnesses, even if they don't vote to remove Trump from office.  ""Why are you here if you're not going to stand up?"" she said she told senators. Democrats used strong language in their presentation to the Senate to characterize Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to announce investigations that the House managers said served only his own interests: ""plot,"" ""scheme,"" ""unprecedented coverup."" (He countered with some of his favourite terms: Nadler was a ""sleazebag""; Schiff a ""con job"" and the trial ""a hoax,"" he said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.) They went to great lengths to underscore the gravity of the charges and the historic nature of the process, repeatedly invoking the so-called Framers of the Constitution. ""Impeachment is not for petty offences,"" Nadler said on the second day of arguments. ""It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or unpopular. "" And if there was any doubt about just how sombre of an occasion it was, the opening words of the sergeant at arms at the start of every session were there to remind us: ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."" As were the stern security staff who were quick to reprimand reporters and lookers-on for the smallest infraction, handing them a photocopied list of rules, with the one they've violated emphatically underlined: no cellphones, no talking, no eating, no leaning, no standing. WATCH | Adam Schiff they'll be authors of their own decline if they don't hold Trump accountable: In advance of their final day of arguments, the managers presenting the Democrats' case issued a warning to those who might be convinced Trump abused the power of his office but hesitant to remove him. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,"" Schiff said near the end of another nine-hour-plus session. ""For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won."" But it will take more than that to convince Trump's most vocal defenders in the Senate that he must go. ""When it comes to replacing this president nine months-plus from the election, you've got an uphill battle with me, because I really do believe that the best group people to pick a president are the voters,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters. Even Seidman, who supports the impeachment process, thinks a vote to remove Trump would be risky and potentially destabilizing given that a percentage of Americans would find such a process tantamount to a coup d'état. It's also highly unlikely to happen, contingent as it is on a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats hold 47 of 100 seats. But that doesn't necessarily mean the impeachment process is a futile exercise, said Seidman. ""There is the impact that this has on the American people, on Trump's chances for re-election, on his historical reputation, on how much political power he has going forward,"" he said.

Another 19 people in the province are also under investigation for possible infection, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer.

Williams updated reporters on the emerging situation at a news conference at Queen's Park shortly before noon.

Watch: Ontario health officials provide an update on the efforts to contain the coronavirus Officials previously said the woman's husband, a man in his 50s, had been showing mild symptoms on the Jan. 22 flight from Guangzhou, China, to Toronto. ""He became more symptomatic in the next 24 hours, and then had a family member not come to the house, [but] call 911, and that person gave clear advice and direction to 911 and paramedics responded appropriately,"" Williams said. Officials have since been reaching out to those aboard the China Southern Airlines flight who sat within two metres of the man. De Villa said Toronto Public Health has been ""working flat out"" to identify any potential contacts the two people might have had in the city.  The man is now at the city's Sunnybrook Hospital, where he remains in stable condition. The woman is at home and is currently ""asymptomatic,"" de Villa said. No one else lives in the residence, she added. Public health workers have been in regular contact with the woman to check on her condition, de Villa told reporters. Yaffe said that screening for infection at airports can be difficult. ""There's no perfect screening in an airport. In fact, [for] SARS, we were doing thermal screening in the airport, and it was found to be totally ineffective,"" she said. Williams said that those who are not currently exhibiting the flu-like symptoms consistent with the coronavirus are likely not contagious. ""If somebody does not have symptoms, they usually are not shedding,"" he said, adding researchers are continually studying the virus and becoming more familiar with its characteristics. Dr. Michael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in Toronto, said the second case doesn't make him worry, because the disease was spread between two people who had close contact, and there remains no evidence that the disease is spreading beyond Ontario. ""This is, unfortunately, something we were prepared for,"" he said on CBC Radio's Metro Morning, where he fielded calls from concerned residents in the Greater Toronto Area. For those who are worried about travelling or being out in public, Gardam said there remains no perfect answer to avoiding illness, but suggested people should avoid anyone who appears sick and always take care to wash their hands. ""Handwashing is something that never goes out of style,"" he said. Listen to the full Metro Morning interview with Dr. Michael Gardam: As for face masks, Gardam said the jury is still out on how effective they are when it comes to preventing the spread of disease. Early data on the new form of the virus suggests masks won't be especially effective, and some say repeatedly touching and adjusting the masks with unwashed hands could do more harm than good. Chinese officials said Tuesday the number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei province — where the disease is believed to have originated — has risen by 24, bringing the total now to 106. Authorities reported one in the capital, Beijing. Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases across China has risen to 2,744. All of the cases outside of China, in countries such as the U.S., have been travel-related, Yaffe said. Global Affairs Canada is now urging Canadians to avoid all travel to the part of China where the new strain of coronavirus originated. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#China</a>: We have increased our risk level for the province of <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hubei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Hubei</a>.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, has said she believes there will be more cases ""imported into Canada"" because of global flight patterns, but she notes there's little risk of becoming infected here. Toronto Mayor John Tory said he's requested that all public health information related to the coronavirus be translated into ""languages other than English or French"" to ensure the city's diverse population can stay informed. Echoing public health officials who stress the risk of contracting the virus remains low, Tory urged residents to maintain business as usual. ""Be careful, be vigilant, but you don't have to change your life at the moment,"" he said. The news of Canada's first presumptive coronavirus patient came Saturday as authorities around the world grappled with the new type of virus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that most often cause mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses including the common cold, but they can also lead to severe diseases. Some coronaviruses spread between animals, some pass between animals and people, and others go from people to people. This new virus is different from the coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  Its symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Those with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable to severe disease. That includes the elderly and people with chronic illness, such as diabetes, cancer, heart or lung disease. Health officials have stressed that while human-to-human transmission of the virus does take place, it's most likely in cases involving close, prolonged contact with someone who is already infected. As of last week, the World Health Organization has not designated the outbreak as an international public health emergency.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-wuhan-ontario-second-case-1.5441401,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-travel-china-restrictions-health-1.5442123 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-contaminment-canada-1.5441216 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-gta-question-and-answer-1.5441546 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-buses-1.5440899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760,N/A

On Friday, CBC published a letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. In subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. The letter was first sent to Health Minister Diane Thom Monday evening by the Foster Family Coalition. She responded with a generic email pointing to the department's progress in completing a self-imposed three-year improvement plan, and making no mention of the letter or its allegations. On Tuesday, CBC requested an interview with Thom. She issued no statement until Friday, when a four-line statement attributed to the minister said she ""will not comment on [the concerns raised] until we have a chance to … hear directly from [the coalition] and build dialogue going forward."" ""Making sure that children and youth in care are safe and supported is something we take very seriously,"" the statement read. Tammy Roberts, the executive director of the Foster Family Coalition, confirmed the department reached out to her Wednesday to arrange a meeting. She said no date had yet been set. Reached by phone on Friday, Premier Caroline Cochrane said she had ""been running non-stop"" and had not read coverage of the letter. ""I do know that if you're talking about the foster family association [sic] than that would be a better question to ask the appropriate minister … Diane Thom,"" she said. While deferring specifics to the department, Cochrane went on to say that ""the government cares."" ""Actions are taking place,"" she said. ""However, the world does not change in a short time."" Asked what she would say to foster parents, Cochrane, a former social worker, said she ""value[s] the support that they provide to children and to our communities. ""I hear that they want to have a voice, and this government is more focused on giving all stakeholders a voice,"" she said.

687,Paul Withers,2020-01-26T10:00:00.138Z,Why more Nova Scotians lose power in a storm than you realize,"During severe weather, many Nova Scotians click on Nova Scotia Power's outage map to find out how many customers have lost electricity and where. But the map doesn't tell the whole story. The actual number of customers without electricity during a recent storm was higher than indicated by the outage map, according to information provided to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. And that's a normal occurrence, says Paul Casey, Nova Scotia Power's vice-president of transmission, distribution and delivery service. The Utility and Review Board asked the power company for detailed information on the interruptions and restoration times associated with a big windstorm on Dec. 10, 2019. At the time, the company said a maximum of 52,000 customers were without power at the same time during the storm. That's what appeared on the outage map. Casey said about 78,000 households lost power at least once during the storm, while the number of instances of households losing power was about 116,000. He said the peak outage number doesn't include households experiencing a second or subsequent outage, or households temporarily taken off the grid by Nova Scotia Power when the company is carrying out restoration work. It's unclear what the peak number would be if those instances were included in Nova Scotia Power's figures. ""That would total a larger number [than 52,000],"" said Casey. In its submission to the board, Nova Scotia Power released a graph tracking cumulative hours of winds above 80 km/h between 2005 and 2019 at stations in Yarmouth, Greenwood, Halifax, Truro and Sydney. The December windstorm capped a year that saw the most hours of sustained high winds on record. These winds weaken trees and equipment, increasing the probability of outages. Nova Scotia Power spends $100 million a year to maintain and upgrade transmission and distribution equipment, including $25 million for vegetation management. The company said it's investigating battery storage and microgrids as it tries to harden its system as sustained high winds become more frequent.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-power-customers-storm-outages-reason-winds-1.5440084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/10000-carrots-rabbit-rescue-adoption-1.5440660 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ohio-basketball-coach-pays-visit-brings-gifts-to-canso-team-1.5439003 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/glen-petitpas-donair-recipe-nova-scotia-smithsonian-astronomer-1.5425033 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-little-harbour-protected-land-golf-course-development-1.5439596 https://www.cbc.ca/archives/with-interactive-tv-restaurant-delivery-was-just-clicks-away-1.5429942,N/A
688,Kayla Hounsell,2019-11-18T18:35:29.461Z,Shanna Desmond's family hopes for help to move from home where murder-suicide took place,"Thelma Borden tries her best to keep going day to day, but it's a constant struggle. She's haunted by memories and images she can't escape, because her family home is also the scene of her family tragedy.  Borden's daughter, Shanna, and 10-year-old granddaughter, Aaliyah, were killed in her home in Nova Scotia on Jan. 3, 2017, shot by her son-in-law, Lionel Desmond. He also shot his own mother, Brenda, before turning the gun on himself. A former member of the Canadian Armed Forces who had done two tours in Afghanistan, Desmond's family said he had been struggling with PTSD and had been trying unsuccessfully to get help. ""I always say a prayer before I start cooking because in my mind I'm wondering where they were,"" said Borden, seated in the living room of her home in Upper Big Tracadie. ""If I'm in this room, I'm wondering what part of the room was my granddaughter lying [in]. I know she was left in this room."" Thelma Borden and her husband, Ricky, still live in the home. The Bordens would like to relocate, but say they can't afford it.  They're hoping their request for government assistance becomes part of the fatality inquiry that was set to start Monday, but has now been adjourned until the new year.   At the inquiry, which the CBC's Laura Fraser was live blogging Monday, the Bordens asked for the adjournment because they parted ways with their lawyer. Their new lawyer told the inquiry he needed more time to prepare.  Judge Warren Zimmer granted a request for adjournment. The inquiry is now set to continue Jan. 27.  The inquiry's mandate is to determine the circumstances surrounding the four deaths. It will examine whether Lionel Desmond had access to appropriate mental health services, whether he should have been able to buy a gun and whether his health-care providers were trained to recognize occupational stress and domestic violence. The inquiry was recommended by Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner after a review of the deaths. Sheldon Borden, Lionel Desmond's brother-in-law, who is also a Canadian Forces member, intends to raise the relocation issue at the inquiry. The family believes the Department of National Defence should help. ""You cannot begin the healing process if you're trapped in the same environment which destroyed you,"" he said. ""You'll never become whole again.""  Borden said he has already requested help from the Prime Minister's Office, the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada, the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime, as well as individual politicians.  He received a response from the PMO, which expressed condolences, but stated the matter ""falls more directly under the purview of the Minister of National Defence"" and had been forwarded accordingly. Borden said he has not yet received a response from the minister. The inquiry is expected to sit Monday to Thursday for three weeks, after which Judge Warren Zimmer, of the Nova Scotia Provincial Court, will release a report containing findings and recommendations. As this is a fatality inquiry, and not a public inquiry, his report won't assign any legal responsibility. ""I think it needs to be a public inquiry because I think we need to be able to hold somebody accountable for this significant tragedy,"" said Rubin Coward, a former military member and advocate working with the family.  He also hopes to participate in the inquiry to raise the broader issue of racism in the military. The family claims Desmond experienced racism during his service, an issue they believe contributed to his illness. Thelma and Sheldon Borden only speak lovingly of Lionel Desmond. They describe him as a caring, loving and humble person who returned from Afghanistan a different person — an angry man with a ""short fuse"" who struggled with a ""strong sickness."" ""Trauma changes you,"" said Sheldon Borden. It changes personalities."" The family hopes the inquiry will help determine what went wrong and create change that will help other veterans get the support they need.    ""I hope that they can try to find a way that this never happens to anybody else, that they help these young people if they're in the army,"" said Thelma Borden. Her son agrees, saying he hopes it results in ""systemic, institutional"" change.   ""To see that would be a blessing, because I wouldn't want to see it happen to anybody else whatsoever,"" said Sheldon Borden.  According to a court decision dated June 20, inquiry participants include:  Under the province's Fatality Investigations Act, anyone can make an application to participate at any stage of the proceedings. A spokesperson for the Canadian Armed Forces said it will review the inquiry's findings and consider any recommendations relevant to its operations. Veterans Affairs Canada will also review the report when it is released.

689,Kazi Stastna,2020-01-25T03:13:07.851Z,"As they head into Day 4 of impeachment trial, Democrats hope to leave senators wanting more","As the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump enters its fourth day in the U.S. Senate, stamina is waning. Among viewers at home, interest has dropped off — from about 11 million viewers to a little less than eight million, a mere six per cent of those expected to vote in the November 2020 election. In the halls of the Senate, the press corps is getting restless, still chasing every media availability but privately cursing the long hours they've put in covering a trial that has stretched beyond nine hours each of the past three days. On the Senate floor, while some senators keenly flip through massive binders of supporting documentation, highlighting relevant sections, others slouch, yawn or slip in and out of the chamber, where strict rules dictate they're only allowed to consume milk or water. Democrats are hoping they can sustain the punishing pace for at least one more day as they wrap up their case against the president Friday and make a final push to convince the Senate and the American people that Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival was a brazen abuse of power intended to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. Hour 23 of redundant impeachment arguments. For those following at home: Drinking game—every time House Dems say “drug deal” or “get over it”...drink a shot of milk! ""It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest,"" said Jerrold Nadler, one of seven Democratic legislators, or so-called managers, prosecuting the case, Thursday. ""It is a shocking corruption of the election process. And it is without doubt a crime against the constitution, warranting — demanding — removal from office."" WATCH | Jerrold Nadler lays out the case for abuse of power: The Democrats have been using video clips of testimony from the House impeachment hearings last year and Trump's own statements to methodically weave a director's commentary of sorts, chronicling a by now familiar story: Trump's withholding of $400 million US in military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and revive a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. ""This is actually a very effective use of the House evidence because it digests the moments that constitute evidence for the Democrats,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication at the University of Pennsylvania who runs FactCheck.org. And while much of the testimony was familiar to anyone who paid attention during the House hearings, several senators from both sides of the aisle admitted they were hearing some of it for the first time. ""This may have been the first time that they have heard the entire case presented sequentially,"" Jamieson said. ""And they are having a very different experience than the public has had, because very few in the public are watching from one o'clock until whenever the proceedings [end]."" Although several of Trump's defenders in and outside the Senate denounced the presentation as same old, same old, Republicans might end up using their own samples of House testimony to rebut the Democrats' case when they begin presenting their defence Saturday.  It would be a mistake for the lawyers representing Trump to discount evidence of misconduct altogether, said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on constitutional law and the legislative process at the North Carolina School of Law.  Instead, they should clearly spell out how the Senate should assess whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offence. ""Merely saying all he did was perfect is shameful. It is false and leads any neutral observers to lose confidence in their case,"" said Gerhardt. Gerhardt was a witness for both sides in the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and in the Trump impeachment hearings in the House, and Nadler played some of his testimony at the start of Thursday's session. He says he regrets that there are no joint witnesses in the current impeachment process. ""The breach between the parties is much worse than it was 20 years ago, and it was bad then."" The importance of hearing from additional witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, has been a key focus for the Democrats. It will likely come up again in their final day of arguments as they attempt to prove the second article of impeachment and show that Trump obstructed Congress by stymying the inquiry into how he handled the Ukraine matter. They'll need to convince at least two Republicans (along with the two independents, who are expected to vote with Democrats) to get the 51-member majority they need to vote in favour of calling of witnesses once Trump's defence team presents their case. Adam Schiff, the congressman leading the prosecution, has goaded senators over the past two days, hinting at the incriminating details that might be in the diplomatic cables and other subpoenaed documents that the Democrats have also requested but that the White House has thus far refused to release.  ""They're yours for the asking,"" he told senators on the first day of arguments. WATCH | Adam Schiff calls on senators to demand the release of subpoenaed documents: ""As they built the narrative, they would establish what they knew, argue that it was strong enough to impeach based on what they knew and then say, 'But wouldn't you also want to know this?'"" Louis Seidman, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center, said of the Democrats' strategy. It's a strategy that seems to be tapping into public sentiment. An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken Jan. 20-23 found that 66 per cent of Americans, including 45 per cent of Republicans, agreed that the Senate should call new witnesses to testify. ""They have to sustain public support for witnesses. In fact, get it to increase if they can, because that puts pressure on the susceptible Republicans who might be willing to vote that way,"" Seidman said. Rick Scott, of Florida, is one of those Republicans. But he told reporters Thursday that Democrats had their chance to pursue witnesses during the House hearings and could have gone to court to fight the president's refusal to comply with their subpoenas. He and other Republicans have, however, said they want Hunter Biden to testify about his association with Ukrainian energy company Burisma, where he was a paid member of the board from 2014 to 2019. Trump and other Republicans have alleged Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to dismiss the country's prosecutor general in order to shield Burisma from a corruption investigation. In their arguments Thursday, Democrats tried to debunk that theory and show that Biden's actions were part a wider international effort to root out corruption.  ""The whole idea of a fair trial is you bring in relevant witnesses,"" said Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on her way into the Senate chamber Wednesday. ""Relevant witnesses here are people who know what Donald Trump did and what his intent was and what its impact was on our national security and on the security of the Ukraine. Hunter Biden doesn't have any knowledge of that or any bearing on that."" Her fellow presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar said she's been keeping the pressure up on her Republican colleagues, urging them to at least agree to hear from witnesses, even if they don't vote to remove Trump from office.  ""Why are you here if you're not going to stand up?"" she said she told senators. Democrats used strong language in their presentation to the Senate to characterize Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to announce investigations that the House managers said served only his own interests: ""plot,"" ""scheme,"" ""unprecedented coverup."" (He countered with some of his favourite terms: Nadler was a ""sleazebag""; Schiff a ""con job"" and the trial ""a hoax,"" he said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.) They went to great lengths to underscore the gravity of the charges and the historic nature of the process, repeatedly invoking the so-called Framers of the Constitution. ""Impeachment is not for petty offences,"" Nadler said on the second day of arguments. ""It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or unpopular. "" And if there was any doubt about just how sombre of an occasion it was, the opening words of the sergeant at arms at the start of every session were there to remind us: ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."" As were the stern security staff who were quick to reprimand reporters and lookers-on for the smallest infraction, handing them a photocopied list of rules, with the one they've violated emphatically underlined: no cellphones, no talking, no eating, no leaning, no standing. WATCH | Adam Schiff they'll be authors of their own decline if they don't hold Trump accountable: In advance of their final day of arguments, the managers presenting the Democrats' case issued a warning to those who might be convinced Trump abused the power of his office but hesitant to remove him. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,"" Schiff said near the end of another nine-hour-plus session. ""For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won."" But it will take more than that to convince Trump's most vocal defenders in the Senate that he must go. ""When it comes to replacing this president nine months-plus from the election, you've got an uphill battle with me, because I really do believe that the best group people to pick a president are the voters,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters. Even Seidman, who supports the impeachment process, thinks a vote to remove Trump would be risky and potentially destabilizing given that a percentage of Americans would find such a process tantamount to a coup d'état. It's also highly unlikely to happen, contingent as it is on a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats hold 47 of 100 seats. But that doesn't necessarily mean the impeachment process is a futile exercise, said Seidman. ""There is the impact that this has on the American people, on Trump's chances for re-election, on his historical reputation, on how much political power he has going forward,"" he said.

""They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,"" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told senators. ""And we can't allow that to happen."" The Trump legal team's arguments in the rare Saturday session were aimed at rebutting allegations that the president abused his power when he asked Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress as it tried to investigate. The lawyers are mounting a wide-ranging, aggressive defence asserting an expansive view of presidential powers and portraying Trump as besieged by political opponents determined to ensure he won't be re-elected this November. ""They're asking you to tear up all the ballots across this country on their own initiative,"" Cipollone said. Though Trump is the one on trial, the defence team made clear that it intends to paint the impeachment case as a mere continuation of the investigations that have shadowed the president since before he took office — including one into allegations of Russian election interference on his behalf. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow suggested Democrats were investigating the president over Ukraine simply because they couldn't bring him down for Russia. ""That — for this,"" said Sekulow, holding up a copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, which he accused Democrats of attempting to ""re-litigate."" That report detailed ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia but did not allege a criminal conspiracy to tip the election. From the White House, Trump added name-calling, tweeting that his team was making his case ""against lyin', cheatin', liddle' Adam ""Shifty"" Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nervous Nancy Pelosi"" and others of ""the Radical Left."" Trump's team made only a two-hour presentation, reserving the heart of its case for Monday. Acquittal appears likely, given that Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and a two-thirds vote would be required for conviction and removal from office. Republican senators already eager to clear Trump said Saturday that the White House presentation had shredded the Democratic case. Several of the senators shook hands with Trump's lawyers after their presentation. The Trump attorneys are responding to two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House — one that accuses him of encouraging Ukraine to investigate Biden at the same time the administration withheld military aid from the country, and the other that accuses him of obstructing Congress by directing aides not to testify or produce documents. Trump's defence team took centre stage following three days of methodical and passionate arguments from Democrats, who wrapped up Friday by warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election. They also implored Republicans to allow new testimony to be heard before senators render a final verdict. ""Give America a fair trial,"" said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead Democratic impeachment manager. ""She's worth it."" In making their case that Trump invited Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, the seven Democratic prosecutors peppered their arguments with video clips, email correspondence and lessons in American history. On Saturday morning, House managers made the procession across the Capitol at 9:30 to deliver the 28,578-page record of their case to the Senate. Republicans accused Democrats of cherrypicking evidence and omitting information favorable to the president, casing in a nefarious light actions that the president was legitimately empowered to take. They focused particular scorn on Schiff, playing clips of past statements meant to undercut his credibility. Schiff responded on Twitter that Republicans were ""trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth."" He later added: ""What was most striking to me was ... they don't contest the basic architecture of the scheme."" The Trump team had teased the idea that it would draw attention on Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was vice president. But neither Biden was a focus of Saturday arguments. Instead, Republicans argued that there was no evidence that Trump made the security aid contingent on Ukraine announcing an investigation into the Bidens and that Ukraine didn't even know that the money had been paused until shortly before it was released. Trump had reason to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine and he ultimately released the aid, they said. ""Most of the Democratic witnesses have never spoken to the president at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance,"" said deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura. Watch: Democrats go on offence at impeachment trial Pupura told the senators the other main reason for the July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for the Biden investigation was in line with the president's concerns about corruption, though Trump never mentioned that word, according to the rough transcript released by the White House. Pupura said everyone knows that when Trump asked Zelensky to ""do us a favour,"" he meant the U.S., not himself. ""This entire impeachment process is about the house managers' insistence that they are able to read everybody's thoughts,"" Sekulow said. ""They can read everybody's intention. Even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong."" After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud &amp; deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer &amp; their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V. Defence lawyers say Trump was a victim not only of Democratic rage but also of overzealous agents and prosecutors. Sekulow cited mistakes made by the FBI in its surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide in the now-concluded Trump-Russia election investigation. ""You cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum,"" he said. One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, is expected to argue next week that an impeachable offense requires criminal-like conduct, even though many legal scholars say that's not true. The Senate is heading next week toward a pivotal vote on Democratic demands for testimony from top Trump aides, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, who refused to appear before the House. It would take four Republican senators to join the Democratic minority to seek witnesses, and so far the numbers appear lacking. The Democrats' challenge was clear as they tried to convince not just senators but an American public divided over the Republican president in an election year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-defence-arguments-1.5440604,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-democrats-final-arguments-1.5439716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-case-so-far-1.5438816 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-trump-1.5437770 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966,N/A
692,Jennifer Sweet,2019-05-17T08:30:00.586Z,St. Mary's woman scammed by fake Microsoft tech-support warns others,"A woman from St. Mary's First Nation in Fredericton is speaking out after she was targeted by an online pop-up scam. Sheila Brooks said she was using the internet on her laptop at home on May 4, when a black box with computer codes in it flashed across her screen. There was also an alarm sound and a warning that her bank account was at risk of being defrauded within the next three hours. Brooks said she called the toll-free number on the screen and was connected with what seemed like the Microsoft Corporation. ""I said, 'Oh, Microsoft.' It's got to be legit, right?"" An agent assured her she would help protect her account and asked for permission to access Brooks's computer in order to guide her through the process. The fraudster also asked for the number to call Brooks's bank. They were connected to what sounded like her real telephone banking number and a second fraudster, who explained she would have to secure her money by buying Google Play gift cards. They can be used to buy apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, and books online, but Brooks said at the time, she had no idea what they were for. She had some hesitation and proposed going directly to the bank and withdrawing her money as an alternative. But the fake bank agent told her doing so would make it look like she was working with the ""fraudsters."" The woman agent directed Brooks to the nearest stores selling Google Play cards. She had been to two locations, where she purchased $900 worth of cards, and was at a third store trying to buy about another $1,000 worth when her bank card was declined. The clerk at that store asked her if she was sure she needed that many cards and even hinted it could be a scam, but Brooks said she was in an agitated state and the fraudsters had advised her not to reveal why she was buying the cards because the store would charge her extra fees. Outside the store, Brooks looked around frantically. She couldn't complete her ""mission,"" and she was going to be late for work. That's when she spotted her daughter across the parking lot. Brooks flagged her over and explained what was going on, despite the protests of the woman on the other end of the phone line. The daughter recognized the deception instantly. ""She grabbed the phone and said, 'Who is this? This is a scam?' And the woman on the phone hung up."" Brooks said she had never heard of this type of scam before and was very upset to find someone had swindled her by impersonating a reputable corporation. ""I'm just so angry … We don't trust corporations with a good name anymore?"" ""They make it sound like it's a legitimate thing to somebody my age, who's not that savvy with computers and the knowledge that there's so many scammers out there,"" said Brooks, who is 66. ""It's a tough lesson to learn."" Fortunately, she had only been able to scratch off the coating on two gift cards, worth $100 and $10, to reveal and share the redemption codes with the fraudsters. So far, she's been unable to get back her money for the other cards. ""I told my family, 'If you need Google Play money come see me. I'll give it to you real cheap."" She changed her bank accounts and is taking her computer into the shop for cleaning. Brooks said it only hit her after the fact how much worse it could have been. ""If I'd had the time, I probably would have spent every cent they needed to 'secure' my money."" ""It makes me sick."" ""I thought I was a pretty tough kid. I'm always looking out for me and my husband and my kids and they could have taken it away in a second."" Brooks shared her story as a warning to others. She feels more needs to be done to spread the word about this sort of fraud. She listens to the radio and reads the paper but said she doesn't spend much time on social media or the internet. ""Yes, I should have known. ... I should have known when I talked to the bank. When he said, 'You have to buy security cards.' That should have been a red flag. And it kind of hit in the pit of my stomach. Then I said, 'Well, it must be legit because we called the bank, and it was the iconic voice saying this is what you need to do."" The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says tech support scams have been around since about 2010 and are still very common. In 2018, there were 1,391 reports of it, and 821 victims lost a total of about $876,000. ""They'll spoof legitimate companies to deceive consumers into clicking on links or calling a toll-free number,"" said Jeff Thomson, manager of the centre's fraud prevention intake unit. If not Microsoft, it's sometimes Google, IBM, or HP.  The messages in the pop-ups can be quite alarming, said Thomson, and in some cases they are difficult to close. ""You've really got to have your wits about you and take a step back and pause and ask yourself, 'Is this normal?' ""Nobody's going to ask you to pay for a service … with Google Play cards."" The anti-fraud centre does about 200 presentations a year at schools, seniors centres and crime-prevention forums, said Thomson. ""We know prevention is key.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/tech-support-scam-1.5138736,[],N/A
