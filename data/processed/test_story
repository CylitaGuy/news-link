Snow all but over ahead of a bitterly cold Tuesday for P.E.I.

Following Sunday's snowfall, crews continue to work to clear roads across the province on Monday. Environment Canada said flurries paired with dropping temperatures could be expected Monday with northerly winds of 30 km/h and gusts to about 50 km/h. Temperatures are likely to fall to about –8 C Monday afternoon, with a wind chill making it feel like –16.  At midafternoon Monday, the province's road conditions map showed partly covered roads in Charlottetown and the main roads in and out, as far as Crapaud, Morell, Wood Islands and almost to Kensington. Route 315 from Wood Islands to Montague was also partly covered. CBC meteorologist Jay Scotland said no significant snowfall is expected Monday, but the brisk winds could mean blowing snow on exposed roads.  Temperatures will also continue to fall tonight ahead of a fairly sunny but bitterly cold Tuesday, he said. Here's a look at snowfall totals from Sunday's storm courtesy of volunteers. Most areas saw between 10-20 cm as expected. Just scattered flurries today but temperatures will continue to fall this afternoon and tonight ahead of a fairly sunny but COLD Tuesday. Earlier on Monday, RCMP said main roads on the Island were slushy and slippery, with side roads snow-covered and very slippery, but salt "doing its job." Dispatchers were asking Islanders to give themselves a little extra time to clear vehicles of snow and to drive carefully.  We are on patrol this morning. Main Roads are slushy (and slippery) with the salt doing it’s job. Side roads are snow covered and very slippery. Not a good morning to be rushing around so... leave a little earlier than normal and take your time!!! Both the French Language School Board and the Public Schools Branch opened after a one-hour delay.
