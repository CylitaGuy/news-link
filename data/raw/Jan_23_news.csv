0,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-18T23:09:29.618Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan will give up royal titles, public funding","Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer be working members of the Royal Family and will, therefore, no longer use their royal titles or taxpayer money, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace released Saturday. ""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty and hastily called family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal Family and spending more time in North America. In a surprising Instagram message posted at the beginning of 2020, the pair called the move ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement. It will remain the couple's U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy, was the subject of scrutiny last year. Media reports revealed renovations to the building — which cost an estimated £2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)  — were coming from the Sovereign Grant, the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A | Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, Markle didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporter Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there are ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

1,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-15T16:17:03.386Z,Pesticide on planes: Parents call for changes after cabin fumigated with passengers on board,"Rania Khunaysir didn't see it coming when she booked a last-minute Caribbean vacation for her young family. The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabin would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica, despite guidelines that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly.  ""Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a non-toxic insecticide ... I thought insecticide doesn't sound non-toxic,"" Khunaysir told Go Public about the family's flight last August. Khunaysir's husband Randy Beharry and their three-year-old daughter are both asthmatic. The couple's son, who was seven months old at the time, was also on the flight. ""I was worried about my kids."" Beharry said. ""My asthma triggered probably within minutes. I had a hard time breathing,"" The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strict rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly. ""I don't want to be inhaling this pesticide,"" Khunaysir said.  More than two dozen countries, such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada. The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease. The World Health Organization has said it has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended, but also says non-chemical methods need to be found.   The long-standing practice is raising concerns among some health experts. ""There is no such thing as a non-toxic pesticide,"" said researcher Chris van Netten, a professor emeritus with the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health. He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides ""not acceptable"" and said airline crew members and passengers need to be better informed and protected — especially children, older travellers and those with respiratory problems.  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk, Ont., flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed.  She said people on her flight in April 2018 were coughing and wheezing.  ""I think the public should have been aware ... that there is a spraying in these countries … and [told] a little bit more about the chemical they're spraying,"" she said. She now takes her own mask when she's travelling to hotter countries.  Harlene Hart from Newington, southeast of Ottawa, was on her way to Cuba on another Sunwing flight in February, a birthday present from her boyfriend, when the cabin was sprayed with pesticide about an hour before they landed.  ""Insecticide should be sprayed in a well-ventilated area,"" she told Go Public in an email. ""Not a sardine can with partially reused air."" What upsets her most, she said, is that she wasn't clearly notified before she purchased her ticket. She said she wouldn't have taken the trip if she had known. Canadian airlines are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will be sprayed with insecticide — despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who say the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks, skin irritations and long-term problems with the nervous system. Transport Canada said there's nothing it can do, but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose a ""foreseeable hazard.""  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek. It is unverified, but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the ""top-of-descent"" disinsection procedure, which involves spraying while passengers are on board.  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009 where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get ""advice from their own physician ... on whether they should travel to those destinations."" That advisory sets guidelines — not rules — saying airlines should notify passengers: • Before they purchase their tickets. • On the flight ticket itself. • Before boarding the aircraft. None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods.  WestJet points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to, and two other airlines that fly to these countries — Sunwing and Air Transat — say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask. Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airline's ""General Conditions of Carriage."" Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes.  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its ""Health Tips"" section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada.  However, passengers won't see that link if they book through third party websites like Khunaysir did when she booked her Air Canada flight. Van Netten, who has studied the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides, said the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabins isn't getting through. He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better. ""People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to.""  The practice of fumigating an airplane's cabin started decades ago. It's mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects — such as malaria and yellow fever — before entering certain tropical countries.  Twenty-seven countries require Canadian airlines to spray. Two methods are used, according to the Transport Canada website: spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplane's interior surfaces before passengers board. ""Both of them have their problems,"" van Netten said.  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on, noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system. ""Tingling in the fingers for instance — that's how it would start. And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment ... but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage."" The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin, a pesticide that's been approved by the World Health Organization for what's called ""disinsection"" on flights.  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying.  ""We get reports of a sore throat, sore eyes … lots of skin conditions,"" said Troy Winters, senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ""I've got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebody's hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction.""   He's concerned about the long-term effects of repeated exposure on airline staff, saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career. ""Recently I've started to see some reports of potential longer-term results and I'm concerned about potential long-term neurological effects.""  There are no industry-wide rules on what, if any, protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating.  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff. Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use, suggesting a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated.  The U.S. has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket.  The Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization Act also recommends the U.S. government work with WHO to find a ""safe, effective, and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft."" There are non-spraying methods being developed, like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction, but they are still in the testing stages.  WHO says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly, but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018, it said there is a need for new ""nonchemical"" methods. For now, travellers have few options — such as choosing to travel to countries that don't require spraying, travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying starts and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in. Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues, they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that they'd be sprayed.  ""I'm really surprised that they allow this to continue,"" Khunaysir said. ""I would've had no problem saying, 'Let's change our destination, let's go somewhere else, where they don't require that.'""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

2,Amina Zafar,2020-01-23T02:08:58.060Z,How Canadian hospitals and airports are preparing for new coronavirus,"Health-care workers on the front lines of Canada's preparations for the new coronavirus are gearing up to treat potential infections and prevent spread. Those preparations will continue regardless of whether or not the World Health Organization declares the outbreak spreading in and beyond China a global health emergency on Thursday. The agency was expected to  make a decision on Wednesday but delayed, citing lack of information. China remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with more than 500 cases. Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have also confirmed cases. The head of the WHO's health emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said the priority now is to find out how the virus is passing between people and to limit it. ""We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" he said. Given the speed of global travel, Canadian officials have said they would not be surprised if the virus lands here. If so, airport screening would offer one measure in efforts to control the spread. But passengers arriving here may not show any symptoms for days, which is why hospitals and health-care officials are getting ready. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> Standard infection control practices like isolating potentially sick patients are key, experts say. At Toronto General Hospital's emergency department, staff have already had some practice in the form of three patients who tested negative. ""We've had three patients come in with a travel history who presented with these symptoms,"" said nurse Debra Davies, the manager of the emergency department. ""They've done a phenomenal job in getting those patients into the isolation."" ""As long as we keep an eye on it, we should be well prepared,"" she said. Davies is a veteran of the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 that infected more than 400 people in Canada and killed 44. Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in northwest Toronto, says there were lessons learned from SARS. ""I can't stress enough how incredibly unprepared we were for SARS,"" he said. ""We're in such a better position now."" During that outbreak, Gardam recalls running around trying to buy respirators and setting up negative pressure rooms to isolate patients. When Humber River opened in 2015, it was designed with outbreaks and infection control in mind, and such equipment and design principles are built into the new hospital. Horacio Arruda, head of Quebec's public health authority, said Wednesday five people in that province were under surveillance for possible exposure.  Hospitals in Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia have also announced preparations for cases.  The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) acts as the lead agency for dealing with the coronavirus, through the Quarantine Act. Under PHAC's direction, Canada Border Services Agency officials will now ask travellers: ""Have you been in Wuhan, China, in the past 14 days?"" There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. Additional signs at airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will remind passengers to speak to border officials if they have flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough.  ""We are in the process of putting up signs on the electronic screens warning travellers that if they've been to an affected area to essentially determine if they've been in contact with live animals, sick people,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday on CBC's Power & Politics. If so, CBSA agents can alert a federal quarantine officer to do an assessment, which could include a temperature check. Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory as well as provincial government labs in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have a battery of tests to detect respiratory pathogens, including one that's in the works for the new coronavirus, Allen said.   So far, Canada is not planning to use thermal imaging to monitor travellers en masse, as was tested during the SARS outbreak. Tam said the current assessment of the risk to Canada is ""low."" Steven Hoffman, a law professor and director of the Global Strategy Lab at Toronto's York University, and an expert on global health, supports Canada's screening approach so far. ""Not everyone who has a high temperature is going to have this novel coronavirus. In fact, only a very small percentage would,"" said Hoffman. The first U.S. patient illustrates one of the weaknesses of airport screening — the man in his 30s did not have symptoms when he arrived and was in good condition, so he wouldn't be picked up in a check for fever. Rather, when the man started feeling ill, he went to a doctor, with a fever and cough. Lab tests confirmed the infection and he was put into isolation for monitoring. Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician in Toronto, said there's a delay between when people are infected and when they develop symptoms — the incubation period. For coronaviruses in general, such as those that can cause the common cold, the incubation period is typically five or six days. With coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, the incubation period can extend to 14 days. ""You can imagine if an individual is infected and they get on a plane and it could be up to two weeks before they manifest symptoms. In today's world you could literally go around the Earth before you start to develop illness,"" said Khan, founder and CEO of BlueDot, a digital health company that helps predict the spread of infectious diseases globally. ""We need to kind of think about that in the context of how airport screening works. The value of airport screening and engagement with travellers, if you will, is more about giving them the information they need so that if they do become sick after they've left the airport they know what to do."" Health officials stress precautions for travellers to  prevent infection while in China, such as staying away from animal markets, washing hands, observing cough hygiene, not coming into contact with sick people and telling health-care providers about their travel if flu-like symptoms occur.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,[],N/A
3,Erica Johnson,2019-04-02T17:51:22.864Z,"Bell customer's 5-month fight is 1 of almost 10,000 recent complaints to telco mediator","Matthew Tomlinson spent five months trying to get Bell to give him a TV package at the price he was promised. The 47-year-old Ottawa computer analyst says a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package last June, which cost him an extra $50 per month. ""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. Frustrated, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the telecom mediator, the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS). His complaint is included in a mid-year report released today by the CCTS, indicating that the number of Canadians unhappy with their telco service providers continues to climb. The CCTS says it accepted 9,831 complaints between August 2018 and January 2019 — a 44 per cent increase over the same period the previous year. The biggest issues for consumers: billing disputes, misleading contract terms or non-disclosure of information and poor quality of service. ""It's unfortunate that we see the same issues on a regular, recurring basis,"" CCTS commissioner Howard Maker told Go Public. He says by the time consumers have filed a complaint with his organization, they are often at their wits' end. ""It's difficult to see them all have to spend time and resources on things that maybe didn't need to have occurred, if better processes had been in place in the front end."" Ninety-two per cent of complaints to the mediator were resolved, although the CCTS could not address 6,413 other complaints beyond its mandate, including customer service, pricing and operating practices and policies. The country's largest service provider continued to receive a disproportionately high number of consumer complaints - Bell Canada was the subject of 3,034 complaints. Rogers received 915 complaints. For the first time, Cogeco placed third on the list, with 790 complaints, after an upgrade to its computer system led to customers losing service and being unable to contact technical support. Telus received 746 complaints, making it the fourth most-complained-about telecom provider. Freedom Mobile, owned by Shaw, expanded its service areas last year and placed fifth on the list, with 637 complaints. Customers filed the most complaints about cellphone issues (37.1 per cent), followed by problems with internet (27.8 per cent) and TV services (18.2 per cent). Canadians were only recently able to file complaints about TV services. That process was introduced into the CCTS mandate in September 2017. Tomlinson's complaint last fall said he paid an extra $50 per month after a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package.""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. ""Every time they told me that something was being fixed, it was never fixed. Every deadline or date they gave me … none of those deadlines were met."" Tomlinson estimates he went back to a Bell retail store more than 10 times, to try to sort out his billing issues. On top of that, he says, he spent countless hours on the phone to Bell. ""I'd go to sales and sales told me, 'No, this is a billing problem, you have to talk to billing.' So there was this really circular logic they were employing to simply keep me from being able to fix my bill."" Finally, Tomlinson complained to Bell's escalation department — but he still didn't hear back, so he filed a complaint with the CCTS. ""This is the most deplorable customer service I've ever experienced,"" he says. ""And I just didn't want it to go unchecked and unnoticed."" In an email to Go Public, Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson wrote, ""This kind of customer experience is rare, and we apologize to Mr. Tomlinson. We have provided coaching to all team members involved to ensure these kinds of mistakes are not repeated."" Gibson also noted that Bell's share of CCTS complaints ""declined more than any other service provider"" — by 2.4 per cent. Mike Polera says he filed a complaint last fall with the CCTS, after his experience trying to move his wife's cellphone from another service provider to his Rogers account. In terms of frustration, ""on a scale of one to 10, this was a 12,"" says Polera, a small business consultant based in Toronto. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Polera first contacted Rogers using a live chat agent, so he was able to save a copy of his chat and have a record of what was promised. When he went to a Rogers retail store to set up his wife's account, store reps couldn't help him and said there were no notes on his file. ""I actually had everything in writing and then found out that none of it was actually applied to my account,"" says Polera. ""It really made me angry. I felt completely taken advantage of."" In frustration, Polera took his cellphone business to another service provider. He says Rogers then charged him for services the company never delivered, including a $65 charge for a phone number that wasn't Polera's, and an activation fee. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'This is absolutely ridiculous',"" says Polera. ""Then I got angry."" After he wrote to the CCTS, Rogers issued him a credit for more than $350. Rogers spokesperson Sarah Schmidt told Go Public, ""We strive to deliver solutions for our customers the first time they contact us, and in this case we let Mr. Polera down. We see every customer complaint as an opportunity, and we have taken steps to ensure other customers do not experience the same situation."" A telecom watchdog says problems continue to exist in the telecom industry because companies get away with treating customers poorly. ""Fundamentally, the biggest problem with our system right now is there there aren't any strong penalties in place for the telecoms when they do something wrong,"" says OpenMedia's executive director Laura Tribe. ""Clearly, going through the CCTS and having a complaint filed is not a big enough threat to the telecoms to stop this behaviour."" Recently, the CRTC issued a report calling for more measures to prevent telecom companies from using aggressive and misleading sales practices. The recommendations are the result of an eight-month public inquiry conducted by the telecom regulator, prompted in part by months of stories by Go Public about the pressure on telco employees to upsell and mislead customers in order to meet sales targets. Rogers employees say managers turn a blind eye The CRTC report, issued in February, said harmful sales practices ""exist in all sales channels, including in store, online, over the phone, and door to door."" Among other things, the CRTC report recommended creating a mandatory internet code of conduct that could include price protections during a contract, and requiring telcos to allow a cooling-off period after purchasing products and services. Matthew Tomlinson says he still gets angry when he thinks about the hours involved trying to rectify his Bell bill, and the time thousands of other Canadians are spending, in similar situations. ""We don't want to be spending all this extra time away from our children, away from work, away from vacation planning, in order to deal with a problem that ultimately, in the end, it only took about 10 minutes to fix.""

4,"Karissa Donkin, Jacques Poitras",2019-11-25T10:00:00.602Z,Former Joi Scientific employee says he debunked technology NB Power spent millions on,"A former employee of Joi Scientific said he debunked claims the company made about its hydrogen technology but quit after being unsatisfied with the company's response to his findings. NB Power is facing an end-of-year deadline to prove the Florida startup's hydrogen technology works, or the provincial government will pull the plug on the utility's Florida lab, which costs about $20,000 a month to run. The company has claimed it has found an efficient way to generate hydrogen from seawater on demand, something that would be a major innovation. NB Power and the Regional Development Corporation spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas has maintained the technology has ""potential."" ""We had independent validation and measurements, but there were parts that could not be measured,"" Thomas said at a legislature committee on Nov. 1. ""Some assumptions had been made. We're now back into an area where it's still promising but not to the same levels as we initially thought."" But according to Austin Walker, who worked at Joi Scientific as a lab technician between 2018 and 2019, the technology, or mechanism, as it was often called, is nothing new. ""They always said, 'the mechanism is doing this or that,' but there was never actually a defined mechanism,"" Walker said. ""There was always just vague theories."" The company was always keen to differentiate its technology from electrolysis, an established process that uses electricity to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen, Walker said. Electrolysis is considered wholly inefficient for power generation. But Walker said he proved to company executives that its technology is essentially just electrolysis by another name. That would make the company's claim of 200 per cent efficiency impossible, Walker said, because it would violate a law of thermodynamics that says ""you cannot create energy just kind of out of nowhere."" Walker was only 21 years old when he started at the company, fresh out of school, in the fall of 2018. Yet, he said that he was able to determine over the course of just a few months that the company's technology was nothing new. He had just finished a bachelor's degree in biology, with a minor in chemistry, at East Central University in Oklahoma when he was hired at Joi Scientific in October 2018. His job ranged from doing ""basic chemistry experiments to just learning more about the technology"" under the direction of the vice-president of science. Before his job interview, Walker reviewed Joi Scientific's website and its promotional materials. One marketing video, which claims that ""Joi Scientific has solved the problems that have kept hydrogen from being widely used for energy,"" caught Walker's eye because the video's claims sounded like ""perpetual motion,"" he said. ""Our patented extraction process takes a tiny amount of energy to start a chemical process, making enough hydrogen to power the process itself and generate plenty more for use in fuel cells and engines and boilers,"" the video says. Walker assumed he was the one who didn't know enough about the subject, especially since the company is based in the Space Life Sciences Center at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. ""I kind of had a healthy dose of skepticism right from the start, but it wasn't until about one or two weeks in that I really kind of was like, 'OK, yeah … something's not right here,'"" Walker said. Walker said the company came up with a slideshow for investors that includes a bullet-point list of reasons why its technology was not electrolysis. CBC News has not seen that list. ""I would look at that list of things and be like, 'None of that really makes sense, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact opposite in my own experimentation,'"" Walker said. A few months into his job at Joi Scientific, Walker began testing the bullet points from the list during his lunch breaks and said he was able to disprove one point in ""20 minutes at most."" In May, about two months after he began doing experiments to test the company's claims, Walker said, the company allowed him 15 minutes to present his findings at a staff meeting.  He said he was able to prove all but one point wrong. He also used part of his presentation to explain how electrolysis works. ""A lot of people didn't grasp the full weight of what I had said, so what I did after that is I went to people individually and kind of explained things,"" Walker said. He said these people included Robert Koeneman, the company's president and senior vice-president of technology. ""I went with Rob out to get drinks and kind of explain to him all of my thoughts in detail, to the point where I knew I had done my best to explain to him why everything was wrong,"" Walker said. On a call in midsummer, Joi Scientific told its shareholders that its technology didn't work as previously described, according to a record of the call obtained by CBC News. On that call, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy admitted the company had been calculating power incorrectly. But Kennedy didn't mention Walker's findings in May that Joi Scientific was performing electrolysis and didn't have groundbreaking technology. Walker is the second former Joi Scientific employee to raise concerns about the company's technology. He is also one of at least eight Joi Scientific employees who are no longer with the company. At its height this year, the company had about 20 employees, according to interviews with former employees and a review of LinkedIn profiles.  In addition to Walker, the departures included two executives who were in charge of science and engineering. NB Power declined an interview request for this story. Joi Scientific also declined an interview request. In an emailed statement, vice-president of marketing Vicky Harris said the company ""remains as committed as ever to continuing our work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" She said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. Her statement didn't elaborate on the delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. Even though there were reportedly third-party verifications of Joi Scientific's technology, Walker believes people often ""take it for granted that you know what you're talking about."" ""Those third-party companies couldn't spend a month of testing like I did to check every little thing,"" Walker said. ""They had to take some of the stuff on faith and, yeah, I think that's probably how that happened."" In addition to operating a lab in Florida in the same building as Joi Scientific, NB Power has been sending its own employees, plus some engineers from Stantec, to work with Joi's technology. A spokesperson for Stantec declined an interview request to talk about its work on the Joi Scientific project. ""We are not authorized to speak to this matter, as per our agreement with our client,""  Stantec spokesperson Ashley Warnock wrote in an email. Expense reports show at least nine NB Power employees, including Thomas, have travelled to Joi's headquarters since 2016.  But it's not clear whether NB Power's own testing ever flagged any of the same issues Walker found during his lunch breaks. According to an Oct. 26, 2016, briefing note from NB Power, Joi Scientific's hydrogen production system is ""consistently repeatable"" and Joi's ""methodology used to evaluate the system's production ratio is reasonable and justifiable."" ""NB Power observed input to output ratio results which exceeded 100%,"" the briefing note says. It goes on to say the test results and data were consistent with claims made by Joi Scientific and ""with previous observations made at Joi Scientific at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [in August 2016]."" It said NB Power's technical representative, an unnamed senior nuclear physicist, ""has spent approximately 24 hours of lab time with the system"" and ""has gained sufficient knowledge to understand the system's operation at a basic level and has confidence that the technology could be readily transferred to NB Power.""  Speaking to CBC News in May 2019, Thomas was a believer. ""We have seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,"" Thomas said. Earlier this month, Thomas acknowledged the technology hasn't reached 70 per cent efficiency but maintained it still has ""potential.""  Walker became frustrated after attending a meeting with shareholders in May, where he said the company didn't mention any of the problems he said he raised earlier that month. ""It just seemed like they weren't even trying to portray the actuality of the company's situation, and I just felt that was kind of unethical,"" Walker said in an interview. ""Especially when some people were talking about continuing to invest more money into their company.""  Thomas, who sits on Joi Scientific's board, also attended that meeting, according to Walker. Walker described the tone as positive and said shareholders heard ""vague empty promises"" that he felt the company should have known wouldn't pan out.  ""I thought that there was just a line that crossed for me,"" he said. Walker said he quit his job later that day. He believes NB Power needs to audit things better before putting money in and suggested the utility should have sent electrochemists to assess the Joi Scientific technology. NB Power didn't respond to a question about how many, if any, electrochemists were sent to evaluate Joi's technology before it was licensed. ""I thought that the investors and people have a right to know how much their money is being wasted, especially if it's a government-run power company like it is in New Brunswick,"" Walker said.

5,Melissa Couto,2020-01-22T17:25:21.194Z,Larry Walker becomes 2nd Canadian elected to Baseball Hall of Fame,"When Larry Walker packed up his car for his first spring training in 1985, he didn't expect to be embarking on a path that would lead him to the National Baseball Hall of Fame 35 years later. The Maple Ridge, B.C., native — just two years removed from giving up on a hockey dream — barely even knew the rules of baseball back then. ""I had no idea,"" Walker said Tuesday on a conference call shortly after learning he had been elected into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. ""As I signed that contract and drove down to Florida to go to spring training and play baseball, I never knew the rules of the game or much about the game. ""You know, I [was] a hockey player. You grow up in Canada that's what's in your blood and veins and so baseball was something I had to learn along the way. Once I figured it all out and learned how to play and became more successful, then the road became a little bit clearer of what the possibilities were if I was able to be successful."" Walker's successes were plentiful: three batting titles, seven Gold Gloves, five all-star appearances, a National League MVP award. And soon, a plaque in Cooperstown. Walker received 76.6 per cent of the vote by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in his 10th and final year on the ballot, narrowly surpassing the 75 per cent required for induction by just six votes. WATCH | Walker gets call to Hall: There were times he thought he might not get there, though. The 53-year-old expressed doubts in a tweet earlier in the day. ""That was just how I felt and I shared that with all honesty,"" said Walker, who had received just 54.6 per cent of the votes last year. ""And then the call comes. ... that number popped up on the phone and I think I uttered the words 'oh [expletive],' and maybe an 'oh my God' or whatever it was before I actually answered the phone and said hello. ""And just to hear them ask if they could speak to Larry Walker, and the rest was almost in disbelief to hear them say 'you didn't come up short this year, you passed the 75 per cent threshold and welcome to the Hall of Fame.' Pretty amazing."" As the first Canadian Hall of Famer ever inducted, I couldn’t be prouder and happier to welcome my friend and fellow Canadian Larry Walker to the Hall! 🇨🇦 <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/halloffame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#halloffame</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Cdnmooselips33?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Cdnmooselips33</a> <a href=""https://t.co/Ve1VuGvlgO"">pic.twitter.com/Ve1VuGvlgO</a> The former Colorado Rockies and Montreal Expos slugger will become just the second Canadian elected to the Hall. Pitcher Fergie Jenkins of Chatham, Ont., was inducted in 1991. The 77-year-old Jenkins sent Walker a congratulatory message on Twitter moments after the announcement. ""As the first Canadian Hall of Famer ever inducted, I couldn't be prouder and happier to welcome my friend and fellow Canadian Larry Walker to the Hall!"" Jenkins said. Walker, the 1997 NL MVP, is joined in this year's induction class by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who amassed 99.7 per cent of the vote. Jeter fell short of a unanimous ballot by just one vote in his first year of eligibility. The induction ceremony will be held in Cooperstown on July 26. WATCH | Larry Walker speaks to The National after his election: Walker, a career .313 hitter over 17 seasons, including 10 with Colorado, said he watched this year's vote results ""religiously"" unlike in his previous nine years on the ballot. ""This year had a chance, the other years didn't,"" the former outfielder said. ""These last two weeks, three weeks... seeing what was going on and watching peoples' votes come in and just sitting there looking at it, watching the number stay around 85 [per cent] past 200 votes, it honestly got me interested because there was a chance. In past years that never existed."" Walker hit an eye-popping .366 with a league-best 49 homers, 46 doubles and a career-high 130 runs batted in during his MVP season. His .452 on-base percentage that year, as well as his .720 slugging, also topped the NL. Walker signed with the Expos as an amateur free agent as a 17-year-old in 1984, five years before Canadians were first eligible for the MLB draft. His shift to baseball came after Walker had been cut from a junior hockey team. WATCH | The case for Larry Walker: ""I think I would probably be missing a few more teeth, there's one thing,"" Walker said when asked how his life would be different had he stuck to hockey. ""And I don't know if the success would have been there in hockey as it turned out in baseball so there's probably a better chance that maybe I would be back home in Maple Ridge doing some kind of a job there and this kind of conversation would never be happening, honestly. ""It was a decision I made pulling into a town in British Columbia and deciding I just didn't want to do it no more... The Montreal Expos signed me and I got that chance and I just kinda rolled with it."" Walker made his MLB debut in 1989 and played six seasons with Montreal before signing a free-agent deal with Colorado. He capped his career with 144 games over parts of two seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals from 2004-05. Larry gets the call to the Hall. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/HOF2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#HOF2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/qDNSipAQsF"">pic.twitter.com/qDNSipAQsF</a> Congratulatory messages poured in for Walker on social media from across Canada, including a nod from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""He's in! From the Montreal Expos all the way to the Baseball Hall of Fame — congratulations,"" Trudeau tweeted. Joey Votto also released a statement through the Cincinnati Reds' Twitter account.

France is preparing to target internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook with a three per cent tax on the revenues from their digital business in that country. Canada may eventually follow France's lead — but for now, it's not prepared to go it alone. Speaking while in transit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Wednesday, Small Business Minister Mary Ng said her government is looking at this issue in terms of what's in the best interests of Canadian businesses. ""I do think it's important to tackle this on a multilateral basis,"" she said. ""You do need to work through those processes."" Taxing multinational tech firms was part of the Liberals' re-election platform, which committed to ""work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations."" The proposal would tax the proceeds of online advertising and user data sales for digital firms with global revenues of more than $1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than $40 million. The Liberal platform projected $540 million in new revenue in 2020-21 from ""making multinational tech giants pay their fair share."" But Canada may not be able to proceed with its plans and start banking that kind of income this spring. Taxing multinational tech firms is easier said than done. Digital businesses models cross borders: a company may be headquartered and taxed in one country while it profits from its business activities in many others. That's why the 36 member countries of the OECD are trying to reach an international agreement on how to tax digital companies by mid-2020. Governments share a common concern: multinationals setting up in low-tax jurisdictions and avoiding taxes in others. Ng told CBC News Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to work though this process. Last fall, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among American industry groups urging the Trump administration to oppose Canada's adoption of a French-style digital tax. American digital companies believe they could be subject to ""double taxation,"" where they end up paying tax on the same revenue in both countries — something the tax treaty in place between the U.S. and Canada is supposed to prevent. The U.S. groups warned that the Liberal proposal could undermine American investments in the Canadian tech sector and be inconsistent with Canada's international trade commitments. World Trade Organization rules, as well as trade agreements like the recently renegotiated North American free trade deal, are supposed to prevent discrimination between foreign and domestic companies in areas like tax policy. Countries aren't allowed to create arbitrary rules to game the system in favour of their own corporations. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party also proposed taxing digital firms in the last election, said ""it makes no sense at all"" that an international foreign company could make money in Canada and not pay any taxes. Speaking during a break in caucus meetings Wednesday in preparation for the return of the House of Commons next week, Singh said that when working class people are paying their fair share, it's wrong for multinationals to do otherwise. He brushed aside the risk of retaliation. ""I don't think that we should live in fear of Mr. Trump. I don't think we should make decisions based on fear,"" he said. ""Particularly when our decisions are the right thing to do."" Talks Wednesday in Davos brought a temporary truce to a heated trade dispute over France's tax, which targets companies that have global revenues of over 750 million euros ($1.09 billion Canadian) and French revenue of over 25 million euros ($36 million Canadian). The thresholds are meant to offer French start-up companies room to grow. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he'd agreed to postpone collection of the tax until December — after the next U.S. election cycle — in return for a commitment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold off on the retaliatory sanctions President Donald Trump threatened to impose on French exports like champagne and cheese.

8,Avery Zingel,2020-01-21T02:17:39.870Z,"Here's how N.W.T. MLAs, auditor general's office reacted to foster parents' horror stories","N.W.T. politicians are responding to criticisms launched at the territory's troubled child welfare system, which foster families say is failing them and the children they care for. ""This is not going to go away,"" said Jackie Jacobson, MLA for Nunakput. On Friday, CBC published a letter from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. In subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. ""I know the frustrations that some [foster parents] are going through,"" said Jacobson. ""The whole system has got to be looked at."" Jacobson says he wants support for social workers, parents and families themselves who are navigating a system that is ""short staffed across the board.""  Everything comes down to the safety of children, said Jacobson.  The CBC contacted every sitting regular MLA to speak for this story. Members were in a budget meeting all day Friday. Kam Lake MLA Caitlin Cleveland, reflecting on the accounts from foster families this week, said in an email that it was ""very difficult to hear stories of people hurting, especially children."" Cleveland chairs the territorial government's Committee on Social Development, which will review and respond to the Foster Family Coalition's letter. ""I will continue to prioritize hearing their first-hand accounts to support the improvement of the N.W.T. foster care system,"" she wrote, thanking foster families for their trust and time. ""We need to ensure we are properly supporting social workers, birth families, and foster families to make sure we are supporting the success of our children."" The social development committee was previously tasked with reviewing the territorial government's response to the 2018 auditor general's report, authored by Glen Wheeler. Reached for comment on the Foster Family Coalition's letter, Wheeler said if change is going to happen, it might come down to political will. The auditor general doesn't ""have the power under the legislation to force a department to do anything,"" he said. ""It's up to MLAs as the elected representatives of the people and the minister of the department … to make sure the recommendations are fully implemented,"" said Wheeler. CBC reports about the treatment of foster families ""resonate with what we heard [in 2018],"" he said.  The last auditor general's report found there were no dedicated staff to manage the delivery of foster care across the territories. The system also didn't have support for caregivers beyond a daily rate provided to families, he said.  Asked whether a future report would consult foster families, Wheeler said the auditor general spoke to the Foster Family Coalition in 2014 and in 2018. ""I'm sure individual foster parents had important things to say … but the coalition, as a representative of the parents, was able to provide us with the perspective and information we needed to do our work,"" he said.  As of now, the auditor general has no plans for another audit.  It follows up on reviews, usually leaving a few years between reports, especially if recommendations need time to fulfil, said Wheeler. ""Given the severity of what we found in 2014 and the fact that when we went back in 2018, the situation in some ways was worse, it certainly is an area that we are going to continue to monitor,"" he said. The Auditor General of Canada has audited child and family services federally, and reviewed Yukon's delivery of child and family services. Asked whether any jurisdictions it audits are performing well, Wheeler said, ""if you look at other audit reports from other jurisdictions, it becomes obvious that most jurisdictions are struggling in this area."" ""It's a similar story unfortunately,"" he said.  Yellowknife North MLA Rylund Johnson said people who foster children are functionally frontline workers, but ""we don't often treat them as such."" Johnson wants the department to explain which of the coalition's recommendations it will take, and for the ones it rejects, he wants them to explain ""why we are not taking the suggestions from the people who are on the front lines."" He said MLAs have to support the department, and simultaneously, create policies that enable Indigenous children to stay in their communities.  ""At the end of the day, the state is taking Indigenous children from their homes. It's always going to be the most difficult thing we do as a government."" After the 2018 auditor general report, the territorial government increased funding to child and family services.  Auditor general reports, said Johnson, measure the government on how well it follows its own policies, but not whether they are the ""right policies."" ""That, from a political level, is the conversation we need to be having,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/child-welfare-mlas-1.5431953,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-foster-letter-response-1.5431878 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-care-nwt-family-stories-1.5429286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/foster-parents-letter-nwt-1.5427105,N/A

(NTI) and the government of Nunavut have renewed their commitment to work together with the signing of the Katujjiqatigiinniq Protocol.  The signing happened Tuesday in the Koojesse room of the Frobisher Inn. The government's cabinet and NTI's board witnessed the signing.  This isn't the first time NTI and Nunavut's government have recommitted to each other. The organizations have reaffirmed their partnership twice since 1999: first in 2004 and again in 2011, with the Clyde River Protocol.  Why now? — NTI's president Aluki Kotierk quipped: ""It's a new decade.""  This time, questions focused on how the two parties are handling what has appeared to be a fraught conversation on the future of education in the territory.  Nunavut's government is in the midst of updating the territory's Education Act and Inuit Languages Protection Act, via Bill 25. NTI had asked to have a larger role in the creation of the bill.  ""Certainly we have a difference of opinion, in terms of how we've worked together and whether or not it's been a partnership approach, in terms of Bill 25 specifically,"" Kotierk said.    One of the Katujjiqatigiinniq Protocol priorites is continuing to implement Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement, which provides Inuit the right to have a say in the government's social and cultural policies.  ""I think it's very interesting how the public perception might be that there are things that we're not working well on and that's where the interest often lies, but I think we have many examples where we work well together,"" Kotierk said.  She gave examples she was proud of, such as the tripartite agreement on health with the federal government, and issues related to poverty reduction. Nunavut's premier Joe Savikataaq added the agreement-in-principle on devolution to that list.  ""I think the timing is just right,"" Savikataaq said. ""We have ... a new minority government, which seems to be a lot more willing to work with partners. It's just something we felt the timing was appropriate."" If NTI and the territory can be united in their requests to the federal government, Savikataaq says he feels they will be more successful.  The agreement reaffirms structures that are already in place, including quarterly meetings between the premier and the president of NTI, and the goal of biweekly meetings between the CEO of NTI and the deputy minister of Nunavut's Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs.  NTI is the organization responsible for implementing the land claims agreement, now known as the Nunavut Agreement, and for representing Inuit in the territory. As Inuit are the territory's majority population, Kotierk says, it makes sense that the two collaborate on issues.  Savikataaq says the two groups will continue to have disagreements, but will work through them with meaningful consultation.  ""The land claim spells out our obligations and this is just to reinforce our obligations and our commitments to work together for the betterment of Nunavummiut,"" Savikataaq said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nti-government-nunavut-katujjiqatigiinniq-protocol-1.5435310,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/education-act-consultations-nunavut-1.4928172 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bill-25-nunavut-education-1.5377738 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/look-ahead-north-politics-2020-1.5411682,N/A

""The driver of the vehicle didn't have any indication that a child was getting off the bus."" The 67-year-old bus driver was issued a ticket under the Highway Traffic Act for failing to operate the flashing red lights on the bus. The offence carries a fine of $100. In an emailed statement, the Public Schools Branch said the driver has not driven a bus for the PSB since the incident.  ""The Public Schools Branch emphasizes procedure and safety protocol with all of its drivers and travelling students,"" the email said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-child-struck-by-vehicle-getting-off-school-bus-1.5426404 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewer-clog-charlottetown-1.5435153 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-school-federation-oppose-private-food-companies-1.5435050,N/A
13,Anonymous,2020-01-22T00:30:36.822Z,"The end of anonymity? Facial recognition app used by police raises serious concerns, say privacy advocates","Read Story Transcript A secretive facial recognition software used by hundreds of police forces is raising concerns after a New York Times investigation said it could ""end privacy as we know it."" Clearview A.I. has extracted more than three billion photos from public web sites like Facebook, Instagram, employment sites and others, and used them to create a database used by more than 600 law enforcement agencies in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere, according to Times reporter Kashmir Hill. ""It is being used to solve many murder cases, identity fraud cases, child exploitation cases,"" Hill told The Current's host Matt Galloway.  Police officers who spoke to Hill said the app was a far more powerful tool for cracking cases than any government database they had used before. The company claims their software finds a match in three out of four cases. The software is so effective, Hill said, that even when she covered her face and mouth for a photo, it still pulled up seven images of her. ""I was just shocked at how well this face recognition algorithm works,"" she said. Hill said investors and police officers she interviewed expect this software, or another similar technology, to be available to the public within the next five years. ""If you were in a restaurant having a sensitive conversation about family secrets or work secrets, a stranger next to you could snap your photo and know who you are, and understand that conversation in context,"" she said. ""You can imagine stalkers using this tool — just really malicious use cases."" The potential uses for this kind of software is ringing alarm bells for privacy advocates. ""What you lose, if this technology gets out into the wild, is the possibility of any anonymity in public ever. That's something that we need to think about,"" said Brenda McPhail, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association's Privacy Technology and Surveillance Project. McPhail said this kind of facial recognition technology could also make it easier for governments to monitor protesters. ""It's a threat to the fundamental freedoms that we value in a democracy,"" she said. When Hill started looking into Clearview, she initially came up against a lot of dead ends. Its website was only accessible to law enforcement, and their listed New York address led her to a building that didn't exist. For a long time, the company declined to speak to her. But they did find her. While interviewing police officers about the app, she would ask them to scan a photo of her, to see how the software worked.  ""The police officers would then get a call from the company saying, 'Are you talking to the media?' So they were actually tracking who was talking to me while they weren't talking to me,"" she said.  ""So I found that a bit disturbing."" Clearview was founded by Hoan Ton-That, an Australian techie and onetime model, and Richard Schwartz, a former aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. It is backed by Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook and Palantir. <a href=""https://t.co/ALE12Z0LkH"">pic.twitter.com/ALE12Z0LkH</a> Hill said that Clearview's secrecy, and their willingness to use their software to track a reporter, raised concerns about police departments' willingness to share sensitive information about suspects and victims with the little-known company. ""Most of the departments had done no vetting of them … and the company has this vast database of everyone that the police department is interested in,"" she said. McPhail said she was also concerned by allegations in Hill's story that Canadian police forces are using Clearview A.I.'s software.  ""The way the data is collected is probably against Canadian law,"" said McPhail. ""We've got law enforcement agencies using it without confirming that the use of the tool is compliant with Canadian law. That's a big problem."" Hill interviewed Canadian police officers about the app on condition of anonymity, so The Current reached out to several police forces across the country. The Vancouver Police Department said it has never used the software and has no intention of doing so. The Toronto Police Service says it does use facial recognition, but not through Clearview A.I. Ontario Provincial Police say they have used facial recognition technology, but wouldn't specify which products they use.  ""Generally, the RCMP does not comment on specific investigative tools or techniques,"" an RCMP representative said in a statement. The Current also requested comment from Clearview A.I. but did not receive a response. Michael Arntfield, a Canadian criminologist and former police officer, believes concerns about the technology are overblown. ""The upsides far outweigh the downsides and are in the public interest, quite frankly,"" he said. He believes the amount of information Clearview can glean from even billions of images pales in comparison to the ""troves"" of personal data gathered and sold to advertisers by companies like Google and Facebook.  ""We're deluding ourselves if we think that we have any privacy whatsoever,"" he said. ""Now we can actually use this [technology] for a productive purpose, for a public safety purpose … why is the alarm being sounded now?"" Written by Allie Jaynes.

14,Erica Johnson,2019-04-29T16:46:41.471Z,'I had to crawl': Amputee seeks damages after United Airlines and airport security seize scooter batteries,"Stearn Hodge says he will never forget the humiliation of having to drag his body across a hotel room floor during what was supposed to be a vacation celebrating his 43rd wedding anniversary — because a security agent at the Calgary International Airport and United Airlines confiscated the batteries he needed to operate a portable scooter. ""Having to crawl across the floor in front of my wife is the most humiliating thing that I can think of,"" said Hodge. ""It unmasks how real my disability is … I haven't been the same since."" The 68-year-old retired contractor from Kelowna, B.C., lost his left arm and right leg in a 1984 workplace accident. He now relies on a portable scooter powered by lithium batteries. But on a trip to Tulsa, Okla., on Feb. 26, 2017, an agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and a United Airlines official told Hodge to remove the $2,000 battery from his scooter and fly without it, as well as his spare battery. In making the demand, both employees cited safety concerns. Stearn Hodge shows how he had to crawl when he didn't have his mobility scooter: Lithium-ion batteries are a potential fire hazard, but global standards issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) allow people with disabilities to travel with compact lithium batteries for medical devices in carry-on luggage. Hodge said no one from CATSA or United Airlines would listen to him or read IATA documents he had printed out, showing his batteries are permitted on board if an airline gives prior approval. Hodge had received that permission. ""They're taking my legs — and not only that, my dignity,"" said Hodge.  He can only wear a prosthetic leg for a short period due to discomfort and risk of infection, he said. A few months earlier, Hodge almost had his batteries seized on a WestJet flight. But ""seconds"" before takeoff — and after he suffered a panic attack — Hodge was granted permission to take them on board. He has now hired a lawyer and is fighting to have his case heard before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A spokesperson for an Ottawa-based disability rights organization says it's ""frustrating"" that Canada's airline industry seems to ignore hard-won protections for people with disabilities. ""It's been a long fight to make sure that mobility devices — or any device used to accommodate a person with a disability — can be carried on [a plane],"" said Terrance Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. ""When security can — even with regulations in place — seize what otherwise should be able to go onto the aircraft, that leaves people with disabilities very vulnerable."" When the CATSA agent seized his batteries in Calgary, the employee suggested it wasn't a big deal, Hodge said. ""I still remember the CATSA agent saying, 'Well, you could get a wheelchair.' How's a one-armed guy going to run a wheelchair?"" asked Hodge. ""How am I going to go down a ramp and brake with one hand? But that shouldn't even have to come up."" Hodge's wife had recently undergone cancer treatment, which affected her spine, and she couldn't push a wheelchair for her husband. Hodge said he asked for an agent from United Airlines to come to the security checkpoint, as he had called the airline earlier and was assured it was OK to bring his battery and a spare on board. But the United Airlines employee that arrived sided with the security agent. Consequently, a three-week trip that was supposed to be a celebration with his wife resulted in Hodge spending much of his vacation confined to his bed. To perform basic personal hygiene, he was forced to drag himself across the hotel room floor to the bathroom. ""An anniversary is supposed to be all about remembering how you fell in love … and keeping that magic alive,"" said Hodge. ""And those things were denied. I'm crawling across the floor and it is pathetic."" A United Airlines spokesperson told Go Public that it couldn't comment on Hodge's experience, as he wants his case heard by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In an email sent to Hodge by the airline, complaint resolution official Tatricia Orija wrote that ""it appears we were in violation of federal disability requirements,"" offering both Hodge and his wife an $800 travel certificate. She also apologized for the ""inconvenience."" ""Inconvenience is when it rains on your holiday,"" said Hodge. ""This was a … life-changing moment for me and my wife."" Three months before the United incident, on Nov. 27, 2016, Hodge had also run into battery problems while travelling to Cancun, Mexico. In that case, a WestJet employee initially told him he could take the batteries in a carry-on, but when he got to the security checkpoint, a CATSA agent said the batteries had to be in checked luggage. ""According to federal airline law, that's the worst place you want to put them,"" said Hodge. ""Because if a problem develops with those batteries, they don't know where they are and they're only going to find out about it when it's too late."" Minutes before his departure, a WestJet employee was able to confirm that the batteries could go on the plane. In an email to Hodge, a WestJet customer support agent wrote: ""While I cannot change your past experience, I would like to offer you a $350 future travel credit as a goodwill gesture."" WestJet spokesperson Morgan Bell told Go Public he couldn't comment on the case since it is before the courts but that ""WestJet will always err on the side of caution and supports the due diligence of its people evaluating any items they believe may pose a safety concern.""  CATSA also wouldn't address questions from Go Public, citing Hodge's complaint. The agency did provide Hodge with a transcript of a recorded call with client service agent Justine Drouin, who apologizes to Hodge and says ""all of the screening officers will undergo a briefing."" Hodge and his wife travel at least once or twice a year and say the only place they run into trouble with his scooter batteries is in Canada. ""I have flown through Europe, the United States and Mexico since 2015 with these batteries and have never been detained or harassed because of them. It is only in Canada that I have been relentlessly detained,"" said Hodge.  He estimates it's happened more than a dozen times in the past two years, saying it now triggers severe anxiety. ""When I go through the checkpoint, I'm starting to vibrate now. I don't know what I'm going to get. It's like playing Russian roulette."" Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, said while he's pleased there are protections in place for people with disabilities who are travelling, those protections need to be enforced. ""This is an assault on a person's dignity,"" said Green, noting his organization has been fighting over transportation issues for four decades. ""In 1979, the government of the day said, 'Yes, we will make our transportation system accessible,'"" he said. ""Here we are … 40 years later and the same barriers are there in transportation for Canadians with disabilities."" Green, who is visually impaired, said he has had security agents question the battery in his laptop, which allows it to ""talk"" when it is turned on. He said he receives ""a lot of emails and telephone calls"" from people with disabilities who have been hassled at the airport. ""It happens very, very frequently,"" said Green. ""You put in complaints, the first thing that happens is the airlines deny."" Go Public asked the Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulates air, rail and marine travel, how often people have filed disability-related complaints over the past three years. A spokesperson said the agency has received 583 accessibility complaints related to air travel during that time — with fewer than one per cent related to batteries. And those numbers have steadily increased since 2016. The majority of complaints related to the transport of mobility aids are from passengers who have had expensive mobility devices — scooters and wheelchairs — damaged.   Last September, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Hodge's complaint to the Canadian Transportation Agency. However, the agency has no power to award general damages beyond out-of-pocket expenses.  On May 9, Hodge's lawyer, John Burns, will ask a Federal Court judge to compel the commission to hear the case. ""It's a failure of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to grant access to the remedy that the statute provides,"" said Burns. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows for up to $20,000 in damages for each count of pain and suffering, and up to another $20,000 if the discrimination is ""willful or reckless."" ""It sends a very clear message to the airlines and everybody else involved,"" said Burns. ""People with disabilities should be taken seriously. You don't take away somebody's legs and then describe it as an inconvenience. No, this is an injury."" Hodge is optimistic he'll eventually have his day before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It's a pricey endeavour. In order to cover legal costs, he's had to put up for sale a cherished Corvette he has worked on for years. But it's a fight he says he has to have — not just for himself, but for so many others with disabilities. ""The thing I would love more than the compensation,"" said Hodge, ""is the [legal] decision that someone can go to and say, 'You did it here, you can do it for me.'""

15,Erica Johnson,2019-05-01T09:00:00.135Z,Bank employees angry regulator's report on sales tactics weakened after banks and government review drafts,"Several bank employees are speaking out, angered by recent revelations that a report on banking sales tactics was weakened after the regulator shared a draft copy with the banks and federal government. They contacted Go Public to reveal why they think upselling wasn't widely detected during a lengthy review of misleading sales tactics by the regulator — slamming the bank review as inaccurate, inappropriate and a PR exercise. The employees provided internal documents disclosing aggressive upselling they said isn't obvious and said they were frustrated by a recent Go Public story that showed a report released by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada last year had key consumer protections eliminated after early drafts were shared with the federal Finance Department and the big banks. ""When I saw the regulator gave the report to the banks, I couldn't believe it,"" a CIBC call centre employee wrote to Go Public. ""I had to reach out to you."" CBC has confirmed the identity of bank employees in this story, but is not revealing them to protect their employment.  The regulator told Go Public it gave banks a draft report so they could identify factual errors. The review was conducted in 2017 and culminated in a report released on March 20, 2018. The FCAC's handling of its bank review is grounds for a public inquiry into the regulator and Canada's financial services, says the Small Investor Protection Association (SIPA), a consumer advocacy organization. ""It's proof that the Department of Finance is complicit with the FCAC and is deceiving the public,"" SIPA president Stan Buell told Go Public. The CIBC call centre employee says she was one of the people interviewed by the FCAC as part of its review.  The regulator interviewed some 200 bank employees at various branches of BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD, Scotia and National Bank as well as 400 more employees — some of whom, worked at banking call centres. ""That whole interview was an exercise in public relations,"" she says. She says during the interview, she wasn't transparent about the pressure to meet sales targets, because she worried the process wasn't confidential.  Been wronged? Contact Erica and Go Public team ""Did I tell them we were pushing sales hard? No way,"" she says. ""How did I know that wouldn't get back to someone?"" She says she has sold things to help the bank's bottom line and meet sales targets, but has made it seem as though it is in the best interest of the client. ""At every telephone banking level, we are trying to sell to the client."" She says she had to vent, after learning the regulator's report was weakened, after early versions were sent to banks and government. ""It just made me really angry, reading what went on behind the scenes,"" she says. In an email to Go Public, CIBC's director of public affairs Trish Tervit says the bank ""supplied complete org charts"" to the FCAC.  ""The bank did not select which employees were interviewed as part of the FCAC's industry-wide review,"" wrote Tervit. ""Putting clients at the centre of all we do is our priority every day. We have a strong, client-focused culture and we continuously review our business to ensure we do what's right for our clients."" A Scotiabank financial adviser says he thought it was inappropriate for the FCAC to let banks see the draft report.  ""The banks shouldn't have had any say in it, in any way,"" he says. ""That's shocking to me."" He says his sales targets have sharply increased since last November. He says employees are upselling customers simply to meet sales targets, but that much of that harm would be impossible for the regulator to detect. He provided a screenshot of an internal website, showing that the higher an interest rate an employee quotes a customer on a mortgage, the more sales units they earn towards their target.  ""They [customers] don't know they could've got a lower mortgage rate,"" says the financial adviser. ""I don't know how upselling would ever be tracked."" Another example of upselling he said the regulator couldn't detect is the way employees are encouraged to move clients away from investing in GICs and steer them into mutual funds, which provide guaranteed annual fees for the bank. To meet sales targets, he says he pushes mutual funds because he gets double the amount of credit. ""That can be harmful to customers,"" he says, ""because a mutual fund might not make sense."" In an email to Go Public, Scotiabank director of Canadian banking communications Patricia Hsiung wrote, ""Any reports that Scotiabank has set aggressive sales targets are inaccurate and misleading. Scotiabank remains committed to delivering an exceptional, transparent and trustworthy experience for our customers that prioritizes our relationships over products."" She also wrote that the bank considers ""customer feedback from more than one million surveys yearly"" and is making, ""great strides in driving towards industry leadership in overall customer satisfaction."" Another Scotiabank financial adviser working in a different city also contacted Go Public to say he was disturbed to see the regulator's report was weakened after it went to government and the banks, and that the regulator's claim that it did not find that bank customers were widely harmed — is not accurate. He provided documents showing his sales targets had significantly increased as of last fall. ""The pressure is enormous,"" he says. ""We're lying to our clients. Upselling all the time. You don't want to do it, but if you don't, you'll lose your job."" He says the regulator wouldn't know his manager tells him to gloss over the fees attached to a mutual fund. ""People will back out if they know there's risk involved, or fees,"" he says. He says he also increases credit card limits because he's under pressure to hit sales targets, but the FCAC wouldn't be able to tell that either, by looking at files. ""If they [bank customer] have an existing card with a $5,000 credit limit, I'll say, 'I see you're pre-approved for $10,000, let's attach that to your file,'"" he says. ""I don't ask the client if that's a good thing for them, in case they say no. I need to make points for my sales target."" News that the banking regulator provided draft copies of its review into aggressive sales tactics to government and the banks has prompted renewed calls for a public inquiry into financial services and the FCAC from the Small Investor Protection Association. ""I really think the government needs to listen to the voices of the people, to understand what their needs are and the impact on their lives, due to the lack of investor protection,"" says Buell. ""The FCAC should be providing that, but is not."" In a statement released earlier this week, Buell said an independent inquiry is necessary because ""Canadians are entrusting their hard-earned money, savings and futures with what should be trusted institutions and individuals."" ""There appears to be a far too cosy relationship between the banking industry, the FCAC and the Finance Department,"" says Buell. Go Public asked Finance Minister Bill Morneau about claims that the report was weakened after he saw it. ""Obviously, it's always important for us to take a look at how the banking sector is working,"" he says.  ""And I'm confident the FCAC did a good job."" Regardless of whether or not a public inquiry is called, one of the Scotiabank financial advisers who reached out says he has a message for banks, and for bank customers.  ""They [the banks] need to stop being so greedy and ripping people off,"" he says. ""And when people go to the bank, they shouldn't trust what we say. We're under pressure to sell, but we can't tell you that."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

16,Adam Carter,2020-01-23T16:10:10.093Z,"E-learning is no boogeyman, but would be costly to implement properly, expert says","Online learning isn't the massive problem that Ontario's embattled teachers unions are making it out to be, according to a leading expert in the field — but he says to properly implement it across the province would likely prove very costly. Michael Barbour, associate professor of instructional design at the College of Education and Health Sciences at Touro University California, told CBC News that political rhetoric is masking the possible benefits that e-learning could bring to Ontario. But with few concrete details about how the program would roll out, he says it's difficult for people take an informed stance. One thing is for sure, Barbour says: to do this right wouldn't be cheap. The province would need to hire more teachers to support students, properly outfit classrooms and computer labs, and work with telecom companies to ensure broadband access in rural areas. ""It's going to be a lot of money, a lot of purchasing, [and] a lot of set-up in a very short period of time,"" said Barbour, a Canadian who has been involved with K-12 online learning in countries including Canada and the U.S. for decades as a researcher, teacher, course designer and administrator. ""If the government embarked upon this because they believe it is going to save money, then that was a fool's journey."" E-learning has become a major talking point in the fight between the provincial government and education workers, alongside class sizes and compensation for teachers. The province announced last year that it would require high school students to take four online courses in order to graduate. After considerable blowback, Education Minister Stephen Lecce scaled that number back to two. Students graduating in 2023-2024 would be the first cohort required to complete the two courses, selecting from options like Grade 11 biology, Grade 12 data management, and Grade 10 career studies. Union leaders have repeatedly said that bringing in mandatory e-learning courses would hurt the province's education system. Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation president Harvey Bischof appeared on CBC Radio's Metro Morning Monday, and said the province wants to ""impose mandatory Alabama style e-learning that every piece of evidence says is not constructive for many of our students."" Larry Raines, coordinator of the educational technology section at the Alabama Department of Education, dismisses that idea outright. He told CBC News that since online classes were first offered in 2006, enrolment has ballooned from 300 students to over 27,000, and the results have been largely positive. ""We worked to make sure we were not out there to take the place of teachers,"" Raines said in a phone interview. ""We're actually employing almost 1,000 teachers across the state."" Comparing Ontario to Alabama also doesn't work, because completion of Alabama's online courses isn't mandatory for graduation. Instead, the state has a guideline that dictates every student must have an ""online experience"" to graduate, but an online course is just one way to achieve that. Barbour says he understands why a union that's embroiled in a labour dispute would want to hold up Alabama as an example. ""I did my PhD down in Georgia, and the common saying in Georgia was, 'Thank God for Alabama, because otherwise Georgia would be the worst education system in the U.S.,'"" he said, adding that Alabama historically has had very poor performances on both national and international assessments. ""But that's not because of online learning,"" he said. An examination of Alabama's graduation numbers shows there's not really a difference before or after online learning was implemented, he said. ""Alabama has a bad education system for a variety of reasons."" Part of the problem here, Barbour says, is the province has released very few details about its plans for the program, so people can't really make an informed decision. ""The ministry hasn't done a good job of actually telling us what they mean,"" he said. Ministry of Education spokesperson Alexandra Adamo told CBC News in a statement that that province is ""committed to building a world-leading online learning system to strengthen Ontario students' competencies in the modern economy. ""We are proceeding with developing and implementing a made-in-Ontario program that will ensure student flexibility, technological literacy and a vast selection of courses, through two mandatory courses over the lifetime of a student's high school career."" Adamo could not, however, say how much that program will cost. ""The full financial and policy implications of the online learning strategy are subject to the development of the ministry's final implementation plan. Once these elements are finalized, the ministry will provide more information,"" she said. Some research from the U.S. has lauded e-learning as a viable education option, while other reports are less bullish. A 2014 study based out of Harvard University that examined Florida's online course offerings did not find any evidence of negative effects of virtual education on student learning. But in 2018, The Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute examined how effective online learning has been in that state, and found that online learning was failing poorer students. Despite the fact that 62 per cent of enrolments in Michigan were students living in poverty, researchers saw a gap of nearly 20 percentage points between the pass rates for those students (48 per cent) and students not in poverty (66 per cent). The institute says that in the last decade, the number of virtual learners in Michigan nearly tripled, but the statewide virtual pass rate did not improve — instead, it has steadily decreased from 66 per cent in 2010-11 to 55 per cent in the 2018 academic year. Still, Barbour maintains that e-learning could work in Ontario if students are properly supported. ""Technology, be it a classroom that's using a traditional chalk board or white board, to a high-tech classroom ... to an online class, it's just a medium,"" he said. ""And what impacts learning is how we design, deliver and support that learning within that medium."" But he says he also understands why unions are pushing back during this round of bargaining, given what he sees as comparisons between the current Ford government and when Mike Harris was in power back in the 1990s. ""The idea that the motivation behind a lot of the measures that they're making is based upon cost saving, that's a real concern for folks that are trying to collective bargain right now,"" Barbour said. ""It's a reasonable position to take."" adam.carter@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/e-learning-ontario-1.5436788,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586,N/A
17,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-21T22:47:56.106Z,'I won't be swayed': P.E.I. to ban flavoured vape juice,"Consultations are underway for regulating vaping product sales on P.E.I., but Health Minister James Aylward says he has made up his mind on one thing. Flavoured vape juice will be banned in the province. ""We did it with flavoured tobacco, we're going to do it with flavoured vaping as well,"" Aylward told CBC's Island Morning. ""I won't be swayed."" The health minister has made the decision in the face of opposition from Imperial Tobacco and the Atlantic Convenience Stores Association. In a news release, Imperial Tobacco urged governments in Canada to be certain vaping regulations were based on science. ""This is an extremely complex issue for which governments need to talk to scientists and doctors who understand the issue and not get swayed by the dramatized headlines,"" said Eric Gagnon, head of corporate and regulatory affairs at Imperial Tobacco Canada. ""If politicians and regulators allow themselves to be influenced by fear instead of facts, the biggest losers will be the millions of adult smokers across Canada who want an alternative to smoking."" In a release, the Vaping Industry Trade Association said it's calling upon ""all levels of government to formally acknowledge the thousands of Canadian vapers who quit smoking by vaping."" The organization said it wants government to carefully consider how proposed policies negatively affect adults who rely on vaping products to remain smoke-free. Shamus Kelly, owner of Eastern Vapes in Charlottetown, said banning flavoured vaping products won't get them out of the hands of Island youth. ""They're pushing everybody to the black market. They are going to get their hands on it, no matter what,"" Kelly said. ""But now it's not going to be professionally-tested, lab-tested stuff. It's going to be black market products that, who know what's in them, right? And they're going to get them that way.""  Kelly said up to 80 per cent of his business is selling flavoured vapes so he expects the decision to affect his bottom line.  Julia Hartley, with the P.E.I. Lung Association, said there's evidence to show that youth between the ages of 18 and 24 are particularly drawn to flavoured vaping products.  ""We have data showing that almost 100 per cent of youth prefer flavoured products and also data showing that half of these kids would quit vaping if, you know, the flavours were taken away. That's all the evidence we need,"" she said.  Aylward said he was alarmed by news from P.E.I.'s Public Schools Branch that vaping is starting as early as Grade 4. He believes banning flavoured vapes will discourage young people. ""Trying to protect our population, particularly our youth, that's the number one thing that I think about every day,"" he said. Consultations on regulations will go on about another week, said Aylward, and he expects to have draft regulations by early March, and those could be in force as soon as the end of that month. Aylward said there is still a role for the federal government in regulation when it comes to online sales and limiting the amount of nicotine in products. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-flavoured-vaping-banned-1.5434281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-flavours-canadian-vaping-association-1.5367882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-bill-deagle-1.5365964 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-partners-medical-society-doctor-recruitment-2020-1.5433244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,N/A
18,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-22T23:06:04.104Z,Judge rules Jason McKay had clear operating mind while saying 'I killed my wife',"Jason McKay answered his door covered in blood and proceeded to tell police officers without emotion that he had killed his wife, according to testimony heard last week at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench.  One officer testified that McKay said verbatim, ""She's dead. I ​f--king killed her."" Testimony from the two officers who went to the McKay home in the early morning hours of Sept.6, 2017, was given as part of a voir dire. Video recordings of McKay in the police car shortly after his arrest and evidence about what happened at the police station were also subject to the trial within a trial.  At issue was whether Jason had spoken voluntarily to police with a ""clear operating mind."" Justice Michael Tochor found that he did in all cases, presenting his decision Wednesday at the Court of Queen's Bench in Regina.  The judge noted Jason was informed of his right to a lawyer and to silence after his arrest, yet made unprompted statements like ""I already know I'm charged for murder because she's dead,"" ""I've got nothing to lose,"" and ""she's cold as ice.""  These statements were all caught on camera.  Tochor was satisfied that Jason understood these words could be used to his detriment. Even at the police station, Jason continued to say things like ""I know my wife is dead, I watched her for two hours,"" and ""I killed my wife.""  ""He had the cognitive ability to understand what he was saying,"" Tochor ruled.  Defence lawyer Thomas Hynes suggested that Jason made the statements while intoxicated. Jenny's cousin had spoken with him on the phone earlier in the evening and suspected he was intoxicated and Jason's mom said he wasn't making sense on the phone. Still, Tochor found the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jason voluntarily made statements in the presence of police officers with an operating mind. Furthermore, he found Jason spoke in the absence of threats, promises, an atmosphere of oppression or police trickery.   Tochor was also tasked with ruling on a second voir dire that involved evidence meant to illustrate the state of their relationship and Jenny's state of mind. He ruled that most of the evidence would be considered admissible to the trial.  Only days before her death, Jenny had called 911 after Jason returned to their home following a dispute, saying ""he said he's going to kill me."" During the call, she described Jason as violent, unpredictable and threatening.  Another police officer testified Jenny told him she didn't feel safe and wanted an exit plan.  Her coworker testified that Jenny said ""he beats me in ways no one can see,"" and another testified that Jenny referred to being hit often.  A text message from Jenny to Jason read: ""I'm afraid of you.""  Hynes had argued that Jenny was unreliable because of her alleged problem with alcohol. He also suggested Jenny had a motive to fabricate statements to coworkers, as a possible excuse for work performance. Tochor was unsatisfied with both arguments, finding the evidence to be corroborated and consistent.  Tochor ruled that some testimony about Jason's behaviour toward Jenny was also admissible. This included Jason's daughter's account of Jason allegedly striking Jenny, as well as information from Jenny's coworker who said she saw Jason attempt to strike Jenny in the stomach.  The judge reminded the lawyers that while much of the voir dire evidence is admissible, relevance exists on a spectrum and he couldn't yet say how relevant these bits of evidence are or whether they will be relied upon in the final decision.  Crown prosecutor Adam Breker concluded his case after the judge ruled on the voir dires. The defence will begin its case on Thursday morning. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-murder-trial-voir-dire-1.5436612,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-week-second-degree-murder-1.5433136,N/A
19,Erica Johnson,2019-10-21T12:17:54.616Z,Banks deny compensation when hackers steal customers' money,"Sunjit Lidhar was awoken by a phone call from Scotiabank last February, informing him that $3,000 had been transferred out of his savings account and was gone. ""My heart pretty much dropped to my stomach,"" Lidhar told Go Public from his home in Surrey, B.C. ""We just assume our money's safe."" Soon after, the cybercriminals stole another $2,000. But worst of all, Scotiabank refused to reimburse him. ""It is not acceptable to have your money stolen from your account and the bank — which you trust so much with your life savings — tells you they can't do much to help."" Lidhar is the victim of a ""systemic problem"" of criminals breaking into people's online accounts and stealing money, according to Christopher Parsons, a senior public policy researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Parsons argues that the country's banks, not their customers, should be financially liable when thieves raid customer accounts. ""The banks are responsible — solely responsible — for building and maintaining the infrastructure,"" he said. ""We need to reverse the liability the banks currently impose upon individuals who are using the very services and tools that banks are providing.""  The trouble started for Lidhar on Feb. 11, when hackers broke into his account and e-transferred $3,000 in two transactions — one for $2,000 and one for $1,000 — to an email address he says he doesn't recognize. As soon as he learned about it, Lidhar says he changed his password, got a new debit card, asked Scotiabank to freeze his accounts and stopped banking online. Scotiabank said it would investigate, but when Lidhar didn't hear back after two weeks, he visited his local branch. While speaking to someone in the fraud department, they told him money was again being transferred out of his account. ""I was totally shocked and blown away that this was happening while I was in the branch,"" he said.  Been wronged and you're not the only one? Contact our Go Public team His bank was able to stop one e-transfer for $1,000 but not another for $2,000. Lidhar says Scotiabank took a few weeks to investigate, and then said it wouldn't cover his losses.  In an email, Scotiabank said his claim was denied because the transaction was authorized from an internet address where he has ""extensive history."" Security experts tell Go Public that hackers can access a bank account from a victim's IP address by taking over an infected computer and logging in as if they were that person. Lidhar says Scotiabank wouldn't explain how the fraud happened, adding that only he has access to his account.  ""They're trying to blame me,"" he said. ""And they haven't told me anything about who it went to."" In a statement to Go Public, a Scotiabank spokesperson said the bank ""took immediate action and conducted a thorough investigation,"" into Lidhar's case.  ""We take the concerns of our customers very seriously,"" wrote Douglas Johnson. After Go Public contacted Scotiabank, it offered to compensate Lidhar — six months after his money was stolen.  Go Public has heard similar stories from others — all saying their accounts were hacked, and that the banks often won't reimburse them. In May, Martin Chapman of Peterborough, Ont., lost almost $12,000 when criminals broke into his accounts at TD Bank and Royal Bank. Initially, he says, TD refused to fully compensate him, offering just $1,805. ""They have admitted to me they don't know how the scammer broke through their security system,"" said Chapman. Only after he appealed did TD agree to reimburse all $6,000. RBC refunded the remaining money after a two-week investigation. TD would not respond to questions from Go Public about this case.  Curtis Hamilton of Esquimalt, B.C., says he was targeted by hackers last November who installed a key logger on his computer and sent just over $2,000 to themselves. TD's fraud department said Hamilton didn't protect his password and it was his fault. Hamilton had anti-malware software on his computer. He's hired a lawyer but has yet to get his money back. ""It's been quite frustrating,"" he said. ""The bank is basically saying … 'We're not responsible for anything.'"" TD would not comment on this case, when asked by Go Public. Patricia Widdis of Breslau, Ont., told Go Public that hackers accessed her RBC account and redirected her Visa payments, stealing $12,000 in May 2018. The bank was able to get $7,000 returned, but she is still out $5,000 and feels betrayed. ""They said, 'You made the payments yourself,'"" said Widdis. An RBC spokesperson wrote that potentially unauthorized transactions are analyzed ""on a case-by-case"" basis. Most Canadians are unaware that more criminals are hacking into financial institutions in Canada and around the world, says security expert Limor Kessem.  ""These threats are very real and very problematic,"" said Kessem, an adviser based in Tel Aviv with IBM X-Force, an international team of investigators who track global security threats to the financial sector. ""In the beginning,"" she said, ""we would see that a banking trojan [a type of virus] would be targeting banks through their customers,"" such as GozNym, a malware attack she helped uncover and that was shut down in May, as part of an international law enforcement operation. GozNym targeted two financial institutions based in Canada — which Kessem won't name — and 22 U.S. banks, credit unions and popular e-commerce platforms, stealing sensitive personal and financial information, including online banking login credentials such as usernames and passwords. It's estimated GozNym stole over $100 million from some 40,000 victims. It's an example of the sort of malware that might be responsible for the hacks against Lidhar, Hamilton and Chapman.  ""And then we have a different type of attack,"" said Kessem. ""Cybercrime groups that will invade the banks' actual infrastructure and get into their payment systems and start compromising them internally."" It all points to the need for financial institutions to take responsibility when hackers steal customers' money, says Parsons, the public policy researcher.  ""They can't just provide us tools or push liability upon us and then walk away,"" he said. ""One of the ways of correcting this would be to shift the liability structure. So rather than punishing customers … the banks themselves should be liable, so that they're encouraged to build way better security and protect their customers from this sort of fraud."" In the U.K., says Parsons, banking fraud was such a big problem, the government made banks responsible for financial losses to customers.  ""And as soon as the banks had to take those losses, all of a sudden … fraud plummeted because the banks invested massively in security,"" said Parsons. He says Canada's next government needs to follow the U.K.'s example.  ""If banks themselves won't do it, then it's an area where legislation needs to be seriously considered. We can't rely on customers to know about every kind of security vulnerability, to track every website that has breached passwords,"" he said. ""That's just absolutely absurd and not a feasible solution to the problem."" Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association — which represents Canada's largest banks — whether its members would consider assuming liability when hackers break into the online banking systems they have created. A spokesperson did not address that question, but wrote, banks ""have no higher priority than the security of their customers' money and conduct comprehensive investigations of all fraud cases, some of which are complex and take time to investigate the specifics of the case."" All the banks involved in these cases have told Go Public that customers are responsible for taking precautions to ensure their devices, accounts and information are protected. Sunjit Lidhar says he's stopped doing online banking and now heads to his bank branch instead — a hassle he says is worth it, for peace of mind. He says he wrote to Go Public to let people know that banks could hold them responsible when hackers strike. ""I just want people to know that this is something that's very real,"" says Lidhar. ""It's not safe. And that's something they [the banks] need to work on."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Candice Jahnke was in the Rochdale Boulevard restaurant last Thursday when she caught video of a mouse falling from the ceiling of the business onto another woman. ""I want to clarify that we are clean and we have all the protection in place, but it's an incident, an accident,"" Rahman told CBC.  ""We are very proud of our product and service and whatever incident happened, it's just bad luck for us.""  Rahman said he had pest control inspect his restaurant and that the investigation into the incident is ongoing. As of Wednesday, there are no signs of mice or any other rodents or insects in the restaurant and he was given a certificate proving that, he said. Rahman said he doesn't know how the rodent got into his store. He checked the restaurant's CCTV footage and saw Jahnkhe's video of the mouse as it fell. Jahnke said it was her children who first noticed the animal on the ceiling, and they watched it drop into the hood of a woman's jacket and it was all on video.  ""As soon as I stopped recording, I went to the lady right away, she went to sit down and I said, 'I don't mean to alarm you, but you have a mouse crawling on you,'"" Jahnke recalled. Jahnke said initially the woman was stunned but she slowly took off her jacket and that's when the mouse jumped out of the fabric and scurried toward some nearby garbage cans. Jahnke said restaurant employees appeared to quickly dispatch the rodent. Jahnke shared the video to Facebook where it generated roughly 1,200 shares. She then removed it from public view because she tired of the constant notifications on her phone. A prepared statement from Mary Brown's corporate offices confirmed the store had been checked by pest control professionals and that the restaurant was closed on Wednesday for an inspection and a ""deep clean."" ""We thank all of our Regina customers for their patience as we ensure that our food safety standards are not compromised and necessary steps are taken to ensure this is an isolated incident,"" the statement said. ""We do everything to make sure [the restaurant] is spotless,"" Rahman said. He said there are currently about 25 traps placed around the store in the event another mouse gets inside. Rahman noted the restaurant is not a standalone building. The ceiling is shared with other businesses. He said he contacted the building's landlord in the hopes they check the other businesses under the same roof. When contacted, Wascana Property Management, who oversees the building, did not offer comment for this story. Though the Mary Brown's store does have previous infractions recorded through the government of Saskatchewan's infractions website, none of them were related to pests.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mary-brown-s-mouse-falls-on-customer-1.5436442,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/restaurant-inspection-story-1.5401718 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/live-mice-released-edmonton-restaurants-1.4595084,N/A
21,Anna Desmarais,2020-01-20T12:00:00.151Z,Smith's Landing First Nation asks N.W.T. to speak out against northern Alberta mine,"The chief of Smith's Landing First Nation near Fort Smith, N.W.T, is calling on the territorial government to speak out against a northern Alberta mining project.  ""The government of the Northwest Territories is strangely silent … on the oil sands projects,"" Chief Gerry Cheezie said.  Cheezie said that N.W.T. Premier Caroline Cochrane should be hosting meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney to make sure the Indigenous communities living within the Mackenzie water system will not be affected by the controversial $20.6 billion Teck Frontier mining project that is proposed for a site 110 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, Alta.  A joint federal-provincial review board deemed the Teck Frontier mine in the public interest last July, despite ""significant adverse ... effects"" to the environment, species at risk and the traditional practices of Indigenous peoples. Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has the final say on whether the project goes forward. He must decide before the end of February.  If approved, the Teck Frontier mining project would produce 260,000 bitumen barrels a day and create 7,000 jobs in Alberta. Its lifespan is estimated to be 41 years.    Joslyn Oosenbrug, a communications manager with the N.W.T.'s Environment Department, said in a statement that the territory is the ""ultimate downstream jurisdiction"" of the Mackenzie River basin and that ""N.W.T. waters can be impacted"" by management decisions in Alberta.  In 2015, the Northwest Territories and Alberta signed a bilateral water management agreement to preserve the quantity and quality of the territory's water. Oosenbrug said Alberta must take action if the water quality deteriorates.  The territorial government did not make a submission to the joint federal-provincial review board on the Teck Frontier mining project.  Oosenbrug also said the territory monitors the water quality for any effects that could come from upstream oil extraction. The government has had a water monitoring site at Fort Fitzgerald, Alta., since the 1960s, which gives early warnings of any environmental changes in the Slave River.  Part of the Smith Landing First Nation's traditional territory runs just south of the border between the Northwest Territories and Alberta, along the Slave River and into the Peace-Athabasca Delta.  Smith's Landing First Nation was only invited to join the review panel at their last session in October 2018 after pressuring Alberta on at least four separate occasions for the right to consult, said Becky Kostka, the land and resources manager for the First Nation.  In its final submission to the Alberta government, Smith's Landing First Nation argues that it has seen a noticeable decline in water levels, water quality and air pollution — all stemming from other resource projects in northern Alberta. Transcripts from members of the Smith's Landing First Nation in that report say the Slave River is ""at a tipping point"" and that another resource project could ""seal the fate"" of the nation. Jess Sinclair, press secretary to Alberta's environment minister Jason Nixon, said in a statement that Smith's Landing First Nation did not identify any specific sites that needed mitigation from the Teck Frontier project.  The Aboriginal Consultation Office, an arm of Alberta's provincial government that specializes in Indigenous consultation, found that consultation with the First Nation was adequate.  Chief Cheezie will be speaking at a press conference in front of the environment minister's Vancouver constituency office Monday. He and other Indigenous advocates will be presenting the minister's office with a joint letter expressing their concerns over the Teck Frontier project.  ""We haven't been sitting on our hands here because we see the immense danger to our people,"" he said. ""We're not going anywhere. Forty one years from now ... when the mine shuts down, Teck will leave but we will still be [here]."" Cheezie said Smith's Landing is also actively lobbying other federal ministers, including Dan Vandal, the new minister responsible for northern affairs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/smiths-landing-nwt-teck-frontier-1.5431837,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187,N/A

23,Robert Jones,2020-01-21T12:29:11.405Z,Smart meter critics change tone on NB Power's new business case,"NB Power's $92-million plan to buy and deploy smart meters in New Brunswick got a late endorsement Monday from a pair of consultants unconnected to the utility who had lobbed early criticisms at the project — a change in tone not lost on at least one Energy and Utilities Board member who will soon be deciding its fate. ""Both of you there just gave some compliments to NB Power on their business case. So you think this is a well-prepared business case?"" asked EUB member Michael Costello during the testimony of Philip Diodomenico and Kathleen Kelly, consultants with Daymark Energy Advisors Inc. of Worcester, Mass. Diodomenico and Kelly were hired by public intervener Heather Black to independently review NB Power's smart meter plan and told Costello despite some shortcomings it is a much better proposal than they have dealt with elsewhere. ""Generally, the business case is a good business case,"" said Diodomenico. ""It's made good use of outside consultants and expertise. It's taken a conservative approach in a number of areas, not everywhere, but in a number of areas. Yeah, so it's a good business case."" Kelly said although NB Power might be underestimating expenses and overestimating benefits of its smart meter plan by several millions of dollars, it still looks to be a solid investment. ""We've tried to take some of the assumptions and expand them and make them more conservative to make ourselves more comfortable with it,"" said Kelly. ""We've reduced the benefit cost ratio, but we haven't seen it go to one [break even] or lower."" Black recommended against the adoption of NB Power's smart meter plan during the utility's first application in 2018 and, although she has expressed no personal opinion on the matter so far this time, her experts gave the utility's case an important boost at a critical time. The two said they would not recommend against the project moving forward if NB Power expands on a risk assessment of things that could go wrong and how they might be fixed and develops acceptable ways to measure whether the meters are accomplishing predetermined goals. Diodomenico and Kelly were the final two witnesses to be called during the hearing, which has lasted six days and moves to final arguments on Wednesday. NB Power has presented evidence suggesting its acquisition of 360,000 smart meters will provide 16 financial benefits that together will exceed the projected cost of the project by $31.1 million over 15 years. Although Diodomenico and Kelly said that net benefit number is probably too high, it's likely not zero, something a second independent expert was less certain of. Alice Napoleon, a senior associate with Synapse Energy Economics of Cambridge, Mass., also testified Monday.  Synapse was hired to independently evaluate the smart meter plan as well, but by the Energy and Utilities Board itself. Napoleon told the board it is unclear from her analysis — because of vagueness in NB Power's numbers — whether the project will be a financial benefit or liability in the long run. ""We find that NB Power has presented a proposal that, under plausible conditions, would result in benefits to ratepayers,"" said Napoleon in her opening statement. ""Under alternative but still plausible conditions, the proposed AMI (advanced metering infrastructure) plan might not provide net benefits to customers."" Also testifying Monday was McGill University lecturer Paul Heroux, who was called by intervener Roger Richard, a staunch opponent of smart meters. Heroux said his research shows that even low levels of radiation, like from radio frequencies that will be constantly emitted by smart meters, pose a health hazard to humans. ""We have been for a long time influenced by this radiation unknowingly,"" said Heroux. Earlier in the hearing, Dr. Michele Plant, a witness for NB Power, testified there was ""no carcinogenic risk"" from radio waves or frequencies at ""an exposure level thousands of times higher than those measured near a smart meter."" In the hearing two years ago, the EUB ruled it could find no credible evidence that smart meters posed any health risks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meter-eub-hearings-1.5434186,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-rate-meters-1.5430140 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-catch-22-1.5428720,N/A
24,Kenneth Miller,2020-01-18T11:00:00.741Z,A husband pleads for the rights of wife with disabilities,"When I married my wife, Cheryl Miller, I promised to be loyal to her through sickness and in health.  She is my love and soulmate, whom I love dearly.  Unfortunately Cheryl has multiple sclerosis, and has lived with this disease for 45 years.  During this time, I have therefore become an advocate for my precious love — and for all disabled individuals.  Why?  Because they have to spend all their energy trying to live a rewarding life, with many challenges and worries ahead of them.  Many, including Cheryl, meet these challenges with great fortitude and bravery. Therefore it is incumbent on me that I continue to fight for changes that will make their lives better.  What are some of the challenges I see and changes that I would like to see?  Nothing is more frustrating than when I can't find a handicapped parking space — especially when a spot is taken by a vehicle without a handicapped permit.  A painted handicapped parking sign on concrete is useless, because after the first snowfall, it's usually covered up.  What is needed are handicapped signs that are on buildings or above ground.  We also need more of them. A lot more. There are too many places that have a limited number of handicapped parking spots, including close to hospitals!  What's more, these spots are rarely supervised, and offenders are rarely ticketed.  And on the off chance they are ticketed, the fines vary too much. Once we've found a parking spot, things don't get much better.   Many places have no ramps to get to the entrance, and often have two sets of doors to go through at a time, or lack automatic doors.  Access to these buildings is therefore extremely difficult.  Some of the doors also have a lip, where a wheelchair might tip over. (It doesn't take much.) Entrances and sidewalks are often uneven and dangerous.  Many beaches are inaccessible, in my opinion, because of little or no regard for the disabled. At least the beach at Birds Hill Provincial Park has beach access mats, but their handicapped trail cannot be safely travelled in a wheelchair!  Oh well, another battle for me to engage in.  Now let's compare Canada to the United States and their Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991. In it, there are clear federal requirements for accessible parking. What's more, states can also create further requirements and enforcement measures. These requirements also are enforced by local law officials instead of private parking authorities. Cheryl and I have been fortunate to vacation in Maui for several years and we don't think we've seen an individual illegally park in a handicapped zone. We also always find a handicapped parking spot, even when tourism is at its highest. Possible reasons? The signs in Maui state the fines associated with the offence. For example, my wife and I noticed handicapped signs that say ""HANDICAPPED PERMIT REQUIRED MAXIMUM FINE $500."" Furthermore, Cheryl and I witnessed handicapped parking spaces regularly being supervised in Maui.  And unlike here, these parking requirements are enforced by local law officials — the Maui police — instead of private parking authorities. Also, all of their signs are above ground where they are easy to see.  Does the United States ensure better care for the disabled than Canada?  When it comes to accessibility, in my opinion, the answer is a resounding ""YES.""  I have talked to different government agencies and officials about implementing changes to make the lives of disabled individuals easier. It has been a never-ending battle with many obstacles, but one that I will gladly continue.  My God, Canadians with disabilities have enough challenges to contend with every day! On a final note, we have an aging population, which, realistically, could mean an increase of disabled individuals.  What we need are far-sighted and compassionate women and men, who can empathise with the disabled community.  In fact, I invite them to live a day … no, a month … no, a year, with the challenges my wife and I have to contend with.  Until the people in power make the necessary changes to make the lives of individuals with disabilities better, the quest will continue for their human (God-given) rights!  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Health Minister Danielle McCann told a news conference Tuesday that people with mental health issues who aren't responding to treatment would be able to ask for the procedure — but she stressed such cases would be exceptional. The college of physicians also said it expects that few people would be affected. ""We don't expect many of these patients will qualify, because one of the other criteria that remains is to suffer from a disease that is not curable, which is not necessarily the case of all mental health situations,'' said Dr. Yves Robert, the college's secretary. ""It will really be an individual, case-by-case decision that will be done.'' On Tuesday, the Quebec government announced it would comply with a court ruling last year striking down part of its medical aid in dying legislation — specifically the requirement that someone seeking medically assisted death be ""at the end of life.'' The same Quebec Superior Court judgment invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the federal Criminal Code. To comply with the provincial law, prospective recipients would still have to be 18 years old or older, have the mental capacity to make their own decisions about medical care, suffer from a serious and incurable illness and be in constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain that can't be relieved. Speaking to reporters, McCann confirmed that severely mentally ill patients could qualify. ""The guide will be modified to include safeguards, elements that allow (for) medical aid in dying for people who have severe mental disorders and who are resistant to any treatment,'' McCann said. She spoke of possible additional criteria for the mentally ill — a psychiatrist would need to be consulted — and said the delay before medical aid in dying is given would be longer. The proposed changes follow Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin's ruling in September in a case brought by two Quebec residents who suffered from incurable degenerative diseases but did not meet the criteria for assisted death. The judge declared unconstitutional the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and the section of the Quebec law stating people must ""be at the end of life.'' The federal government has said it accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly, launching public consultations on how to implement the necessary changes. Those consultations will look at issues including whether those suffering from mental illness and ""mature minors'' should be eligible, as well as whether those who fear losing mental capacity and being unable to provide consent should be allowed to make advance requests for medical assistance in dying. A parliamentary review of the law is to begin this summer. Critics have said that assisted death for those whose only condition is mental illness raises complex moral and ethical issues. Some have argued there's a lack of evidence that mental illness is an incurable condition, and others have said more should be invested into treatment and resources for those suffering from mental illness. Robert said that in jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands that brought in euthanasia legislation before Canada, mental health cases have been a minority of overall cases. The college is just beginning its reflection on the mental health matter and will take time to consult groups and determine who would qualify. ""We are approaching a no-man's land, where nobody else was before, so to be prudent and to take the time to have a good reflection and to do one step at a time and do it in a spirit of serenity and wisdom is probably the best way to handle and treat these very delicate and complicated issues,'' Robert said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-to-expand-assisted-death-to-mentally-ill-but-few-expected-to-qualify-1.5437030,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,N/A

Thursday marks seven days since a state of emergency shut down St. John's, and while other surrounding communities have lifted their orders, officials are advising things won't be back to normal any time soon. ""It's played significant havoc,"" said Conception Bay South Mayor Terry French. French estimates the town needs tens of millions of dollars to get back up to speed after storm surges pummelled the harbour. ""We have basically a new coastline. A new beach. Our beautiful trail system has been destroyed in many areas,"" French said. ""We have our storm sewers that have been torn up from the ground. The yacht club, for example, is open now to the elements. It's at the mercy of the waves and the wind."" Bonavista didn't escape a similar beating. Mayor John Norman says extensive damage to the town's sea wall will require costly repairs. Numerous sections of the levee either failed or completely collapsed and disappeared into the ocean, Norman said, and pounding surf eroded land between the shoreline and oceanfront homes. ""Homes that used to be 30, 40 feet from the water, in some cases, their fence line is now five feet from the water,"" he said. The town is pressing the federal and provincial governments for emergency financial help. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said he hasn't yet considered how much the storm will cost the capital city, since there are more pressing matters to deal with. ""Cost right now is not a concern. We need to get the snow moved,"" he said. The city will also seek financial help from Ottawa, Breen said. Premier Dwight Ball announced Wednesday his government will work with municipalities to figure out the full costs of the emergency and discuss disaster relief.  ""It'll take some time to get this all calculated,"" Ball said. The City of St. John's announced it's confident the state of emergency order, which was called mid-day last Friday, will end early Saturday morning. ""We felt it was important that residents have some timeframe to work within, where they could have an expectation of when they could start getting out and around,"" Breen said early Thursday. Breen said the city chose a hard date to have an ""orderly transition"" back to normalcy, and to give people and businesses time to prepare. Until then, people continue to emerge from snowed-in houses, and the City of St. John's continues to lift restrictions on what can open. Doctors, dentists and vets are allowed to operate Thursday, and taxis can run as normal. Food stores, pharmacies and gas stations may open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Schools and government offices remain closed, but executive-level officials must report to work. On Wednesday afternoon, Brig.-Gen. Roch Pelletier said the Canadian Armed Forces effort in Newfoundland is still receiving an influx of calls from those needing help getting out of their homes. The emergency operations centre has logged over 1,000 calls since opening earlier this week, according to the province. Provincial Minister of Municipal Affairs Derrick Bragg said the direct line set up to reach military units has been bogged down by non-priority calls, such as people on vacation asking for their cars to be dug out, making it difficult for military members to reach those who are in need of priority assistance.  ""I'll give you an example, earlier this morning we went and we visited a gentleman 89 years old. He's ex-military, he's got a son with a disability, he was snowed in he could not get out of his house,"" Bragg said Wednesday. Those in need of help can call 311, 709-754-2489 or 709-729-3703, for hearing impaired text 709-691-9493. The province added another help line, run by the Canadian Red Cross, on Thursday due to the influx of requests. That number is 1-800-863-6582 and will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Army reserve units weren't the only ones landing from afar in order to help the region recover. Jim Roberts, a heavy equipment operator from Forteau, drove to St. John's from the Big Land to help clear snow. Roberts and a colleague brought in a front-end loader and snowblower, driving about 1,000 kilometres to help widen streets. He lugged the equipment on a trailer to the ferry crossing. ""We didn't have any issue getting over,"" he said. ""I can see they can use the help.""  Roberts says he's looking at long days. ""We'll run as many hours as we can.""

Minister Adrian Dix and Dr. Bonnie Henry issued a joint statement saying there have been no cases of illness caused by the coronavirus in Canada and the risk to British Columbians is considered low. However, they said, health-care workers have been asked to be vigilant and take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms following the outbreak first identified in China.

29,Karissa Donkin,2020-01-21T22:58:25.546Z,'He was so loved': Mother of man who died by suicide wants to erase stigma,"A mother whose son died by suicide last summer wants to see more people talking about addiction and mental health. Brent McLellan took his own life by jumping off Saint John's Reversing Falls Bridge on July 11, 2019. He was 43. But Marjorie and Allan McLellan had to wait six months to be able to bring Brent home.  They knew Brent died because a tourist visiting the Reversing Falls took a photo of him in the water, according to his mother. ""Otherwise, we would have been sitting here all this time saying, 'Where's Brent?'"" Marjorie McLellan said. ""As bad as that sounds, we at least knew what had happened."" Brent's remains were discovered in September in Sandy Cove Beach in Digby County, Nova Scotia. For months, police tried to piece together the mystery man's identity. The Nova Scotia RCMP pleaded for information from the public, offering details on the Urban Heritage jeans he was believed to be wearing and his Terra work boots. A forensic artist from the New York Academy of Art also developed a facial reconstruction to try to give people an idea of what he looked like. But the boots were a crucial clue. A family friend was with Brent on the day he bought the boots for a new job and she called the RCMP, McLellan said. A couple of weeks ago, the family got the news they'd been waiting to hear. Growing up on Saint John's west side, Brent loved being outside and playing with other neighbourhood children. He was also close with his two sisters. ""They just loved their brother and he loved them,"" McLellan said. Brent was a star athlete in hockey and baseball, even playing for the Saint John Alpines senior baseball team in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was one of several players who grew up together playing baseball in Lancaster and who made the jump to senior baseball at the same time, according to Terre Hunter, general manager of the Saint John Alpines. Hunter remembered Brent for his competitive drive, but also for his distinctive laugh. ""Brent was a really friendly, outgoing guy,"" Hunter said. ""Just one of those guys that people sort of migrate to."" Brent moved to western Canada to work as an insulator, but struggled to find work when he returned to New Brunswick, Hunter said. ""We certainly knew that he was having a tough time,"" he said.  ""That was no secret."" McLellan said her son was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. While he was receiving mental health services, McLellan didn't see her son getting better.  She said Brent had attempted suicide in the past. ""I really felt that's how he would die, by suicide,"" she said. ""You don't have children to bury them, that's for sure. You should not outlive your children."" As his family waited to find his body, they held Brent's funeral at Our Lady of the Assumption Church on July 24.  More than 800 people packed the church to remember him. They sang, ""Take me out to the ball game"" as the funeral procession left the church, so loud that McLellan thought the rafters were going to collapse. ""I think it surprised the family because I don't think they had any idea how many lives he had touched,"" Hunter said. He organized an honour guard of former Alpines players, who came to remember the player who once wore #7. While McLellan is happy to finally know where her son is, she's not sure she will ever have closure. ""People talk about closure, but our son is still gone,"" she said. Still, she is hoping something good can come out of her family's tragedy. McLellan would like to see more resources for people struggling with mental health issues and addictions. Most of all, she wants people to know it's OK to talk about mental health and addiction and that they shouldn't be ashamed if they are sick. She was happy to see hundreds of people line the Reversing Falls Bridge last September to honour those who have died by suicide, including her son. ""It has to come to light more, be out in the public more,"" she said. ""People have to take advantage of what's out there and not be embarrassed by it."" After Brent died, McLellan went back into her messages to look at her final words to her son. ""Have a happy, happy day Brent,"" she wrote to her son on the morning before he died. ""He was so loved and I'm so glad he knew that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brent-mclellan-saint-john-1.5435279,[],N/A

Lawyers for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly sent a letter to the British press threatening legal action after Meghan and her young son Archie were photographed walking in a public park north of Victoria.

31,Alex Soloducha,2020-01-22T10:00:00.955Z,The Ballad of William Wenaus: How a Regina musician wrote a K-pop 'global anthem',"'Wrote a ballad for one of the world's biggest K-pop artists' is a line Regina musician William Wenaus can add to his resume. Wenaus, 27, penned and produced the song Dear Me which was recorded by South Korean artist Taeyeon as the lead track for the re-release of her new album. After it was put out on Jan. 15, Purpose - The 2nd Album Repackage climbed to the number one spot in 25 countries on iTunes as more ears tuned in. Taeyeon was a member of South Korean group, Girls' Generation, for eight years before going solo. Wenaus said he thought Taeyeon would be the ideal artist while writing the song. ""[Dear Me] gave me a bit of a platform to express feelings and ideas that I couldn't get through rock music,"" said Wenaus. It was a Girls' Generation song, Mister Mister, that first introduced the composer to K-pop in 2014. Wenaus soon found himself writing more ballads and K-pop seemed like a good fit due to the sensitivity of the lyrics, he said. ""There's just really, really beautiful emotive stuff,"" he said about K-pop. ""I had things that I wanted to say and that was the medium through which I had to say those things."" Wenaus wrote and recorded the song in Regina with local musicians hired for instrumentation and vocals while he played piano. He shopped the composition around before it eventually found its way to the K-pop star. Taeyeon liked it. Her album, Purpose, was originally released in October and re-released last week with the addition of new songs, including Dear Me. Wenaus calls the song's success ""surreal,"" although he had a feeling the song would succeed because of Taeyeon.  Most of the song was translated from English to Korean, but Wenaus said Taeyeon's version captures the essence of the original — and a key part of the song was recorded in English. ""The hook in the chorus where it says 'I love myself. I trust myself,' that's from the original,"" Wenaus said. ""It's pretty cool because that's kind of become a global anthem.  ""That's pretty special and it seems to mean a lot to a lot of people which is also really, really fantastic."" Wenaus said his belief in himself, the inspiration for the song, is what got him to the point of pitching the song itself.  ""That idea of really trusting yourself and the direction that you're on ... that's how I did this."" ""That message is what got me there and that's pretty special."" The video currently has more than 11,500 comments on YouTube, which has more than 2.5 million views since it was released Jan. 15. ""I see pop music as at its best a form of care,"" said Wenaus.  ""You're reaching out to millions of people, and even if it's three-and-a-half minutes out of a person's day, to pull them out of the hustle and bustle and craziness that we live in ... and to bring them joy is a special thing."" Since the song's release, Wenaus has received lots of support from family, friends and people in Saskatchewan who don't even know him but are proud of his success.  Wenaus hopes to write from more K-pop acts and one day compose for films. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-musician-k-pop-song-success-1.5435446,[],N/A

33,Anonymous,2020-01-22T00:20:33.998Z,"New cabinet announced in crisis-hit Lebanon, but protests continue","A new cabinet was announced in crisis-hit Lebanon late Tuesday, breaking a months-long impasse amid mass protests against the country's ruling elite and a crippling financial crisis, but demonstrations and violence continued. Hassan Diab, a 60-year-old former professor at the American University of Beirut, announced a cabinet of 20 members — mostly specialists supported by the Shia group Hezbollah and allied political parties. The new government, which comes three months after former Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned, was rejected by protesters who have been calling for sweeping reforms and a government made up of independent technocrats that can deal with the country's economic and financial crisis, the worst since the 1975-90 civil war. Even before the cabinet was announced, thousands of people poured into the streets, closing major roads in the capital of Beirut and other parts of the country in protest. The protesters complained that political groups still were involved in the naming of the new ministers, even if they are specialists and academics. Later, a group of protesters near Parliament threw stones, firecrackers and sticks at security forces, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray. ""We want a government of experts ... who are they kidding?"" said one protester, Fadi Zakour. ""We have been protesting for 90 days and we are not happy to close roads,"" he added. Diab saluted the protesters in the street and vowed to ""work to fulfil your demands."" In a speech addressing the country following the government announcement, he added that his cabinet is the first government in the history of Lebanon to be made up entirely of technocrats. He insisted the 20 ministers are specialists who have no political loyalties and are not partisan. Diab appealed to citizens to help the government implement a ""rescue program"" and said this cabinet has the ""capability and qualifications, will and commitment"" to carry it through. ""It's time to get to work,"" Diab said. For three months, the leaderless protests have been calling for a government made up of specialists that can work on dealing with the economic crisis. The protests have recently turned violent, with around 500 people injured in confrontations between protesters and security forces over the weekend. Although the government announced Tuesday is technically made up of specialists, the ministers were named by political parties in a process involving horse trading and bickering with little regard for the demands of protesters for a transparent process and independent candidates. Still, among the ministers named were accomplished academics and six women, including the minister of defence and deputy prime minister. The number is a record for Lebanon, with women now holding more than quarter of the Cabinet posts, including those of defence, justice, labour, youth and sports and the displaced. ""The independence of justice will be among our top priorities and I will put all my efforts to move in this direction,"" Justice Minister Marie-Claude Najm told local LBC TV. Analysts said the new government, being politically aligned with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, would likely have difficulty drumming up international and regional support needed to avoid economic collapse. ""The cabinet includes a fair number of capable technocrats, but it does not have any political independence to speak of,"" wrote Paul Salem, president of the Middle East Institute. ""This government is likely to be short lived, to preside over a steep decline in the economy, a dangerous swerve in the state's security relationships, and growing social and political unrest in the country,"" he predicted. The heads of the main ministries include career diplomat Naseef Hitti for the Foreign Ministry. Economist Ghazi Wazni was named finance minister and former army Gen. Mohammed Fahmi was named minister of the interior. Zeina Akar was named minister of defence and deputy prime minister. Lebanon has been without a government since Hariri resigned Oct. 29, two weeks into the unprecedented nationwide protest movement. Diab dismissed accusations that his was a government made up of one political camp consisting of Hezbollah and its allies, insisting it was the government of all of Lebanon. He also said it was natural to consult with political parties on the names of ministers, because in the end they are the ones that will decide the vote of confidence in Parliament needed for the cabinet. Diab said his first visit as prime minister will be to the Arab region, particularly to the Gulf Arab countries — a nod to Saudi Arabia, which was the main backer of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Backing from oil-rich Gulf countries is badly needed in Lebanon that has one of the highest debt ratios in the world. He said the government would get to work immediately and hold its first meeting Wednesday. Panic and anger have gripped the public as the Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummeted in value. It fell more than 60 per cent in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and flows of foreign currency dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most basic goods. Shortly before the cabinet was announced Tuesday night, the Syndicate of Money Changers in Lebanon issued a statement saying it had agreed to set the exchange rate at a maximum of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, after it reached 2,500 pounds to the dollar last week. The official price still stands at 1,507 to the dollar.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-lebanon-cabinet-1.5435450,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/beirut-rocked-lebanon-clashes-1.5432673 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-protests-1.5431739 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371,N/A

Sveinung Rotevatn said the country has done it simply by making electric vehicles a good deal. ""The most important incentive would be that the vehicle would be exempt from all taxes,"" said Rotevatn. ""In Norway we tax regular cars quite heavily and have been for many years. So if you want to buy a great vehicle at a cheap price, the electric vehicle would be your option."" The incentives don't stop when you've purchased your car. Norway provides special commuter lanes and free parking, and exemptions from road and ferry tolls. Rotevatn said it was important for Norway to look at vehicles if it was going to reduce its carbon footprint. While other countries have been able to cut back on a carbon-fueled power grid, Norway was already running on abundant hydroelectricity. It is a situation similar to P.E.I.'s, where transportation is the source of 48 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Norway also faced similar climate and geographic challenges. ""Norway with its cold winter climate, vast distances, sparse populations, is probably, in theory, the worst country in the world to try to launch an electric mobility revolution,"" said Rotevatn. ""If you can do it here you can do it anywhere. And that means you can also obviously do it in P.E.I. and then in Canada."" There are two basic options for encouraging electric vehicle purchase, he said. Make the vehicles cheaper, or make gas more expensive. Norway opted for cheaper vehicles, he said, because more expensive gas can have a disproportionate effect on lower-income people, who may not be able to afford to buy a new vehicle. Rotevatn believes one way or another, running an electric vehicle needs to be the cheaper option for people. ""The environmentally-best option also needs to be the cheapest option for people,"" he said. ""I don't think there is enough idealism in the world that people are going to be willingly spending more on a car than they have to to save the environment."" Rotevatn said the only thing keeping electric vehicle sales from being even higher in Norway is a lack of models that are appropriate for large families or work purposes.

37,Hallie Cotnam,2020-01-23T09:00:00.003Z,'Athletic' pigs won't let fence stand between them and a good time,"The pigs at Peabody Farm in Venosta, Que., can't fly, exactly, but they do get air. ""Oh, yeah, pigs jump. I see them jump over the fence the same way their mothers did. They're pretty athletic,"" farmer Pierre Laframboise said. The nimble porkers have been escaping their enclosures at the small operation, about 60 kilometres up Highway 105 from Gatineau, Que., thanks largely to the recent snowfall. First, the growing snowdrifts are helping make the low-slung wire fencing even less of a hurdle for the animals. Second, the low-voltage electrical current that pulses through the wire packs less of a punch in winter, and is therefore less of a deterrent to would-be escapees. ""There's not as good of a ground connection because the pigs are walking on snow instead of dirt,"" Laframboise explained. And don't they know it. Chief among the slippery sows is a pair of escape artists aptly named Thelma and Louise. The boar, Themistocles, also likes to make a run for it.  It's their offspring that Laframboise sends to market. ""The ones that we bring to slaughter, we don't name,"" he observed.  A bottle-fed runt named Tiny, who has his own growing following on Instagram, is the exception, and has been having a heck of a time in the fresh snow lately.  Laframboise and his partner, Sandra Marsters, aren't too worried about the strays. Their farm is on a little-used road, and their small herd of mainly Tamworths appear to be homebodies, sticking close by despite their new-found freedom. The farthest they've wandered is about 750 metres down the road, Laframboise said. ""Then they'll see the truck. I'll roll down the window and call 'em up, 'C'mon girls, let's get going,' and they'll follow."" The bristled pigs don't seem to mind the cold, either. They'll sometimes huddle together or warm up in their straw-filled shelter, but curiosity keeps them seeking out new territory, Laframboise said. ""They just want to explore. They want to have some fun."" Of course, staying close to home also means a higher likelihood of being fed. The animals will often climb onto the porch, and even nose their way into the house. ""'Where's our dinner? C'mon buddy, let's go. Time for lunch,'"" Laframboise imagines them saying. Watch this space for updates on the Peabody Farm pigs. Several of the sows are due to farrow around Valentine's Day. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/pig-farm-snow-fencing-free-range-cold-sows-boar-piglet-1.5434621,[],N/A
38,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-11-28T19:42:49.629Z,Customers file record number of complaints about Canadian telcos,"David Marco has no shortage of unflattering adjectives for Bell Canada — a telecom service provider he says convinced him to sign on as a customer by misrepresenting the true cost of a two-year deal for internet, TV and home phone. ""It's outrageous. It's patently wrong. It's deceptive,"" Marco, 65, told Go Public from his home in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. In October, he filed a complaint with the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) — and he's got company. According to the industry mediator's annual report, consumers filed a record-breaking number of complaints against Canada's telecom companies in 2018-19 — nearly 19,300.  The CCTS says that figure is a 35 per cent increase over 2017-18 and an all-time high in the organization's 12-year history.  ""It's disappointing to see … issues that customers shouldn't have to deal with,"" said CCTS Commissioner Howard Maker. ""It tells us that there's still room for improvement."" The report, released Thursday, tracks complaints received between Aug. 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019, of which the greatest share (over 40 per cent) were billing errors, followed by contract disputes (over 30 per cent) and dissatisfaction with service delivery (over 20 per cent).  CCTS says it ""successfully resolved"" 91 per cent of all concluded complaints. Bell Canada, the country's largest telecom, with 22 million subscriptions, received the most complaints — almost 5,900. (A customer with multiple services from the same provider can be associated with several subscriptions.) Complaints against Bell about incorrect charges and ""disclosure of important information"" were ""disproportionately high,"" according to the report.  A Bell spokesperson notes the company's share of total complaints declined slightly over the previous year, and that it is reviewing the report to ""ensure that they continue to provide customers with the best experience.""  Rogers, which has about 16 million subscriptions, received just over 1,800 complaints. Its share of complaints also slightly decreased over the previous year.  Rogers had a ""disproportionately high percentage"" of complaints about incorrect charges on wireless accounts, but received a slightly lower proportion of complaints about credits and refunds that weren't received on internet services.  A Rogers spokesperson said the company had the fewest complaints per subscriber among the national carriers and has ""started to see progress"" in improving its customer service. Telus, with 14.5 million subscribers, received just over 1,600 complaints — up 71 per cent.  Most of those were about either changes to wireless contracts (28 per cent) or wireless price increases (30 per cent), according to the report. It received a lower proportion of complaints about incorrect wireless charges and contract disputes. ""Shame on us that we had language that was confusing and not transparent,"" Tony Geheren, executive VP at Telus, told Go Public. He says the increase in complaints was a result of a ""poorly executed rate change"" for wireless customers and that Telus has since simplified its contracts.  The report notes 158 violations of the Wireless Code — a 42 per cent increase. Most involved a failure of companies to provide customers with key documents, and not giving proper notice before disconnecting a customer's service. Bell accounted for 29 per cent of all Wireless Code breaches, while Rogers and Telus each accounted for 20 per cent.  Marco's frustration began last March, when he says a Bell sales representative promised him internet, TV and home phone service for $119.90 a month for two years. But in September, the price for his TV service went up by $3.50. When he called Bell, he recorded the conversation, and a second rep told him to look at the contract the company emailed him after he verbally agreed to sign up — it mentions that prices are ""subject to change."" Marco says he didn't scrutinize the contract, because he was going with what the first rep offered him on the phone. He requested a transcript of that conversation but was told that wasn't possible.  ""There will be no way for us, sir, to send you a copy of the transcript,"" the rep said. Marco says that's nonsense. ""The contract was the phone call. They're denying that they have the contract,"" he said.  He says a story reported by Go Public last year supports his argument — a case that went to small claims court determined that a verbal agreement between a customer and Bell trumps any written contract that the telecom giant emails after the fact. CCTS investigated but said it couldn't help, because according to Bell the transcript no longer existed. The company only holds them for six months which, according to a Bell spokesperson, is ""standard practice"" in the industry. ""I think that's problematic,"" said Maker, the head of the CCTS.  ""We've spent a lot of time asking the CRTC … to ensure that service providers are retaining records so that an independent investigation can be obtained and the actual facts can be determined."" ""The ability to … investigate what happened is limited in the absence of that phone call."" Consumer advocate John Lawford says what's really needed is a ban on price increases for internet and TV during the life of a contract — the same way companies aren't permitted to jack up prices during a cellphone contract. ""The Wireless Code doesn't let you change your wireless pricing for two years,"" Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, told Go Public. ""It kind of sets the trap for consumers who are expecting the same protections on internet and TV as they have on their wireless phone."" He says the CRTC missed a ""golden opportunity"" when it created similar rules for internet service, which come into effect on Jan. 31.  ""They allowed the Internet Code to go into effect without the rule that you have to keep the price the same,"" says Lawford. ""It is a very big missed opportunity."" Lawford doesn't think the telco giants will lock in prices for internet and TV contracts unless the regulator demands it. He says people fed up with ""unfair"" contracts should complain to the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and their MP.  ""Put pressure on those powers that be — to make the rules for internet and TV the same as they are for as they are for wireless,"" says Lawford.  Meantime, Marco says he will find another provider when his two-year contract is over. For now, he has advice for anyone calling a telecom.  ""Record the conversation. Record anything — incoming and outgoing,"" he says. ""Because it's the only protection that they'll get.""

39,Erica Johnson,2019-09-23T00:00:51.953Z,Banks tell dozens of customers they're to blame for thousands of dollars lost to e-transfer fraudsters,"A Manitoba man says marketing that claims people are protected when they e-transfer money is misleading, after fraudsters stole $3,000 and TD Bank said he was to blame. Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.  The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime. ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account."" Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements. Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves. ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive."" As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone. That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back. ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious."" He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate. TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""  Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions. The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.  Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer. ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.  They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.  In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.  ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating."" All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.  Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases: Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.  Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement. TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.  In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""  In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen. ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?"" She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted."" CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January. Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg."" He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm."" ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police."" Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police. ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner."" Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits. He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

40,Anonymous,2020-01-21T15:16:44.288Z,"When 'math is accessible to any brain,' we can make better political, social choices, says mathematician","Read Story Transcript If more people were comfortable with math, they would approach politics and social issues in a more rational way, says mathematician and playwright John Mighton. ""We had a financial crisis because people didn't understand what would happen if their mortgage rates went up slightly,"" he told The Current's host Matt Galloway. ""And we have an environmental crisis because people can't add up the consequences of their actions because we're so afraid of math or numbers."" Mighton recently published a book on the subject: All Things Being Equal: Why Math is the Key to a Better World.  Math teaches you ""to create arguments, to look for hidden presuppositions, to see patterns, make inferences,"" he says. ""We'd have a much healthier society if people didn't immediately seize on the first explanation of an event. If they were trained in probability, they'd learn to consider all the possibilities,"" he said. ""And more deeply, if people were confident in their problem-solving abilities, they would actually think deeply about the problems before they arrived at an opinion."" Mighton, who is also the founder of JUMP Math — a Toronto-based charitable organization promoting numeracy — wasn't always a numbers evangelist.  In fact, until he was 30 years old, he didn't even think he was very good at it. But as a young, struggling playwright, he decided to pick up a side gig as an elementary school math tutor. He ended up discovering he loved the subject. ""It was a revelation to me that by explaining the math and working at it over and over at my own pace, things that were mysterious to me became easier and easier,"" he said. Mighton realized that for years he had bought into what he says is a far too common misconception: that math is difficult and most people don't get it. ""We have to drop that myth because at all levels, from early childhood development right up to brain scans of mathematicians, the research is suggesting that math is accessible to any brain,"" he said. The issue, Mighton says, is that math tends to be taught in ways ""that aren't really well supported by evidence in the science of learning."" For example, teachers and parents often try to teach problem-solving skills by starting out with complex, multi-step math problems, he says. But math, he explains, is more like a ladder than other subjects: ""If you miss something, it's very hard to go on."" If those initial steps are missed, not only does it become difficult to learn those more complex concepts, but even young children will quickly decide they're not so-called math people, he says. ""There's research that suggests as early as Grade 1, kids know where they are in the hierarchy. They know if they're in the inferior group,"" he said. ""Once you decide you're in the inferior group, you stop engaging, working, you stop remembering things. Eventually you develop anxieties by Grade 3 or Grade 4, and it makes it very hard for your brain to work."" Instead, he says educators should introduce math concepts in bite-sized chunks, or what he calls ""more scaffolded problems,"" and then gradually work their way up to tougher problems. ""The key is keeping the student in a zone that they can be confident and think,"" he said. Mighton says he's been astounded by the potential of children when they're taught in this way. He recalled teaching a class full of students with violent behavioural issues, ""who were thought to be unteachable."" Mighton taught them how to read binary code, and how to use it to do a magic trick.  ""They went nuts. They thought they were little code breakers,"" he said.  On their third lesson, the children actually cheered when Mighton and his team came in. ""It tells me there's just this inestimable potential in children, not only for learning, but for a sense of wonder and curiosity."" ""Kids enjoy doing math as much as playing sports or creating art if they're allowed to succeed."" Written by Allie Jaynes.

41,Michelle Ghoussoub,2020-01-23T16:22:49.113Z,"Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus ","Shortly after news broke that a case of coronavirus had been confirmed in Washington state, John Elzinga, who manages an industrial supply store in Langley, B.C., noticed that boxes of his N95 face masks were suddenly flying off the shelves. ""Just [Wednesday] morning there was a big rush, out of nowhere. They were all in looking for the same thing,"" he said. ""It was unusual. You get the feeling right away that there was something else going on."" The standard-issue industrial dust masks, normally used for construction and industrial manufacturing, weren't being purchased by workers in steel-toed boots and hard hats — his usual clientele — but by ""regular off-the-street families,"" he said. One person came in and bought 30 boxes all at once. They were soon sold out. ""The good news is they're on sale. This isn't a price-gouging scenario,"" he said with a laugh, adding that some customers specifically asked if the masks would protect from coronavirus. But Danuta Skowronski, with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said the agency is not recommending that people use the masks to protect themselves — and would be unlikely to ever issue such a directive. ""That is a huge cost with no proven benefit. It could run the risk of draining our supply of masks for the real indications that we have in the health-care system, and even from an environmental perspective, it's ill-advised,"" she said. Skowronski said the one time she would advise the use of a face mask would be for someone who has symptoms and who is entering a health-care facility for treatment. Elzinga said he's previously noticed a run on face masks at his store, back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. At the time, the Public Health Agency of Canada asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks. The report found that masks can offer protection, but there's no evidence inexpensive masks can protect against flu virus particles small enough to be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract or the lungs.  It did find that the N95 masks — like those sold at Elzinga's store — are the most likely to be efficient because they filter particles smaller than one micron in size and provide a tight facial seal. On Wednesday, British Columbia's health minister and provincial health officer said officials are closely monitoring the international outbreak, which can cause pneumonia, fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. It has killed 17 people. China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has said the outbreak likely resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating.  The BCCDC has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, and public health teams have implemented screening for early detection of infections for travellers arriving in airports. Skowronski said the risk to people in B.C. remains low — and for people travelling in China, the best protection is to avoid contact with animal markets and wash your hands regularly. ""I don't want people to misinterpret the intense interest in this virus by public health as an indication that this is a serious threat to British Columbians today,"" she said. ""Rather, the reason that public health is so interested is that we are in an all-out effort to try to contain this virus and stamp it out, and that requires huge effort by public health at all levels of our health-care system,"" she said. Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-masks-1.5437209,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-coronavirus-screening-test-airports-1.5436045 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5435286,N/A
42,Jason Vermes,2020-01-22T20:52:11.132Z,"As St. John's area returns to normal, small business owners are feeling the pinch after days of closures","Five days after a blizzard hammered the Northeast Avalon, prompting states of emergency in St. John's and surrounding communities, businesses in the region — and their employees — are starting to feel the pressure of nearly a week without work. Amanda Skinner, owner of Mount Pearl comic book shop Heroes and Hobbies, says she's worried about her future if customers aren't able to start coming into the store. ""Being only open for two years, there is no profit there yet. I mean, I don't get paid. I don't get a paycheque or anything like that,"" she said. ""Not only do I have the bills here for the shop, I have bills at home."" With many businesses still closed under a state of emergency, workers are beginning to feel the pinch. Hourly workers in particular have wondered whether they will be compensated for shifts cancelled as a result of the storm. Despite a hodgepodge of government programs to support workers, Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour president Mary Shortall says there is little available for employees during crises like last week's blizzard. When it comes to a program like employment insurance, ""[workers] apply once they get laid off. There's paperwork, there's waiting lists, they have to have so many hours accumulated,"" Shortall said. ""Something like that probably wouldn't be a very easy fix for someone who's lost four or five days and immediately needs it."" For sole proprietors like Skinner, support can't come soon enough.  ""This is going to affect small businesses all over for much longer than what we anticipated,"" she said. At his Mount Pearl garage, Auto Care owner Jerome Terry says business has been slow to pick up since he reopened yesterday after a two-day closure. On average, the garage takes in 10 to 12 cars each day, he says. On Tuesday, he saw only two. ""I think I gathered an hour's labour out of all,"" he said, adding that Wednesday was much the same. He says it comes down to car owners simply being unable to get to him. With a state of emergency still in effect in St. John's, many of his customers can't drive to the garage. Though he's confident his shop will weather the storm, he's also anticipating a bit of a downturn.  He wants the government to step in and offer financial supports, like tax breaks or subsidies, to help local businesses get back on their feet after the storm. Despite the loss of revenue, however, he says his shop's three employees won't be out of pocket for the work they lost — but Terry will be shouldering the cost from a personal account.  ""I'm going to use a line of credit — take money from my line of credit — and deposit it to the bank and write the boys their cheques,"" he said. Hobby shop owner Skinner says she hopes government relief funds will be made available, but she's hesitant. ""There's not really a whole lot for sole proprietorships,"" Skinner said. ""If we get sick, we don't get sick benefits.… We work around the clock 24/7 and there's no EI there. There's no anything."" In the meantime, she says residents have been encouraging others on social media to visit local businesses hit hard by the storm once roads are clear. Next month, Heroes and Hobbies will be marking its second year in business. Skinner hopes she'll be there celebrating. ""I hope it'll pick up again for the next year,"" she said.

Amin Yussuf, 29, remains wanted on Canada-wide warrants in connection to the shooting death of 26-year-old Abubeker Gemechu Abduraman on March 24, 2019. Police believe Yussuf returned to Xhale Lounge after he was kicked out and started firing a gun into the bar. Abduraman was killed and two others were injured. Yussuf is wanted for first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder using a firearm and unauthorized possession of a firearm. Yussuf, who was first identified as a suspect in June 2019, is also known by the following aliases: Abdirizak Yussuf, Craig Yussuf, Mohemed Yussuf, Mohemed Mohamed and Mohammed Farrah. He has connections to the Northwest Territories, as well as Edmonton, Toronto and Prince Albert, Sask., said police. The investigation has given police reason to believe Yussuf may be in the N.W.T.'s Yellowknife or Hay River areas, said Edmonton Police Service spokesperson Cheryl Sheppard.

She said police will post wanted flyers in the communities in a campaign that will last about six months. Sheppard reminded residents not to approach Yussuf if he's spotted, but to call 911. ""We don't expect or want anyone to engage in any confrontation with him,"" she said.  The reward is offered by the Stephan Crétier Foundation, a private charitable foundation, through a program called Bolo (standing for Be On The Lookout), which helps police seeking public assistance in serious criminal offences. Crétier is founder, chairman, president and CEO of GardaWorld Security Corporation. According to its website, Bolo uses social and mainstream media to increase exposure for most-wanted notices. The reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the arrest of Yussuf is available until July 21, 2020, through Crime Stoppers.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/amin-yussuf-reward-nightclub-shooting-death-1.5434754,[],N/A
44,Steve Thomas,2019-12-14T09:00:00.675Z,"Careful, Canada: What Ireland has learned about two-tier health care","This column is an opinion by Steve Thomas, director of the Centre for Health Policy and Management at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. He has been studying the issue of privatization in Canada, is the author of a chapter on Canadian health care in the book 'Is Two-Tier Health Care the Future?,' and has collaborated with the University of Toronto and University of Ottawa. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Be careful what you wish for, Canada. One way or the other, Canadian courts are about to make some key decisions about the role of private financing and practice in the health care system; the Cambie case in British Columbia is just the latest attempt to overturn fundamental components of publicly funded medicare.  Closing arguments were made last week and the decision in this legal case, which is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, will have ramifications for decades and for millions of people. So, what can international experience teach us? One particularly illuminating case is Ireland. It is striking that as Canada seems on the cusp of embracing two-tier health care, Ireland is struggling to limit it. In 1957, the Irish Republic decided to set up a voluntary health insurer owned by the state to take the pressure off the public system, allowing health care to be bought by those who had the means. It sounded reasonable, and 60 years later, private health insurance has taken off with almost half the population covered and plans offered by private companies. This allows faster access to public care subsidized by the state, and queue-jumping of the very long waiting lists by those who are better off financially. Despite only accounting for 12 per cent of total health funds, however, private insurance in Ireland now drives access to hospital care – the tail that wags the dog. Private health insurance occupies a unique role in the Irish setting, providing faster access to care in both public- and private-provider settings. However, it does not always cover hospital expenses and often covers a fraction or nothing at all for non-hospital care, such as outpatient appointments with a specialist, GP visits, and care from allied health professionals. It also does not cover drug costs (there is a government reimbursement threshold for households spending more than a fixed amount in a month). Moreover, the benefits of queue jumping only accrue to those who are able to afford private health insurance premiums — and there are concerns about that affordability. The cost of insurance varies hugely by product and there are more than 300 hospital plans, but for an adult with public and private hospital coverage, the cheapest is around $1,900 per year. A recent study showed that roughly 19 per cent of households experience unaffordable private health expenditures, which includes both private health insurance and co-payments. The latest household survey suggests that people are going without some GP services and dental care in order to afford health insurance plans. Ireland has historically been way off the pace when it comes to delivering universal health care. It is an outlier in Europe, with one of the highest proportions of national income spent on voluntary health insurers — 13 per cent in 2017, compared to an EU average of 2 per cent. The result is two-tier access to acute care, and only very average results in terms of health outcomes. (The other two countries with large voluntary health insurance sectors are France and Slovenia, but their insurers cover co-payments and they do not allow faster access). Rather than helping the public sector out, private insurance may have contributed to its problems in Ireland. It erodes solidarity, giving the well-off a way out of engaging with the public sector, and potentially aggravating under-funding by making the better-off less willing to be taxed more for health. It also means that dual-practice providers – those who work in both the public and private sectors — have an incentive to keep their public waiting lists long to boost their private practices. Private insurance also costs every taxpayer regardless of their insurance status, because the government subsidizes those who take out private insurance by offering tax breaks. As a potential way out of this two-tier system, the Fine Gael Labour government of 2011 proposed Irish private insurers become the basis of a universal health insurance system, modelled on the Dutch managed competition system. However, this policy cul-de-sac proved too expensive and too complex, and it has now been abandoned for a more typical re-energizing of the public system in the guise of the ""Sláintecare"" policy. The core aims of Sláintecare are to establish a universal, single-tier health service where patients are treated solely on the basis of health need and funded through general taxation. This means a removal of private insurance funding from public hospitals over a period of six years, with waiting-time guarantees backed up by increased accountability and information. In other words, a return to publicly funded health care. Nevertheless, the disentangling of the public and private systems is complicated; it will take careful planning, coalition-building, and changing the public narrative about the nature of the health system. The introduction of private health insurance in Ireland allowed a two-tier system to develop with long waiting lists in the public system and limited financial protection for households. It has impeded a fair, efficient and integrated system, and there has been profiteering by some insurers since the liberalization. It has taken decades to develop a plan that will disentangle public and private health care financing in Ireland. Implementation will take another 10 years at least. While Canada might be considering an expanded role for private health services and insurance, such a decision needs to be taken with sober judgment. It cannot be easily unwound.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-two-tier-health-care-canada-ireland-1.5383995,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgery-centre-trial-1.5363013 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/closing-arguments-begin-in-legal-case-over-private-health-care-in-b-c-1.5364329 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/surgery-wait-times-alberta-shandro-reduce-1.5390893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/extremely-concerned-protesters-decry-ontario-health-care-cuts-changes-1.5354513 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lawrencetown-cooperative-doctor-recruitment-telehealth-maple-out-of-pocket-1.5138483,N/A

Pandya is among a growing contingent of researchers working on new technology that would allow humans to colonize the martian world. The Edmonton-based physician is serving as an astronaut on the red planet from the heart of the desert lands of the western United States. Pandya is acting as the commander of a 16 day mission at the Mars Desert Research Station near Hanksville, Utah. The mission officially began on Jan. 18. She will ""return to Earth"" on Feb. 3.  ""We're going to be living real life on fake mars,"" Pandya said in an interview Friday with CBC Radio's Edmonton AM. ""We're essentially living in a tin can."" The research station simulates life on Mars so researchers can study the science needed for human exploration of the planet. ""We're locked in, not locked in,"" she said.  ""You have to suit up to go outside because going outside would essentially kill you so that's the biggest adjustment.""  Pandya and her crew will be contending with all the complications of life in a hostile environment. The atmosphere on Mars is barren and deadly. Radiation is high. Oxygen is virtually nonexistent. Her water supply will be limited. Her meals will be freeze-dried or grown in an enclosed greenhouse on site. Communication with Earth will be limited.  ""In the past we've grown tomatoes and basil and thyme so there is a little bit of an opportunity for fresh food on Mars,"" she said.  ""And then you also maintain the time delays with Earth so, at its maximum that's a one way 20 minute communication delay, so you can imagine that nothing like phone calls or Skype or instant messaging is possible.""  This is Pandya's second mission at the research station and part of a growing resume in space research and bioastronautics.  Pandya, who grew up in Sherwood Park, and earned two degrees at the University of Alberta, is an advanced diver, skydiver, pilot-in-training, and Fellow of the Explorers' Club. In 2015 she successfully completed Scientist-Astronaut Candidate training with Project PoSSUM (Polar Suborbital Science in the Upper Mesosphere) and was part of the first crew to test a commercial spacesuit in zero-gravity; She most recently completed an underwater mission with Nautical Experiments in Physiology, Technology & Underwater Exploration (NEPTUNE) for scientific research. She was selected as part of a five-member team of scientists that took part in the NEPTUNE research mission at the Jules Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Fla.  The mission in October kept the scientists underwater for five days to study the effects on the human body.

46,Andie Bulman,2020-01-23T14:57:11.141Z,Bartering in the blizzard: How a neighbourhood managed before the stores reopened,"We'll always remember this storm.  Stories of how we tunneled through snowdrifts to free our neighbours, and collectively heralded Baby Snow as our once and future king, will be swapped for years. For me, the most significant lesson learned is that bartering and sharing are alive and well.  Like most of us, I barely left my house on Friday. I made one trek outdoors (I live in the Georgestown neighbourhood, not far from the downtown core), but mostly draped myself in blankets, played Scrabble, and prayed to the Netflix gods that we wouldn't lose power. Saturday came and our power flickered back on. I thanked the Netflix gods and the Light and Power B'ys. Then I turned on the radio. The state of emergency was already a day in effect. Roads were carless, stores were closed. The mayor warned that this could continue for at least a few days. My supplies had held up pretty good, but I made a few critical errors — most notably, I was already low on butter. I reached out to the world via Facebook. Beehak (a talented pastry chef) responded! She would be happy to trade a cup of butter for two eggs. We met halfway down Barnes Road and made the swap. It felt like something that would have happened in the 1930s. Later that day, I baked several blueberry crisps and bartered one for ground coffee and buttermilk (I wanted to make waffles). I also gave a blueberry crisp to my next-door neighbours. They had lent me snowshoes, so I could venture downtown into the carless snowglobe world. The trade seemed more than fair. I'm a creature who consumes tons of butter and after an afternoon of baking, I was low again. I emptied out my liquor cabinet and swapped vodka for more butter. Later in the day, I traded tonic water and limes for chips and tea bags.  Each time I left my house, I carried a backpack and shovel.  I stopped at neighbours' houses and pitched in along the way. The neighbourhood was alive. People were trading supplies, digging out fire hydrants, and helping each other out. I passed several bonfires, impromptu snowboarding trails and really gorgeous snow forts. I was constantly offered beer in exchange for my labour, which seemed especially generous considering what a hot commodity beer is in the barter system. I've been trying to do a dry January, so I declined each time. In one neighbourhood, a big Victorian house had set up a hot chocolate booth and from all over weary shovels stopped for a break. The snow was brutal, but compassion and sharing matched it tit for tat. Our own car was buried in a seven-foot drift. Friends, my husband and I tackled it for two hours and took a break. When I returned to my car, someone had blown it out completely. I could have kissed them — or at least given them a high five. By late Saturday, Mark Wilson, organic farmer and man about town, set up a Facebook Group called Stone Soup. It was/is a place where people could swap supplies or ask for help if their food ran out during the state of emergency. Some folks offered to trek across the city in skis to deliver toilet paper. Others baked bread and knocked on doors. I hope Mark keeps the site up, because it almost stands as a monument to both human kindness and the lack of food security we have in this province.  By Sunday, I had settled into my state of emergency routine. Shovel something for someone, catch up on missed work and emails, go for a walk and trade my supplies for other supplies, keep an eye on Stone Soup in case someone needed something that I had, and then read or play video games with my dog and husband.  Monday night, we had a neighbourhood cookout, something we haven't done before. Circular Road was like another world, never seen anything like it. Here's what it was like yesterday when ever a plow couldn't make it through the street <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/nHKZdxnYbf"">pic.twitter.com/nHKZdxnYbf</a> Luke and Nina opened up their home and carved out some snow seats in their front lawn. Others baked treats, emptied out their freezers, and dragged over their barbecues. We had a celeriac, apple and moose sausage dish; carrot ginger soup; leek and potato soup; Jim Lahey's famous no-knead bread, ribs, moose chili, nachos and more blueberry crumble. Everyone brought their babies. The good cheer was palatable. I broke my resolution of having a dry January and had a glass of prosecco. After all of the bartering and kindness, sharing a drink with my neighbours had never seemed so important.

48,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-22T00:04:47.499Z,"P.E.I. Home and School Federation, Opposition criticize for-profit involvement in school lunch plan","Both the P.E.I. Home and School Federation and the Official Opposition say the provincial government should steer clear of private, for-profit food companies in developing a new school lunch program. Two weeks ago the province's Department of Education laid out the parameters for a pilot of the new program with two tracks — one involving private companies providing healthy meals for students, the other using Public Schools Branch staff to prepare meals at Kinkora Regional High School, distributing those to nearby schools. ""School food and profit don't really go well together,"" said Karla Bernard, education critic for the Green Party and chair of the province's standing committee on education and economic growth.  ""You know this isn't about making money, this is about feeding kids."" The overall plan is for government to roll out a healthy lunch program at all Island schools in the fall of 2020, based on the results of the two competing pilots involving six schools.  At a meeting on Jan. 7, MLAs on the education committee were told the model used could vary from school-to-school, some using the not-for-profit model, some using private companies — Chartwells at Montague High used as one example — who already provide services in the schools. Following a discussion at its board meeting Monday night, the P.E.I. Home and School Federation said it's hoping to see a non-profit lunch program emerge. What will be served in the school food program? Here is a draft menu for the pilot at Kinkora Regional High School. <a href=""https://twitter.com/PSBPEI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@PSBPEI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/EducationPEI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@EducationPEI</a> <a href=""https://t.co/DJa5J6VkVr"">pic.twitter.com/DJa5J6VkVr</a> ""When you're talking not-for-profit that means you can support local, that the well-being of children is the number one priority of such a program, not profit,"" said federation president Cory Thomas. The federation has been advocating for a universal lunch program since 2015, Thomas noted.  He said a non-profit model would receive support from donors in the community, and be more likely to incorporate local ingredients into meal plans. ""At the end of the day, our role is to advocate for children and a non-profit model would assist with poverty reduction in communities buying local,"" he said. Government is setting a maximum price point of $5 for lunches, but offering financial support so families that can't afford meals can still take part. ""I think we all agree that it's going to have potential for such a great impact long-term on P.E.I., the health of our population and an immediate impact on students' ability to learn,"" said Education Minister Brad Trivers. Trivers said some government funding during the pilot might end up going to the private companies involved to allow them to provide meals at the $5 price point. He said regardless of whether schools end up preparing their own meals in-house or with a private company, the service will be the same. ""It is not about making a profit,"" said Trivers. ""We're going to use private contractors in areas where it makes sense. Where they can deliver service at a value that we can't match in-house."" Trivers said ultimately all school lunch programs, whether non-profit or privately run, will come under the administration of a new charitable organization, which government has suggested will be supported by donations from the public and corporations. When asked if the public might be less willing to donate to an organization paying private corporations to provide school meals, Trivers said ""That's definitely a valid concern. But that's why we're doing the pilot. That's why we're giving everyone a chance to see what it looks like.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-school-federation-oppose-private-food-companies-1.5435050,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-lunches-free-motion-passes-1.5427677 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-lunch-program-1.5418313 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oleary-fire-dog-saves-owner-1.5433694,N/A
49,Anonymous,2020-01-22T12:00:24.138Z,"U.S. Senate approves Trump impeachment trial plan, rejects Democrats on documents, witnesses","The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted early on Wednesday on party lines to approve the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, rejecting Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and ensure witnesses are heard. As the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history began in earnest, Trump's chief legal defender argued the Democratic case was a baseless effort to overturn the 2016 election, but a top Democratic lawmaker said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence of wrongdoing. Trump was impeached last month by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and impeding the inquiry into the matter. The president denies any wrongdoing. After U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts convened the proceedings, the two sides began more than 12 hours of squabbling that lasted into Wednesday morning over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposed rules for the trial. Senators voted along party lines, 53-47, to block four separate motions from Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to subpoena records and documents from the White House, the State Department, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine. By the same tally, senators also rejected requests for subpoenas seeking the testimony of acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton, White House aide Robert Blair and White House budget official Michael Duffey. Under McConnell's hastily revised set of procedures for the trial, there will be 48 hours of opening arguments — 24 hours for each side — over six days, easing off an earlier plan to keep them to two days each. It also allows the House's record of the probe to be admitted as evidence. The arguments will begin when the trial resumes at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday. WATCH | How the impeachment trial may play out: Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point after opening arguments and 16 hours of senators' questions, but they held firm with Trump's lawyers to block Tuesday's Democratic requests for witnesses and evidence, a potentially good sign for the White House. White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Trump's defence, attacked the foundation of the Democrats' charges against the Republican president and said they had not come close to meeting the U.S. Constitution's standard for impeachment. ""The only conclusion will be that the president has done absolutely nothing wrong,"" Cipollone said as he argued in favour of McConnell's proposal to decide on whether to allow further witnesses or documents later in the trial. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. After a particularly heated exchange over whether Bolton should testify, Roberts admonished both parties to remember they were addressing the world's greatest deliberative body. ""I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,"" he said. WATCH | Cipollone calls the trial 'a partisan impeachment' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who helped spearhead the House impeachment inquiry, summarized the charges against Trump and said the Republican president had committed a ""trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment."" Schiff said that although the evidence against Trump was ""already overwhelming,"" further witness testimony was necessary to show the full scope of the misconduct of the president and those around him. Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point after opening arguments and senators' questions. But Democrats said they forced repeated votes on evidence and witnesses, which extended late into the night, to get Republicans on the record immediately. Democrats want a number of current and former Trump administration officials, including Bolton, to testify. ""For all of the name-calling and finger-pointing from the president's counsel, we did not hear a single argument on the merits about why there should not be the documents and witnesses we requested in this trial,"" Schumer said. WATCH | Rep. Schiff makes his argument against the proposed rules: Under McConnell's plan, lawyers for Trump could move early in the proceedings to ask senators to dismiss all charges, according to a senior Republican leadership aide, a motion that would likely fall short of the support needed to succeed. Even if such a motion fails, Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the 100-member chamber, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. McConnell has repeatedly said the rules for the trial would mirror those the Senate used in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further witness testimony and evidence. Schumer took great exception to the comparison during a morning news conference. ""The McConnell Rules are not even close to the Clinton Rules,"" said Schumer, pointing to the compressed timeline for presenting the case and the allowance of a dismissal motion at any point during the trial. ""McConnell wants a trial with no existing or new evidence,"" he said. Democrats accuse Trump of pressuring a vulnerable ally to interfere in U.S. elections at the expense of American national security and say he needs to be removed from office because he is a danger to American democracy and national security. Trump and his legal team say there was no pressure and that the Democrats' case is based on hearsay. Cipollone has described the Ukraine investigation as an illegal attempt to remove a democratically elected president and avert his re-election. ""They're not here to steal one election, they're here to steal two elections,"" Cipollone said on Tuesday. Cipollone also repeated a trope that Republicans were excluded from the secure facility where the initial depositions for the House impeachment hearings took place. In fact, Republican members of the House intelligence committee were not only present but questioned witnesses. At the heart of the impeachment trial is Trump's request to Ukraine in July to investigate Joe Biden, a top Democratic contender to face Trump in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter. The younger Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for a period that included over two years while his father was U.S. vice-president. Trump also sought the announcement of a probe based on a discredited theory involving the hacking of Democratic computers ahead of the 2016 election, which have been attributed by the U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate as being the work of Kremlin-connected Russian actors. Democrats charge that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine that had been approved by the Pentagon and Congress, with the money only released as it became public knowledge that a whistleblower had lodged a complaint after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. Last week, a congressional watchdog found the White House broke the law by withholding the security aid. The assessment from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office was seen as a setback for Trump, but it remains unclear whether it will figure in his trial given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered. The obstruction of Congress charge relates to Trump directing administration officials and agencies not to comply with House subpoenas for testimony and documents related to impeachment. Trump has sought to rally his base with the impeachment issue, fundraising off it and at raucous election rallies painting himself as the victim of a witch hunt. Trump is attending the annual gathering of world business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday to project an air of business as usual and tout the strength of the U.S. economy. Asked whether Trump was planning to watch the trial, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, ""He has a full day here in Davos, but will be briefed by staff periodically."" This is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history. No president has ever been removed through impeachment, a mechanism the nation's founders — worried about a monarch on American soil — devised to oust a president for ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" Bill Clinton, like Andrew Johnson in the 19th century, was acquitted in the Senate, while Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before a full House vote on articles of impeachment could occur. With a two-thirds majority needed in the 100-member Senate to remove Trump from office, he is almost certain to be acquitted by fellow Republicans in the chamber. But the impact of the trial on his re-election bid is far from clear. Trump, 73, has gone through a succession of controversies since taking office in January 2017. House Leader Nancy Pelosi had previously resisted pressure from her party's left flank to take the step after special counsel Robert Mueller spelled out instances in which Trump sought to impede the federal inquiry that documented 2016 Russian election interference to boost Trump's candidacy.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-house-vote-analysis-1.5401650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-1.5429169 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/what-will-history-say-about-the-trump-impeachment-1.5400734,N/A
50,Erica Johnson,2019-11-18T16:14:38.413Z,"Bank wires fraudsters over $800K of retiree's savings, despite red flags","A Calgary retiree says he was ""sick to his stomach"" after learning his bank wired more than $800,000 of his savings to fraudsters despite security red flags. Rod McLeod, 75, was a longtime customer with Cidel Bank — one of dozens of private banks in Canada that handle wealth management for people with high incomes or sizeable assets.  ""It has turned my life upside down,"" says McLeod, a retired lawyer. ""I expected them to protect me."" McLeod is suing, alleging ""negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"" by Cidel in a statement of claim filed last week. It's one more case of what's become a multibillion-dollar problem in Canada and the U.S., according to authorities.  Wire fraud is a ""huge problem"" and ""so rampant,"" investigator and former FBI agent Don Vilfer told Go Public, that better laws are needed in Canada and the U.S. to protect bank customers.  ""Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. is behind in terms of requiring financial institutions to take certain steps … [to prevent] this kind of thing,"" Vilfer said.  In September 2018, McLeod was excited to make an offer on a condo in Rancho Mirage, Calif. — just north of Palm Desert. He had Cidel wire a deposit to a California bank account and waited for instructions on the outstanding balance of $619,000 US ($820,000 Cdn). A few weeks later, an email supposedly from the realtor handling the sale, said the balance should go to a different bank — Chase Bank in Denver, Colo. Even though his escrow agent had cautioned him, two months earlier, against any sudden changes, McLeod says the warning was forgotten in the push to seal the deal.  The seller, he'd been told, was a billionaire. ""So it made sense that he banked in several places."" McLeod sent the new instructions to his contact at Cidel. But the email wasn't from his realtor, Brady Sandahl. It was from a new email address, created by fraudsters who had transposed the last two letters of Sandahl's name so that, at first glance, it appeared legit. When that email arrived at Cidel, it appears the bank's mail server flagged it, tacking ""SUSPICIOUS MESSAGE"" onto the subject line.  Despite that warning, a bank employee emailed the fraudster, asking for the address of the bank account owner — adding a senior Cidel employee and McLeod to the email thread. McLeod says his excitement about the condo got the better of him. He didn't notice the email had been flagged, and, he says, had no prior experience wiring money to another country. ""I don't do this every day. This is something that's totally new to me,"" he said.  ""My wife said, 'You wanted it too much, you ignored the red flags.'""  McLeod and his wife authorized the wire transfer. The money went to Denver, where fraudsters quickly transferred most of it to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. Days later, when McLeod made inquiries about next steps, it became apparent he was the victim of fraud. ""I thought, this can't be happening,"" he says. ""It just can't be happening."" Chase Bank was able to keep $26,000 US from being transferred, and that money was returned to McLeod. McLeod hired Vilfer to investigate. Since leaving the FBI over a decade ago, Vilfer has testified in over 100 cases, often providing expert testimony on digital forensics in cases involving wire fraud. ""It's very profitable for the fraudsters when they can pull it off,"" he says. ""We had one client that lost $14 million — and they're [fraudsters] doing this all day long."" In his report to McLeod, Vilfer says the realtor's email account may have been compromised and recommended further analysis of the realtor's devices and accounts.  ""With email hijacking scams of this type, in my experience, it is the realtor or mortgage broker who is targeted,"" he wrote. Sandahl did not respond to calls for comment from Go Public.  The case is an example of what investigators call ""business email compromise"" — a type of wire fraud that targets businesses and their customers. Typically, the fraudster hacks into a business's email account and impersonates the sender, instructing the customer to redirect the money.  Go Public recently investigated this type of scam, and spoke to a Toronto-area businessman who lost almost $3,000.  Compromised business emails — particularly in the real estate sector — led to an estimated loss of $12 billion US over the past five years, according to the FBI. Such scams were reported in 150 countries, and all 50 U.S. states. Vilfer says McLeod's bank — Cidel — should have stopped the scam in its tracks. ""You have the flag on the email that it's a suspicious message,"" says Vilfer. ""And with this kind of fraud that's so prevalent … that should certainly cause some sort of alarm, to take an extra look at this and see why is this being flagged?"" ""Good technology ... apparently was ignored,"" he said.  In the statement of claim against Cidel, McLeod's lawyer, Brett Code, alleges the bank's actions ""represent a marked departure from the required standard of care, and constitute gross negligence."" It seeks full compensation for McLeod's loss.  None of the allegations has been proven in court and Cidel has not yet responded to the statement of claim.  In one of two emails to McLeod, Cidel CEO Craig Rimer wrote: ""We are very sorry that you've had to go through this terrible experience and for the financial loss you endured."" However, he wrote, Cidel has no obligation to reimburse McLeod.  In a second, one-line email, Rimer blamed McLeod for the wire fraud, writing, ""The introduction to the email address came from you and you authorized the transaction after much back and forth between them [fraudsters] and you."" Rimer declined to be interviewed but sent Go Public a statement saying, ""We acted in accordance with the express written and signed wire instructions that were delivered to us by our client.""  He would not outline what policies exist at the bank when it comes to conducting wire transfers, but wrote that Cidel acted in full compliance with all industry standards and that the bank will continue to assist its client in recovering the funds from ""an unscrupulous third party."" There is no legislation in Canada or the U.S. that requires a financial institution to confirm the identity of a bank account holder who is receiving a wire transfer to prevent fraud and protect customers.   It's considered a best practice for banks to confirm they are sending a client's money to an appropriate destination, but Vilfer — the former FBI agent — thinks that needs to become law.  ""We're just relying on the banks doing the right thing,"" he says. ""It would be a good idea for both the United States and Canada to stiffen up the statutory requirements; require policies for protecting against this sort of fraud."" The largest insurer of U.S. banks, ABA Insurance Services, said recently it's ""critical"" that banks start making phone calls to authenticate wire transfers, among other procedures.  McLeod knows his lawsuit against Cidel could drag on for years. ""If I don't win this, I'm throwing good money after bad,"" he says. ""And they can outlast me. I'm 75 years old."" He's also moved his remaining assets to another management company.

51,Mike Crawley,2020-01-23T05:57:36.028Z,"Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals are filled beyond capacity nearly every day, new data reveals","Overcrowding has become so common in Ontario hospitals that patient beds are now placed in hallways and conference rooms not only at times of peak demand, but routinely day after day, research by CBC News reveals.  New data obtained through a freedom of information request show the widespread extent of the province's ""hallway medicine"" problem, something that Premier Doug Ford has promised to end. An exclusive analysis of the data by CBC News shows that hospital gridlock — a phenomenon that used to be restricted to surges in patients during flu season — is the new normal.  Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals were filled beyond 100 per cent occupancy nearly every day in the first half of last year.  Five hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as the main hospital in Hamilton, Sudbury, Peterborough and Niagara Falls all spent more than 160 days over their funded capacity during the 181-day period from January through June 2019. CBC News analyzed data for all 169 acute care hospital sites in the province during this six-month time frame. Some of the key findings:  An expert on hospital administration calls the figures ""astonishing"" and says they demonstrate that overcrowding is now a widespread phenomenon around Ontario. ""These are really big numbers,"" said Donald Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at University of Toronto. He said the data show the hallway medicine problem is neither occasional nor restricted to a few hospitals. Redelmeier said such chronic overcapacity makes the hospital experience extremely dissatisfying for patients, it means non-emergency surgeries get postponed, and it means when there's a surge of new patients, there's nowhere to relieve the congestion.  ""You ought not to be striving for 100 per cent capacity because it doesn't leave you any reserve for when things get tough,"" said Redelmeier, who is also an internal medicine specialist at Sunnybrook Hospital.   ""We've got warning signs going off all over the province and the situation just isn't viable,"" said Anthony Dale, chief executive of the Ontario Hospital Association.  WATCH: Overcrowding affects patients from the moment they enter ER ""All across the province you have hospitals at extremely high levels of occupancy,"" said Dale in an interview with CBC News. ""What we're seeing is that it's no longer just during the flu season but it's all year round."" The chronic nature of the overcrowding ""is simply not sustainable, not for patients, not for people who work in hospitals,"" Dale said  The acute care hospital site that was the most frequently filled beyond capacity was Mackenzie Health's 333-bed Richmond Hill Hospital. Its acute care wards were overcapacity on all but two days in this six-month period.    A tour of its emergency room in the early afternoon of a recent weekday — typically a time of lower ER volumes as compared to evenings and weekends — revealed around a dozen patients on stretchers in the corridors or placed alongside the nursing station desk. The situation has become so entrenched that signs are posted assigning hallway spots an official bed number. ""For our staff who work in this environment, they would describe it as constantly working under crisis,"" said Mary-Agnes Wilson, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Mackenzie Health, which runs Richmond Hill Hospital.  Richmond Hill provides an example of how the ripple effect of overcapacity in acute care wards is felt in the emergency department. Even after being admitted, a patient typically spends hours stuck in the ER waiting for a ward bed to open up. Over the past year, the average patient admitted to an Ontario hospital spent more than 16 hours in the ER before getting a ward bed, according to provincial data.   At the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, the average admitted patient waited 46 hours in the ER before getting a bed on a ward in November, the most recent month for which statistics are available. Although the occupancy data analyzed by CBC News comes from the first half of 2019, there's little if any indication the situation has improved since then. Niagara Health says the overcapacity problem across its three acute care hospital sites did not improve in the second half of 2019, averaging 104 per cent during both six-month periods last year.  At Southlake Regional Health Centre, a 500-bed facility in Newmarket, occupancy averaged 110 per cent in the first six months of 2019, according to the data. In the second half of the year, occupancy averaged 113 per cent, says the hospital's CEO, Arden Krystal.  Hospitals' chief method of coping with the demand is to place beds in makeshift locations, now officially enshrined as ""unconventional spaces"" in the Ontario health care bureaucracy. At Richmond Hill, a former meeting room now houses 10 patients separated by cubicle dividers. At Southlake Regional Health Centre, overflow spaces include former exercise rooms and a kitchenette.  ""We try to fill every nook and cranny because the risk of having 40 or 50 admitted patients standing in our emergency department is even greater than filling those spaces,"" said Krystal. ""When emergency gets backed up, they start to get worried that they can't assess people quickly enough to make sure that they can stay safe.""  Figures provided by the Ministry of Health suggest a five to six per cent drop in the use of unconventional spaces province-wide over the past year.   ""It was increasing steadily year over year but we have managed to halt that,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott.  That still means nearly 1,000 Ontario patients are being housed in hallways, lunch rooms and auditoriums every day. Elliott admitted it will take ""several years"" to achieve Ford's promise of ending hallway health care.   ""This isn't a problem that grew up overnight, it has been building up over a number of years,"" Elliott said in an interview Tuesday. ""There's no simple solution to change it, there's a lot of action that needs to be taken and we are doing that.""  The number of acute care hospital beds in Ontario has stayed effectively the same for 20 years, at around 20,000 while the province's population has grown by three million people. Ontario now has fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than any other province: 1.4 beds for every 1,000 people. That's on par with Mexico, and half the number in the U.S. WATCH | Anthony Dale of the Ontario Hospital Association says hospital overcrowding is putting a strain on health-care providers But shortages of care available outside the hospital system are also crucial factors in the overcrowding. On any day, one out of six hospital beds is occupied by a patient who doesn't need to be in hospital, but cannot be safely discharged home. This is a long-running phenomenon in health systems across Canada known as ""alternate level of care"" (ALC). Lengthy waits for long-term care spaces are the chief cause, but a lack of available home care and other forms of continuing care also contributes.  While the number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals hovered between 3,500 and 4,000 for the first half of the 2010s, it grew over the past five years, exceeding 5,300 in September 2019, according to figures from the Ontario Hospital Association.  This means creating new hospital beds is not necessarily a better solution than freeing up the beds occupied by patients who ought to be elsewhere.  Ford became premier in June 2018, and his Progressive Conservative government by no means created the hallway medicine trend. The previous Liberal government froze hospitals' annual base funding for four years running.  Nor is hospital overcrowding restricted to Ontario. Recent reports of overflowing patients come from Montreal, Saskatoon,  Moncton, N.B. and Kentville, N.S. Some of the most obvious solutions to the problem won't happen quickly or without a major outlay of public money. One  top priority is expanding the number of long-term care facilities to meet the demands of a senior population that is growing in number and in the complexity of its needs. The Ford government is embarking on a long-term reform of the health system that includes reorganizing how funding is provided. The aim is to shift those hospital patients who don't need to be there into care elsewhere.  The reform is centred on teams that bring together hospitals, home-care agencies and long-term care facilities in geographic areas. Each team will receive a combined pot of funding to provide the range of health services its population needs.   Hospitals are taking their own steps to try to reduce patient demand. For people with chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, Niagara Health has focused on developing programs to support the patients at home after discharge. ""This has already shown great reductions in emergency department visits, hospital readmissions and days spent in hospital,"" said Derek McNally, Niagara Health's executive vice-president of clinical services and chief nursing executive. ""We know that there's a lot more work that we need to do,"" said Elliott. ""It's like taking an ocean liner and turning it around. it doesn't happen on a dime.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-hallway-medicine-healthcare-over-capacity-1.5434572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/hallway-medicine-unfortunate-reality-for-guelph-general-hospital-1.5435015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/across-sw-ontario-small-hospitals-struggle-with-overcapacity-1.5434670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-civic-etobicoke-general-hallway-health-care-1.5339511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hospital-health-sciences-north-overcrowding-1.5139909 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ontario-health-care-1.4912674 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-doug-ford-health-care-rueben-devlin-1.4997601,N/A
52,"Virginia Smart, Lisa Ellenwood",2019-11-24T09:00:00.590Z,"Pain, agony and 'years of duress': How hockey wives are fighting back over players' chronic brain injuries","Jennifer Belak Liang remembers her car phone ringing as she was picking up her daughters Alex and Andie from school one day in August 2011. It was the agent for her husband, hockey player Wade Belak. On speaker phone, the agent asked her if she had spoken to her husband that day.  She hadn't. It was the second phone call she received asking that question and it filled her with dread.  ""Wade is really hurt,"" the agent said. ""It was awful. I was called by multiple friends … they knew before I knew. But they didn't know what to say,"" Belak Liang said of the day she lost her husband to suicide. Belak's suicide was the third death in a cluster of tragic and sudden deaths of NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard, 28, and Rick Rypien, 27. All had been tasked with fighting on ice and all suffered multiple hits to the head. There have been other deaths of players since, including Steve Montador and Todd Ewen. Now, the wives of some of the retired hockey enforcers are in their own fight, taking on the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman. They want the league to acknowledge there's a link between fights and head injuries on the ice and long-term effects like degenerative brain disease. They also want more support for families struggling with symptoms of traumatic brain injury.  ""My husband had CTE. He was showing signs of CTE. He took his own life,"" said Belak Liang. ""It's going to be many more...  It's [an] injustice to everyone else out there, I think, for them not to admit that this can happen.""  Wade Belak had recently retired from his 14-year career with the National Hockey League and was in Toronto in the summer of 2011 rehearsing for the show Battle of the Blades — the CBC reality show that pairs hockey players with figure skaters. At approximately 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, he ended his life. After the loss of her husband, Jennifer Belak Liang struggled with feelings of isolation and guilt.  ""I was drowning, blaming myself,"" she said in an interview with The Fifth Estate. At the time, she knew little of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease. Her husband had asked that in the event of his death, his brain be tested for the disease. She fulfilled his wish, and he was diagnosed with CTE. Since the loss of her husband, Belak Liang, who has since remarried, tries to offer support to others facing tragic loss of loved ones. As an NHL enforcer who played 14 seasons in the NHL, Belak ""knew his role,"" said Belak Liang. ""He didn't love it, but he was fine with it [because] he wanted to stay within the NHL and have his career.  ""He told me: 'I can't stay here unless I fight.' "" Watch Jennifer Belak Liang remember her husband: While many hockey players can make millions during their career, brain trauma and concussions can take a toll, especially for those who played the role of an enforcer — a role now being phased out. It  was during her husband's last years with the Nashville Predators that Belak Liang noticed a shift in his behaviour.   ""It started about five years before he passed. He just got really introverted, really quiet at home. When the kids were screeching or making noises, I could see him not able to handle it, which was not like him."" About eight months before he died, Belak noticed a decline in her husband's memory. He'd use his phone to help remember daily tasks, including taking pictures of groceries he had to buy.   Many experts say concussions can often lead to a cycle of substance abuse, depression, memory loss, even suicide.  Daniel Carcillo, 35, from King City, Ont., has won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Blackhawks, and was known as Car Bomb for his reckless fighting style on ice. He now battles depression and suicidal thoughts.  Carcillo said his wife, Ela Bulawa, has been burdened. ""But I think that's what marriage and loving somebody is all about, right? Through sickness and in health.""  While he was in his final NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015, Carcillo suffered great personal loss: the passing of his grandfather, as well as his best friend and teammate, Steve Montador, who was found to have CTE. Carcillo, who had seven concussions during his NHL career, wonders if he could become another statistic. ""Wade had CTE. Are these reaffirmations that I'm going to have CTE?... ""There's a pretty good chance."" Once retired, players can often feel abandoned and without support. Carcillo said he has felt that way. But he's taken steps to heal: functional neurology therapy, acupuncture, proper nutrition and diet. He speaks publicly, often on social media, about traumatic brain injury and the impact it can have.   ""I'm very, very proud of Daniel, from where he has been, and where he is now,"" Bulawa said. They have started a foundation called Chapter 5, which aims to provide support to retired players and their families, especially players who are suffering post-concussion syndrome, anxiety and depression. ""They put their whole lives into playing hockey and being the best of the best. And once it's over, then what?"" said Bulawa. ""It shouldn't just be,'Oh, that's it, sorry guys. See ya later.' ""   Carcillo and Bulawa have learned to recognize signs of his depression returning, for example sleeping in, impulse control issues, loss of appetite and withdrawal from friends and family. Todd Ewen played hockey in the era when even after getting rocked on the ice, players were sent back out again. Both he and his wife, Kelli, believed he experienced head trauma because he had symptoms: blurry vision, headaches and sleeplessness. After playing 11 seasons in the NHL, Todd Ewen retired in 1997. He became a real estate agent, was a musician, patented several inventions and coached the St. Louis University Billikens. But Ewen was struggling. He became aggressive with Kelli. Depression, memory loss and confusion plagued him. By 2013, he gave up coaching because he couldn't remember plays and was missing practices.   ""We didn't know who we had. One day we had the sad Todd, the mad Todd, the angry Todd. We had no idea what was going on. This man suffered for years like this, our family suffered for years like this,"" his wife said. They wondered if he could have Alzeimher's or Parkinson's disease, but with the loss of Rypien, Boogaard and Belak in 2011, Ewen began to wonder if he could have CTE.  He told Kelli one day that he didn't want to be a burden. At the time, she did not realize the weight of his words. On Sept. 19, 2015, Kelli Ewen found her husband in the basement of their home near St. Louis. He was 49 when he killed himself. The Ewen family was contacted by the Canadian Concussion Centre in Toronto asking to study Todd's brain.   ""I knew something was wrong. And I thought maybe this is the answer. I read the articles about [CTE]. I could just check off the boxes, just one after another. And I thought this has to be it.""  But neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati at the centre told Kelli her husband did not have CTE. She was devastated and desperate for an explanation and said she asked the doctor to retest his brain, but Hazrati declined.  In 2018, a class action lawsuit between more than 300 retired players and the NHL was settled. Players had accused the league of failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. Ewen's negative CTE results were used as an example in the lawsuit of how media hype could lead a person to kill themselves because of fear of having CTE. Bettman wrote: ""This, sadly, is precisely the type of tragedy that can result when plaintiffs' lawyers and their media consultants jump ahead of the medical community and assert, without reliable scientific support, that there is a causal link between concussions and CTE.""  Kelli Ewen said she was was extremely hurt, and believed they were using her husband for the benefit of the lawsuit.   The NHL announced an $18.9-million US settlement — $22,000 US per player and medical expense coverage up to $75,000 per person. However, there was no acknowledgement of liability for the players' assertions.  Carcillo refused to participate in the settlement.  Kelli Ewen couldn't live with the results from the Canadian Concussion Centre. She arranged to have samples of her husband's brain sent to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist and director of Boston University's CTE Center. Her research, much of which has involved professional athletes, focuses on the long-term effects of all kinds of brain injury, which can include CTE. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy.  While there is no known treatment, the hope is research from Boston University's brain bank will one day allow the detection of the disease in life, ""while there's still a chance to do something about it,"" McKee said. In late 2018, McKee revealed her own conclusions to Kelli Ewen, stating her instincts were correct: her husband did, in fact, have CTE.  ""[Gary Bettman] still stands by the [original] findings, which I find mind-boggling,"" Kelli Ewen said. Kelli Ewen filed a lawsuit against the NHL on April 30, 2019, challenging the league's dismissal of  a link between hits to the head during hockey games and CTE . She wants to bring awareness to concussions and CTE and the suffering families go through when they don't understand the symptoms they're seeing with their husbands.   ""It's not about money, you know? It's about the pain, the agony, the years of duress,"" she said.   ""I feel like it's the NHL's responsibility to stand up and take care of these players that this great game of hockey was built on; these fighters that gave, essentially, their lives for the NHL. And it's time for them to step up and admit and help them get the help they need."" Watch Kelli Ewen talk about her lawsuit: The day after Kelli Ewen's lawsuit was filed, Bettman appeared before a Commons subcommittee in Ottawa regarding sports-related concussions and safety.   Bettman questioned any direct link between multiple hockey concussions and CTE, saying ""in short, I don't believe based on everything I've been told — and if anybody has information to the contrary, we'd be happy to hear it — other than some anecdotal evidence, there has not been that conclusive link."" ""Our players like the way the NHL game is played and understand the implications of playing a physical contact sport at the highest professional level in the world,"" he said.  ""At the end of the day we view ourselves as a family, and our resources are available to the members of our family."" Jennifer Belak Liang, Kelli Ewen and the Carcillo family would disagree.  ""It's crazy to me that they won't admit anything. It's sad,"" Belak Liang said.   ""At least admit it's real,"" said Ewen. ""That would go a long way with a lot of the families."" The Fifth Estate requested an interview with Bettman to address the wives' concerns, but the only response was: ""Thank you for your inquiry. We will not be participating.""   At a sports conference in Toronto last week, The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeown approached Bettman. All he would say was: ""How are you? Nice to see you. I gotta go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hockey-players-enforcers-brain-injuries-1.5370444,[],N/A

Next year's operating budget for the facilities was presented Wednesday, but did not include the $230,000 needed to provide the products and install dispensing equipment. ""Staff have missed the boat on this, these are essential,"" said Coun. Tony Mancini. ""It's 2020 right? Let's remind everybody what year it is."" Councillors were particularly upset that money for the menstrual products wasn't included in the proposed budget, but the increase for three new employees in corporate communications was covered. ""This has ended up as an item that we have to struggle and plead and mount a case for,"" said Coun. Lisa Blackburn. ""I just don't think it sends a good message."" Blackburn pointed out that menstrual products are being provided at all 14 branches of the municipality's library service without a significant impact on its finances. ""It should have been baked into the budget,"" said Blackburn. Finance officials said a staff report on where the funding will come from has not made it to the audit and finance committee, so the item could not be included. The annual ongoing costs for menstrual products would be $220,000. Coun. Shawn Cleary had another solution. He asked for a report on cutting $267,000 — the cost of the staff increases. Cleary pointed out Halifax already has 22 people in corporate communications. ""That's a lot for a city our size,"" said Cleary. The municipality's director of corporate and customer services, Jerry Blackwood, said communication officers do not just deal with the media, but help with special projects and emergency situations.

54,Adam Miller,2020-01-22T10:50:27.511Z,Key things to watch for in the coronavirus outbreak,"As the China coronavirus outbreak continues, key questions remain about the nature of the virus and how quickly and easily it can spread between people.  Here's a look at some of the potentially serious turns the outbreak could take. Human-to-human transmission is the spread of an illness from an infected patient to a non-infected person. There are two types of this transmission: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission infection occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission. Infections among health-care workers strengthen the evidence for this,"" the WHO in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" WHO officials will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to discuss what recommendations should be made to manage it. ""The key issues here are what is the extent of human-to-human transmission and how easy is human-to-human transmission?"" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.  ""That's going to be a factor into how widespread this ultimately gets.""   Health officials will also be watching closely to see if the virus changes as the outbreak continues, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.  ""Viruses evolve and mutate, and they may start to take on new attributes and characteristics that either make them more easily transmissible or make them more deadly,"" he said.  ""The reality is that the longer that it's out there, the more it will evolve.""  Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said if the coronavirus mutates into something more contagious, that would be a ""significant concern"" similar to the way in which SARS evolved. McGeer said the initial clusters of patients infected with SARS in early 2003 were associated with open-air markets in China, much like in the current coronavirus outbreak, with limited transmission from person to person.  ""Then over the next couple of months, the virus evolved into a virus that was more transmissible person to person, but more transmissible person to person when people were seriously ill,"" she said.  ""If that process is repeating itself, and the virus is changing, then we may be moving from one problem to a completely different problem. So far that's not what it's looked like, but I don't think you can be sure about it."" McGeer added there haven't been many reports of transmission to health-care workers, aside from the reported 15 cases of medical staff in Wuhan, which she said concerns her about the potential for the virus to change.  ""They must have followed up with health-care workers after the initial cases in December, they didn't see transmission and now they've found transmission,"" she said.  ""It does raise the concern that this is a virus that is changing and if it's a virus that's changing then that's a whole new set of issues. There's nothing we can do except wait to know what's going to happen."" Another concern is the possibility of a ""super-spreader,"" a highly infectious patient who can spread the illness to many people at a disproportionate rate to other carriers.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said super-spreader events were ""pivotal"" in the spread of SARS worldwide in 2003.They defined super-spreading as transmission to at least eight people.  One super-spreading event was identified early in the epidemic in Beijing, where a patient with an onset of SARS two months after hospital admission was the source of transmission to 76 patients, including 12 health-care workers and several hospital visitors.  Prof. Gabriel M. Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said Tuesday the ""critical issue"" in controlling a coronavirus epidemic is to make sure that super-spreading events are controlled quickly.  ""It is absolutely critical that public health authorities recognize a super-spreading event in the very earliest stages,"" he said during a media availability. ""Before it goes absolutely explosive.""  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said the possibility of a super-spreader is top of mind for health officials worldwide.  ""There is also the possibility of super-spreading events. The global community is very familiar [with] what has happened with SARS in the past and this is something that is on our radar,"" she said during a press conference Tuesday. ""That is possible, and what we need to prepare ourselves for."" Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot that uses data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world, said outbreaks are like fires, and infected individuals are like embers.  ""They may land in one location where they happen to just trigger a big outbreak, and it may have to do with a super-spreading event,"" he said.  ""A super-spreading event does not mean that it is limited to the epicentre in Wuhan; it could catalyze multiple new epicentres.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A

The new estimate, which was reported earlier on Tuesday by CNBC, is based on a number of factors, including new anticipated pilot training requirements. Reuters reported last week that regulators had been pushing back the time needed to approve the plane. Boeing's best-selling plane has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes killed 346 people in five months. Boeing shares fell 5.5 per cent and were halted for pending news. Boeing is expected to disclose details of the estimate later on Tuesday. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing did not immediately comment. Reuters reported on Monday that Boeing is in talks with banks about borrowing $10 billion US or more amid rising costs after the two crashes involving the 737 Max. Boeing confirmed on Monday that it temporary halted production of the 737 Max in Washington state in recent days. The company had said in December it would halt production at some point this month. Boeing has estimated the costs of the 737 Max grounding at more than $9 billion to date, and is expected to disclose significant additional costs during its fourth-quarter earnings release on Jan. 29.

57,Dan Ralph,2020-01-22T17:39:01.001Z,CFL to stage league's 1st regular-season game in Halifax,"The CFL is returning to Halifax. A CFL source says the league will announce Thursday it will stage a regular-season game between the Toronto Argonauts and Saskatchewan Roughriders in the Nova Scotia capital. The contest, with the Argos as the home team, will be played July 25 at Huskies Stadium at Saint Mary's University. The source was granted anonymity because the league has not publicly announced the site of the game. It will be the first regular-season game played at Saint Mary's. The CFL held an exhibition contest there in 2005. The previous four Touchdown Atlantic games were held in Moncton, N.B. Last year, the Montreal Alouettes defeated Toronto 28-22 before 10,126 spectators at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium. That stadium's seating capacity can be expanded to 20,725, but there was no expansion for last year's contest. Schooners Sports and Entertainment (SSE), a group trying to secure a CFL expansion franchise for Halifax, will again sponsor the game. It did so last year as well. Last month, Halifax Regional Municipality voted in favour of providing a one-time $20-million contribution to a proposed CFL-friendly stadium so long as it was located at a site other than Shannon Park. SSE had settled on a six- to eight-hectare site at Shannon Park, a surplus military site in north-end Dartmouth, for $110-million stadium. But a report suggested Shannon Park lacks transportation options to get spectators to and from the venue and the site would need millions of dollars in infrastructure investment. CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie has remained bullish on Halifax becoming the league's 10th franchise, but has stated repeatedly it's contingent on a suitable stadium being built in the largest city in Atlantic Canada. This year's Touchdown Atlantic will feature two teams which finished at opposite ends of the spectrum last season. Saskatchewan, under first-year head coach Craig Dickenson, finished atop the West Division with a 13-5 record. Quarterback Cody Fajardo was a finalist for the CFL's outstanding player award after finishing as the league's passing leader (4,302 yards). Saskatchewan's season, though, ended with a 20-13 home loss to the eventual Grey Cup-champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the conference final. Toronto, meanwhile, missed the CFL playoffs for a second straight year. The Argos finished third in the East Division standings with a 4-14 record, with three of those wins coming against the league-worst Ottawa Redblacks. Toronto has a new head coach in Ryan Dinwiddie, a former quarterbacks coach with the Calgary Stampeders. Toronto fired previous head coach Corey Chamblin after just one season in the job. Toronto will give up a home game at BMO Field this season to participate in this contest. This will be the fourth Touchdown Atlantic appearance for the Argos, who played in the inaugural contest — a 16-16 exhibition tie with Hamilton in 2005. Toronto had the CFL's worst attendance last year, averaging 10,652 spectators in six home games — another home game was the Touchdown Atlantic game in Moncton while the club didn't provide attendance figures for two others dates at BMO Field. Saskatchewan was one of the CFL's top draws. The Riders averaged more than 30,000 spectators at Mosaic Stadium and twice attracted more than 33,000 fans to their games. Saskatchewan also drew 33,300 for the West Division final, which Winnipeg won 20-13.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-to-stage-league-s-1st-regular-season-game-in-halifax-1.5436219,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/atlantic-schooners-cfl-franchise-halifax-hfx-wanderers-fc-1.5262867 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grey-cup-rescued-kenora-hotel-fire-1.5432185,N/A

The dpa news agency reported Monday that prosecutors have asked Berlin's region court to sentence two of the men to seven years in prison and the two others to six and five years each. A verdict is expected next month. Prosecutors claim the men, aged 21 to 25, stole the ""Big Maple Leaf"" coin worth about €3.75 million euros (about $5.44 million) from Berlin's Bode Museum in March 2017. German media have reported that three of the accused, 24-year-old Wayci Remmo, 20-year-old Ahmed Remmo and 22-year-old Wissam Remmo, have links to organized crime. The fourth suspect, identified only as 20-year-old Dennis W., worked as a security guard at the museum, which is located in the heart of the German capital. The defendants have remained silent throughout the trial. Their lawyers have denied the accusations against their clients.

61,Heidi Atter,2020-01-22T16:24:13.326Z,City of Regina report says building permits take as much as 8 times longer than in Saskatoon,"A new report by Regina administration looks at how the city can improve its building permit process, which can take as much as eight times longer than Saskatoon's on average. The city hired an external consultant to review the situation in July 2019.  The resulting report is set to be considered by Regina's priorities and planning committee Wednesday. ""The Building Permits process has, for many years, received numerous complaints,"" says the introduction to the report in the committee agenda. The report compares the time to obtain permits in Regina to some other major prairie cities.  Regina averages 43 days to approve a residential permit. Saskatoon averages five days to approve a similar permits, while Winnipeg averages 11 days and Calgary averages 21. Commercial permits take an average of 65 days to get approved in Regina. This compares to averages of 25 to 50 days In Saskatoon, one to 29 days in Winnipeg and 49 to 56 days in Calgary. The report said the city's permit and inspection service has public safety, public confidence and economic competitiveness as objectives. ""If the City fails to diligently conduct plan review, permit issuance and construction inspections, the City may face legal liability for resulting financial losses, personal injuries or death,"" the report says. It says the service should focus on clarity, consistency, efficiency and predictability. The report points to issues including staffing levels, cost recovery and the amount of days it takes to process permits as current issues. Regina's permit service has about eight employees. By contrast, Saskatoon has 17 and Calgary has 36. The report recommends a workforce development plan to bring in qualified building officials and keep them for years.  The service was originally supposed to recover all costs through permit fees. Instead, a 2018 study found this isn't the case. To be able to recover all costs, a 14 per cent fee increase would have to be put in place immediately.  The report says the city should not increase fees right now and should focus on building confidence in the industry first.  The report also recommends:  The city conducted a survey as part of the review. The majority of participants said they worked in the industry.  Eighty-seven per cent said said the building permits and inspection process is not efficient. Ninety per cent said the speed of service does not meet their needs. Seventy-four per cent of people said they didn't communicate with the city in a way that works for them and 75 per cent said the City does not keep them informed about the status of their application.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/report-building-permit-process-regina-1.5435873,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/city-of-regina-building-permits-1.5198884,N/A
62,John Peters,2020-01-12T12:00:00.257Z,Mental health advocate wants you to know how to survive suicidal sadness,"Please believe me, I know how it feels to want it all to stop. It wasn't that I even wanted to die. I didn't. I was just so exhausted from feeling the way I was feeling.  And while those moments — when dying feels like your only option — are scary, you feel so frustrated that it makes it so tempting.  But here's what I need you to know! When you hear someone has died by suicide, it's heart-wrenching, it makes you feel sick to your stomach, it brings on a sudden intense feeling of ache in your soul — and always leaves you asking ""Why?""  Too many of us know the sting that suicide brings. Too many of us are scared to talk about suicide, and too many of us perpetuate stigma around suicide.  I don't have every answer. Nor can I speak to every case.  But three things, in my experience, I know are certain. John Peters offers a personal message to anyone in crisis: I've often seen individuals who have been hesitant to talk about suicide, because they believe talking about it causes it to happen more frequently.  But I believe that if you're in pain, then you must talk about it. We need to have more conversations about suicide and life promotion with our families, children and friends, in our workspaces and communities. Through storytelling and education, we can abolish the stigma around suicide and be more compassionate. There is power, growth and a healing impact when we speak the truth.  Ignorance causes us to belittle, gaslight and silence those who are battling this enormous fight.  There is a persistent behaviour of calling people ""too sensitive"" — which is a way to avoid being held accountable and to continue with abusive behaviour.  It can be seen everywhere, when you hear ""it's just a joke"" or ""don't take it so seriously.""  We must remember — we don't know what an individual is experiencing and what a person's thresholds are. Humour that involves someone's identity, religion, sexual orientation, mental health or appearance could be detrimental.  We as a community need to acknowledge the truth: there are many of us who fight silent battles and we urgently need to cultivate safe, shame-free spaces and communities, where an individual feels safe enough to reach out when in crisis.  We as community members are all accountable to our neighbours. Every human being's life is precious.  Today, there is no excuse for saying ""I don't know."" With the amount of information on the internet, public health, and local mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, we can take steps every day to ensure that we are informed and equipped with the right information and tools.  Which brings us to … It is a privilege to have access to resources and efficient care.  Sadly, here in Canada, prejudice and neglect are two major barriers in the system.  Due to the genocidal foundation of our country, colonial systems and policies, a large number of Canadians do not have access to care.  I speak to this as a front-line worker. In my area, for example, we have fewer than 1,500 people, and the number of people who have to tirelessly fight to access care is appalling.  Now, think about that in a lens looking at the entire country.  If any Canadian suffers, if any Canadian dies by suicide, we fail, Canada fails — and continues to fail. Commission your community's leadership and local governments to bring in resources, and do not be gentle or quiet about it. BE LOUD AND ADAMANT! Community is incredible and when we are connected, we can move the earth. Conduct workshops facilitated by health professionals about suicide prevention, so the community can gain knowledge. Provide mental health therapists and programs to respond to our community members who reach out when they are in crisis. This will help us support and care for them in a good way.  Provide spaces where people can pray together, and provide creative outlets for people to nourish their gifts and talents. Each individual has a unique expression form and when it's nourished, it is powerful and healing.  You can also start prevention and life promotion initiatives in your own community to raise awareness. Really, the list could go on and on, because everyone is responsible for actively contributing to the prevention of suicide. There are lives at stake!  Many people, such as your friends, family, even you, may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.  I need you to know, if that's you right now, wherever you are — listen to me: You are loved, you are not a bad person, you are not a bad parent, you are not a bad kid, you are not a screw-up, and you are not worthless. You are beautiful, you are talented, you are gifted, you have purpose, and we need you to stay with us.  If you are struggling today, please reach out to a loved one.  You can also call the Canada Suicide Prevention Service at 1-833-456-4566, Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868, First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness Help Line at 1-855-242-3310 or you can visit thelifelinecanada.ca for more information on other crisis help lines.  Also, for young readers, please check out WeMatter campaign on Facebook, Instagram and wemattercampaign.org.  Remember: The world is beautiful with you in it!

63,Liz James,2019-12-23T12:00:00.423Z,Giving up store-bought gifts reconnected my family to the true spirit of Christmas,"Ten years ago, I threw up my hands in despair at the whole Christmas ""thing."" I'd spent a particularly stressful season buying, wrapping and bookkeeping. I realized that I'd lost touch with the holiday I loved so much.  There was a time when I eagerly bounded out of bed on Nov. 1 to see if the stores had put up decorations yet. I belted out Christmas music all season. Now the sight of a twinkling tree just made me feel tired.  I realized my kids were still of that tender age where I hadn't yet defined how Christmas ""should"" be. I had a unique opportunity. I explained, a la Whoville, that Christmas doesn't come from a store. I quickly learned that ""handmade Christmas"" could be even more exhausting than ""bought Christmas."" After the first year I learned to streamline. Each person picked a type of gift  and made a ton of them. You get what you get.  I learned to have a strong idea of the season I loved and wanted — beautiful decorations, nice smells in the kitchen, tons of time with my family — and to keep adjusting until I got there. My kids bought into the idea with remarkable enthusiasm. The toddler declared excitedly ""I get to BE Santa"" (in our household, we treat Santa as a metaphor more than a literal truth). Both boys spent all of November and December rescuing egg cartons from the trash, colouring them with markers and wrapping them to go under the tree. On Dec. 24, we went around to friends and neighbours who were delighted to receive partially wrapped bits of trash from exuberant three- and five-year-olds wearing Santa hats. It was all the cuteness of regular Christmas, with far less guilt for getting rid of everything the minute the season has passed. A couple of years in, I found a five-year-old sitting beside the tree surrounded by piles of gifts. He declared, ""Mom, I have more presents than ANYBODY,""  Looking at the piles he'd sorted, I saw that he meant he'd made more presents than anybody.  I was sold. I figured it would end when they went to school, but it didn't. They'd return each January to join in the chorus of ""what'd you get?"" with their heartfelt speeches about creating the Christmas that matters to you. I thought this would get them ostracized for sure, but it gave them a kind of celebrity. The boys' sense of fairness was helped by the fact that we do presents at other times of the year. I'd see something perfect for them in a store in May and bring it home as a spontaneous gift, especially when travel was imminent. I once overheard one of the boys saying ""we don't do bought Christmas, we do airplane Presents."" Last year, it changed. My 13-year-old asked if we could have a bought Christmas, so that he could find out what ""normal Christmas"" was like. His dad and I had a decision to make. Was handmade Christmas really about no-buying, or was it about intentionality?   We agreed to give bought Christmas a try. By mid-morning on Dec. 25, it appeared we'd never go back. The 13-year-old stood in piles of crumpled paper and declared, ""What have I been missing?"" To my surprise, this year he asked if we could go ""50-50"" between the two.  He told me that bought Christmas was ""fun, but obviously not for every year,"" and that it ""lacked a personal touch.""  His older brother would have skipped bought Christmas completely, because he thought it was ""exhausting"" and that ""making a gift means you're giving someone a part of you."" I have no idea what Christmas will look like for my boys when they're adults.  Or even next year. What I hope is that it will be a conscious choice. I also hope that if — or when — they feel like they've lost the season they love, they'll have the tools they need to find it again.

65,Erica Johnson,2019-06-10T20:42:18.198Z,Sunday school teacher says she was strip-searched at Vancouver airport after angry guard failed to find drugs,"A former Sunday school teacher who was falsely accused of being a drug smuggler, detained at Vancouver International Airport and eventually strip searched says she is still traumatized by the treatment and is calling for greater oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency. Jill Knapp's run-in with CBSA agents took place on Jan. 9, 2016, on her way home to Calgary, after visiting her husband in Mexico City. The 39-year-old says she is only now speaking out about her experience because she was diagnosed with anxiety after her airport ordeal. ""It was traumatizing,"" Knapp told Go Public, explaining that no one told her why she was red-flagged as she attempted to make her connecting flight in Vancouver. She said she has no criminal record and had nothing in her luggage that would prompt a closer look. ""Within two minutes he called me a drug smuggler, mentioned a strip search, and even said that he was going to send me to the hospital for an X-ray [to look for drugs],"" says Knapp. ""And that was before he even asked me any questions."" A request under the Access to Information Act by the CBC reveals other airline travellers have officially complained about mistreatment by border agents including screaming, using foul language, belittling them, using racial profiling and physical force. A civil liberties advocate says the complaints point to the need for independent oversight of the CBSA, the only major law enforcement agency in Canada that doesn't have external review of employee conduct. ""When border agents operate — either at land crossings, at airports — there is very little oversight,"" says Tim McSorley, national co-ordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, based in Ottawa. Knapp says she had collected her luggage when she was pulled aside and directed to ""secondary inspection,"" where she says a border guard became instantly aggressive. ""Out of nowhere, he actually raised his voice at me and said, 'I think you're a drug smuggler,'"" says Knapp. ""He said, 'I deal with people like you every day.'"" Knapp says she told him she had been visiting her husband in Mexico and that she had applied for him to live in Canada, but says the agent didn't believe her. She says the agent also didn't believe her when he asked what her job was and Knapp told him she worked with law firms as a software instructor. ""He actually scoffed at me and said, 'You don't do that type of work.' How would he know what kind of work I did? He was getting angrier and angrier."" The agent confiscated her phone and demanded her password. Finding nothing incriminating on her phone or in her luggage, the agent called in a drug-sniffing dog, which also didn't detect anything. Knapp says she was eventually placed in detention, but says she wasn't told why. She requested to speak with a lawyer and was told staff placed a call on her behalf, but she never heard from anyone. She hadn't eaten for 14 hours, but was only offered half a glass of water and no food. She says CBSA staff denied her requests to use the bathroom. Knapp was growing increasingly concerned about her parents, who were picking her up in Calgary. Her father is a heart attack survivor, and she worried about causing him stress. In desperation, she says, she offered to have the strip search the agent had mentioned hours earlier. ""At that point, I was so scared of what they would do if I stayed, it was like … if this is what it takes for me to leave, I'm going to do it.'"" Knapp says two female officers entered the room and told her to strip from the waist up. She told them she was a Sunday School teacher before complying. Finding nothing, they ordered her to remove her clothing from the waist down. ""They actually made me turn around, open up my butt cheeks and squat,"" says Knapp. ""I was just in shock. I didn't quite understand what it involved."" Knapp was finally released, and her phone returned. She found half a dozen texts from her anxious husband wondering where she was. CBC requested an interview with the CBSA, but the agency declined. In a statement, it said it couldn't discuss Knapp's case due to privacy concerns. After Knapp filed a complaint, she obtained internal documents through the Privacy Act, in which CBSA spokesperson Isabel McCusker wrote: ""The review of Ms. Knapp's clearance established that the [border services officers] involved in her examination followed standard procedures and guidelines."" CBC received over 1,700 pages of documents, most of the material heavily censored, after submitting a request under the Access to Information Act to find out how many other travellers have filed complaints about their treatment at the hands of the CBSA. We asked for complaints the agency classified under ""Officer/employee conduct,"" ""Questioning"" and other categories, for Vancouver International Airport, Toronto's Pearson International Airport and Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. The documents contain more than 800 allegations investigated by the CBSA about border agents and inappropriate behaviour, including the following: ""Officer commented, 'People like you who can't afford to travel always traffic drugs.'"" ""Threw me on the ground, yelling 'Don't resist'... [other] agents loved this and were laughing."" ""Hauled into the airport jail and treated like trash."" ""He called me moron more than once ... mocked my ... accent."" ""I was roughly frisked ... detained/held for questioning for seven hours."" ""He attacked me in the baggage claim area ... made anti-Semitic remarks."" ""He was pushing me with his hands ... started using foul language."" ""They broke my iPad."" ""Pulled out a knife in a threatening manner ... stared at me and then thrust the knife into the cardboard box."" The CBSA has a code of conduct, which says officers will act with ""professionalism, integrity and respect."" ""It's completely unacceptable and … kind of repulsive that people go through this when they're simply trying to travel to their destination,"" says McSorley, who reviewed the complaints. ""It's ... just common courtesy and decency that you wouldn't swear, use racist terms, use anti-Semitic terms, use physical force against someone who hasn't broken a law."" A CBSA spokesperson said during the calendar years 2016 to 2018, it investigated 821 allegations of misconduct by agents at all border crossings, of which 615 led to disciplinary action — including termination. McSorley's organization has been pushing for years for external oversight of the CBSA. ""There are millions of people crossing our border, flying into the country,"" says McSorley. ""The public deserves transparency from [the CBSA]."" For three years, the federal government has been promising to bring in oversight, and a bill is currently before the House of Commons. However, it has not yet received royal assent, and time is running out before the House breaks for the Oct. 21 federal election. Harassment, sexual assault among alleged misconduct by border agents investigated by CBSA In another internal CBSA memo Knapp obtained through the Privacy Act, as part of an internal investigation into the complaint she filed, an officer wrote that she was detained because her eyes appeared to be bloodshot — perhaps raising suspicion of drug use. Knapp says her eyes were red due to crying because she missed her husband. The officer also noted she was wearing bulky clothing, which Knapp disputes, saying she was wearing a fitted yoga outfit. Lastly, the officer questioned why she was flying through Vancouver on her way home to Calgary from Mexico. ""That was because I was using Aeroplan and that was the only route I could do,"" says Knapp. ""But the thing is, no one ever raised any of these concerns with me."" Knapp says she is speaking out about what happened to her to try to encourage Ottawa to change how complaints about the CBSA are investigated. ""I'm a safe person to talk about it because I'm a Canadian citizen … and I have no risk of deportation or anything like that,"" she says.

66,Anonymous,2020-01-19T15:15:47.984Z,Oprah Winfrey details her decision to withdraw from Russell Simmons doc ,"Oprah Winfrey said Friday that Russell Simmons attempted to pressure her about her involvement with a documentary in which several women detail sexual abuse allegations against the rap mogul, but his efforts were not what prompted her to leave the project. ""He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me,"" Winfrey told The Associated Press through a spokesperson on Friday. It was not anything Simmons said that prompted Winfrey to withdraw from the On the Record film, according to Winfrey, but rather inconsistencies in the story of one of Simmons' accusers, Drew Dixon, that she felt needed to be addressed. Winfrey said Friday that she still believes Dixon and other women in the film, but that more reporting was needed. On the Record directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have said they have ample evidence against Simmons, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings. Winfrey has said she wanted to delay the release of the film, scheduled to premiere Jan. 25 at the Sundance Film Festival, but that that view was not shared by the film's directors. On the Record had been part of her partnership with Apple, which no longer will distribute the documentary. Winfrey, who herself has spoken openly of being sexually abused, announced she was leaving as executive producer on Jan. 10, saying that more work was needed and that the filmmakers were ""not aligned"" in their ""creative vision."" The film's producers, Impact Partners, said in a statement earlier this week that the movie was ready for Sundance. ""We have always championed the voices of those who have been wrongly silenced. The women in this film have made a great sacrifice by coming forward to tell their stories in their own words. We are honoured to support them,"" the Impact statement reads. ""We stand firmly behind the work of the intrepid filmmakers who continue to break new ground by advancing important stories in the public interest."" The AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Dixon has told her story publicly, including on CBS This Morning earlier this week. The communications between Winfrey and Simmons and her concerns about Dixon's story were first reported by The New York Times. Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, a Simmons representative issued a statement, saying ""If defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation, then there would be no justice."" Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Winfrey disputed allegations by the makers of On the Record that she gave them little warning before her Jan. 10 announcement. In a story which ran early Friday, Dick and Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter that they received just 20 minutes notice before Winfrey issued her statement. ""It was very disappointing and upsetting,"" Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them. That was our first thought. 'Oh my God. Let's tell everybody and figure this out.'""  Winfrey told the AP that Dick and Ziering knew well of her intentions. She said she had raised concerns last month about the film needing more work. According to Winfrey, she told Dick and Ziering that ""new information"" had made her see gaps she ""thought needed to be filled"" and that it was better to ""take a rest."" ""They said they would go on with or without me,"" Winfrey told the AP. She said the bottom line for her was that ""The film isn't ready.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/winfrey-decision-simmons-doc-1.5432160,[],N/A
67,Fred Youngs,2019-12-21T11:00:00.737Z,Amateur hour LRT announcement shows Tories can't get past blaming Liberals,"This column is an opinion piece by former CBC journalist Fred Youngs. Youngs was a reporter, producer, executive producer and senior manager for CBC News in Winnipeg, Calgary and Toronto and covered politics at newspapers in Ontario and Manitoba. A Hamiltonian by birth, he was the senior project manager for the development of CBC Hamilton.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. If there is a checklist for how to bungle a sensitive and fractious political announcement, Caroline Mulroney's appearance - or non-appearance - in Hamilton this week would tick most of the boxes. Indeed, it might just tick all of them. In just a few hours the minister of transportation for Ontario kiboshed a long-planned light rapid transit project for Hamilton, and blamed ballooning costs on the previous government, but didn't give any details around how or why they rose. On top of that she ducked out of a planned media briefing, and left town, for some reason, with a police escort.  Predictably, this amateur hour approach to political announcements has reignited the long-running debate over the LRT in Hamilton. Opponents are delighted; its proponents dismayed. City councillors — who were and still are pretty much in the dark — are left trying to figure out what to do with the $1 billion Mulroney left on the table for unspecified transit projects in Hamilton. They will have to hurry. Mulroney wants a plan by February — which doesn't leave a lot of time to figure out how to spend a lot of money. All this has served to underline that even though they have been in power for 18 months, the Ford government is still making things up as it goes along. And when it runs into turbulence as it did this week in Hamilton, its favourite response is to pivot quickly to blaming the former Liberal government for its troubles. It was Premier Doug Ford who came up with a plan for a new subway line for Toronto, along with $11.2 billion in funding to build it. It, too, came out of the blue to the city and its citizens, and upended planning and work that had already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  For her part, Mulroney undid $165 million in work and preparation for the Hamilton line. About half of that sum was used to purchase property along the proposed LRT line — property the province now owns. All of which must make city officials in Mississauga, Ottawa and other Ontario municipalities, where transit projects are or will be in the works, just a tad nervous. Who knows what comes next if the province decides to draw up its own transit plan for one city, and unilaterally decides to kill a project in another?  That explains why Mulroney decided that the real culprit here is the previous Liberal regime.  The Wynne government, Mulroney said in a statement, had not been ""upfront"" about the cost for building and running the LRT. It was really $5.5 billion, according to her. Although Mulroney has yet to reveal the figures and details to show how the PC government came to that conclusion.  ""We cannot afford to continue the Liberals' approach of making empty promises today and accumulating a massive legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren,"" she said. Slagging the Liberals for ""empty promises"" on the LRT is a bit tricky, given that Ford declared a little over a year ago that if Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger ""wants an LRT, he'll get an LRT."" That was then, it seems, and this is now. Voters decided more than 560 days ago that they had had enough of Wynne and her party. The Liberal party is now just a beleaguered rump, huddled in a corner at Queen's Park trying to figure out how to claw its way out of a hole. The Liberals may have started this project, but the responsibility for it now lies with the PCs. Voters in Hamilton and across Ontario deserve a better explanation of how and why the cost skyrocketed, how the province plans to deal with all the property it owns in Hamilton, and what comes next for transit in Hamilton, and in other cities.  What they don't need is yet another helping of partisanship, finger-pointing and blaming someone else.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/amateur-hour-lrt-announcement-shows-tories-can-t-get-past-blaming-liberals-1.5403214,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/liuna-lrt-1.5402413,N/A
68,Nancy Russell,2020-01-23T11:21:07.916Z,"P.E.I. students raise awareness about Alzheimer's and dementia with presentation, commercial ","Students at a school in Georgetown, P.E.I., have turned what they've learned about Alzheimer's disease and dementia into a lesson of their own. The students are guest presenters this week at an Alzheimer's awareness conference in Charlottetown. They're also featured in a new commercial created for this year's Alzheimer's Awareness Month.  Sheryll O'Hanley, Georgetown Elementary School's principal, was asked by the Alzheimer Society of P.E.I. to share a resource they've developed for elementary students. It includes a storybook called What My Grandma Means to Say. ""With my own experience with Alzheimer's in my family, I jumped on the chance and it's just a perfect fit for Georgetown,"" O'Hanley said.  ""They're so rooted in family here and grandparents play a very big part in our students' lives so it was a no-brainer for me, I had to do it."" O'Hanley's grandfather had Alzheimer's and, as a pre-teen, she and her family cared for their grandparents every winter. ""I remember feeling almost resentment as a child because we weren't really told why we were going,"" O'Hanley said. ""We didn't talk about Alzheimer's and I think, at that time, perhaps the adults didn't think that as children we could handle the conversation."" The book is told from the point of view of a young boy, who watches his grandmother being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and moving into a nursing home. The story resonated for many of the students in Georgetown. Grade 5 student Laney King said one of her relatives has Alzheimer's. ""It is kind of hard sometimes when she doesn't remember you,"" she said. ""But we do visit her a lot so she remembers us more now."" Grade 6 student Patrick Collings said he has had similar experiences with one of his family members, who also has trouble remembering his name when he goes for visits. ""It was just kind of weird, but I didn't say anything and then I talked to my mom after we left and we talked about Alzheimer's."" The story also gave the students a better understanding of Alzheimer's and dementia. ""That Alzheimer's is not a contagious disease,"" said Grade 6 student Hannah Rafuse. ""You don't treat them differently just because they don't remember some stuff, because a lot of people don't remember stuff."" After reading the book, the class took on another spin-off project: creating memory books that they shared with their grandparents.  ""It was really touching because so many of them were like, 'Wow! I didn't think you remembered that,'"" O'Hanley said.  Then, the grandparents shared memories of their grandchild. ""It was very touching,"" O'Hanley said.  ""One grandmother came up to me and she said, 'This is my biggest fear, is that I'm going to forget her.'"" The Alzheimer Society asked if they could come to the session with a camera and interview some of the students and grandparents. That footage is now a new commercial created for this year's Alzheimer's Awareness Month.  ""It was very heartfelt,"" said Corrine Hendricken-Eldershaw, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of P.E.I. ""The ultimate goal is to have young people share their understanding when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's,"" she said. ""Some of the messages that the students of Georgetown shared are really very important for us to hear."" ""I'm very proud of our students, I think they're going to be wonderful ambassadors for Alzheimer's,"" O'Hanley said.  ""I think this will be something that they probably remember, that they can take this information into later years and reflect on."" O'Hanley hopes more P.E.I. educators will take advantage of the information kit, which is available in 37 elementary school libraries across the Island. ""I think the resource is a fabulous way to start the conversation with students, and that conversation to happen as a family,"" O'Hanley said.  ""Because grandparents are feeling frustration and that nervousness already and they may not even develop Alzheimer's, but it is something that they're scared of.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-georgetown-students-alzheimer-demention-awareness-1.5436574,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-alzheimer-s-dementia-letstalkmemory-campaign-1.4832844 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-libraries-dementia-books-2019-1.5224812 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-newcomers-food-bank-charlottetown-1.5436580,N/A
69,Karin Larsen,2020-01-22T03:12:10.824Z,The strange tale of the paid protesters supporting Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing,"Two people who demonstrated in support of Meng Wanzhou outside B.C. Supreme Court during her extradition hearing say they were unwittingly recruited under false pretences and paid to be there. Meng, the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 at the request of the U.S., which seeks to extradite her to face charges of fraud. A number of people showed up on the first day of her hearing Monday and held signs supporting her. For actor Julia Hackstaff of Vancouver it all started with a promise of $100 for two hours of work in what she understood to be an appearance as an extra in a movie shoot. Hackstaff said the offer came over Facebook from a person in the acting community she has never met. ""It's terrible, it's horrifying,"" she said. ""I was sincerely going to participate in something that seemed cool and a nice opportunity. And they took advantage of my profession and my passion ... to make a false protest."" The second person, whom CBC News has agreed not to identify and will refer to as SP, said she was recruited by a friend promising a $150 payday just to show up at the courthouse and hold a sign. ""I was told it was to free Ms. Meng. I had never heard that name before in my life​​​​​,"" said SP, also of Vancouver. ""I had to go after and Google what Huawei was because I never heard that [name] before in my life. I didn't even know it was a company."" Both women say they don't know who was ultimately offering the payment for their participation. SP says a woman identified only as ""Jowe"" [pronounced ""Joey""] handed out the signs at the courthouse. ""She didn't say much, she just shook our hands,"" said SP, who was standing with a small group of people. ""She disappeared for a bit and came back and she had the red signs that you can see in the pictures a lot of people holding. So I assume either she made them or someone got them made for her, and she just basically handed them out. That was it. We were given no instruction, no information on what we're doing."" Hackstaff says she and a friend were told by her contact to go to the Holiday Inn a few blocks away and then brought to the courthouse. When they arrived, they approached a group of young people who looked ""lost"" she assumed were background actors. ""I went and asked, 'Are you guys the extras?' And one guy said yes. He then asked me my name and my friend's name. So we gave him our first names and he checked on his phone like [as] if he had a list."" Hackstaff said she was handed a red sign that said ""Free Ms. Meng, Equal Justice!"" Soon after, she began questioning what was actually going on. There was something very strange about this protest this morning. Participants said they had only heard about the hearing last minute, hence the basic signs. They were unwilling to tell media about their cause and where they were from and were becoming agitated at questions. <a href=""https://t.co/Gnva9yaW4b"">https://t.co/Gnva9yaW4b</a> ""A CBS reporter approached me and my friend and she started interviewing us. And it was in those moments and questions where I started realizing, OK, if this was background work, they wouldn't need detail on background people."" ""And then I started realizing, wait, no one called 'action,'"" she said.  Hackstaff says she ""freaked out"" when a second reporter approached, coming to the realization that the movie she thought she was appearing in was, in fact, something very real. She says that's when she left without being paid. SP says her friend paid her $150 via an e-transfer. She says after she read up on Meng and Huawei, she feels deep regret at having participated in what she feels was a faux protest.   ""I wasn't educated ... and that's a shame on me,"" she said. ""I really wish there was a way to go back in time."" CBC News has left messages with the woman identified as Jowe. She has not responded.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/paid-protesters-meng-wanzhou-1.5434613,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5433840,N/A
70,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-04-11T00:00:00.447Z,Bank regulator's report on aggressive sales tactics weakened after government — and banks — reviewed drafts,"Last year's report from Canada's banking regulator about aggressive sales tactics underwent several drafts that eliminated proposed protections for consumers — edits that were made after the regulator sent early versions to the federal Finance Department and the big banks. Internal documents from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) — obtained under Access to Information and provided to Go Public — show that some recommendations for action were weakened or removed, including a proposal to require that banks work in the best interest of consumers.  Another key edit was the addition of a line saying the review did not find ""widespread mis-selling"" by the banks. It all paints a picture of the ""cosy"" relationship between the country's six big banks, the agency that's supposed to regulate them and the federal government, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""[The banks] have disproportionate access and perhaps disproportionate influence."" The report was prompted in part by months of reporting by Go Public, in which hundreds of current and former bank employees said they were pushed to upsell customers to try to meet sales targets. Some described feeling pressured to do such things as mislead customers about credit card fees and mortgage rates, forge signatures on credit card and loan insurance products and secretly increase lines of credit. At the time, the banks told Go Public that they act in the best interests of their clients, and that employees are expected to follow various codes of conduct. The documents were obtained through Access to Information by public policy researcher Ken Rubin, who asked for draft copies of FCAC's report on sales practices at the big banks, and related correspondence. The regulator's review focused on BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD and National Bank. It found that banks encourage employees to sell products and services and reward them for sales success. But FCAC also said it did not find evidence of widespread harm to consumers. Although FCAC staff interviewed 600 bank employees, and reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents and 4,500 customer complaints, the report did not name a single bank or quote from any of the interviews. ""When I saw the March [2018] report, I said, 'There's more to it than meets the eye,'"" said Rubin, one of Canada's most prolific practitioners of federal Access to Information requests. Thomas found it particularly interesting that the regulator sent a draft of its report to the very banks at the centre of its eight-month review. ""[The banks] have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking,"" he said. ""It's a fact of life."" Sending the banks a draft copy is a big concern for consumer advocate Duff Conacher. ""You don't share … the evidence you gathered,"" said the co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa. ""That evidence is the basis of your conclusions as to whether the law has been violated."" The banking regulator told Go Public it sent the banks a draft report so the financial institutions could ""identify factual errors."" ""If the agency wanted to check the facts in the report … they could have just sent them those facts,"" Conacher said.  In a subsequent draft, a line was added pointing out that banks are ""in the process of enhancing their oversight and management of sales practices risk."" It's not known who proposed adding that line. Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) whether it requested a draft copy of the report.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labreche sent an email that did not respond to that question, writing, ""The Canadian Bankers Association and its member banks regularly communicate and meet with supervisory bodies, including the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as part of the normal course of the oversight process."" The internal documents also include dozens of pages from the big banks, which appear to be responses to the regulator's draft report.  Go Public is not able to know their contents — including the date they were written, or who wrote them — because entire pages were redacted under an Access to Information exemption that protects commercial interests. The documents also reveal that the banking regulator supplied a draft to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his department three months before publicly releasing it last year. Conacher says the regulator, purportedly an independent agency, should not have given the minister and his department a chance to vet and comment on its report. ""It's inappropriate and improper for a minister to be looking at the draft conclusions of a law enforcement agency,"" he told Go Public. ""That means decisions could be made on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts and the law."" One of the most significant edits to the initial draft that was sent to the finance minister was the addition of a finding on Page 1 that says, ""FCAC did not find widespread mis-selling during its review."" ""It's hard to say … exactly what happened,"" said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer organization based in Ottawa. ""The language seems to belie the rest of the report, which goes into some detail about how sales practices — which are a little unseemly — can be performed."" Go Public requested an interview with Morneau, but his spokesperson, Pierre-Olivier Herbert, said the minister was unavailable. In a statement, Herbert did not respond to Conacher's criticism that it ought to be considered inappropriate for the minister to receive a draft report from the banking regulator. A Finance Department spokesperson said it is routine for financial sector agencies to share documents for comment and to confirm facts. Go Public received various versions of the banking regulator's report, including several versions of the original draft, a revised copy after it went to the finance minister, and the final report.  Sentences, recommendations or conclusions are redacted in several drafts, based on an exemption in Canada's Access to Information Act that allows the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose any advice involving the institution or a federal cabinet minister. The exemption applies to advice or recommendations that occur at a ministerial level, essentially to allow confidentiality in the policy-making process. Go Public asked the minister about additions made after he had received a copy. In an email, Morneau's spokesperson wrote, ""the Minister's office did not provide comments or request any edits to the FCAC's report. The findings in the FCAC's report are entirely their own."" However, the documents indicate that Morneau's department made at least six comments on the first draft of the report, including about changing parts that say the regulator will introduce certain reforms to the regulator ""proposes"" them. Most of the comments from the department are redacted. ""The biggest thing is there were three recommendations saying banks should be 'required' to make changes,"" Conacher said. ""And those were all changed to 'suggestions' that the banks should do some things. ""Suggestions are meaningless, if you're actually trying to solve a problem. The banks don't have to do anything."" The draft sent to the minister's office included a line saying, ""Require banks to work in the best interests of their customers."" The line didn't make the final version of the report. Some other language that was critical of the banks — such as a line saying that banks ""lean disproportionately in favour of a sales driven culture"" — was also dropped before the report was published. Go Public checked the lobbyist registry to see how many times the banks or their umbrella group, the CBA, lobbied government officials, senators, MPs — including Morneau — the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and FCAC during the 12-month period between when the regulator announced it was conducting a bank review and the date it released its report. Between March 15, 2017, and March 20, 2018, the big banks and the CBA lobbied a total of 165 times. In the month leading up to the release of FCAC's report, the CBA met with the regulator's deputy commissioner, Brigitte Goulard, four times — including the day before the report was published. Lobbying is legal, but those who do significant amounts of it are required to file a record with the lobbying commissioner, who then makes the information public online. ""The banks — because they're an important economic asset to the country — have to be listened to,"" said the University of Manitoba's Paul Thomas. ""They have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking. It's a fact of life."" As a comparison, Go Public asked four consumer advocacy organizations how many times they had the ear of lawmakers and banking watchdogs during the same period. In total, they had fewer than 10 meetings with policy-makers and FCAC to discuss the sales practices of banks, they said. ""It's extremely concerning to us, of course, that consumer groups are not more meaningfully supported to participate in these important conversations,"" wrote Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. ""The council continues to have serious concerns about the resources available to facilitate meaningful consumer representation at not only FCAC but across government concerning consumer protection."" Thomas says after combing through the various versions of the bank regulator's report, the relationship between the banks, the government and the banking regulator can be difficult to figure out. ""The whole process is submerged. It's not transparent,"" he said.  ""If it hadn't been for Access to Information requests, we wouldn't know the extent to which the banks were given a certain privileged status in this process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fcac-bank-report-on-sales-tactics-weakened-1.5091115,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096,N/A
71,Hannah Thibedeau,2020-01-23T04:45:12.581Z,Rona Ambrose says she won't run for the Conservative leadership,"Rona Ambrose says she won't run to succeed Andrew Scheer as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. In a Facebook post this afternoon, the former interim Conservative leader said she ""struggled"" with the decision to stay out. ""It is humbling to be considered at all — because I love our party, I love the people in it and I love our country,"" she said. Thanking her supporters for their ""messages of encouragement,"" she said that she remains focused on her work in the private sector. ""And the truth is, I love being back in Alberta,"" she added in the Facebook post. ""I know we will choose a strong, compassionate person to lead us — who supports ALL families. I know we'll choose a good leader and I'll be there to support HER…or him!"" Ambrose's comment about ""all families"" might be read as a comment on Scheer, who was dogged by questions about his beliefs regarding LGBTQ rights — and his refusal to march in a Pride parade — throughout the fall election campaign. Conservative strategist Tim Powers told CBC News he's not convinced the comment was directed at Scheer, and suggested instead that Ambrose was warning the entire party that it's ""too tribal."" ""This leadership race needs a diversity of voices,"" he said. ""I think what she means is that ... whether you're a heterosexual couple, a gay couple, you're a single parent, you're rich, you're poor, you should feel welcome in the Conservative Party. Watch | Rona Ambrose says she won't run for the Conservative Party leadership ""Andrew Scheer is irrelevant ... I don't mean that unkindly, but he's not part of the equation. He's the interim leader. His time is done."" Ambrose's former chief of staff, Garry Keller, said she probably felt she needed to make her intentions clear to those Conservatives still thinking about their options. ""Obviously she spent a lot of time thinking about it over the Christmas break and early January,"" said Keller, now vice president of the business advisory firm StrategyCorp. ""You know, people are starting to make decisions on who to support for the leadership, including the MPs, and ... now is probably the right time to make that decision once and for all."" A source close to Ambrose tells CBC News she's not ruling out a return to politics at some future point. In the meantime, her announcement may open up the race to prospective candidates who were waiting to see which way she would jump. Widely seen as a polished and effective performer close to the centre of the political spectrum, Ambrose was viewed by some Conservative supporters as the party's best shot to take down the Liberals in the next general election. Her decision is certain to disappoint some. Former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall personally urged her to run; he told CBC News earlier this month that Ambrose ""checks the boxes, in terms of policy, in terms of electability. ""And then finally, she's from Western Canada,"" Wall said. ""I think she knows where I stand on her potential candidacy. We haven't spoken since, I guess, a week or so just after the federal election.

Vincent Rigby takes over the position after Trudeau's former national security adviser, Greta Bossenmaier, announced her retirement in November following a 35-year career in the federal public service. Rigby brings a variety of different experiences to the new role, including stints at the Department of National Defence, Public Safety Canada, the Privy Council Office and Global Affairs Canada. He has previously supported the prime minister's participation in three G20 summits, took part in talks to set new development targets at the United Nations, been involved in the Arctic Council and helped manage the Afghanistan mission. Rigby's appointment comes as the federal government is struggling with a number of sensitive security files, including a fraught relationship with China over Huawei and the detention of two Canadians, as well as the downed plane in Iran and ongoing concerns about Russia. Rigby is the third person to advise Trudeau on national security since Daniel Jean resigned in May 2018 in the wake of controversy around the prime minister's trip to India.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-national-security-advisor-vincent-rigby-1.5436676,[],N/A

Ottawa Family Cinema has been serving up popcorn and first-run Hollywood productions at affordable prices in the auditorium of Notre Dame High School on Broadview Avenue. The weekend events are run by trained volunteers, with proceeds donated to local charities.  In November, the Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) informed the non-profit organization its lease will run out this May. The board said it needs the auditorium for its international language program. ""We wanted to provide them with ample time to secure a different location,"" said OCSB spokesperson Sharlene Hunter.  That hasn't lessened the blow, however. ""We're very puzzled, very upset,"" said Ottawa Family Cinema co-founder Jim McNeil.  McNeil said the potential cost of moving and recalibrating its projection and sound equipment has cast the organization's future in doubt. ""We're a shoestring operation of volunteers,"" McNeil said. News of the cinema group's possible demise has prompted an online petition, and a fair amount of outrage from community members. ""There are many people in our community who cannot afford to go to movies,"" said parent Jill Skinner. ""This is a great opportunity for people to get together that's affordable, and that is really important."" McNeil said he helped launch Ottawa Family Cinema so low-income families could enjoy the magic of watching a movie on the big screen like everyone else. The former theatre manager, who grew up among plenty of siblings in Belfast, remembers going to the movies as one of the few outings his family could afford to do together. He arrived in Canada as the cost of going to the movies began sky-rocketing, and said he was determined to create an affordable alternative where admission and concession prices were kept to a minimum. A ticket to an Ottawa Family Cinema movie such as this weekend's Little Women currently costs $4, and a kiddies' combo of popcorn, candy and drink is $5. ""Even those who can't afford it can have the escape and entertainment,"" said McNeil, who said he also hands out ""hundreds of free tickets to community centres, schools and women's shelters."" The school board arrived at the decision ""after carefully considering our student needs and our commitment to equity of access to our buildings,"" Hunter said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/movie-theatre-closing-family-cinema-ottawa-catholic-school-board-1.5436083,[],N/A

77,Michael Gorman,2020-01-21T19:41:58.663Z,Premier reaffirms no new effluent will enter Boat Harbour after January,"Pictou Landing First Nation Chief Andrea Paul is expressing concern that although Boat Harbour will stop receiving effluent from Northern Pulp at the end of January, it will still be several months before the former tidal estuary is completely closed to all materials from the mill. Paul issued a news release Tuesday saying she has not agreed to allow the Pictou County, N.S., treatment facility to continue to be used after Jan. 31. She takes particular issue with the company's plan to run its power boiler to provide heat at the site while winterizing the mill, a move that would mean water would flow through the system and into Boat Harbour as late as April. ""We were not consulted about it,"" Paul said in the news release. She could not be reached for an interview. In her release, Paul said the community is disappointed. ""We were expecting a complete shutdown of the Boat Harbour treatment facility,"" she said. ""Northern Pulp could have started draining the pipes weeks ago in order to complete the work before Jan. 31 and avoid the need to heat the mill after that."" Last month, Premier Stephen McNeil rejected calls from the mill to extend the legislated deadline for the company's use of Boat Harbour to treat its effluent. On Tuesday, McNeil said the government is dealing with the situation as it exists, while continuing to keep the promise enshrined in the Boat Harbour Act. ""There will be no new effluent going into Boat Harbour as of the 31st of January. Our commitment has been met to [the Pictou Landing First Nation] and we'll continue to work with them,"" he said. ""Here's where we are,"" McNeil added. ""The reality of it is, we also have an issue and that's that pipe. So we couldn't do anything with the pipe until [Jan. 31]."" Running water through the boiler means the pipe connecting the mill to Boat Harbour, which the province owns and is responsible for, will be flushed and cleaned, allowing it to be disconnected and permanently removed by the end of April, said McNeil. In the meantime, he's expecting a detailed plan from the company within the week about how they will deal with other issues on the mill site, such as leachate and the capping of manhole covers on the property that receive runoff water, which flows into Boat Harbour. As those details continue to be worked out, people who work in the woods and other industries connected to the forestry are on watch for what all of it means for them. The province's forestry transition team has made several funding announcements to assist with silviculture work and retraining, but removing the industry's largest player all but guarantees some operators won't be able to remain viable for the long term. Already, companies from other provinces are advertising job fairs. Josh Molnar operates Molnar Welding in Lantz, N.S., a fabrication and repair shop that specializes in work for sawmills, and employs 25 people. They've been in business for about 45 years. Molnar, the third generation of his family to run the business, said he's watching closely to see what happens with sawmills around the province. If they reach the point where they have nowhere to send chips, it will have a direct effect on his own business. He's hoping that new markets for those chips come about quickly, such as for district heating or biomass for electricity. As much as some people in the industry would like to see Northern Pulp keep operating, Molnar said the immediate focus right now must be on finding new markets and ways to keep the sector viable. ""[Sawmills] need time, they need a solution to get rid of their products so that they can invest for the future,"" he said. It would also mean a future for the 25 people at Molnar Welding and other businesses like them.

78,Payam Akhavan,2020-01-11T09:00:00.411Z,Belonging and grief: What the Iran air disaster reveals about the inextricable ties that bind us together,"This column is an opinion by Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University, a former UN prosecutor at The Hague, and the 2017 CBC Massey Lecturer. He was born in Tehran and left Iran in his childhood, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1980 at the outset of the Islamic revolution and violent persecution of the Baha'i religious minority to which he belonged. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. On the outskirts of Tehran, the fragments of what was once a journey of many dreams lie scattered against a bleak landscape. Amidst the twisted metal and clothing littering the scorched earth, there is a single red shoe of a child. It has a pretty bow, slightly singed by the flames that engulfed Flight PS752 in its last moments before it crashed from the sky in a great ball of fire, bringing to a sudden end so many stories yet to be told, so many joys yet to be discovered. The little shoe made me think of one-year old Kurdia, whose parents Evin and Hiva had taken her halfway across the world, from Canada to Iran, to celebrate a wedding. Persian weddings, we jokingly say, need a football stadium to accommodate the guests. How many adoring grandparents and elders, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends must have smothered little Kurdia with affectionate kisses, seeing her for the first time, not knowing that it would also be the last. It seems to be the fate of people in the Middle East to suffer. Some weeks earlier, hundreds of Iranian youths were shot on the streets of Tehran for protesting corruption, crying for freedom, and their loved ones were arrested for mourning their loss. Mothers and fathers have been killed by barrel bombs in Idlib and Aleppo, standing in a bread line to appease the unbearable pain of hunger. And it is only a matter of time before we witness, yet again, those desperate to flee such horrors, drowning in the depths of the Mediterranean while trying to cross the forbidding sea in rubber dinghies, in search of a better world. And now, the grim sight of a long succession of body bags amidst the wreckage of the aircraft that carried so many on their way home to Canada, the country that opened its doors to them, answering their dream of a better future. One tries to be philosophical at times like this. ""Death is our wedding with eternity,"" the great mystic Rumi wrote. It is difficult to reconcile that wisdom with the horrors the hapless passengers must have experienced in their final moments. Yet, just as weddings are a communal experience that teach us what it means to belong, so too communal grief and mourning shows us, in the hour of darkness, the astonishing light of the human spirit; the inextricable ties that bind us together. In ""Tehranto"" and Montreal, Windsor and Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, Halifax and London, across this vast space we call Canada, people have lost family and friends, neighbours and colleagues, teachers and students. This isn't just another horrible thing happening ""out there,"" in that other world of suffering that momentarily intrudes on our lives of privilege, trivialized by a tweet or fleeting Facebook post, soon to be forgotten. Now it is happening to ""us,"" we who call ourselves Canadians, who imagine belonging as something that is beyond the bonds of blood and soil; a transcendent connection built on a shared humanity. The flag flies at half-mast at my university in Montreal, as it does across other campuses through the country. Many on that ill-fated flight were professors, researchers, and students, part of Iran's massive brain drain as accomplished and ambitious youth settle here in our midst to start new lives. On my mobile phone, there are numerous e-mails and text messages from fellow Canadians, expressing sympathy and concern, mourning the loss that has become ours for the simple reason that we have come to live in the same place – a wonderful and precious place where, amidst grief and suffering, compassion reigns supreme. Just as joyous celebrations define who we are, communal bereavement — healing together, whether it is with our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were here before us or with the recent immigrant returning home from a previous home — teaches us what it means to be human. What it means to be Canadian. It unites us at the core, gives us a deeper identity, emancipates us from the superficial divisions and distractions that we confuse with true meaning. ""Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes,"" Rumi wrote, ""because for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no separation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-air-disaster-iran-canada-1.5421028,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-flight752-crash-timeline-1.5419572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-ukrainian-plane-crash-canada-reaction-1.5418648 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265,N/A
79,Taylor C. Noakes,2020-01-15T23:26:45.604Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan: Welcome to Canada, but pay your own bills","This column is an opinion by Taylor C. Noakes, an independent journalist and public historian from Montreal. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. It's remarkably easy to become financially independent, as Prince Harry and Meghan say they want to do, when other people pay your bills. Doubtless this will be a crucial lesson in Ontario's new high school financial literacy course; there's no better way to keep your money than by not having to spend it. Just ask any Canadian billionaire, whose tax rates have decreased over the past 20 years while their share of total income skyrocketed over the same time period. It's remarkable, too, that news of Meghan, Harry and Archie's planned Brexit to Canada has really only led to a single central question: will Canada pay their security costs? Not ""why are we maintaining this antiquated, obsolete and fundamentally undemocratic institution,"" but rather how much more are we willing to fork over for Monarchy Lite? If the Sussexes are coming to Canada at least in part because they're looking to be more financially independent, they should pay their own security costs. Even without the estimated £82.4 million ($140 million Cdn) the royal family will receive this year from British taxpayers through the sovereign grant, the couple has an estimated net worth of £18 million and receives another £2.3 million annually from Prince Charles. What's particularly curious here is that the Sussexes are in fact doubling down on the monarchy even though they appear to be moving away from it. They're quite literally in the process of attempting to trademark ""Sussex Royal"" in an application covering Canada and Australia, as well as noted bulwarks of British monarchism the European Union and United States. So while they're ostensibly stepping away from their public functions as senior members of the royal family, there are no plans to move away from the fortune to be made from branding and marketing their royal likeness on everything from coffee cups to beach towels. In other words, they're not taking a step back from the monarchy, they're bringing the monarchy to Canada on a semi-permanent basis, seemingly as part of a major product launch. (This ain't your grandma's royal family, it's new and improved!) As much as we might be tempted to feel bad for the embarrassing elements of Harry's family, or the nauseating racism of contemporary British society directed towards Meghan, we mustn't forget the Sussexes are fundamentally a business for whom the taxpaying public pays most if not all of the bills. And though it may appear the couple are fleeing the salivating hounds of Fleet Street, they are in fact imposing themselves on a people they have little in common with. According to some poll numbers, about half of Canadians think our relationship with the royal family should end once Queen Elizabeth dies, and more than 60 per cent believe the royals should have no role in Canadian society and culture. The monarchy in Canada is a lot more than just the occasional visit and some ceremonial relationships between princes and military units. It's also the governor general, the lieutenant governors and several properties that serve as official royal residences, such as Quebec City's Citadel and Ottawa's Rideau Hall. The rough estimate is that maintaining the monarchy in Canada exceeds $50 million annually, a considerable sum to spend on ceremonial frivolities in a country that still has trouble providing safe drinking water to rural communities. Complicated as disentangling Canada from the monarchy would be, that's also quite a lot of money to spend on unelected officials with the power to disrupt the normal functioning of Canadian democracy. Cuddly newborns and photogenic princesses aside, the monarchy is a symbol of the genocidal imperialism that all but annihilated the rightful heirs and stewards of this land. Canadians pumping money into the monarchy in 2020 makes about as much sense as Americans who defend the Confederacy: just because it's historic doesn't mean it's worth celebrating or spending money on. Moreover, far from encouraging a greater appreciation of our national history, our fascination with the celebrity circus that is the British monarchy occludes the reality that anti-monarchists, like William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, were trying to sever our ties with the Crown a full 30 years before Confederation. That an unfortunate number of Canadians can more easily identify latter-day, second-tier foreign royalty than explain what the Rebellions of 1837/1838 were about is demonstrative that the monarchy is a bit of a historical black hole.  It's time to move on and for precedents to be set. Meghan, Harry and Archie are welcome to immigrate to Canada. They just have to get in line like everyone else, and prove they won't be a financial liability.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/meghan-markle-hideout-this-b-c-property-believed-to-be-where-royals-are-1.5427722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-and-prime-minister-giddy-about-harry-and-meghan-s-possible-move-to-b-c-1.5425727 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-family-jobs-europe-harry-meghan-1.5427405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,N/A
80,Jonathon Gatehouse,2020-01-22T13:03:43.107Z,"A 'second class' spy: Muslim CSIS agent alleges discrimination, abuse","Canada's spy agency is being sued for racial and religious discrimination by a longtime employee who alleges that his Muslim faith marked him as a target for harassment, emotional abuse and even physical assaults.  The suit, filed in Federal Court in Ottawa last week by an intelligence analyst using the pseudonym Sameer Ebadi, claims a pattern of bullying and prejudice stretching back almost two decades that saw the man treated as a ""second class citizen"" within the ranks of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.  ""You know, it took me a long time to realize this, to see that, to begin with, anybody with [an] ethnic origin other than a Canadian-born one was a suspect.... Then you add faith and religion to that one, you're going one step down,"" Ebadi told CBC News in an exclusive interview, his voice choked with emotion. ""I don't think there is anybody in terms of the class of employees lower than the [a] practicing Muslim at the service.""  The statement of claim alleges that the analyst — who was recruited by CSIS at the beginning of the 2000s because of his Middle Eastern background and fluency in several languages — was subject to ""discrimination, bullying, physical assaults, religious persecution and the intentional infliction of emotional and physical harm"" by his fellow spies, including attacks while he prayed in the privacy of his office. And it contends that agency managers ""knowingly participated"" in the misconduct or ""stood idly by"" while it happened. As a result of what the suit called an ""irretrievably hostile"" workplace, the analyst claims he suffered extreme stress, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and left him with a host of psychological and medical ailments including severe anxiety, depression, hypertension and insomnia. He has been on sick leave since early 2018. The suit seeks a total of $750,000 in damages, and further compensation for past and future loss of income. It names five CSIS employees, all also under pseudonyms, and David Vigneault, the director and public face of the spy agency. None of the allegations have been tested in court. In an emailed statement, John Townsend, head of media relations for CSIS, declined to discuss the specifics of the claim. But he said in a statement that the agency takes any allegation of inappropriate behaviour, including harassment and discrimination, very seriously. He said the spy service has been working hard since Vigneault took over the reins in mid-2017 to make improvements to its ""already robust"" internal accountability measures, including a new code of conduct, town halls and a ""respect campaign."" ""Our employees are always encouraged to report incidents of harassment, discrimination or bullying without fear of reprisal, and all of our managers are required to act promptly on any issues brought to their attention and, if necessary, request a formal investigation,"" the statement said. ""We make every effort to ensure that all employees feel respected and valued."" Under Canada's Security of Information Act, revealing the identity of an intelligence operative is a criminal offence. CBC News knows the analyst only by his alias, although his lawyer has vouched for his client's employment and position.  Ebadi said in his interview he was initially excited to work for CSIS and to be given the opportunity to use his knowledge and skills to help protect his adopted homeland. But in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the way he was viewed by his colleagues began to shift, and everyday interactions were tainted by hostility and fear. Eventually, he says the work culture became toxic, with his loyalties constantly under scrutiny from fellow employees and the bosses in his Western Canada office. Once while out driving with his then-infant child in the back seat, Ebadi noticed he was being closely followed by another vehicle. ""After a couple of intersections ... he is still coming. So I tried to evade. I increased my speed. I went to the highway. He did the same thing,"" Ebadi said. ""I wasn't sure if this person who is following me is an adversary, somebody who wants to harm me ... because we were told that you are at risk all the time."" Ebadi provided details of the high-speed chase to CSIS security officers, including the make and licence number of the other vehicle. But when there was no followup, he suspected he'd been tailed by members of his own team rather than a foe. Later, after his own car began to experience electrical problems, Ebadi says his mechanic found a mysterious GPS tracking device that had been hidden in the engine compartment and was draining the battery.  His lawsuit claims that ""other Muslim members of the service received the same treatment."" In response, the analyst rededicated himself to the job — working extra, unpaid hours and popping in on his days off to keep on top of his files. He hoped that his evident dedication would put all the suspicions to rest, but it had just the opposite effect. ""I learned later on that all those actions, they were actually raising more alarms at the service,"" he said, claiming his bosses were suspicious of why he would work all that extra time without compensation.  As the years went on, the indignities piled up, he said: intrusive questioning from his bosses about the state of his marriage, applications for promotion or transfer that were rejected out of hand, and a ""new"" office that turned out to be a converted, windowless supply closet next to the men's washroom.  ""People, they used to drop by and they congratulated me on my new position and I knew what they were talking about,"" Ebadi said. ""It was humiliating and it really took a toll on my soul."" And when he complained — to his immediate superiors in Western Canada and then up the chain to headquarters in Ottawa — things only got worse.  Ebadi's suit claims he was reprimanded and publicly humiliated by his bosses, then removed from active investigations and treated as an office pariah. ""The previous rumours and innuendos and backbiting went through the roof. I was isolated. Nobody was talking to me,"" Ebadi told CBC News. ""They passed by me as if I didn't exist."" As his spirits sank lower, the analyst sought comfort in his religion, a faith that he had long downplayed and kept hidden from his co-workers. He began to observe daily prayers in his tiny office — a practice that only served to heighten the workplace abuse.  ""It turned into an attraction, as if it's an amusement park or something that they have never seen,"" said Ebadi. Other employees would stop by to gawk, laugh or shout profanities, he said. And a type of ""game"" developed where his co-workers would abruptly throw open the door to the room as he lay prone on his prayer mat.   ""At times, suddenly somebody would open the door and pretend that they didn't know that I was there,"" he says. ""It would hit me. And it would disorient me."" The final straw came in early 2018, when the analyst returned from lunch to find his office door covered in spit.  ""I turned the door handle and I saw it is wet ... saliva was dripping from the face of the door all the way to the door handle, and it was done [in] such an obvious and brazen manner,"" Ebadi recounted, his eyes welling with tears. ""When I saw that I thought this is not the place for me anymore ... I cannot do one more day here because I didn't feel safe.""  It's not the first time allegations of harassment and discrimination have been levelled against Canada's spy agency. In 2017, five intelligence officers and analysts filed a $35-million lawsuit alleging openly Islamophobic, racist and homophobic behaviour by their managers and co-workers. The complainants said they suffered reprisals and were ostracized when they tried to report or stand up to the bullying, and all of them eventually ended up on long-term sick leave.  That suit was settled for an undisclosed amount a few months later. And Vigneault, who had held a private meeting with the five spies to learn about their experiences first-hand, sent an open letter to all CSIS employees decrying the agency's ""categorically unacceptable"" culture of ""retribution, favouritism, bullying and other problems."" The director also vowed to take ""concrete steps"" to create a ""healthy and respectful"" workplace.  John Phillips, the Toronto lawyer who represented those five claimants and has now taken up Ebadi's case, says he is dismayed but not surprised. ""I've watched organizations like this for 30 years of practice. You can see organizations try to fix things from the top, whether it's the RCMP or CSIS or other organizations, and what happens is that attempt to fix problems — to erase discrimination and try to equalize the work environment — are being undermined by the people in the middle, the central managers that aren't getting the message.... The lesson wasn't learned."" Ebadi says he holds CSIS responsible for the fact that he is no longer the confident, happy and active man he once was.  ""It is bothering me because they shattered my dreams. All the hope, all the good intentions, everything that I had,"" he said. ""That suffering hasn't stopped since I left work. It is with me and I think about it every day."" He said he hopes that those charged with sniffing out threats to the country's security will turn their attention to the bad guys in their own midst. ""They need to do fundamental change,"" Ebadi said. ""They didn't just harm me by acting against the law, they harm Canadians. Because I believe I could still [make a] difference if they had allowed me to contribute.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-muslim-discrimination-lawsuit-1.5433654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-recruitment-retention-1.5245126 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-right-wing-white-supremacy-1.5092304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/csis-toronto-spy-agency-employees-investigation-1.4206269 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/csis-spy-agency-harassment-lawsuit-settlement-1.4452118,N/A
81,Anonymous,2020-01-20T14:00:00.442Z,Inquest into Cynthia Blackjack's death begins in Carmacks,"A coroner's inquest begins Monday into the 2013 death of Carmacks, Yukon, resident Cynthia Blackjack. The first two days of the inquest are scheduled to happen in Carmacks at the local community centre. On Wednesday, it resumes at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre in Whitehorse. If weather drops below -35 C, hearings in Carmacks may be rescheduled, according to a release. Ten days have been scheduled for the proceedings. Yukon Territorial Court Judge Peter Chisholm has been appointed coroner for the inquest. Six jurors have been selected from two pools of candidates: three from Whitehorse and three from Dawson City. Blackjack was 29 years old when she died during a medevac flight to Whitehorse in November 2013. Yukon's former chief coroner refused requests from Blackjack's family and the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation for an inquest. The First Nation argued the coroner's original investigation was inadequate, and did not address ""systemic racism"" as a potential factor in Blackjack's death.  The Yukon Supreme Court agreed, and ordered an inquest. The coroner appealed, but the earlier court decision was upheld. The Yukon Court of Appeal found that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of abdominal pain. The day before she died, Blackjack was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital — a two-hour drive away — and that she would have to find her own way there. The next day, Blackjack's condition worsened, but there was a delay in getting an ambulance to bring her back to the Carmacks Health Centre and then another delay in getting her on a medevac flight to Whitehorse.  The cause of her death was later determined to be liver failure. The Yukon appeal court ruled that the problems with the ambulance service alone justified holding an inquest. ""This is particularly apparent given her [Blackjack's] possible vulnerability as a First Nation citizen and the nature of the care she received in the period preceding her death, regardless of whether a causal link was established between those circumstances and the medical cause of her death,"" the 2018 appeal court judgment says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-little-salmon-carmacks-first-nation-1.3996823,N/A
82,Reneltta Arluk,2019-12-28T15:45:52.275Z,Shared Lines: Why one Inuvialuk woman decided to get facial tattoos,"My great-grandmother, Alice Simon, had facial tattoos.  In the pictures we have of her, there are visible markings all up her cheeks but what always struck me was the thick black line that connected her bottom lip to her chin. So when I began to imagine that thick black line on my face, from lip to chin, I had more questions than answers as to why I wanted it. I'm not fully Inuk. My mother is Denesuline and Cree from the Fort Chipewyan region. My father was Inuvialuit but he was also Dene with Gwich'in roots. The woman who gave me this tattoo is a well known tattooer, Maya Sialuk Jacobsen of Greenland. She is an Inuk that studies the historical markings of Inuit women across the circumpolar North.  She said, ""I don't study land, I study patterns."" Her tattoo methods are traditional stick and poke or skin stitching ink with needle and thread. When I first contacted her, I sent an image of my great-grandmother, and Maya knew exactly where Alice Simon was from.  My great-grandmother spoke very little English; she was a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker. I did not get to grow up with her unfortunately. She died when I was just a young one, but when I was born, she came down to Fort Smith, N.W.T., from Inuvik to meet me. I was five months old.  She took care of me one night while my parents went to the movies. It was winter. In what was then an Inuvialuit practice, my great-grandmother took me outside, bare, and put me in the snow. I am not sure how long I was out there for. I am sure I cried. But even now I know her doing that to me was an act of love.  Through this winter custom, I was given the gift of resilience — a teaching that remains with me still.  She lived during a time when survival was the only way. She was a respected elder, cherished for her knowledge of preserving berries in the winter using techniques that are no longer practised.  Today Inuvialuktun is spoken by only a handful of Inuvialuit — mostly my great-grandmother's relatives, and likely because of her.  Alice was a matriarch. She gave the younger generations their Inuit names when they were born. Mine is Akpik.  It is the cloudberry that grows in the barren land — not too sweet but makes the best jam. Often Inuit are named after relatives who have passed or people in the community that have lived good lives. It's a way to instil positive traits in the young ones.  So when I learned my Inuk name was Akpik, I was confused. Why a berry?  I have a wonderful great aunt, Lillian Elias. Alice was her grandmother. Lillian is the matriarch now, and also a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker.  In one of our visits I asked her why great-grandmother Alice named me after a berry and not a relative. Auntie Lillian thought for a moment and said, ""maybe because they were her favourite."" It was clear to me getting tattooed would be a journey of reconnection, not only to my great-grandmother, but to the community of Inuit women wearing their ancestors' lines in celebration of who we are. I asked myself, why get this now? Easy, because it is time.  So much of our cultural teachings have been lost or taken away by colonialism. We know this, but most importantly we still feel this. In recent years there has been a resurgence of facial tattoos among Inuit women across the circumpolar north.  I received my thick black line so recently that in reflection of writing this, I am still unsure of the teachings it will offer me. I am fine with it, though.  This was not done to resolve any doubts or insecurities.  It was done to keep asking myself the questions about who I am at a time when we are needing to know who we are. We need to reconnect to our ancestral truths and I am grateful that my great-grandmother had the courage to wear hers at a time where many had started being denied theirs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-face-tattoo-reneltta-arluk-1.5397755,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,N/A

On an abandoned section of tarmac, the military members are creating craters in the concrete, and filling them in with whatever they have on hand.  ""The idea is to be able to do these repairs in the extreme cold,"" Lt. Col Simon Comtois said. ""If you use concrete, it takes a lot more time to cure and it's more resource intensive,"" he said.  ""Here, what we're doing is using ambient materials such as snow, water and the debris from the crater."" The fix was strong enough for an aircraft to roll over it, but is a temporary repair for the colder months. Once warmer conditions set in, Comtois said they would put in a permanent fix using concrete.  Last year the federal government said it would spend about $2.3 million to repair one of the air base's crumbling runways in the short term, with a full repaving project and airfield lighting upgrades set for the next few years. The aging runway was experiencing issues like asphalt stripping, debris, and potholes. In 2017, the airport was shut down for four days after issues with a sealant that was applied to cracks in the runways during annual maintenance. Crumbling runway at Goose Bay airport getting major repair, overhaul Goose Bay airfield shut down due to runway issue This joint experiment is happening independently of repairs, and will see about 40 people — evenly split between Canadians and Americans —  testing eight different methods of making repairs in the cold climate of central Labrador. ""This is a great example of cooperation between Canada and the United States,"" U.S. air force Brigadier General Edward Vaughn said. ""It's industry and military. It's really a great coming together.""  Many of the methods being tested are not new, but the exercise gives the forces a chance to examine them and come up with more effective techniques. ""What we're doing now is actually documenting and getting the data,"" Vaughn said. Some new techniques will also be introduced by scientists from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in New Hampshire. ""There's a lot of innovation going on here,"" Vaughn said.  ""Things as simple as: When you're operating the heavy equipment, what kind of gloves do you want to wear? What kind of hat? What kind of communication equipment do you need with all the noise?"" While the fixes will come in handy for Canadian Forces in the North, the Americans expect to use the knowledge in Alaska and some of the colder states, as well as their cold-weather ally countries.  ""We've got plenty of partners around the world in cold regions,"" Vaughn said. ""Think about it. There are even times when even parts of the United states get to be extreme cold. Five different locations were considered for to host the tests, but in the end it was decided 5 Wing was the most suitable. ""We wanted to make sure that we had enough snowfall, so enough material to fix the craters,"" Comtois said.  ""We needed enough cold... we needed to have access to heavy equipment, enough space on the tarmac and the ramp to be able to create a hole and not impede with operations."" The base is warning there may be increased traffic of heavy vehicles crossing Loring Drive to get to a nearby sand pit, and people should be vigilant in the area.

84,Bridgette Watson,2020-01-23T04:06:57.317Z,Kiss and don't tell: Gene Simmons' music festival in Grand Forks is news to mayor,"When Gene Simmons invited tens of thousands of people to a summer music festival in a small B.C. city on CBC radio last week, it was the first the local mayor had heard of the event. Brian Taylor, mayor of Grand Forks, B.C., only learned the Kiss star was launching his Titans of Rock festival there after Simmons made the announcement Thursday on CBC's Radio West.   Simmons says he expects 40,000 people to attend his new festival on the first weekend of August — and while Taylor sees the financial benefits it could bring to the southern Interior community of around 4,000 people, the proposed scale of the event is raising a few concerns. ""This was news to us,"" said Taylor on Radio West on Wednesday, adding he had only heard casual comments at city hall about the possibility of the festival, but nothing in terms of a formal discussion. The festival is replacing the classic rock festival CannaFest, which has been taking place every August at the city's James Donaldson Park. Canadian producer Chuck Varabioff, who used to put on CannaFest, is working with Simmons to plan the new event at the same site.  Taylor said the park can comfortably hold about 7,000 people and around 15,000 maximum daily attendees, given that festival crowds ebb and flow and not all attendees are likely to be on the grounds at the same time. ""It's becoming too big for the site we are in,"" said Taylor, adding he also has some reservations about the type of crowd the event could draw. ""We haven't seen the lineup yet. One of the concerns is that it might change the demographic,"" said the mayor, referring to those who attended CannaFest as ""quite quiet"" fans of music he called ""boomer rock"". Taylor said a larger, younger crowd would mean the festival may need to factor in additional medical attendants and extra policing. During his on-air announcement, Simmons also said there would be no curfew at the festival and musical acts could take the stage at anytime. But Taylor ruled that out. ""We have curfews, we have expectations and bylaws so I think that that is a bit of a misspeak,"" the mayor said.

""We are a free enterprise community and I don't think there are too many people would really support us clamping down on the success that this might bring,"" said Taylor. In the past, Varabioff has made generous donations to local charities, and Simmons said the pair would be contributing to local charities focused on child care and supporting single mothers. The festival also plans to employ casual labour. Taylor plans to support the event as best he can and if it comes to finding a new site in the area to accommodate the event, he will get public input before doing so. ""A lot of people are saying, let's work out the problems, let's not react and get frightened,"" he said. Simmons seems stoked to be coming to town. ""The town's welcoming everybody with open arms,"" said Simmons. ""You'll be shocked at how many cool folks are going up to Grand Forks."" According to Simmons, tickets to the festival are priced at $150 and the lineup will be announced online in the coming days.

85,Terence McKenna,2020-01-20T14:36:20.269Z,Internal Boeing messages detail how pressure to cut costs eroded company's renowned safety culture,"Internal messages and emails from Boeing paint a picture of a profit-focused management culture at the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, where pressure for short-term shareholder returns seems to have overwhelmed safety concerns. The revelations are just the latest in a parade of evidence pointing to the decade-long civil-war inside Boeing, pitting its famed ""safety culture"" against financial performance of the kind that pushes the stock price higher and provides big bonuses for senior executives. Longtime Boeing engineer Cynthia Cole, now retired, traces that conflict back to the company's amalgamation with rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997. ""McDonnell Douglas managers were more cutthroat, and it was all about the bottom line — cut those costs!"" she told CBC's The Fifth Estate. ""They didn't follow a good capitalist model. They followed greed and putting people in the upper echelon, putting their interest first above the workers and the product and just society as a whole."" Watch The Fifth Estate's full documentary, How Boeing crashed: The inside story of the 737 Max, Sunday at 9 p.m./9:30 p.m. in NFLD on CBC TV and CBC Gem. The messages showed a concerted effort by employees, under pressure from their managers, to deceive safety regulators from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in an effort to save money and improve short-term financial performance. Internal messages from Boeing employees have described the 737 Max as an airplane ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" The messages were released by the company earlier this month as it copes with congressional criticism and the worldwide grounding of 737 Max planes. ""I don't know how to fix these things … it's systemic,"" one employee wrote. ""It's culture. It's the fact that we have a senior leadership team that understands very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives."" All this came as Boeing faced greater competition from Airbus, which had designed a plane very similar to the 737 Max . Retired Boeing scientist Stan Sorscher agrees with engineer Cynthia Cole. ""In that business model, nobody says no. You're just going to follow the plan. That's the Walmart business model,"" he told The Fifth Estate. The compromise to safety intensified as deregulation became popular in Washington, D.C. The FAA budget was reduced, and much of the safety oversight was subcontracted to staff paid by Boeing. For longtime Boeing engineers and scientists, the conflict of interest was obvious. ""The downside is someone can threaten your position at work,"" said Cole. ""You play ball or else. The managers could tell you to keep your mouth shut or you lose your job."" Sorscher said it's not just salary at stake. ""It's your assignments. You get reassigned to another thing. You can be replaced by someone who is less capable of resisting pressure.""  In one striking email, Boeing's chief technical pilot Mark Forkner bragged about ""Jedi mind-tricking regulators"" to convince them that no serious pilot training was required in the introduction of the 737 Max model.  That would save money for both Boeing and its airline customers. Boeing was so sure that pilot simulator-training wouldn't be required that it had promised Southwest Airlines a rebate of $1 million US per airplane if it was. The desire to avoid pilot training also led Boeing to conceal from pilots the existence of a 737 Max flight-control system called MCAS, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system.  MCAS was designed to push the plane nose-down to avoid a stall in certain conditions. It has been blamed for the October 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia that killed 189 people and the March 10, 2019, crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in which 157 died, including 18 Canadians. The system was added to the plane to make it handle more like previous 737 models with smaller engines.  Boeing has been struggling to correct the MCAS system since the last crash, but problems reportedly kept appearing, including some beyond the original software flaws. WATCH | A Boeing 737 simulation shows how MCAS doomed the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610: In December, a leaked email showed that a Transport Canada official suggested simply removing the system from the plane. Pilots would then have to be trained to handle the aircraft without it. Two weeks ago, Boeing finally conceded that pilot simulator-training would be required to return the grounded 737 Max to service. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, is a lonely voice in Washington trying to pressure the U.S. government to rebuild the FAA and re-regulate Boeing, but he can't find a single Republican senator to co-sponsor his bill to do so. Boeing has spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to politicians. ""Well, the system is broken right now,"" Blumenthal told The Fifth Estate, ""because the FAA has to be changed in its culture. It has to end outsourcing, end a system that, in effect, puts the fox in charge of the henhouse and puts safety second, rather than first."" ""The system isn't broken,"" new FAA administrator Steven Dickson said when he appeared before the U.S. Congress in December. He insists the FAA is committed to safety and will be fully satisfied before allowing the 737 Max back into the air. WATCH | Cynthia Cole and Stan Sorscher describe how Boeing operated internally: At the climax of the hearing, however, he had trouble explaining what was done about an internal FAA study showing that there would be over 15 crashes of 737 Max aircraft with 2,920 likely fatalities if the MCAS system was not fixed. That study was completed over three months before the Ethiopian airliner crashed. In his appearances before Congress, then-Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg couldn't explain other internal documents that showed the company was aware long before either crash of the flaws in the MCAS system that lead to the tragedies. One engineering study showed that pilots would have only four seconds to recognize a problem with the flight-control system, and only 10 seconds to respond to it, otherwise there would be a ""catastrophic"" crash. It turns out the Indonesian pilots didn't even know the MCAS system was on the aircraft, and so would be unlikely to recognize a problem with it. Though the FAA issued a warning about the flight control problem that could cause ""impact with terrain,"" the Ethiopian Flight 302 pilots took 35 seconds to recognize the problem and try to correct it. By that time, the plane was in a fatal dive. All the internal warnings made it that much more astonishing that Muilenburg spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump after the second crash and assured him any production pause would be temporary. The fleet was only grounded in the United States three days later, after authorities in China, Europe and Canada had already taken action. Muilenburg has now been fired, walking away with a $62-million US ($81-million Cdn) settlement. The company will likely face severe fines. And there is a U.S. Justice Department investigation of Boeing's relationship with the FAA, but few expect any corporate executives to go to jail. ""I think that all these people in these upper echelons are too related and too intertwined,"" said Cole. ""I don't think they're going to find anything against one of their own. You know, people have died. They've got families, they've got lives that they didn't get to live, and for Boeing to pay a fine or to pay millions or whatever that is, where's the justice?""

86,Isabella Zavarise,2020-01-22T22:05:48.609Z,"Charlottetown parkade expanding, but spots already spoken for","A parkade in Charlottetown will be expanding soon, but the company that manages the lot says those new spots are already spoken for. Construction is supposed to finish in June 2020, adding 100 spots to the Fitzroy parkade.  Ron Waite, general manager of the Charlottetown Area Development Corporation, said most of the spots have been reserved for developer Homburg International, which signed a contract with the city to accommodate the company's business tenants.  ""They paid over a million dollars … to build their project to ensure that there would be parking available for them,"" he said. Waite said the expansion at the Fitzroy parkade includes an addition that will extend onto Kent Street and a reconfiguration of the stalls, which he said will allow for more spaces. But Waite said even with the added stalls, many people are still going to be on the wait-list for monthly parking.  Waite said the three parkades the CADC manages downtown all have waiting lists, with some people waiting up to 10 years for a stall.  ""There's very little turnover in the parkade. 60 per cent of the parkade is monthly parkers. The other 40 per cent are for transient or daily — people that come in for short periods of time,"" he said. Waite said some parkades have stopped adding names to their wait-lists.  ""It makes no sense to put somebody on the wait-list in the Queen parkade where people have been on there for years,"" he said.  ""You're providing false hope by just putting them on the list."" Sam MacDonald recently moved into an apartment downtown that didn't come with a parking spot. MacDonald said he and his partner couldn't find anything close by and had to settle on a spot at a bed and breakfast.  ""We contacted everywhere we could think of. Nowhere has any spots. So we ended up having to crowdsource to even find a spot that's still about five, six blocks away,"" he said. He said the lack of available stalls could affect people in other ways as well.  ""I think that this is really going to impact people living in the downtown core moving here if they need to be close to their work, such as myself,"" he said. Steve Bellamy, CEO at the Confederation Centre, said finding parking downtown can be difficult for the hundreds of staff that work at the centre.  ""We employ between 100 and 200 people in the winter and in the summer that number grows to around 400,"" he said. ""So certainly parking for our employees can be challenging. The parkades though provide some relief, but they're even not enough with regular business downtown."" Waite said he regularly hears about these issues, and the CADC is working with the city to come up with long-term solutions. ""It's a huge undertaking because you have to consult so many people and clearly it's a combination of what's the long-term demand and what's the price point people are prepared to pay,"" he said. Charlottetown CAO Peter Kelly said the city is looking at a range of options to create more parking, from building a new parkade, to working with private-sector stakeholders on making other parking spaces available.  The cost of one spot at the Queen, Pownal and Fitzroy parkades is $100 per month before tax — something Waite said is underpriced compared to other municipalities in the region.  ""The city actually subsidizes parking to a certain extent so it's never pleasant to say the parking should cost more,"" he said. ""And that in itself I think would drive down the demand a little bit. But if you want to add capacity, it's a very significant cost."" He said the project will cost just under $3 million, with the city contributing approximately $500,000 to the project. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-fitzroy-parkade-expansion-2020-1.5435145,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-strategic-parking-plan-for-downtown-charlottetown-in-the-works-1.5263391 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063,N/A

88,Julia Page,2020-01-22T10:30:00.827Z,"Sherbrooke nurse suspended for complaining about working conditions in private online chat group, says union","The union that represents health care workers in the Eastern Townships says employees who don't respect ""a code of silence"" within the workplace risk facing disciplinary measures. The regional health agency, the CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS, suspended a nurse after she complained about working conditions on a Facebook Messenger group chat with co-workers, according to the Syndicat des professionnels en soin des Cantons de l'Est. President Sophie Séguin said the local health board should listen to employees' concerns instead of punishing them for speaking out. Séguin said the nurse, who asked the union to preserve her anonymity, created a chat group with some colleagues last December and reported ""well-known issues"" within the health network. One of her co-workers likely shared the content of those messages with administrators, said Séguin. The nurse was then suspended for one month. During the same period, another nurse, Jean-Sébastien Blais, was also suspended for three weeks after he published a public message on Facebook describing a lack of resources for mental health services in the region. The union has filed grievances in both cases. ""What we want to denounce is the Omertà"" within the region's public health board, said Séguin.  She said employees feel the need to speak out publicly because management ""doesn't move fast enough to solve the problems"" that exist in certain sectors, she said. ""There is no Omertà within our establishment,"" a spokesperson for the CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS responded. Geneviève Lemay said the board cannot comment on individual situations regarding employees. However, in an emailed statement to CBC News, Lemay said ""staff members entirely have the right to express themselves on social media regarding their working conditions and work environment, without exposing themselves to the risk of disciplinary measures."" If ""disciplinary measures are taken, it is because the comments made do not respect the rules and regulations that apply in our establishment,"" she said — for example, the health agency's policy on harassment and its rules on social media usage. The office of Health Minister Danielle McCann said personnel issues are confidential but said the minister spoke with CIUSSS officials about these kinds of situations and called any ""code of silence"" ""unacceptable."" Séguin said the union fears this kind of precedent will lead to workers not coming forward when problems surface. ""If people are afraid of speaking out and no longer want to give their opinion, how will we find solutions to these problems?"" she asked. The union will be holding a meeting with management at the end of January to address some of these issues. The professional order representing Quebec nurses said it is important that overworked health care workers go to the right place with their concerns. ""If the workflow doesn't allow nurses to provide adequate care, they should turn to their internal nursing committees to share their opinions,"" said the order's president, Luc Mathieu. Sophie Brochu, a Montreal lawyer who specializes in labour relations, said this kind of situation is happening more and more often in the workplace, because people ""assume Facebook is not in the public domain and is their own space to communicate with their friends and family."" But whether the comments are made publicly or within a private platform, she said employees should know ""there is no such thing as privacy on Facebook."" For health care workers, balancing their obligations to their employer and respecting their own code of ethics ""can come into conflict."" ""They are in a very tight spot,"" Brochu said. Conversations that used to stay at the dinner table after a hard day's work can be traced back to an employee, she warned. ""You have a duty of loyalty to your employer. You cannot harm or damage their reputation in any time, and that applies everywhere.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sherbrooke-nurse-suspended-for-complaining-about-working-conditions-in-private-online-chat-group-says-union-1.5435041,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sherbrooke-nurse-social-post-1.4513475 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/emergency-room-overcrowding-1.5416577 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-s-maisonneuve-rosemont-hospital-1.5421540,N/A
89,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-22T23:59:26.096Z,"How virtual reality may dramatically change eye tests, research","A team at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax is looking at eye testing in a new way thanks to an experiment with virtual reality. The eye clinic works with patients ranging from infants to adults and depends on the subjective responses from patients to help with a diagnosis. That can make their work tricky, especially when small children are expected to undergo exams that can routinely run an hour long. Dr. Darren Oystreck, an orthopist at the hospital who also works with the health faculty at Dalhousie University, estimated his profession has used the same tests for six decades to check for disorders of binocular vision or eye alignment issues. ""You compare it to other areas of medicine where they've had amazing breakthroughs in technology in some of the things they can imagine now and the data they can collect is mind-boggling,"" he said. Oystreck uses equipment like flashlights, pictures and foggy goggles to conduct his work and keep the kids focused. Last year, his team decided it was time to look for new options. That's when they met Ryan Cameron, the CEO of Electric Puppets, a Halifax-based virtual reality company that specializes in children's programming. ""Everything [Oystreck] needed could be applied to many other areas, like brain injury research,"" he said. Cameron has adapted the old vision tests to a virtual reality program. For the team at the IWK eye clinic, the collaboration allows the eye doctors to alter settings and try a wider range of scenarios, all while recording the reaction of a patient's eyes. The hope is that for children in particular, it will lead to more accurate observations. ""They can calm down and relax and feel familiar with the environment quickly and then we can start to put them through the classic tests,"" said Oystreck. The program is being tested and studied at the hospital. The team needs to prove the results are just as accurate — if not more accurate — as the old tests, and they'll produce a peer-reviewed study. Steve Van Iderstine, a research associate at the IWK, said virtual reality systems weren't designed for medical use, but they have great applications for that. ""I'm hoping in a year from now we'll have good data to demonstrate that the virtual reality version of these tests has strong validity, then we'll be able to look forward to the more exciting environments that we can generate with the virtual reality,"" he said. Cameron said those environments, for example, could be a virtual circus where kids would have the impression they're playing a game, when in fact they're being tested. Van Iderstine said because virtual reality systems are commercially available, they're far cheaper than medical equipment. They also take up less space. He hopes headsets sized for small kids will soon be available. For Cameron and his company, this program is just the beginning. They have a patent pending on their work, and they're hoping that virtual reality could be used in the treatment of everything from physiotherapy to psychology.

90,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:54:08.421Z,U of S research could make greenhouses in the far north a possibility,"Imagine having sustainable, cost-efficient greenhouses in the far north growing fruits and vegetables. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are trying to make this a reality. ""We have an increasing population on one hand … and because of climate change we are experiencing environmental instability,"" said Nazanin Charchi, a PhD student in chemical engineering at the U of S. ""So it's important to develop a stable, sustainable and more importantly a predictable food supply."" Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron on the U of S campus to develop a method to remove the chemical ethylene from the air, to help make a greenhouse viable in harsh environments like Canada's north. ""Basically when the plants grow they produce ethylene,"" said U of S professor Jafar Soltan, who has worked for years in the area of treating polluted air and is overseeing Charchi's work. Soltan said ethylene works like a growth hormone. ""For adults growth hormones are good, but we don't want to give hormones to a six-year-old because they hit puberty sooner than they are supposed to. The same with plants."" In warm climates, excessive ethylene can easily be removed by opening the windows. That's not an option in colder, harsher areas. If you could somehow remove the excess ethylene without opening a window during cold winters, self-contained greenhouses become more cost efficient and sustainable. And that's where Charchi's research comes in. Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron to develop a method, or catalyst, to remove ethylene from greenhouses without needing outside air. ""The biggest impact of this research is on reducing energy consumption in those self-contained greenhouses,"" Soltan said. ""The technology that we have removes ethylene in the air inside the greenhouse so you do not need to bring in a lot of air from outside."" That offers the tantalizing prospect of making these self-contained very energy efficient. On top of that, Charchi said being able to remove the excess ethylene means greater longevity for fruits and vegetables that goes bad faster because of ethylene. ""This technology could make greenhouses more environmentally sustainable and less expensive to run. As a result, we could have more food grown in greenhouses in cold regions like Canada and more food security for our families,"" Soltan said. Charchi said they have been successful in being able to use a catalyst to remove ethylene in the lab. She said the next step is to partner with the air conditioning and Hvac industry to develop a commercial application for a  new generation of greenhouses.  Soltan said he foresees the technology being in the form of a small box, similar to a fresh air exchanger, that would be added to the air circulation system. ""It would just continuously get rid of the ethylene and reduce the need to bring in outside air,"" he said. The technology could be adapted to homes and other commercial buildings to reduce energy consumption in those places. When the air is circulating inside a building the technology would get rid of the solvents and smelly chemicals without having to bring in a lot of cold air. Soltan can even see the technology being used in space. ""If you want to grow something in space or travel to Mars or something you want to have a suitable environment for these plants to grow,"" he said. ""We are taking out these hormones that are produced by mature plants and can harm the baby plants. If you remove the hormone you can have a healthy environment for plants to grow, that can be a new way for specially conditioned greenhouses.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-greenhouses-far-north-1.5433905,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-indoor-air-quality-1.5427912,N/A

Nancy Li is travelling to the Chinese city of Guangzhou Wednesday night as the SARS-like coronavirus spreads and health officials in several places expand their enhanced checks.     ""This is the first time I go back in five years, that's why it's particularly important for me to go,"" Li told CBC News.  ""I am stocking up the face masks and … hand sanitizer and gloves.""  The coronavirus strain, previously unknown to scientists, was thought to have emerged from an animal market in the central city of Wuhan, with cases now detected as far away as the United States. The World Health Organization says it will decide on Thursday whether to declare a global emergency. Wuhan is closing its transport networks and advising citizens not to leave the city, Chinese state media reported.  ""For Lunar New Year, the human flow is out of Guangzhou into the inland. People are leaving Guangzhou to Wuhan, not the other way around,"" Li said.  ""If I was going to Wuhan I might really, like, reconsider this trip. There will be less people in Guangzhou this time of the year."" Li said she will be in China for 10 days and is more concerned about going through airports, given the number of people passing through them, some of whom might have been to areas affected by the outbreak.  ""I will go home and just basically spend time with my grandma, that's OK,"" Li said.  ""I'm worried about the airport and stuff.""  There is no confirmed case of the coronavirus in Canada but Li is also concerned that there might be intense screening in place by the time she returns to Toronto. For those heading back to Canada after the celebrations, Dr. Eileen de Villa, medical officer of health for the City of Toronto, said her first advice to those who are unwell is to avoid contact with other people.  ""Keep your illness to yourself,"" de Villa said on CBC Radio's Metro Morning.  ""If, however, you are feeling unwell enough that you feel you need medical attention, then do seek that medical attention,"" she added.  ""But make sure that you tell your health-care provider, one, of your symptoms; and, two, of any travel history, so that that can be taken into consideration both in terms of diagnosing what you might have and in terms of infection control and prevention measures."" She said the authorities are also on high alert and are making preparations in the event the coronavirus comes to Canada.  ""I think we always thought that there might be some possibility. We have a disease entity that we know had shown some degree of human-to-human transmission. How quickly, how readily it goes from human-to-human is still being established,"" de Villa said.  ""In a pretty mobile population, particularly here in Canada in cities like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, we see quite a bit of international travel, so I'm not particularly surprised to see some degree of movement of this virus and its emergence in the United States.""  At the same time, de Villa said Toronto has had its share of experience dealing with disease outbreaks.  ""I think what's really important in our case in Toronto, given that we've had so much experience — we've had the experience of SARS, … pandemic influenza in 2009, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012 — we've had lots of experience dealing with this kind of situation, so we feel that we've learned the lessons from those and are prepared to put those lessons into action."" Meanwhile, on Wednesday afternoon, Health Minister Christine Elliott said while the risks posed by the new coronavirus to Ontarians remain low, the province is actively monitoring and is ready to respond. Speaking at a news conference, Elliott said she briefed Premier Doug Ford and her cabinet colleagues earlier in the day on the province's efforts to monitor the disease and the state of readiness to respond.  ""At that meeting our government approved new actions to strengthen the ministry's ability to monitor any coronavirus cases by adding novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under the province's public health legislation,"" Elliott said.  ""Now physicians, hospitals and other health-care facilities will be required to report a suspected or confirmed case of the new coronavirus to their local medical officer of health. ""The local public health unit can then quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection,"" Elliott added.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-health-emergency-declaration-1.5436518 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,N/A

94,Shane Magee,2020-01-21T20:40:20.649Z,"Labour board says attempt to lure nurses to Restigouche Hospital Centre failed, violated law","New Brunswick's labour board has ruled a bonus meant to attract more nurses to work at the troubled Restigouche Hospital Centre violated a provincial law and didn't work. Vitalité Health Network announced in September it would offer a five per cent pay premium to current and future nurses to work at the psychiatric facility in Campbellton. The staff vacancy rate at the centre, known as RHC, had climbed from 16 per cent in December 2018 to 40 per cent in July 2019. But a decision issued Tuesday states the bonus led to only one new nurse being hired, and adds that the employer admits the move had no measurable effect on recruitment. ""The situation at RHC in the summer of 2019 was one effectively created by the employer over a lengthy period of time,"" Elizabeth MacPherson, vice-chair of the labour board, stated in a 13-page decision issued Tuesday.  The bonus was meant to address challenges at the facility in northern New Brunswick that has come under scrutiny. The hospital was the subject of a provincial ombud report last year that found 'significant mistreatment' and inadequate care of patients linked to chronic understaffing. Days after the report was released in February 2019, Martin Michaud died by suicide at the hospital. Vitalité Health Network's internal investigation into the death of the 38-year-old resulted in a recommendation to continue recruiting staff at the psychiatric hospital so it can ensure an adequate ratio of personnel.  The employer, the Vitalité health authority and provincial Treasury Board, argued the bonus was necessary to quickly deal with the staff shortages after failing to agree with the union on a way to retain and attract staff.  The New Brunswick Nurses Union filed a complaint with the labour board, arguing the move was made unilaterally during contract talks in violation of the Public Service Labour Relations Act.  A hearing was held over several days last year. In December, MacPherson ordered the employer to halt violations of the law and resume collective bargaining with the union. MacPherson issued a written decision Tuesday. Paula Doucet, president of the union, said the decision speaks for itself.  ""The employer was in breach of the law,"" Doucet said.  MacPherson found the bonus violated a section of the law that forces the employer to ""freeze"" the terms of the collective agreement once a notice of bargaining is issued. The notice was issued in October 2018. The union argued that the move changed employee compensation, violating the freeze. The union had sought a province-wide recruitment and retention initiative. The employer argued it tried to reach an agreement with the union on attracting and retaining employees over the summer of 2019. When no agreement was reached, it went ahead with the bonus using an exception to the freeze for critical situations. But staff shortages were a continuing issue rather than one that required exceptional actions, the decision states.  ""To a large extent, the circumstances were due to a lack of planning that was fully within the employer's control,"" MacPherson wrote. MacPherson wrote that the employer had a duty to bargain in good faith, which included exploring all options available to address the issue. But, MacPherson said there was no evidence the employer ever asked the union for its proposal on province-wide recruitment and retention initiatives. MacPherson wrote that a party can't adopt a ""rigid, intransigent position and then claim that the other party's failure to agree to it constitutes an emergency."" CBC News requested interviews with Vitalité and the provincial government about the board's decision. Neither provided one.  ""We are complying with the arbitrators' decision and are assessing our options,"" Bruce Macfarlane, a spokesperson for the health department, said in a statement. Vitalité has maintained that the hospital is safe for patients. Witnesses for the employer testified during the labour board hearing they were concerned staff shortages over the summer could cause security risks for staff and patients Gisèle Beaulieu, Vitalité's vice-president of performance, quality and corporate services, testified that without nurses at the facility, it becomes effectively a lodging house or jail and there's no ability to provide treatment or care. About 60 per cent of the facility's patients have been sent there by court-order for mental health assessments, the decision states.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/labour-board-nurses-restigouche-hospital-1.5434448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nurses-bonus-restigouche-union-vitalite-labour-complaint-1.5314695 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/restigouche-staffing-ratios-1.5018422 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/charles-murray-restigouche-hospital-1.5009426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/restigouche-hospital-rti-appeal-1.5430541,N/A
95,Éric Grenier,2020-01-21T09:00:00.484Z,Not all lanes will lead Conservative leadership candidates to the finish line,"The Conservative Party leadership race is starting to take shape, but there are only so many paths to victory each candidate can take — and limited space in each of them. Some candidates have a better path forward than others. To date, no one has yet met the bar to be classified as a ""verified"" candidate by the Conservative Party. Among those who have publicly declared their intention to run, only former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu have a good shot of meeting the party's stringent qualification requirements. Ontario MPs Pierre Poilievre and Erin O'Toole are expected to enter the race soon, while the decision of former Quebec premier Jean Charest is reportedly imminent. Other candidates could come forward between now and the Feb. 27 deadline for entry ahead of the June 27 vote. Each of them will be looking to identify a lane that takes them to the leadership, cobbling together like-minded regional and ideological groupings within the party's membership that are large enough to elect a leader. These lanes are not always well-defined — and some candidates can blow them apart. Maxime Bernier, the runner-up in the 2017 leadership race, did not have particularly regionalized support. Holding a libertarian worldview, Bernier also defied the old split between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform, the two legacy parties. But Andrew Scheer's lane was to draw support from the rural parts of the country and a mix of members from across the spectrum, pulling both from moderates like O'Toole and Michael Chong and social conservatives like Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux. Scheer was able to attract support from both of the old wings of the party in part because Bernier was an unconventional candidate. The contours of the current roster of likely candidates, however, looks less unusual. The candidate with the steepest hill to climb is likely to be Gladu, who lacks what could be a decisive factor in such a short race: a high profile. The two-term Sarnia–Lambton MP may be able to build support from ridings in southwestern Ontario, but will have some work ahead of her to break through. The second-choice backing of her supporters, however, could prove a hot commodity by voting day. But how about the others? What are their most promising paths to victory? MacKay's path to the leadership looks the most obvious. He has a few things working in his favour. He has the aura of electability, with polls showing he is more likely than some other candidates to stack up well against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. His standing as the last leader of the defunct Progressive Conservatives makes him the natural heir to the support of more moderate, centrist members. His dutiful years of service in Stephen Harper's cabinet might also make him acceptable to the Harper wing of the party. MacKay will likely have a strong and unopposed regional base in Atlantic Canada. Though there are only 32 seats in the region — all seats across the country will be weighted equally in the Conservative voting system — running up the numbers in this one smaller region could pay more dividends than narrowly leading a crowded field in bigger regions. He is already showing some support in other parts of the country, with endorsements from B.C. MP Ed Fast and Alberta MP Blaine Calkins. MacKay has the potential for growth as candidates are eliminated from the ranked ballot, particularly candidates like Gladu, O'Toole and possibly Charest, if MacKay's lack of fluency in French is not seen as too big of an obstacle. He already seems to be fishing in O'Toole's pond — both Fast and Calkins endorsed O'Toole in 2017. The clearest path to 50 per cent is to be seen as the Harper candidate — the person who most closely embodies the continuation of the Harper model, both in governing style and in party management. This person has a strong base in Western Canada and among the old Reformers, but is also acceptable to Conservatives in places like the Greater Toronto Area. Poilievre has the best shot at that title — and that makes him a potentially formidable candidate. The Ottawa-area MP has a ready-made base in eastern Ontario. His bilingualism will give him a fair chance in Quebec. Born and raised in Alberta, he also has the best claim to being the Western candidate. His team includes Jenni Byrne, Harper's former campaign manager, signalling a tacit (if not necessarily exclusive) endorsement from that camp. He has potential for down-ballot growth from O'Toole, whose supporters swung to Scheer over Bernier in 2017. If Charest enters the race, Poilievre could also peel votes away from him among members who believe the next leader needs to be bilingual. But there are still some open questions when it comes to Poilievre. Having played the role of partisan attack dog for his party, members may not see Poilievre as electable in a general election. His recent statements in support of both same-sex marriage and abortion rights could exclude him from getting the social conservative support that was a key component of Scheer's victory. And the entry of another Western Canadian into the race could scupper Poilievre's hopes of support in that part of the country. The need for one candidate to take the Harper lane is both Poilievre's best chance and greatest vulnerability, as being pushed out of that lane would cost him his spot as a front-runner. It is not immediately obvious which lane is Charest's. His standing as a former PC leader (from 1993 to 1998) is shared with MacKay, who helped create the modern Conservative Party but doesn't carry the political taint (in party circles) of also having been leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, as Charest was from 1998 to 2012. He could claim electability thanks to his profile across the country, flawless bilingualism and experience running (and winning) election campaigns.  But his regional base is likely to be restricted, even in his home province. The areas of Quebec that backed the right-leaning ADQ and CAQ during the Charest years are unlikely to warmly welcome their former opponent. Charest also faces the prospect of an ""anybody but Charest"" campaign, which could severely limit his growth potential. While O'Toole has a path to the leadership, it could be occupied by other candidates. His best results in the last leadership race came in the Maritimes, a region that is more likely to back MacKay. Representing a riding in the Greater Toronto Area is an advantage — there are more seats there than in B.C., Alberta or Atlantic Canada — but that is likely to be a hotly contested part of the country. O'Toole did not show great strength in the GTA in 2017, placing first in only five ridings on the last ballot before he was eliminated. His relatively lower profile and lack of fluency in French chips away at his perceived electability. But he does have the potential to be a consensus candidate — one that is acceptable to the broadest swath of the Conservative membership, like Scheer in 2017. The problem for O'Toole, however, is that being everyone's second choice only matters if enough voters list you as their first. He might be able to pull significant support from Gladu, MacKay or Charest, but only if he finishes ahead of them. Much will depend on the final roster of candidates and how the race unfolds. It is early days. But the initial signals suggest MacKay and Poilievre have the most plausible paths to winning the leadership before anyone has taken their first steps.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-next-conservative-leadership-1.5400959 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A

Jackie Koehler joined the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday to share how she got involved with the film and what her role was. For her, she said, the journey technically started when she was about 13 years old, when she developed an interest in animation. ""I just kind of pursued it ever since.… Every year, you kind of get a little bit better, a little bit more knowledgeable"" Koehler said. ""Next thing you know, you're working at Disney."" She's since worked on big films including Ralph Breaks the Internet and The Book of Life. When it comes to Frozen 2, her job was to work on the very nitty-gritty details of how the characters move. Each movement is crafted ""from scratch,"" she explained. The animators review the script as voiced by the actors. They also take into consideration what the directors say they want out of each scene. ""Then we kind of take it from there,"" she said. That involves deciding how a character might cross a room, for example, or how they might pick up a glass, or the sorts of facial expressions they might have during various segments of dialogue. She was one of about 80 animators working on the film. When Elsa’s powers are overtaken by another force, Jackie Koehler, who animated the scene, collaborated with our Effects Designer, Dan Lund, to choreograph Elsa’s surprise. To support the story point, we changed the speed, color and direction of her magic as it is taken over. <a href=""https://t.co/RJwn7Jb0aJ"">pic.twitter.com/RJwn7Jb0aJ</a> Koehler said she could spend about two weeks for each four seconds or so of animation. ""Each shot is very personal,"" she said, adding the shot she worked on for the lullaby sequence at the beginning of the film took months. ""It's very labour intensive."" ""(The shots) kind of become your babies … but then you watch it in the movie and it goes by in a blink of an eye."" While the process is similar to older methods of working on an animated film, going frame by frame, as technology advances, it's a little bit easier. ""The computer allows us to do more iterations so we're able to sort of explore a little bit more what different acting choices might look like on screen,"" she said. There's also a dedicated room for animators to act out a scene and film themselves so they can transpose those movements to the character. ""We'll use that as a basis to ground our characters to make sure that they look and feel like they're living in a real world,"" she said. There's also are multiple other departments in other very specialized roles, like lighting, who will work on the same scenes, she said. ""It looks and feels like magic but it's really a lot of hard work and dedication to our craft,"" Koehler said.  Next up for the animator is Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon.

97,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-12-09T01:00:00.670Z,Car owner forced to replace engine twice within weeks despite safety recall,"A B.C. man says he's in ""disbelief"" after learning he'll have to swallow the cost of replacing his SUV's engine — not once, but twice, within weeks — despite the vehicle being part of a major recall that was issued before the breakdowns. And he's not the only one facing thousands of dollars in repair bills for vehicles under recall. In June, Rick Lingard's 2011 Hyundai Tucson's engine seized and died while he was driving down a major highway near Cranbrook, B.C. ""They showed me the engine after they took it out and there was a hole in it. It was destroyed,"" said Lingard, who lives in Nelson.  He paid more than $7,000 to replace it, opting for a used engine with 40,000 kilometres on it, through an independent mechanic, after a Hyundai dealership quoted him more than $10,000 for a new one. A few weeks later, it happened again. ""The same kind of high-pitched rattle-y sound … and then all the lights came on again and — boom! I was in disbelief,"" he told Go Public. Then, another twist: Just three days after the second catastrophic engine failure, Lingard got a recall notice describing the same problem. The recall was issued in February, but the notice didn't arrive in the mail until August. Lingard says no one at two Hyundai dealerships he'd contacted about his engine breakdowns mentioned anything about a recall. ""To me, it's just irresponsible to the core,"" he said. Transport Canada could easily fix the problem, according to one automotive consumer advocate, by forcing Hyundai to cover Lingard's costs. But the federal agency, says George Iny of the Automotive Protection Association, tends not to use the full extent of its powers.  The agency also has the power to force recalls — under changes made last year to the Motor Vehicle Safety Act — but has never used it.  ""Transport Canada is a bit like an out-of-shape person who just got a gold-plated membership to the gym. That doesn't automatically put you in shape,"" said Iny. ""Transport Canada needs to act more assertively."" After getting the recall notice, Lingard submitted his receipts to Hyundai Canada. It rejected the claim, saying his first engine failure was due to ""insufficient engine maintenance, not the recall"" because Lingard didn't do sufficiently frequent oil changes prior to 100,000 kilometres of driving, and didn't provide receipts for subsequent changes.  The company says he changed his oil every 20,000 kilometres instead of every 12,000 as required by the manual. After the warranty expired, Lingard says he stopped going to the dealership for oil changes.  Iny says using oil changes as a reason to deny claims is common but puzzling.  ""The fact that you didn't keep records of oil changes doesn't make you negligent. That's just an invention,"" Iny said. ""It's not a valid reason for refusing coverage.""  He says both Kia and its part-owner Hyundai have admitted, in some cases, that such engine failures stem from metallic debris left inside during the manufacturing process.  In those cases, ""whether you did oil changes or not,"" Iny said, ""the debris was already there."" Lingard's recall notice doesn't mention debris.  Hyundai Canada also denies responsibility for Lingard's second blown engine because, according to a spokesperson, the engine was not ""provided, installed or inspected by a Hyundai dealer."" When Go Public asked why his recall notice took months to arrive, and why no one at the company told Lingard about the recall, it didn't respond.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they, too, are being left out of the recall. Scott Wild and his wife Donna Stewart, of Cambridge, Ont., experienced the same dangerous breakdown as Lingard, when the engine of their 2013 Kia Sportage suddenly failed at high speeds on June 4. Their mechanic also found a hole had been blown in the side of the engine and it needed to be replaced. ""I said, 'You can't be serious … this vehicle has 140,000 kilometres on it and it's finally paid off,'"" Wild said. That's when the couple discovered there's a recall on the 2013 Kia Sportage, but their specific vehicle isn't covered. Kia told them their vehicle identification number was not listed under the recall.  ""It was really weird, "" said Wild. ""What happened to our vehicle is exactly the same as what happens to all the vehicles that are on the list."" Kia Canada told Go Public that the couple's vehicle had an MPI (""multi-point injection"") engine — and only those with GDI (""gasoline direct injection"") engines are part of the recalls.  What's the difference? When Go Public asked, the company didn't answer. But independent mechanic Chris Solodko, in Hamilton, told Go Public he's repaired dozens of both types and, in his opinion, their engine problems are almost identical. ""They all have the same noise, the same problem. One [type of engine] is running on a high pressure and the other one is running on a low pressure,"" he said.  Transport Canada told Go Public it has received 65 complaints of engine failures not covered by the Kia and Hyundai recalls since March and says it is investigating whether more vehicles should be added. Iny says they have to move faster. ""There is a pattern here. What we need of the carmakers is an open mind that the complaints that fall outside of the group are not just turned down but that they are looked into,"" he said. Wild and Stewart ended up selling their vehicle for parts, then joined one of at least four Canadian, engine-related class-action lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai. The lawsuits have not yet been certified by the courts.  Both Hyundai and Kia have been dogged with engine failure and fire complaints and lawsuits in Canada and the U.S. Hyundai and Kia have recalled almost 500,000 vehicles in Canada for engine-related defects since 2015, due to manufacturing debris that could cause the engines to fail. The problem can also cause fires. Millions of other vehicles have been recalled in the U.S. and, in October, the companies agreed to set aside $758 million US to settle related class-actions in the U.S. and South Korea, pending approval by the courts. Iny is hopeful a U.S. settlement might mean one is coming for drivers in Canada, but it could be a while before that happens — if at all. ""We would want total parity,"" he said. In the meantime, Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a safety-related problem with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Wild and Stewart have filed complaints with Transport Canada. They are waiting to see what the agency decides. ""Zero compassion. Zero empathy. Zero everything,"" Wild said about his interaction with Kia staff.

98,Anonymous,2020-01-23T12:58:26.566Z,From dirty roofs to flat wheels: 8 causes of LRT delays,"Members of Ottawa's transit commission assemble for a special meeting Thursday to discuss what's behind issues on the city's four-month-old Confederation Line.  The light-rail system has been thrown off schedule at least once each of the last eight days, the longest streak of disruptions to its schedule since its launch in late summer. This is the fourth straight day the system doesn't have enough trains to keep its schedule because of the number of trains out of service for repairs. Members of the transit commission plan to question officials with both OC Transpo and Rideau Transit Maintenance, the company contracted to maintain the LRT, about these recent problems. So far, OC Transpo has shared 14 different reasons why the LRT has had trouble running reliably and on time. Here's a look at eight of them: Malfunctioning doors were one of the first major issues. In October, repeated door jams prompted the city to look at how Rideau Transit Group installed the sensors to make sure they were calibrated properly. The city also ramped up communications to passengers not to force open doors. OC Transpo has pointed to door issues 15 times as the cause of LRT delays. A problem with a computer controlling one train caused big crowds to form at stations in October. Computer resets should happen quite quickly, the city said at the time. The delay prompted the city to look into why the on-board computer couldn't be rebooted faster. That's the only time OC Transpo has specifically said a computer failure was to blame. In November, the city cited central computer system problems for delays on the LRT. We don't yet know much about this issue. LRT builder has 'failed' residents, city manager says In the fall, the city said fibreglass covers protecting sensors from snow at track switches were an issue. The covers were then removed and maintenance workers were expected to increase the number of times snow was cleared from the sensors and monitor for build-up. On Saturday the city blamed snow, a lack of maintenance and a heater that was not working properly for switch issues at Blair station that caused a two-and-a-half hour delay.  On Sunday a switch at Blair malfunctioned again but it's not clear whether snow was the culprit.  Switch problems have been singled out as the cause of a Confederation Line issue nine times. Keeping train roofs clear of dirt and debris is proving to be a challenge for Rideau Transit Maintenance. Earlier in January the city blamed a buildup of gunk around the pantograph, the accordion-like apparatus on the roofs of LRT trains that connect to the power source, for two trains stopping on New Year's Eve. We still do not know how a lengthy power cable got pulled at down at St. Laurent station on Jan. 16, causing OC Transpo to stop running trains between Hurdman and Blair stations. Rideau Transit Maintenance has said it appears the wire got snagged on something as the train entered the station but the root cause is still under investigation.  The train affected by the broken cable had to undergo repairs and was pulled out of service, contributing to the train shortage this week.  When LRT train wheels don't turn, they drag. It's an issue known as wheel flats and it's something crews with Rideau Transit Maintenance are supposed to be keeping a close eye on. The city blamed wheel flats as the main reason OC Transpo couldn't run enough trains during rush hour this week. The chair of Ottawa's transit commission, Coun. Allan Hubley, said Tuesday he doesn't believe Rideau Transit Maintenance has been doing a thorough enough job watching for flats. A compressor fault was one of the reasons cited by the city this week for train shortages.  We have yet to receive more details about this problem.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/eight-problems-ottawa-light-rail-lrt-1.5436771,[],N/A
99,Anonymous,2020-01-22T12:16:32.755Z,Fewer LRT trains running again this morning,"Eleven trains will be operating during this morning's rush hour, says OC Transpo boss John Manconi.   This is the third day in a row the LRT system will run without enough trains to meet rider demand.  During rush hours, OC Transpo typically has 13 trains on the tracks, with 11 trains working during slower periods.  When all 13 are operational, a train arrives approximately every four minutes to pick up commuters. When only 11 trains run, that frequency drops to every five minutes. It's been a bumpy few days for OC Transpo. While Monday morning also only had 10 trains ferrying Ottawans, Tuesday morning had as few as eight. To help alleviate the crowds, the agency has been running ""Special"" route buses alongside its trains, which it plans to do again this morning.  Those go from Tunney's Pasture station straight to Slater and Albert streets, and from Hurdman station to the Mackenzie King Bridge near the NAC downtown in the morning. In the afternoon, they go straight from Albert and O'Connor streets (the World Exchange Plaza block) to Tunney's Pasture and Hurdman. They will run 7:30 to 9 a.m. and 3 to 5:30 p.m., like yesterday. Riders, one thing I haven't seen is an exact route these Special buses are taking between Tunney's/Hurdman and downtown. Is it basically mirroring where buses went before Oct. 6?  A special transit commission meeting is planned for Thursday, allowing the city to receive an update on the Confederation Line and bus service. Officials with both RTG and OC Transpo are expected to attend. This is the seventh straight day with an issue disrupting the schedule on the Confederation Line, the longest such streak since it launched.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lrt-delays-jan-23-1.5435708,[],N/A

Like others in her Millidgeville neighbourhood, she had been wondering for some time about what's happening with a vacant and crumbling 1960's era church property on nearby Millidge Avenue. The proposal, by a Guelph, Ontario-based numbered company, would see two, four-storey apartment buildings placed on the 1.9 acre lot at the intersection of Millidge and Daniel Avenue, less than a hundred metres from her child's school.  ""There is no space... on that piece of land for apartment buildings with 80 apartments,"" said Biryukova, who signed a joint letter of opposition with two of her Bellmanor Drive neighbours.  ""It will be like traffic jam road, we don't want our kids to walk through there."" City planning staff are recommending the development be approved, noting that, while the makeup of the community is mainly low to medium density residential, the Municipal Plan does allow for new housing development of higher density in such areas. Their report to the PAC says further that the property is located in a ""Suburban Intensification"" area. ""Intensification Areas are intended to develop with the highest concentration of land uses appropriate for their neighbourhoods, and they are the primary places for growth to proceed in a community,"" states the document. The developer could not be reached for comment Monday. The project is one of two, high density apartment building developments to be considered Tuesday by the city's Planning Advisory Committee. The developer is seeking approval for a municipal height map variance to allow placement of a building that will be about 25 metres tall. That's about 11 metres above what the height map for the Wentworth and Princess Street neighbourhood allows.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/high-density-planning-neighbours-traffic-noise-height-variance-1.5433624,[],N/A
101,Jean Laroche,2020-01-21T22:00:53.404Z,CBC you later! TV building coming down to make way for Halifax hospital expansion,"The Nova Scotia government has issued a tender to demolish the historic CBC building on Bell Road that has hosted popular national television programs like Don Messer's Jubilee, Street Cents and This Hour Has 22 Minutes. According to tender documents posted Tuesday, the company chosen to demolish the building can begin their work April 1. This means that 22 Minutes, which records in the building's studio, must move out by March 31. Stantec Consulting Limited conducted an extensive survey of the more than 63-year-old building to determine what hazardous materials might be present. The company's findings make up the bulk of the tender documents. Investigators examined almost every nook and cranny of the five-storey, almost 60,000 square-foot building and discovered, among other things, ""asbestos-containing materials, lead-containing paint, mercury-containing equipment, PCB-containing equipment and bird droppings."" The tender, which closes Feb. 6, says the successful bidder must remove and dispose of the material deemed hazardous in accordance with established regulations. Last year, the province said it had set aside $1.6 million for demolishing the building. In 2014, CBC Television, CBC Radio and CBC online moved to Chebucto Road in a renovated space that was formerly home to the Bay department store. The provincial government bought the Bell Road building and land from CBC in November 2017 for $4.5 million. Removing the CBC building will allow for expansion of the Queen Elizabeth Health Sciences Centre, which is located next door. A news release from the province said the new building will include: The work is part of the $2-billion Queen Elizabeth II hospital system's redevelopment. The project includes an outpatient centre to be built in the Bayers Lake Business Park, as well as expansions at the Dartmouth General Hospital and the Hants Community Hospital. The project will ultimately make way for the closure of aging and decrepit buildings on the Victoria General site.

102,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:11:35.418Z,Former Quebec premier Jean Charest will not run for Conservative leadership,"Former Progressive Conservative cabinet minister and Liberal premier of Quebec Jean Charest will not run for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada. ""I will not be a candidate. It is final,"" he told Radio-Canada's Patrice Roy in an interview broadcast this evening on ICI RDI. Watch the full French language interview with Charest here. Before Christmas, Charest told RDI that he was thinking of entering the race to succeed Andrew Scheer, who resigned as leader in December after failing to win the October federal election. ""I thought a lot. I consulted and, finally, I made the decision not to be a candidate,"" he said in French. ""The party has changed,"" he added. ""There are subjects on which, obviously, I have principles, like the environment, but also on social issues, upon which I took positions."" During the federal election, the Liberals managed to weaponize Scheer's past opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion and the fact that he had never marched in a Pride parade — raising doubts in the minds of some Canadians about his commitment to LGBTQ rights. Many Conservatives argued that the next leader would have to deliver a more moderate message on social issues for the party to be competitive in the next federal election. Charest said he weighed the impact of a leadership run on his family and his already busy work schedule. He also said that the rules governing the contest played a part in his decision. ""The rules of the leadership race are very strict. Basically, the rules were not written for an outside candidate. The deadlines are very tight, it does not give much time to recruit new members and to set up a national organization,"" he said in French. Former Conservative cabinet minister and Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day said Charest's decision not to run came as a bit of a surprise. Day said that Charest was in Vancouver on Friday making a presentation at a law firm with which Day is associated. After that presentation, he said, Charest gave every indication that he intended to enter the race. ""There were some very significant people there … and he was quite clear that he was pretty well in,"" said Day. ""I've heard as recently as today that one of the people that was helping to organize that meeting on Friday actually heard from him and he was still saying he was in. So yeah, I'm a bit surprised."" Over his long political career he served in Brian Mulroney's cabinet before taking on the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives when they were down to just two seats in the 1990s. He left the federal scene in 1998 to join the Quebec Liberal Party, eventually serving as premier between 2003 and 2012. For years now, Quebec's anti-corruption squad, known as UPAC, has been investigating the Quebec Liberal Party's financing during the Charest period. Sources previously have told Radio-Canada Charest was aware of the shadow that investigation could cast over his candidacy, but the former premier maintains he did nothing wrong. Last week, Charest's lawyer said he is innocent of any wrongdoing in political financing and Quebec's anti-corruption squad should immediately end its six-year investigation, which has not led to charges against Charest's friend, Marc Bibeau, or anyone else. ""Stop this investigation,"" said Michel Massicotte. ""Stop saying we are hiding something, or whatever. We have offered our full co-operation, but this co-operation does not seem to have been reciprocated."" Last week, Maclean's magazine columnist Paul Wells reported that former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper resigned from the board of the Conservative Fund Canada — the financial arm of the national party — so he could be more actively involved in the upcoming leadership race to succeed Scheer. The magazine, citing an unnamed source, said Charest sought Harper's endorsement in a December phone call but the former prime minister refused to give it.

104,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-25T01:00:00.884Z,More surgical items being left inside patients blamed on rushed operations,"Tracy-Ann Wallace says she'll never forget the sharp pain in her stomach and the putrid smell coming from inside her body after a partial hysterectomy. ""I was in constant pain and I had problems going to the bathroom,"" said Wallace, 47 who had the surgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in 2014, after developing uterine fibroids. The 47-year-old says her doctors told her the problems were part of routine healing, but as the weeks passed, the pain and smell got worse. Finally, a friend convinced Wallace to show up at her surgeon's waiting room, and just sit there until the doctor agreed to see her. When the surgeon finally examined Wallace, the problem was apparent and ""horrifying.""  ""She put her gloves on and reached in and took a glove and two sponges out of my body,"" said Wallace. As Go Public recently reported, the number of objects being left in patients after surgery in Canada has jumped 14 per cent over the last five years.  That's no accident, but a systemic problem caused by doctors and nurses being pressured to rush through surgeries, according to veteran surgical nurse Bev McLean.  McLean has spent more than half of her 33-year career in operating rooms, as a nurse, among other positions, and, most recently, reviewing operating room mistakes for legal cases. She says Wallace's story reminds her of a case she reviewed in 2010. In a rush to finish an operation, a surgeon grabbed a sponge from the instrument table after a nurse had finished counting medical devices to ensure all were accounted. The sponge was lost in the count and left inside the patient. It was only discovered after he developed a painful infection and required another surgery to be removed, says McLean. In an effort to reduce wait times and cut costs, many provinces cap funding for certain kinds of surgeries, no matter how complicated or what problems arise. At the same time, the provinces require hospitals to balance their budgets, resulting in a crackdown on overtime and adding to the pressure to rush through surgeries. ""There's a big push these days to be fast,"" McLean told Go Public, ""and that's part of the problem. The faster you go in any procedure, no matter how good you are as a team, there's always the risk that you're going to take a shortcut or that you might miss a step, or you're doing two steps at the same time."" The Canadian Nurses Association and the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada say they too see this as part of the problem. Asked what it's doing about the problem, Health Canada said in an email ""the practice of medicine"" is up to the provinces.  There are oversights and safety measures in place. Accreditation Canada, an independent agency that sets standards for publicly funded hospitals, made it mandatory in 2011 for surgical staff to count the devices — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — used after a procedure to ensure nothing is left behind. This kind of medical mistake is considered a ""never event,"" meaning there are enough safety measures in place that it should never happen. But despite that, it does. Alberta and Quebec have the highest rates of leaving foreign objects inside patients, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Both are above the national average of 9.8 such mistakes per 100,000 patients: Alberta at 12 and Quebec at 15 per 100,000 patients. A spokesperson for Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services tells Go Public, such ""omissions remain very rare,"" adding operating room staff need to be vigilant and follow best practices. Alberta Health Services recently finished a comprehensive review of what's causing these errors, and found the ""primary factors identified are distractions, incorrect surgical tool counts and challenges with surgical team dynamics,"" according to spokesperson Kerry Williamson. Williamson says there is no single, identifiable reason why Alberta's rates are higher, but that it's likely due to the province's good reporting system. In Ontario, hospitals are required to report to the Ministry of Health on their use of the instrument checklist — which has shown to ""reduce the rates of death and complications,"" according to ministry spokesperson David Jensen. The ministry noted the province's rate of left-behind medical devices is lower than the national average, but would not comment on whether the funding model or the pressure to balance hospital budgets is leading to rushed operations.  In some parts of Canada, including Toronto and Ottawa, evidence about medical errors is being gathered in operating rooms equipped with ""black box"" recorders, similar to those in airplanes, providing a window on what can go wrong. The boxes include cameras and microphones that monitor what's being said and done in operating rooms, analysis of which shows distractions like loud noises, irrelevant conversations and doors opening and closing may be leading to medical mistakes. The Toronto doctor behind the project, Teodor Grantcharov, has been testing the boxes for almost four years.  Noises distracted surgeons a median of 138 times per surgery according to findings released in June 2018.  Misplaced medical devices are part of the broader problem of ""preventable patient harm incidents"" — a category of mishaps that also includes hospital-acquired infections, blood clots and childbirth trauma.  Those mishaps are part of a ""silent epidemic,"" according to advocate Kathleen Finlay, founder of the Center for Patient Protection, an independent,Toronto-based group aimed at improving health care. ""People are being injured, permanently disabled and even dying … so the federal government needs to treat this as the public health-care crisis it is,"" said Finlay. And when it comes to such incidents, Finlay says the future looks grim, based on a 2017 report from the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, a not-for-profit health-care watchdog.  The report found more than 12 million Canadians in hospital and home-care settings will be harmed by the healthcare system over the next 30 years, costing the health-care system an additional $2.75 billion per year. Another 1.2 million people will lose their lives.  So what can be done? Finlay would like to see those black boxes routinely used in operating rooms across the country. She's also calling on the federal government to create an independent organization that would investigate hospital medical errors and wants Canada to implement a national hospital rating system, like those in the United States. She also wants to see provinces standardize what data is collected and reported about medical errors so Canadians have a clear picture of what's happening. ""They're very different from one province to the next,"" she says. ""So they're really not the kind of numbers that give you a full picture."" Tracy-Ann Wallace, the former patient, says she was shocked to learn how many patients have had the same — or similar — experiences to her own.

105,Shannon Flaman,2019-12-27T11:00:00.604Z,Don't pity my disability; it's not the same as being kind,"As someone with an external disability, I'd like people to know there's a line between kindness and pity. It's a realization I've come to after a lifetime of struggling with stuttering. Every single time my mouth opens, my disability is announced to the world. I've heard it all: ""spit it out,"" ""slow down,"" ""I can't understand you."" Drive-thrus are a challenge. When I talk on the phone, people think I'm cutting out. On many occasions, I've had people assume I'm drunk or disabled in other ways. These are just a few of the barriers I face every single day. I will continue to face them for the rest of my life. This is my reality. But it's not these barriers that get under my skin. I'm a smart, educated, ambitious woman, yet many people can't see past my disability. Don't get me wrong: I've never been bullied. It's actually the opposite – I'm repeatedly pitied. At least once a day, I can see pity in the eyes of someone I interact with. Take the gas attendant who's used to five-second exchanges. For me, the ""F"" in ""fill her up"" is 20 seconds and the ""R"" in ""regular"" another 20 more. I can see his expression change from confusion to panic to pity. Still, he just rolls with it, fills my tank and sends me on my way. The same can't be said for a woman who insisted on praying (quite loudly) over my head to God. She prayed pretty darn hard that God should take away my speech disability and fix my tongue. That situation was embarrassing and uncalled for. I didn't ask for her pity, nor did I ask for her prayers to ""fix"" me. Stuttering is the brain not connecting at the same pace as my tongue and lips. It also occurs because one side of my brain is stronger than the other. Do either of those sound like the end of the world? I think not. I don't pity myself and neither should you. We all have something ""wrong"" with us, whether it can be noticed by the naked eye or it's hidden inside of us. We all love to be shown kindness, but unless someone asks for pity, don't give it. Pity makes us feel less than or not enough. Over the past few years, social media has helped influence all of us to be kinder, to pay it forward. I love this movement and I think in general we are creating positive change with it. So, the next time you encounter someone different than you, rather than giving them an eye of pity, give them a big ole fist bump. The more characters and harmless differences in our cast on Earth, the better. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Speaking at an event today in Toronto, Omar Alghabra, the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, said fifteen families want their loved ones' remains to be repatriated. One body was returned yesterday, a second will arrive Wednesday and the government is in the process of repatriating another 13 victims, said the Liberal MP. Alghabra said about 61 citizens and permanent residents have been buried in Iran according to their families' wishes.  Canada has been demanding that Iran turn over the ""black box"" flight recorders from the aircraft, which contain information critical to the crash investigation. ""There's some progress but we remain vigilant,"" said Alghabra. ""We know families deserve an open, transparent and thorough investigation."" Alghabra also announced that the federal government will match donations made to the Canada Strong Campaign to support victims' families. Mohamad Fakih, president of Paramount Fine Foods and founder of the Fakih Foundation, launched the national campaign nine days ago with a goal of raising $1.5 million. So far, the campaign has raised close to $600,000 to help those affected when Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 flight, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Alghabra said the government will match funds up to $1.5 million and the federal Department of Public Safety will work with the campaign to decide how best to spend the money. Fifty-seven of those who died were Canadian citizens, 29 were permanent residents and dozens of others were travelling to Canada. The government is giving the families of the Canadians and permanent residents $25,000 per victim to help cover the cost of immediate needs, such as funeral arrangements and travel.

109,Raffy Boudjikanian,2019-12-03T00:32:26.160Z,Some Canadian schools see China's Confucius Institute as a handy teaching tool. Others reject it as propaganda,"After tying his sneaker shoelace, Laur An-Yochim jumps back to his feet.  Gym is his favourite class, and the fifth-grader does not intend to miss a moment of physical literacy consultant Stacey Hannay's instructions. ""What is this in Mandarin?"" Hannay asks, hopping around the basketball court inside Kildare School in Edmonton. The students yell the answer, then move along to a game that involves finding hidden trinkets underneath rows of plastic cups, following directions shouted in English and Mandarin.  Kildare is one of 14 schools in the Edmonton Public School Board's jurisdiction that takes part in programming offered by the Confucius Institute. That includes Mandarin classes but also other subjects taught in Mandarin, ranging from physical education to math. The Institute is partly funded by China's Ministry of Education and offers programming at elementary and high schools, as well as colleges and universities across Canada. China provides annual funding to run the programs as well as Chinese instructors who are are paid by China. In Edmonton's case, they work alongside the school's regular teachers to deliver language immersion programming. Much of Confucius Institute programming consists of classes in language and aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy. China says it helps operate more than 500 of them around the world. In Canada, eight colleges and universities and three school boards have signed agreements with the organization.  Some critics, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), accuse the Institute of political interference and censorship in some of its classes, but the EPSB says it hasn't experienced those problems and has had thousands of its students complete the program since it first struck an agreement with Beijing in 2007. For An-Yochim and other students, the immersion program means his Mandarin is as smooth as his English. He switches effortlessly between the two and says knowing one of the world's most widely spoken languages has allowed him to connect with his grandparents when he visits China annually. ""They say every year, 'Wow, how are you this tall? Or, 'Your Chinese is really good this year,'"" he said.  WATCH | Students at Kildare School in Edmonton test out their Mandarin: The Edmonton school board insists it carefully reviews teaching materials and has no concerns about controversial subjects getting suppressed in class. The board receives annual funding from China to run the program, and 10 EPSB delegates flew there to renew the deal last October at Beijing's expense. ""I needed to go to see what it is, what does this look like? Right? What is the value?"" said Trisha Estabrooks, the board's chairperson and a former CBC News journalist, who was part of the delegation, there for six days. ""I learned about the value that some of our principals in Edmonton Public see in having that partnership.""  Estabrooks does not believe her independence as a trustee was compromised by having the trip expenses covered by China.   ""Taxpayer dollars were not used,"" she said.  ""I'd be concerned about the optics if Alberta taxpayer dollars were used to pay for my trip to China. I would not have gone on that trip.""  But Kathleen Lowrey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Alberta, doesn't want her nine-year-old daughter anywhere near Confucius programs. ""We're inviting them into elementary schools that Canadian taxpayers have paid for,"" she said. ""It's important to separate Chinese culture and language and civilization from the Chinese state.""  Lowrey supports student exposure to Chinese culture, but she worries the country's government ""has very different values from Canada."" She cited the example of two Canadian citizens — Fan Wei and Robert Lloyd Schellenberg — who were sentenced to death in China for drug offences. Some schools that originally took on Confucius Institute programs have since severed their ties. In 2013, McMaster University in Hamilton ended its contract with the organization after a teacher, Sonia Zhao, left the Institute, citing discriminatory hiring practices over her membership in the Falun Gong religious group. The Toronto District School Board dropped out of a partnership before it got off the ground five years ago.  At the time, Concordia and McGill universities in Montreal told CBC they were approached by China but never signed up. McGill cited a lack of safeguards to ensure its academic freedoms. New Brunswick's Education Department, meanwhile, is opting out completely by 2022, calling the program ""Chinese propaganda."" A 2013 intelligence report by CSIS warned that Chinese leaders identified Confucius as ""an organization for spreading propaganda and building soft power"" and spoke of a ""perception that CIs do not allow discussion of topics that the Chinese government deems sensitive,"" such as the political situation in Tibet and Taiwan or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.  Other foreign-government funded institutions promoting culture and education operate in Canada, including Germany's Goethe Institute, Spain's Cervantes Institute and the British Council, but CSIS placed the Confucius Institute in a different category. ""Unlike the British Council, whose charter ensures that it is free from political interference, the CIs are closely linked to the Chinese part state,"" the report said. In 2014, the director of the Confucius Institute in Quebec told CBC she was visited by CSIS agents shortly after setting up shop in Montreal, and they only left her alone after she threatened to file a human-rights complaint. Determining exactly what kind of contracts are in place between Canadian schools and the Confucius Institute can be tricky.  CBC News reached out to eight higher-education institutions to find out about their agreements with China. Four of them didn't respond: The University of Waterloo, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina and Halifax's St. Mary's University disclosed that they renewed their contracts in 2016 but only Waterloo and the Saskatchewan schools provided copies to CBC News. St. Mary's asked CBC to fill out a freedom of information request. The Coquitlam School District in British Columbia and the Edmonton Public School Board provided copies of their agreements. The two boards' contracts specify that China's role will include providing a set amount of annual funding but don't spell out an amount other than a one-time ""start-up"" contribution of $150,000 in Coquitlam's case.  If Canadian educational institutions have to accept foreign funding, they should control the curriculum, said Gordon Houlden, a former diplomat with the Canadian government who has worked in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""If there isn't enough money available, it's very hard sometimes ... to say no,"" said Houlden, who now heads the China Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which is mostly funded by the province and receives no money from China. Houlden says young Canadians should continue learning about an important economic power like China, but the funding for any such education programs should come from local governments or school boards.  ""The 21st century will be, in my view, dominated by Asia,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/confucius-institute-schools-funding-1.5370858,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confucius-institute-programs-china-school-1.5259963 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/xi-jinping-global-ambition-1.5373557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-cbc-1.5372916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-power-belt-and-road-caribbean-jamaica-1.5374967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinas-power-editors-note-1.5373823,N/A
110,Ian Froese,2020-01-23T02:44:35.434Z,"Mounties in Manitoba, B.C. estimate their share of summer manhunt cost $1.5 million","Mounties in Manitoba and British Columbia spent about $1.5 million combined on last summer's hunt for two fugitives wanted for three B.C. killings. B.C. RCMP estimate they spent $750,000 to investigate the triple homicides committed by Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18. In an email to CBC, Sgt. Janelle Shoihet said the costs include the major crime investigation, the specialized support services, overtime and logistics.   Meanwhile, Manitoba RCMP spent less than $800,000 on the expansive search in the province's northern wilderness — a cheaper price tag than the province's top Mountie was banking on. ""I'll be honest with you, I was expecting about a million bucks, and that's kind of what I had in my mind,"" RCMP Assistant Commander Jane MacLatchy said in an interview.  ""That was the amount that I was willing to go to on this to get it done."" The military said Wednesday they were still finalizing their bill to deploy two aircraft and their personnel. The manhunt in Gillam, Man., which ended with the discovery of the suspects' bodies on Aug. 7, lasted around 16 days. In videos before McLeod and Schmegelsky killed themselves, the lifelong friends admitted to the murders of botanist Leonard Dyck, American Chynna Deese and her Australian boyfriend Lucas Fowler. Police descended on Gillam once officials realized a burned-out vehicle had been driven by the two suspects. Manitoba's top Mountie shared insights into the police hunt at a Winnipeg disaster management conference on Wednesday. By the end of the first week, she said RCMP believed the suspects either fled — which seemed improbable because there were no credible sightings outside the Gillam area — or had died. ""If they were out there, alive somewhere, we had no reason to believe the killings were going to stop."" MacLatchy said community members were a tremendous help, but at the same time, those same people, gripped by fear and overwhelmed by the international attention, needed support themselves. In hindsight, she wishes the RCMP was helping people to process what happened — not only after the manhunt, but during it. ""It's not a RCMP responsibility to bring in resources for mental health,"" MacLatchy said, ""but I certainly would have liked to facilitate or help the community get the supports they needed. She also said the RCMP should have had media spokespeople on site in Gillam to handle questions. MacLatchy added police was fortunate to have a Manitoba Hydro generating station in the Gillam area to serve as accommodations for their members. She credited the community for their guidance and said the RCMP would hold appreciation dinners in the Gillam area and Winnipeg to thank all individuals for their help. ""I am so thankful to this day that we were successful in that search, because imagine if we hadn't found them,"" she said. ""The people of Gillam, the people in that whole northern Manitoba area … would still be afraid of who's walking around in the woods and they'd still be locking their doors — some of them probably still are."" Gillam Mayor Dwayne Forman told the conference the worry among residents persists. When one man realized the suspects were spotted nearby, he started sleeping on his couch at home with a gun nearby.  ""He no longer sleeps with a gun, but he still cannot sleep in the bed. He still needs to be in the living room to protect his family,"" Forman said. ""The emotions are still there."" The cost of the manhunt to the Manitoba RCMP is still being finalized, but it's ""expected to be well under $800,000,"" spokesperson Robert Cyrenne said in an email. Significant expenses include overtime costs and backfilling the positions of employees sent to the Gillam area, MacLatchy said. The RCMP paid Manitoba Hydro around $40,000 for overnight accommodations at a generating station and other needs. ""Even though we were putting a lot of resources on this thing, we were very cognizant that we were spending taxpayers' money,"" MacLatchy said. ""We wanted to make sure that we got the best bang for the buck."" Forman said he tried his best during the chaotic search to keep his community at ease, but said it was a ""huge lapse"" in judgment that it took 10 days to hold a community meeting. After his speech to the audience of municipal officials, one person approached a microphone at the Winnipeg ballroom.

111,Max Fawcett,2020-01-22T12:00:00.485Z,OPINION | Defeating Jason Kenney will require a progressive merger,"This column is an opinion from Max Fawcett, a freelance writer and the former editor of Alberta Oil magazine. Jason Kenney, it turns out, is not invincible.  After two years of bending the political universe to his will, that universe started to fight back in 2019. His much ballyhooed ""war room"" keeps finding new and exciting ways to shoot itself in the foot, small business confidence is faltering, and the cuts to health and education spending (and yes, they are cuts) have yet to really bite. An October poll showed support for the UCP dropping from 56 per cent to 44 per cent, with 21 per cent of the people who voted for the UCP in April expressing dissatisfaction with its performance. ""If this persists and these voters feel as though they were misled, it impacts trust and makes them awfully difficult to win back,"" ThinkHQ Public Affairs president Marc Henry told the Edmonton Journal. ""They thought there'd be a light at the end of the tunnel, but all they're seeing is more tunnel."" But if Mr. Kenney's progressive opponents are going to defeat him at the polls in the next election, they can't sit around and wait for his government to continue making mistakes. Instead, they'll have to do what Kenney did in the run-up to the last election: put aside their partisan differences and unite behind a single banner. That will mean someone putting an end to the Alberta Liberal Party, whose brand is only slightly less toxic in Alberta right now than the Communist Party of Canada's. The party's current leader, David Khan, finished fourth in his own riding of Calgary-Mountainview in 2019 (one that used to be a reliable Liberal stronghold), while the party itself received just 18,546 votes provincewide, less than one per cent of the popular vote. ""I don't know how much lower they could go,"" says Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University. ""Even in the 1980s, when they had zero seats, they didn't get one per cent of the vote."" The Alberta Party, meanwhile, doesn't seem to know what it stands for — or, right now, if anyone's willing to stand for it. And while the brand itself might have once had value, the fact that it's spent two elections trying to find itself has almost surely diminished that value in the minds of voters. With no leader, and no real excitement around finding someone to replace Stephen Mandel, it's fair to assume that 2019's performance could be its high-water mark. ""I actually feel bad for the Alberta Party,"" Bratt says, ""because they made huge strides in 2019. They ran candidates in every riding, they increased their fundraising, they participated in the leaders debate and they took their popular vote from two or three per cent to nine per cent. But the absence of that one seat makes a world of difference."" It's probably tempting to think that the banner progressives should be uniting behind is the orange one, since that's essentially what happened in both 2015 and 2019. But even so, the NDP wouldn't have been able to form government in 2015 without the split on the right between the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta and the Wildrose Party. Without that split in play, and with a four-year track record as a government that happens to coincide with a collapse in oil and gas prices, the NDP brand may not be in much better shape than the Liberal one. The fact that many Albertans blame the NDP for an economic downturn that was driven by huge changes in global oil and gas markets is neither fair nor rational, but nobody ever said politics was either of those things. After all, Donald Trump is president of the United States. That's why Alberta needs a new progressive alliance, one that can offer a home to everyone who doesn't support the current government's policies and personalities. And while a rebrand might seem to some New Democrats like an admission of defeat, it's often the shortest path to power. In addition to the UCP, there's the B.C. Liberal Party, which was effectively taken over by Social Credit members after their government was drubbed by the NDP in the 1991 provincial election. The B.C. Liberals would go on to govern for most of the 21st century before they were defeated in 2017 — and even then, they won the popular vote and the most seats. In Saskatchewan, meanwhile, the Progressive Conservative Party emerged from the ashes of the scandal-ridden Grant Devine era in 1997 as the Saskatchewan Party — and eventually formed government in 2007.  The Alberta NDP was far more scandal-proof in office than either of those two parties, but it still faces the same branding challenge that Alberta Liberals have struggled with for decades. And like those Liberals, that's less a result of anything they've done than the behaviour of their federal cousins. For example, the NDP held its national convention in Edmonton in 2016, and used the opportunity to undercut the only provincial NDP government in the country at the time. In an interview with the CBC's Peter Mansbridge, then-leader Tom Mulcair said he'd support a policy to keep Canada's oil in the ground if members passed it — a statement that only confirmed the suspicions many Albertans still had about the provincial NDP's attitude toward the oil and gas industry. Jagmeet Singh, the leader who replaced Mulcair, has been even more antagonistic toward Alberta's energy sector, pledging repeatedly (and impotently) to block the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. If the NDP brand and its association with federal leaders and policies is a bit of an albatross, though, its leader surely isn't. Rachel Notley remains a hugely popular politician in Alberta, one whose appeal and reach vastly exceeds that of her party. In the run-up to the last election, Notley consistently polled higher than the NDP itself — often by double-digits. And it's that popularity, particularly within the party, that makes political strategist Stephen Carter think she could be the one to convince them to take the kind of leap they'll almost certainly need in order to win the next election: a full break with the federal party and the birth of a new political vehicle in its place. ""I think the Alberta Democrats could be something that would be phenomenal,"" he says. Carter isn't convinced that there needs to be a formal merger between the various progressive parties in Alberta. ""The population won't split. If the population really wants to defeat Kenney, they will choose one horse and ride it to the finish line."" But, he says, they'll be far more likely to saddle up with a party that doesn't have any pre-existing baggage. And ironically, he thinks part of that baggage is the NDP's conspicuous swing to the centre when it was in government. ""I think they were a very responsible government, in terms of what they actually did. But they didn't give anybody any real reason to love them. You're not going to get anywhere by relaxing the craft brewing laws. They needed to do something more significant — that actually impacted regular human beings."" More importantly, he says, if the Alberta Democratic Party is to succeed, it would need to be willing to allow new voices at the decision-making tables: ""You never grow a political movement without reaching outside."" He remembers being approached to run the leadership campaign of Alison Redford and agreeing, provided a certain individual wasn't involved. That individual had the same condition for their own participation, but eventually the two met and realized they worked well together. ""If I'd been successful in my small-mindedness,"" Carter says, ""I never would have had that power and strength that comes from working with someone who mildly disagrees with you — or in some cases even moderately disagrees with you, and pushes you to a new position that is better and stronger. I would argue that was the problem with the NDP, and that remains the problem with the NDP."" Another problem is the temptation to believe that what happened in 2015 could happen again in 2023 — namely, a split of the conservative vote. But betting on a breakup of Jason Kenney's conservative coalition might be even more foolish than expecting him to lose outright, according to Duane Bratt. ""There are some early indications of splits within the UCP, but he's just such a force of nature, and a force of will, that he's got his hands over that,"" Bratt says. That means that if progressives want to win the next election, they'll have to put aside their misgivings and tribal loyalties and find a way to work together. That will require Alberta Liberals to finally let their beleaguered brand die. It will mean formalizing a divorce between Alberta's New Democrats and their federal cousins. And it will force the Alberta Party's members and donors to give up on their own new brand and endorse an even newer one. The alternative, of course, is a re-elected UCP government. Time will tell which option Alberta's progressives find more unpalatable.  This column is an opinion.

112,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2019-12-04T20:00:17.049Z,Plastic surgeon vows to fight potential class-action lawsuit alleging he filmed patients without consent,"UPDATE: Since the publication of this article, Dr. Martin Jugenburg has responded to CBC's request for comment. The article has been updated to reflect that response.  A Toronto plastic surgeon who could face a class-action lawsuit over allegations he breached the privacy rights of patients by recording them without their consent using surveillance cameras at his clinic said the suit is without merit and that he intends to vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Dr. Martin Jugenburg — known online as Dr. 6ix — is well-known on social media and was the focus of a Marketplace investigation last year that found security cameras in examination rooms at his clinic in the Fairmont Royal York hotel.  The petition to have the lawsuit certified as a class action was filed on behalf of former patients on Nov. 28 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It alleges that Jugenburg failed to act in the class members' best interests and that he placed his interests over theirs ""in pursuit of his own personal and commercial gain.""  J.C., a representative plaintiff in the case, went to Jugenburg's clinic for a breast lift consultation and said the behaviour alleged in the lawsuit is unacceptable.  ""I can't imagine how many other women out there don't even know this has gone on. No doctor should be able to get away with this type of behaviour.""   The statement of claim also alleges that Jugenburg's clinic posted images of patients on social media without their consent. The allegations have not been proven in court. In a Dec. 2 statement to CBC News, Jugenburg said patient privacy continues to be his highest priority. ""We believe this legal action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit,"" he said. Jugenburg said he has apologized to his patients for not posting visible signage alerting them to the security cameras in his clinic and said the footage was ""protected, secure, and auto-deleted itself after a time delay.""  If given the go-ahead by a judge, the class-action could represent patients who visited Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, between January 2012 and February 2019.   ""The heart of the lawsuit is really to get damages for women who had their trust abused by Dr. Jugenburg and who suffered some pretty serious mental health effects as a result of realizing that they were filmed without their consent,"" said Tina Yang, one of the lawyers involved in the case.  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record' The plaintiffs are seeking $50 million in damages, including aggravated damages, and $25 million in punitive damages, plus an amount to be determined for special damages. Lawyers say these numbers could change if the lawsuit is certified, the number of plaintiffs in the class is determined and their additional experiences are gathered.  Last year, while reporting undercover for a story on breast implants, Marketplace producers spotted security cameras in a closed-door examination room where patients are asked to undress, as well as in the waiting area. The small black-and-white devices were attached to the ceiling in the corners of the rooms. At least some of the cameras in these rooms were also recording audio. Following CBC's coverage, Jugenburg said in an email that he provided clear signs about security cameras and removed the cameras from examination rooms.  J.C., one of two representative plaintiffs on the statement of claim, had read Marketplace's article last year.   ""I remember I was walking through my basement reading it and then I ... literally fell onto the chair and I was overcome with humiliation."" J.C. visited Jugenburg's clinic in the summer of 2018. She said a nurse asked her to remove her top and bra so that photos of her breasts could be taken for her medical record with a hand-held camera, which is common practice.  At one point, J.C. also took off her pants so the nurse could examine her for a ""tummy tuck."" J.C said that at no point during her consultation did staff tell her about the additional security cameras in the room. ""The entire time I was there, it wasn't private,"" she said. At one point during the consultation, the nurse left the room to give J.C. and her friend who accompanied her to the appointment a moment to discuss their thoughts, J.C. said. ""That private conversation for starters wasn't private,"" she alleged. ""But [the nurse] knew it wasn't private.""  Both Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) launched investigations into Jugenburg's clinic following Marketplace's reports in December 2018. The commissioner's investigation found that the clinic's use of security cameras went against Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and that the clinic did not obtain patients' consent to film them with security cameras during appointments.  The commissioner reported that the clinic had a network of 24 security cameras that were recording 24 hours a day in examination rooms, the operating room, pre-operative room, reception areas, hallways, administrative offices, a computer workroom and the staff kitchen.  According to the commissioner's report, some cameras were first installed in 2012 but stopped working sometime that year. When the clinic expanded to two floors, the system was reset. These recordings began running in January 2017. The clinic said it shut off the cameras on Dec. 13, 2018.  The footage was available for Jugenburg to view live through a secure application on his phone. Footage from the security cameras was also stored on devices that were automatically overwritten with new footage approximately every 30 days, the report said. Jugenburg told the IPC that the cameras were installed for the security of the clinic, staff and patients and not for health-care purposes.  As part of the investigation, the clinic gave the IPC examples of when footage from the surveillance cameras was reviewed by staff. On two occasions, the footage was reviewed to verify statements made by staff to patients during consultations and on another occasion to review staff conduct.  In the spring of 2019, the college told Jugenburg to remove all cameras from rooms where patients undress and required that the clinic post clear signage alerting visitors to video surveillance.  WATCH: A plaintiff says security cameras were a huge violation of her privacy The clinic told the IPC that there are now only two security cameras — one at each of the two reception desks on both floors of the clinic. These cameras are only recording after office hours.  The clinic confirmed with the IPC that it destroyed all footage recorded prior to January 2019 except for footage that was seized by the college for its investigation.  ""Even though the cameras are no longer rolling, he still has to be held accountable for what he's done,"" said J.C.  Neither of the two representative plaintiffs know if the clinic shared photos of them on social media. ""We're alleging that there were photographs taken of patients that were then placed on social media without consent,"" said Kate Mazzucco, another lawyer involved in the claim.  The lawyers who launched the lawsuit said these allegations are in the statement of claim based on a pending case against Jugenburg with the CPSO that alleges Jugenburg engaged in ""disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct"" by allowing a film crew into a patient's surgery without her consent, touching her inappropriately and posting photos of her on social media without her consent.  When asked previously about these allegations, Jugenburg said they are ""denied and being defended."" These allegations, and allegations that Jugenburg used video recording devices at his clinic, will be addressed at a college disciplinary hearing in May 2020.  If you have a story you'd like to share, send it to caitlin.taylor@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239,https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/toronto-plastic-surgeon-marketplace-cameras-1.5137052 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-breast-implant-cameras-1.4944628,N/A

114,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:21:46.948Z,New virus could trigger travel sector woes akin to damage from SARS in 2003,"A deadly new virus that emerged in China is raising concerns beyond the public health sphere as experts warn about the potential economic cost of a global outbreak that is already drawing comparisons to the deadly SARS epidemic 17 years ago. Transportation and tourism companies have seen declines in share prices amid travel warnings and restrictions from governments around the world hoping to avoid a repeat of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which cost the Canadian economy an estimated $5.25 billion. At least 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected by the ailment called novel coronavirus, whose early cases are linked to a market in Wuhan in central China. The World Health Organization postponed until Thursday a decision on whether to declare an international emergency over the outbreak of the flu-like illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, including one case in the United States. ""The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering, in negative GDP terms, if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,"" Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp, said in a report. The travel sector has already started to feel the hit as shares of four North American airlines that fly to China, including Air Canada, fell on Tuesday amid growing anxiety about the viral infection. None of the airlines fly directly to Wuhan, but their Chinese partner airlines do, and some passengers transfer from a Chinese carrier to a Canadian one, offering the potential for the virus to spread here. Shares at the three biggest U.S. cruise lines have also fallen, with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. — which boasts a major Chinese presence — dropping more than four per cent this week. Analyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital pointed to the past for clues on the market volatility, propelled by ""an unknown level of potential disruption."" ""History suggests shares may be in for a rough ride,"" he said of airline and tourism stocks in a research note. He recalled jittery stock movements after the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as well as with H1N1 influenza in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. ""These larger-scale epidemics can have a more pronounced near-term impact. However, once a better understanding of the magnitude of the spread and severity was understood, stock prices recovered quite sharply in all three cases within months,"" he said. The extent of the epidemic so far still falls well short of the spread of SARS, a virus from the same family as coronavirus that spread from China to more than two dozen countries — including Canada. SARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide, killing close to 800, according to the World Health Organization. The disease sickened about 438 Canadian patients and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area. SARS cost the country $5.25 billion and about 28,000 jobs, according to a 2014 report by Kai Ostwald, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. The damage came in large part from fear-based shifts in consumer behaviour rather than higher medical expenditures, Ostwald said. ""Specifically, fear of contagion prompted widespread aversion behaviour, in which people significantly reduced activities that put them in close proximity with others. This included not only things like flying and eating in restaurants, but also activities like workplace and school attendance,"" he wrote. Hotels in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Canadian outbreak was centred, lost out on an estimated $39 million in revenues in April 2003 alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission. Less traffic through the city's Pearson airport spawned some $220 million in losses, according to the Conference Board of Canada. More than 800 bus tours were cancelled by the end of April — when the World Health Organization issued a one-week travel advisory for Toronto — with an economic loss of up to $6 million. Air Canada wouldn't speculate on the potential impact from coronavirus. In 2003 financial reports, it said passenger revenues decreased in part due to lower demand for travel resulting from the SARS crisis, particularly in the Pacific market that ""was severely adversely impacted with large reductions in traffic and capacity."" Chang Hoon Oh, a business professor at Simon Fraser University, warned against alarmist reactions to relatively small outbreaks. Canadian authorities are now more prepared for SARS-like viruses, he said. But he also noted that the number of annual visitors to Canada from China has shot up, growing by a factor of 10 since 2000 to 757,000 travellers in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. On Tuesday a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from China was diagnosed in the Seattle area, making the United States the sixth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, uncertainty over how deadly and transmittable the new virus may be has amplified concerns, especially on the cusp of the annual mass travel surrounding lunar New Year, which begins this week. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says she immediately contacted her counterparts at the provincial level upon hearing of three potential cases of the new virus that were investigated and ruled out. ""They in turn have notified their front line in terms of their health system,"" Tam said on a call with reporters Monday. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the SARS epidemic in anticipation of possible cases. Canadians are at low risk of contracting the illness, Tam said. Other precautionary measures have been introduced by the Public Health Agency of Canada, including screening processes at airports in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal to identify passengers travelling from Wuhan for assessment by Canada Border Services Agency officers, including a possible temperature check. Tour operators are alert, but aren't battening down the hatches just yet. ""Industry is monitoring the issue,"" said Tourism Industry Association of Canada spokeswoman Marcela Diaz in an email.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/coronavirus-economic-impact-1.5437393,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256,N/A
115,Robert Jones,2020-01-22T23:09:23.843Z,NB Power's smart meter plan gets major boost with critical endorsements,"Two key players who helped sink NB Power's application for smart meters two years ago told the Energy and Utilities Board they are satisfied the utility has sufficiently improved its proposal and individually offered critical endorsements of the new plan. ""Our own assessment is that even when tested, the business case advanced remains positive,"" said J.D. Irving Ltd. lawyer Christopher Stewart about NB Power's $92-million application to buy and deploy advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), including 360,000 smart meters. JDI and public intervener Heather Black both opposed a similar NB Power application two years ago and were each cited in the EUB's 2018 decision that rejected the project. But during closing arguments Wednesday wrapping up eight days of hearings into a renewed application, each said the utility had improved the quality of its proposal enough to warrant approval. ""Our criticisms in the last AMI proceeding were primarily centred on our view that the business case lacked detail on the primary benefits and lacked independent expert validation,"" said Stewart. ""NB Power has sufficiently addressed these perceived deficiencies in this application."" Black agreed and said she was satisfied by the entirety of the evidence and expert testimony that supported it. ""NB Power has proven that it has a positive business case,"" Black said. ""In any scenario that the evidence can bear, the business case is positive.""  NB Power considers the adoption of smart meters and the technology that supports them to be critical to its future and during the last two weeks put effort into presenting more convincing evidence for that position than it did in 2018.   The utility built a business case that showed the investment would make, not lose, money and it hired a string of experts to independently test its plans.    In a 94-minute closing address to the Energy and Utilities Board, NB Power lawyer John Furey methodically recapped the costs and benefits detailed in the business case supporting the AMI investment and tried to assure board members the utility would make the project work. ""It is in the best interest of NB Power, its customers and all stakeholders that the deployment of AMI is a success and that costs are contained within approved budgets and all benefits are achieved.""   Smart meters are capable of two-way communication with the utility, allowing them to be read remotely several times an hour rather than in person and manually once a month.    NB Power says that will generate 16 separate financial benefits in the short term that will more than pay for the $92 million upfront investment.    More importantly, it argues the meters will open up a variety of future innovations in pricing and service not possible without the technology, including time-varying rates where electricity can be priced at different amounts during different times of the day. During hearings, various interveners tested NB Power's budgets and projections for the project and although some weaknesses were found, none were large enough to kill the project a second time, according to Stewart. ""Broadly speaking, the quantified benefits asserted are within the realm of reasonableness and sufficiently supported by independent evidence,"" said Stewart. ""Costs are generally supported within a reasonable level of specificity and also supported by acceptable evidentiary foundation. ""The interveners and the utility might debate whether the precise quantification of a particular benefit should be x or y or whether an assumption is conservative as opposed to merely reasonable, but frankly that's the natural consequence of a proposal of this type.""  Endorsements were not unanimous. Individual interveners Gerald Bourque and Roger Richard each urged the EUB to reject the meters as unsafe.    Bourque said he considers the devices to be a fire hazard based on problems experienced in Saskatchewan several years ago.  Richard expressed concern about the long-term health effects of radio frequencies constantly emitted by the meters as they communicate data back to NB Power.   The utility has said consumers concerned about smart meters can refuse to accept them but will be billed for having their meters read manually at a cost estimated to be $4 per month. A decision from the EUB on the application is not expected for several weeks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meters-eub-hearings-1.5436874,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meter-eub-hearings-1.5434186 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-rate-meters-1.5430140,N/A

117,Erica Johnson,2019-09-30T00:00:00.921Z,"Toronto-area man out $2,775 after e-transfer fraudsters impersonate him on email","A Toronto-area contractor says it was ""pretty creepy"" to discover someone had hacked into his email and impersonated him — convincing customers of his family-owned granite countertop business to send thousands of dollars via e-transfer.  The fraudsters then stole the payments. ""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont. ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'"" Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.  Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.  ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there."" Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit. By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.  To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775. ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable."" Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.  Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite. Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit. ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good."" Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked — moving money from point A to point B — and that it was not going to investigate. ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess."" Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in a statement said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly."" Interac would not address Sinani's — or other customers' — concerns. Interac is a private company and Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders. Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what — if anything — it was doing to help trace the money, but in a statement said funds sent ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover."" York Regional Police are investigating.  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buy and share email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts. ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems, said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.  ""It's turning into an arms race."" Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites — from the local library to pizza delivery — and any one of those databases can get hacked. ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out."" Heywood says hackers then use bots — custom software — that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers. ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" — such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and — ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer."" So Interac's e-transfer system, he says, is only as secure as users' email and passwords. On the heels of a Go Public story published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank. ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.  ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system."" Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, says Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries. Vijayaraghavan, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfers directly from bank to bank — using only a bank code and a person's account number.  ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system."" Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authentication — a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address. Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work. ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks."" Popa, the cybersecurity expert, says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers — and the auto-deposit option — is if the government forces them.  He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place. ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians."" Sinani the contractor, says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.  But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient. ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""

118,Bryan Eneas,2020-01-20T11:00:00.695Z,Small-town Sask. film processor gets photo development requests from around the world,"Made to Last is a series of profiles of Regina-area artisans who have a passion and talent for hands-on jobs creating or repairing unique, high-quality pieces that require time and personal care. These arts stand to be lost in the age of mass production and planned obsolescence. Photos taken on film are meant to last but when they're forgotten about and sit undeveloped, especially for a long period of time, it gets trickier to recover those memories.  That's where Greg Miller, of Film Rescue International in Indian Head, Sask., steps in. ""It's great work. We've never got rich doing this work, but we've always been highly entertained,"" Miller said.  The stories customers tell him tend to be similar: a family member died, then they go through their belongings and old rolls of undeveloped film are discovered. Sometimes, the photos are ""a bit naughty"" or sexually explicit, but Miller said, for the most part, family members are excited to see them and rarely ask for those to be withheld in their final package of images. He noted the company is intensely private the images they process,  so they can't accidentally be leaked. Because regular film processing labs, which are increasingly rare, don't always have the right chemicals or materials to process those rolls of undeveloped film, this business 70 kilometres east of Regina, fills that niche.  When he started the business in 1999, Miller would get two or three phone calls a week from prospective customers.  That changed when he was put on Kodak's referral list; he then started to receive 20 to 30 calls a day. Miller said the company has worked with film dating as far back as the 1920s, and has done work with various law enforcement agencies, two presidential libraries, the Smithsonian Institution and for customers from around the world. ""It's opening time capsules for a living, basically,"" Miller said.  ""That's fun work. To this day, I love the job. I like getting up in the morning and seeing what we'll discover."" In particular, Miller said he enjoys working with old, high-quality photo negatives. He said they're similar to antiques, and he likes seeing how careful people were about taking photographs because they were expensive and more difficult to make. Miller said the company is working to future-proof his business. The company is relaunching its website soon, and it will be shining a light on the business's film scanning and archive digitization services as well as their film recovery work.  He said it's not always the most exciting work, but it's work that will keep the business alive as there becomes less and less old film to process.  ""We're always trying to innovate and do that type of work better than other people,"" Miller said.  Read other pieces from the Made to Last series:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-photo-film-recovery-digitization-1.5429355,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-luthier-1.5423298 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-bookbinding-1.5403310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-venice-tailors-1.5402224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-franks-shoe-repair-1.5403245,N/A

121,Kris Rowe,2019-12-27T09:00:00.675Z,The race to exascale is on — while Canada watches from the sidelines,"This column is an opinion by Kris Rowe, a computational scientist working to get science and engineering applications ready for the next generation of exascale supercomputers. Born and educated in Canada, he has worked at major Canadian and American Universities, as well as two U.S. national laboratories. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Some of the brightest minds from around the globe have been quietly working on technology that promises to turn the world on its head, but so far Canada has been watching from the sidelines. While it is unlikely that people will be huddled around their televisions to watch the power to these incredible machines being switched on, the scientific discoveries that follow the debut of exascale computers will change our daily lives in unimaginable ways. So what exactly is an exascale computer? It's a supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion billion calculations per second — or 1 exaflops. ""Exa"" is the metric system prefix for such grandiose numbers, and ""flops"" is an abbreviation of ""floating-point operations per second."" For comparison, my laptop computer is capable of about 124 gigaflops, or 124 billion calculations per second, which sounds fast. According to the TOP500 list, today's fastest supercomputer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit, which tops out at a measured 148.6 petaflops — about one million times faster than my laptop. However, Summit is a mere welterweight relative to an exascale supercomputer, which is more than 60 times faster. To put that speed in perspective, if you took all the calculations a modern laptop can perform in a single second, and instead did the arithmetic non-stop with pencil and paper at a rate of one calculation per second, it would take roughly 3,932 years to finish. In a single second, a supercomputer capable of 1 exaflops could do a series of calculations that would take about 31.7 billion years by hand. While colloquially a supercomputer is referred to as a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of servers — or compute nodes — connected by a dedicated high-speed network. You might assume that an exascale supercomputer could be built simply by using 60 times more compute nodes than today's fastest supercomputer; however, the cost, power consumption, and other constraints make this approach nearly impossible. Fortunately, computer scientists have an ace up their sleeves, known as a GPU accelerator. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the professional-grade cousins of the graphics card in your personal computer and are capable of performing arithmetic at a rate of several teraflops (ie. really, really fast). And a feasible route to exascale can be realized by not only making supercomputers larger but also denser. Sporting six extremely powerful GPUs per compute node, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora will follow this approach. Scheduled to come online in 2021, Aurora will be the first exascale supercomputer in North America — although the title of first in the world may go to China's Tianhe-3, which is slated to power up sometime in 2020. Several other machines in the U.S., China, Europe and Japan are scheduled to be brought to life soon after Aurora, using similar architectures What exactly does one do with all that computing power? Change the world, of course. Exascale supercomputers will allow researchers to tackle problems which were impossible to simulate using the previous generation of machines, due to the massive amounts of data and calculations involved. Small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) design, wind farm optimization and cancer drug discovery are just a few of the applications that are priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project. The outcomes of this project will have a broad impact and promise to fundamentally change society, both in the U.S. and abroad. So why isn't Canada building one? One reason is that exascale supercomputers come with a pretty steep sticker price. The contracts for the American machines are worth more than $500 million US each. On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU signed off on €1 billion for their own exascale supercomputer. While the U.S. and Europe have much larger populations, the annual per capita spending on large-scale computing projects demonstrates how much Canada is lagging in terms of investment. The U.S. DOE alone will spend close to $1 billion US on its national supercomputing facilities next year, a number which does not take into account spending by other federal organizations, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation. In comparison, Compute Canada — the national advanced research computing consortium providing supercomputing infrastructure to Canadian researchers — has a budget that is closer to $114 million Cdn. In its 2018 budget submission, Compute Canada clearly lays out what it will take to bring our country closer to the forefront of supercomputing on the world stage. Included is the need for increasing the annual national spending on advanced research computing infrastructure to an estimated $151 million — a 32 per cent increase from where it is now. Given cost of the American exascale supercomputers, this is likely a conservative estimate. However, the need for an exascale supercomputer in Canada does not seem to be on the radar of the decision-makers in the federal and provincial governments. Hanlon's razor would suggest that this is not due to some sinister plot by politicians to punish the nation's computer geeks; rather, our politicians likely don't fully understand the benefits of investing in the technology. For example, the recent announcement by the premiers of Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to collaborate on aggressively developing Canada's small modular reactor (SMR) technology failed to mention the need for advanced computing resources. In contrast, corresponding U.S. DOE projects explicitly state that they will require exascale computing resources to meet their objectives. Why should the Canadian government — and you — care? For the less altruistic, a benefit of supercomputing research is ""trickle-down electronics."" The quiet but persistent legacy of the space race is technology like the microwave oven found in most kitchens. Similarly, the technological advances necessary to achieve exascale computing will also lead to lower-cost and more energy-efficient laptops, improved high-definition computer graphics, and prevalent AI in our connected devices. But more importantly for Canada, how we invest our federal dollars says a lot about what we value as a nation. It's a statement about how we value the sciences. Do we want to attract world-class researchers to our universities? Do we want Canada to be a leader in climate research, renewable energy and medical advances? It's also a statement about how much we value Canadian businesses and innovation. The user-facility model of the U.S. DOE provides businesses with access to singular resources, which gives American companies a competitive advantage in the world marketplace. Compute Canada has a similar mandate, and given the large number of startup companies and emerging industries in Canada, we leave our economy on an unequal footing without significant investments in advanced computing infrastructure. Ultimately, supercomputers are apolitical: they can just as easily be used for oil exploration as wind farming. Their benefits can be applied across the economy and throughout society to develop new products and solve problems. At a time when Canada seems so divided, building an exascale computer is the kind of project we need to bring the country together.

122,Jacob Barker,2020-01-21T23:28:28.256Z,14 found guilty of civil contempt for protests at Muskrat Falls site,"Fourteen members of the Labrador Land Protectors group have been found guilty of breaking a court-ordered injunction at Muskrat Falls. Supreme Court Justice George Murphy handed his ruling down Monday via video link to those facing charges at the courthouse in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.  Murphy found them guilty of contempt of civil court for breaking an injunction put in place in October 2016 as protests at the gate of the controversial hydroelectric project reached a peak. Among its conditions, the injunction ordered people not to enter the work site or block access to it.  Some of the charges related to a five-day period during which a large group occupied the work site, while others were in  connection to other dates and in some cases multiple breaches of the injunction as well as breaches of undertakings.  ""The fact that there is and has been compliance with the Injunction for over two years and the need to promote Indigenous reconciliation are in my assessment relevant factors to be considered by the court when deciding whether to decline to impose a finding of contempt,"" Murphy wrote in a 50-page written judgment accompanying his verbal decision. ""However, in the circumstances of this case, when I balance those factors against the important societal goal of ensuring people understand the importance of compliance with court orders, I do not believe it can be said that to impose a contempt finding in any of these cases would 'work an injustice.'"" Kirk Lethbridge, found guilty of contempt of court, was among those who occupied the site in October 2016. He also brought a copy of the injunction to a press conference where it was torn up by NunatuKavut President Todd Russell. ""People are saying we lost today but this is not the loss that concerns me. We lost Muskrat Falls, and that's a lot deeper cut than what happened today,"" Lethbridge said after the hearing. ""We lost the historic beauty of Muskrat Falls. That's what we lost and that means a lot more to us than any of these court proceedings."" Sentencing recommendations will be heard Feb. 7.

123,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:34:55.925Z,Volkswagen ordered to pay $196.5M after pleading guilty to all Canadian emissions-cheating charges,"German automotive giant Volkswagen was ordered to pay a $196.5-million fine to the Canadian government after pleading guilty in a wide-ranging emissions-cheating scandal on Wednesday. Judge Enzo Rondinelli handed down the record-setting fine hours after the automaker formally pleaded guilty to all 60 charges it was facing, including admitting — among other acts — to secretly importing cars that violated polluting standards. The Crown and Volkswagen jointly suggested the penalty, which falls short of the maximum $265 million the company could have been forced to pay. But prosecutors said the penalty is more than 20 times higher than Canada's previous record environmental fine, a contention Rondinelli supported as he ushered in what he described as new standards for environmental accountability. ""The proposed fine here indicates that a new era of environmental protection is upon us,"" Rondinelli said in his decision. ""The proposed fine here would be the biggest fine imposed in Canada for an environmental infraction, by a wide margin."" The German automaker and the Crown submitted an agreed statement of facts in a Toronto court, acknowledging the company imported 128,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, along with 2,000 Porsches, that violated the standards. Reading from the statement, prosecutor Tom Lemon noted that certain supervisors and other employees at Volkswagen ""knew that VW was using software to cheat the U.S. testing process,"" the results of which are used by Canadian authorities. The federal government charged the auto giant last month with 58 counts of illegal importation under the Environmental Protection Act and two counts of providing misleading information. The penalty proposed by both sides was significantly higher than the $7.5 million fine incurred by a mining company in 2014. The money paid by Volkswagen would go to the Environmental Damages Fund, and both parties suggested distributing it to the provinces and territories based on how many affected vehicles were sold in each jurisdiction. The statement of facts notes that the automaker has already tried to make some amends in Canada. Volkswagen ""has devoted significant resources to, and undertaken extensive measures for, the remediation of the subject vehicles,"" Lemon read in court. ""VW settled Canadian consumer claims by providing compensation and benefits for emissions modification and buyback options to remediate the subject vehicles ... or remove them from the road."" Those settlements, according to the document, provided benefits ""of up to a potential maximum"" of $2.39 billion, and were completed by Aug. 31, 2019. But the company refused to admit any actual human or environmental harm caused by its pollution, saying only that the scheme had the potential to cause harm. In court last month, defence lawyers said they intended to plead guilty, but the resolution was delayed while three people sought to make victim-impact statements and provide other input. Rondinelli ruled against them, saying it's not their role to prosecute the company accused of harming them. Lemon said at the time he would gather victim impact statements and review them before submitting them to the court on Jan. 22, in line with the typical process. On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that the ""community impact statement"" turned in to them was not admissible in court. The seven-page document — accompanied by 520 pages of reference materials — was an attempt to enter untested expert testimony into the record, they said. Rondinelli accepted that argument. ""We are at a sentencing hearing, not a trial,"" he said. Volkswagen previously pleaded guilty in U.S. court to three felonies in 2017 and was fined $4.3 billion. German prosecutors fined the company  €1 billion euros in the emissions-cheating case in 2018.

124,Alana India Anderson,2020-01-13T21:39:43.390Z,Why a move to Canada makes sense for Prince Harry and Meghan,"This column is an opinion by Alana India Anderson, a British-Canadian entertainment journalist and editor currently living in London, U.K. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. In recent days, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been branded an ""ego-crazed"" leech, ""incredibly irritating,"" and ""insufferable"" by esteemed members of the British press. And yet they're shocked that she's made the decision, along with her husband Prince Harry, to leave the U.K. for North America.  On Monday, the Queen released a statement saying the Royal Family ""respect"" and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family, while remaining a valued part of the institution. ""It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the U.K.,"" it read.  Since the couple made their decision to ""step back"" from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family last Wednesday, the U.K. media has been thrown into a frenzy. How could they do this to the Queen? What does this new ""progressive role"" mean? Who will be paying for their security costs overseas?  But most importantly, why move to Canada? Having immigrated to Canada from London 20 years ago for a better quality of life, I know the appeal all too well. In fact, although I'm currently working in the media in the U.K., I still regularly visit the country that welcomed me and my family with open arms, so I'm well aware of the social and cultural differences. There's no doubt that Harry and Meghan would enjoy a relatively peaceful life if they relocate to Canada. Toronto is where Harry and Meghan started their relationship four years ago, and where she lived for several years while filming the TV series Suits. Besides familiarity, Canada offers a fresh sense of stress-free simplicity they are not afforded in the U.K. Not only is celebrity culture almost non-existent in Canada, but fascination with the Royal Family tends to take a far more friendly tone. In contrast, there's no escaping the paparazzi in places like London. While the U.K.'s reality TV stars relish the flashing bulbs of photographers, several celebrities will recall ""terrifying"" experiences of erratic driving and little to no privacy as photographers go to extreme lengths to get ""the shot."" This is because there is no governing body for paparazzi — it's a grey area. The paparazzi and tabloid culture prevalent in the U.K. is clearly something Harry is wary of. Last year, the Prince said that every camera flash ""takes him back"" to the tragedy of his mother's death in 1997, grief which he compared to a ""wound that festers."" And the media attention in Europe can be unrelenting. Kate Middleton and Prince William won £91,000 in damages in a French court verdict in 2017, for example, after topless paparazzi photographs of the Duchess were published in a French celebrity magazine. The couple said the incident was a ""serious breach of privacy."" It's telling that only one photograph emerged during Harry and Meghan's recent six-week Christmas holiday on Vancouver Island — an image they released on their own terms, showing Harry with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in front of a dazzling backdrop of water and mountains. Is it so wrong for Harry, who has not only grown up under the weight of media attention but also faced such tragedy in his life, to want some peace? After all, the couple who have put such a spotlight on mental health surely deserve to look after their own. Escaping the relentless pressure of media attention by itself isn't the only incentive for the family to leave the U.K.  Since their first meeting, Meghan's race has been the talking point of headlines adorning British tabloids. Toned-down prejudice has seen the Duchess described as having ""rich and exotic DNA"" and being ""almost straight out of Compton."" The fact that she makes mixed-race women, such as myself, feel more in-touch with their identity is merely overlooked. Despite 1.2 million people identifying as mixed-race in Britain, Meghan is often reduced to being an outsider. Meghan has openly expressed her struggle to adapt to British tabloid scrutiny, saying she ""tried to adopt"" the ""British sensibility of a stiff upper lip."" It's a struggle that now appears over, resulting in the U.K. losing a progressive and refreshing couple who are not only responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in tourism, retail and fashion, but also newspaper sales and website clicks. They wouldn't be the first members of the Royal Family to see the attraction of Canada. Speaking in Toronto in 2010, the Queen praised the ""vast, rich and varied"" country for ""inspiring its own and attracting many others."" And Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, resided in Canada from 1911 to 1916 and acted as hostess for her father, Prince Arthur, during his term as governor general. The Princess's portrait was even on the $1 banknote issued in 1917.  Of course, there's no guarantee the paparazzi wouldn't follow them, the way they did when Charles, Diana, William and Harry visited in 1991. But a move to Canada would likely mean at least a reduction in the media scrutiny of Harry, Meghan and Archie. And that spotlight is something Harry has tried to escape his entire life, a significant curiosity about his private life which he has admitted he has ""never been comfortable with."" And it could also see the Royal Family spread its wings and become an international brand in a country where, unlike the U.S., Harry and Meghan are less regarded as ""celebrities,"" but are undeniably extremely popular. Viewed from that perspective, Harry and Meghan relocating to Canada could be a win for their family — and the Royal Family.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harry-meghan-doc-media-1.5328618 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-harry-paparazzi-settlement-1.5138130 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5420966/royal-reporter-says-pressure-on-meghan-markle-is-typical-she-s-just-complained-more-1.5420972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025,N/A
125,Santiago Guzmán,2020-01-12T11:30:00.858Z,"I'm new to Canada, and here's why I'm terrified of falling on ice ","Picture this: you just finished grocery shopping for the week. Standing in front of the glass door that leads to a crowded parking lot in St. John's, you see a not-so-scary snowstorm coming before you.  Luckily, you're just a couple of metres away from the bus stop, so it shouldn't be that bad. You don't take the bus regularly because of its lack of efficiency — sometimes it's easier and faster to walk, instead of waiting for an extra half-hour. This time, the bus is your best bet. Plus, the bus will leave you almost in front of your door. Sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're trying to be positive. Although this is not your first winter in Newfoundland and you know how to deal with it, sometimes it's hard to keep yourself positive. Kudos to you. Now that you've made a plan, you put your groceries on the floor to prepare yourself to face this winter crusade: you pull out your mittens, put your warm hat on, cover your mouth and nose with your bulky scarf. You walk through the glass door.  You can feel the immediate change in temperature, and the wind. You start walking slowly, aware of the slippery street, balancing the grocery bags you're carrying. It seems like there is enough salt on the floor to protect you from sliding, and the bus stop is barely 60 metres away. Slip. Your right boot swiftly slides on an icy spot that the salt didn't cover. Miraculously, you juggle the grocery bags, as though you were on a tightrope above a hungry shark waiting for its prey to fall. You find your balance and stand still for a second. That was close! You let a laugh out, take a deep breath and try all over again. Slip. Crack.  Now you're sitting on the barely cleared sidewalk with all your groceries around you. No laughs this time. Instead, slow tears that freeze as they fall down your face. Your ankle. Despite the cold numbing your body, you can feel pain. Deep, sharp, acute pain. It's broken, you know it. In the distance, you see the bus arrive. Its passengers get out while some others hop on, and you're still on the ground in pain. No bus, no groceries, no laughs, but a broken ankle and the fear of having to go to the doctor. No, you're not afraid of needles, and prescriptions — you're afraid to have to pay fully for the medical service in the ER. You don't have health coverage. You really don't know why you're crying now, if it's the pain of your broken ankle or of depleting your minimum wage savings to pay the medical bills.  Unfortunately, the previous scenario is the fear of multiple immigrants in Newfoundland and Labrador. In order to be eligible for the provincial Medical Care Plan, you have to be a current resident of the province, and fall under one of these groups: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, international post-secondary student or international worker (with a valid work visa). It seems simple, but it's not. I put myself forward as a case study. I live in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to the Medical Care and Hospital Insurance Act, a resident is a person ""who is lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, makes his or her home in the province, and is ordinarily present in the province but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the province."" Since I was pursuing my studies here, I envisioned making Newfoundland and Labrador home.  So, emotionally speaking, I would argue that I was a resident even back then. Of course, my feelings could be debatable compared with the actual number of international students who decide to remain in the province. Therefore, as students, we're only given the credit of a temporary resident, because what will happen after we graduate? Nonetheless, after graduating, I decided to stay here. I moved from Corner Brook to St. John's and signed a lease in the house I'm currently renting. I think that's enough for me to become a resident.  I am not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (I have all the intention to become one when I can actually afford it), and I am no longer a post-secondary student — so these are three other categories I don't qualify for. OK, but I do have a valid work permit, so I take it that I'm considered as an international worker. Well, yes but no.  I have to be employed by a Newfoundland and Labrador-based company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for MCP. I'm a self-employed artist trying to make a living from what I came to study in Newfoundland and Labrador to begin with. Securing a full-time position in my field can be quite challenging, but that hasn't stopped me from finding continuous work in my field almost since I graduated last May. However, my contract work won't be considered as full-time employment. Immigration and career consultants have worked hard with me to find a solution. They've helped me look for and connected me with available resources in order for me to get an affordable health care plan. Have I been lucky? No. The answer I've always encountered is ""you're not eligible."" Like the character in the scenario above, I'm afraid to get injured because I wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills. I blamed myself in the beginning for not looking into this situation earlier. I truly thought that this was only happening to me. However, as I became more vocal about it, I found that fellow former international students who decided to reside in N.L. have struggled with this issue as well. Why haven't we found a solution? Why is there nothing in place to support the transition of these international graduates from students-to-workers in matters of health care? Here's a tip: if you're currently an international student, want to stay in this province, and find yourself reading this article, make sure to purchase insurance with your current insurance provider within 30 days of graduating.  I wish someone had told me, because I walk my days afraid of falling.

Pay increases have been a contentious issue for Revelstoke city council in recent months.  The idea was introduced last year by Coun. Cody Younker, who argued Revelstoke's salary structure for mayor and councillors was not in line with other similarly sized municipalities. ""If we expect our mayor to work full-time, and you ... want the mayor to be at all these meetings and chairing meetings with ministers, we need to pay appropriately,"" he said last November. If you live in B.C., here's how much your mayor and councillors make Council voted in favour of his motion to increase salaries. However, Cross argued for the need of a third-party review of remuneration ahead of any pay increases, and Coun. Mike Brooks-Hill introduced motions to defer the raises and to reduce the salary increases.   Those motions were struck down. On Tuesday, Coun. Cross again pressed for a third-party review and Sulz argued it was unnecessary. ""I firmly believe that going to a third party is not the way to do it,"" Sulz said. ""We have the ability to look at this in a constructive way. We've done that.""  After council rejected his motion, Cross said he could not work with colleagues ""who chose self-interest over the mission we were all elected to serve."" He announced his resignation effective as of Feb. 7. In an interview with CBC News, Cross said he lost a lot of sleep ahead of his decision to resign from council. ""For me it was really an ethical dilemma,"" he said. ""We all got elected knowing what we were getting into, and if we felt there should be change it should have been done effective with the next council. That's the only way you can maintain the public trust that you are not lining your own pockets."" Sulz said he was disappointed and a little surprised Cross resigned over the issue. ""A man has to make a decision based on how he feels,"" he said. Sulz stands by council's decision, saying a third-party review would have cost Revelstoke around $30,000.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/revelstoke-city-council-pay-raise-mayor-1.5436913,[],N/A
127,Shawn Jeffords,2020-01-21T23:57:56.001Z,"Public health restructuring should be negotiated, not forced, report states","Any merger of health units must be negotiated and not forced, public health officials in Peterborough, Ont., said Tuesday as they urged Premier Doug Ford's government to let communities drive service amalgamations. The recommendation is one of a series included in a discussion paper released Tuesday by the city's board of health at a rural municipalities' conference in Toronto. The board chairman of Peterborough Public Health said the agency wrote the report as the province conducts consultations on its plan to reduce the number of provincial health units from 34. ""As they try to determine the right number, that needs to come through conversation,"" Andy Mitchell said. ""It needs to come from the bottom up, from the communities."" Premier Doug Ford's government announced in the 2019 budget that it planned to begin a sweeping merger of public health units by 2020-2021, saying at the time it would strengthen the system. The government said it had conducted a review of the province's public health units and believed their structure did not allow for consistent service delivery. Ontario's public health units co-ordinate services including vaccination programs, infectious disease outbreak investigations, and restaurant inspections. The consolidation would mean that health units would serve larger geographic regions, which include communities with different needs. But Health Minister Christine Elliott appointed special adviser Jim Pine last fall to conduct consultations with municipalities who had warned that the amalgamation, coupled with changes to public health cost-sharing with the province, could jeopardize services and result in frontline staff layoffs. A spokeswoman for Elliott said Tuesday that consultations continue but the government intends to move forward with its plan to ""amalgamate certain units."" ""This work will be directly informed by feedback from Mr. Pine's consultations and, as such, it is too early to say how many units the province will establish or when amalgamation will start,"" Hayley Chazan said in a statement. Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, Peterborough's medical officer of health, said the local health board is encouraging the minister to build on established strengths of many public health units, including those in rural Ontario. ""Amalgamations of boards, particularly into regional, rather than local structures, threatens both the accountability and the responsiveness of public health governance,"" she said. The report does not oppose merging health units, but said that based on studies, the agencies should not serve populations greater than 500,000. Any new model must also take into account rural communities' ability to pay, it adds. ""Funding should be predictable and consider factors such as equity, population demographics and density, rural/urban mix,"" the report said, adding it should also ""increase to meet new demands."" Dr. Joyce Lock, the chief medical officer for Southwestern Public Health, said that agency was created in May 2018 as a result of a voluntary merger between two health units near London, Ont. The former Elgin-St. Thomas Public Health Unit and Oxford County Public Health Unit separately served 205,000 rural and small city residents. The agencies joined together to ensure they could continue to provide programing after multi-year funding increases below the rate of inflation, she said. ""Without longer-term efficiencies we would need to shutter some programs,"" she said. ""Our amalgamation has allowed us to pool our resources, become a stronger voice for rural public health and blend the best of our skills, talent, and knowledge."" Lock said their merger will save money over the long-term, but urged the province to take a ""thoughtfully planned, strategic, and well-funded"" view of the process. ""It takes dollars and time up-front to save dollars and time down the road,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-public-health-1.5435445,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/reconsider-public-health-restructuring-region-waterloo-1.5245480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lhin-management-jobs-cuts-1.5055191 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ontario-health-super-agency-private-health-care-funding-1.5039944 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-are-ontario-health-teams-doug-ford-government-1.5035750,N/A
128,Emily Chung,2020-01-20T14:47:38.887Z,"Goodbye, gas furnaces? Why electrification is the future of home heating","It's a stereotype, but it's true — Canada's winters are cold. And many of us stay toasty by burning fossil fuels such as natural gas in our furnaces or the boilers that feed our radiators. In an effort to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets to reduce global warming, the U.K. has proposed banning fossil fuel-based heating in new homes by 2025. Cities in the states of California, Washington and Massachusetts are also trying to phase out natural gas. If your home is hooked up to a district heating system, where a utility supplies heat directly, you may be able to tap into a variety of greener energy sources.  But if your home relies on its own individual heating system, as most do, what are the alternatives to fossil fuels and will they work in the colder parts of this country? Here's a closer look. About 45 per cent of Canada's emissions come from burning fossil fuels to make energy, including heat and electricity — quite a bit more than transportation (28 per cent), the Prairie Climate Centre reports. Of that, about half is from houses, shops, schools and other private and public buildings. The other half is from industry. Nearly 70 per cent of the energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil fuels, a 2014 study estimated. Forced air furnaces and hot water or steam boilers with radiators, which most often burn fossil fuels such as natural gas, make up a majority of the primary heating systems in Canada, Statistics Canada reports. ""Very important,"" said Fin MacDonald, program manager of the Zero Carbon Building program at the Canada Green Building Council, a non-profit that advocates for and certifies green buildings. In provinces such as B.C., Ontario and Quebec whose power grids don't produce a lot of emissions, fossil fuel combustion from buildings represents the biggest source of carbon dioxide, he said. That's certainly the case in Vancouver, where more than half the greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings, said Brady Faught, green buildings engineer with the city. While people may be concerned about a car idling for 10 minutes, Faught says ""your house is basically idling all day."" And it's not just the gas it's burning that's the problem. Natural gas or methane — a greenhouse gas that traps heat far more effectively than carbon dioxide, causing much more global warming per molecule — also leaks from the entire distribution system used to deliver gas to people's homes and furnaces, Faught said. Buildings heated with fossil fuels can cut some of their emissions by reducing the need for heating through things like better insulation and reusing ""waste"" heat. But in order to make a big difference, the green building industry is looking to electrify heating. ""The only fuel that we can truly make 100 per cent carbon neutral is electricity,"" MacDonald said. That's why the City of Vancouver is trying to come up with regulations and incentives for homeowners to electrify their home heating. ""The ultimate goal is zero emissions,"" said Faught, whose job is to develop policies to encourage green retrofits for single-family homes in Vancouver. In provinces with an electrical grid based mostly on hydro, nuclear or other non-fossil fuel energy sources, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C., replacing a gas-burning furnace with an electrical heating system can nearly eliminate a home's emissions. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, power is largely generated by burning fossil fuels. For now, homeowners who want to cut heating emissions need to go beyond electrification and also install green power generation, such as solar panels. Baseboard heaters are the most common option in use across Canada. They're powered by electrical resistance heating, just like your toaster and oven. Electric forced air furnaces, electric convection heaters and electric radiant floors also use electrical resistance heating. Heat pumps are far more efficient, because they simply move heat into your home, rather than generating heat. There are two kinds: Air source heat pumps, which draw heat from the air. (Yes, it can work even when it is very cold outside, just as your freezer can use its heat pump to cool itself to -18 C in a 20 C kitchen.)  Ground source heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground and are sometimes referred to as geoexchange or geothermal heat pumps. However, MacDonald says the industry is trying to move away from calling it geothermal, as it gets confused with geothermal power generation. Baseboard heaters are popular because they're very cheap and easy to install. However, those and other kinds of electrical resistance heaters are very inefficient. ""They're like just having a toaster running in your house all day … resulting in high electric bills,"" said Faught. For those reasons, baseboard heaters are often popular in rental units where landlords install them and tenants pay the cost of electricity. That said, it's possible to bring the cost down in a small home by making the building more airtight and better insulated. David Turnbull, a former homebuilder and current manager of Enerspec Energy Consulting, said his company built a townhome complex in Edmonton where units were relatively small and so well-insulated that ""you could almost heat the house with two hair dryers."" In that case, baseboard heating made financial sense. Heat pumps are way more efficient than electrical resistance heating. Both MacDonald and Faught say it's possible to get 300 per cent efficiency from a heat pump — that is, you can get three kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity you put in. They're especially efficient in spring and fall.   However, MacDonald says heat pumps tend to produce a lower temperature heat than burning fossil fuels, and therefore don't heat a building as quickly. That means a building needs to be airtight and well insulated to keep the heat from escaping and reduce the ""heating load"" before you should consider this as an option — and even more so the further north you go. Faught says air source heat pumps can heat an airtight, well-insulated home to a comfortable temperature until it gets to about -10 C outside. In places with colder winters than that, supplementing with baseboard heaters may be necessary with conventional air source heat pumps. However, some manufacturers have brought cold climate heat pumps on the market that they say can deal with outside temperatures down to -25 C or -30 C. One big advantage of heat pumps is that they don't just heat homes, they can also cool them. In fact, air conditioners are technically heat pumps. The difference with the heat pumps capable of heating homes is they can run in reverse. Air source heat pumps are cheaper and easier to install, but less efficient and more expensive to run. That's because the ground temperature tends to remain stable all year round — containing more heat in the winter and more ""coolness"" in the summer than the air. However, ground source heat pumps tend to be a lot more expensive — and require more space — to install because it's necessary to dig deep to access stable underground temperatures. That can be particularly costly in places where the ground is bedrock, said Turnbull. It's more economical if you're building on clay or sand, he said, and especially if you're digging anyway — for a parkade, for example. Solar power is useful for generating green energy to run devices like heat pumps in provinces with a fossil fuel-based electricity grid. However, there's also solar thermal energy, where heat is collected directly rather than by generating electricity. MacDonald said that tends to be more expensive than other options and requires lots of space for the solar panels. Because most of the heat is collected in summer, it also needs to be stored somewhere. ""If you have a pool, perfect,"" he said. If you have a ground source heat pump, in theory you can also store the heat in its underground heat exchange loop. Turnbull and Faught both think solar technology is not quite ready for heating individual homes in Canada (although solar thermal heating with storage has been successfully tested for district heating in Okotoks, Alta.). In Canada, the federal government is holding public consultations on proposed changes to the National Building Code and its National Energy Code for Buildings. Some jurisdictions such as Vancouver are also coming up with their own regulations and incentives to encourage electrification, especially in new homes. The city's climate emergency response report  proposes that by 2025, all new and replacement heating and hot water systems should be zero emissions.  ""Having a fully electric house without a gas line is the direction we want to go,"" Faught said. Turnbull says governments need to plan to phase out fossil fuels in home heating. ""It's an inevitability that we are going to get off them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-home-certified-as-alberta-s-1st-passive-house-1.4803890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/district-energy-1.5378650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-home-heating-carbon-emissions-1.5429492 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/passive-house-affordable-housing-1.4432331,N/A
129,Ariana Kelland,2019-12-18T10:48:09.612Z,Jennifer Hillier-Penney took estranged husband off life insurance 2 weeks before she disappeared,"Two weeks before Jennifer Hillier-Penney vanished from her estranged husband's house in a remote Newfoundland town, she removed him as a beneficiary on her life insurance policy. For her oldest daughter, Marina Penney, that gesture says a lot about what her mother was thinking in the days leading up to her disappearance in St. Anthony. ""She knew that something was going to happen to her,"" Penney said from her Clarenville home this week. ""She was living in fear."" Hillier-Penney disappeared from Dean Penney's home on Nov. 30, 2016. Documents show the change in her life insurance policy — removing Dean Penney and leaving her two daughters as beneficiaries — was signed and dated on Nov. 16, 2016. ""The 16th of November, as I know it, it was the day her life was threatened. She went back to work that day and she had her friend witness those changes to take my dad off that policy,"" Marina Penney said.  The RCMP have not named any suspects in the suspicious disappearance of Hillier-Penney. Documents, however, indicate the Mounties believe she was kidnapped and killed.  The RCMP are not commenting on the existence of the life insurance policy or what it could mean. ""All tips and any new information received are being pursued,"" RCMP spokesperson Glenda Power said in an email. ""Police do feel there are people who may have information relevant to the investigation who have not come forward."" Marina Penney said she knew about the change in her mother's policy shortly after she went missing. But after three years without answers, she's decided to take it upon herself to reveal details she believes are important in the case. She posted the policy documents on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her mother.  ""There were very few people that knew that had happened, and I'm to the point now where I just need to put her story out there,"" Marina Penney said.  ""People need to know that."" Hillier-Penney went to her estranged husband's home that night to stay with their daughter, Deana.  Dean Penney told The Fifth Estate last year he was going hunting at their cabin in Northwest Arm, 45 minutes away. The next morning, her daughter woke to find her mother's cellphone, purse, jacket and books were still inside the house. Her vehicle was also still outside.   Police believe she disappeared around 8 p.m. Before she disappeared, Hillier-Penney was looking into leaving her estranged husband and her hometown behind, her daughter said. She had a job interview lined up in Glovertown. Friends of Hillier-Penney have said she expressed fear over leaving Penney. ""Jennifer told me … that he said that he would make away with her. And they would never find her. Like she knew that,"" friend Vicki Burden told The Fifth Estate in 2018. ""She had said stuff to me, but not to the extent she told other people,"" Marina Penney said. ""She just didn't want to burden me with it."" Dean Penney did return to his home the night of Hillier-Penney's disappearance, he told The Fifth Estate, to get his duck decoys. Penney said last year he has no knowledge of what happened to Hillier-Penney. Marina Penney is unable to move forward until her mother's body is found. ""I'm in limbo. A lot of anger right now. Coming up on the third year, the weight of all this is heavy,"" she said. For three years, she has racked her brain thinking of where her mother could be. She has no doubt she's dead. Those suspicions have torn Marina Penney's family on both sides apart, she said, ""No one looks at each other the same anymore."" Dean Penney's lawyer, Bob Simmonds, declined comment when reached by phone Tuesday about the change in Hillier-Penney's life insurance policy.  In the years following Hillier-Penney's disappearance, Marina Penney has longed to have her mother near her — especially when she had her first child, who's now 19 months old.  It's not about what Marina has missed, she insists, but about the life her mother never got to live.  ""She was 38 years old. She had plans. She was sick of living a miserable life and she wanted to do more for herself,"" Marina Penney said. ""She wanted to be happy and that was taken from her."" What tears Marina Penney up inside is knowing her grandfather went to his grave in August without knowing what happened to his daughter. ""In the last three years, he spent so much time sat down by himself consumed by his own thoughts,"" she said. ""That killed him. It was too hard on his heart."" The RCMP were granted an extension last Thursday to hold items seized from Dean Penney's home, the family cabin and a vehicle. Some exhibits have been tested at the RCMP's national crime lab in Ottawa, while others may need to be sent for analysis. ""If they had hard evidence, somebody would be in jail,"" Marina Penney said.  Penney said she's not confident in the case that the RCMP is building, and has been disillusioned by the investigation.  ""It's not that [the RCMP] don't want her found. They want her found more than anything but they got to start taking more action. Because people are going to start doing it themselves.""

The City of St. John's has agreed to allow the St. John's International Airport to resume operations as of 5:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. The announcement is somewhat bittersweet for Beverly Steele whose sister who lives in St. John's missed a surgery that could only be done in Halifax. The 12 hour surgery would be critical in removing some of the cancer in her abdomen. ""The sooner she gets the surgery the better,"" said Steele, who is concerned about the cancer getting worse as she waits. Steele said the surgery was booked for Wednesday but the hospital needed her sister there by Tuesday, which didn't happen due to so many cancellations.  ""There is nobody to blame, it is just the luck has not been in our corner as of right now,"" she said Steele said it has calmed her family's nerves to secure another appointment for surgery and to see those flights back up and running. ""I am relieved, yes, because it's not just my sister in this situation, there are a lot of people that have to leave for many other reasons,"" Steele said. ""We just really need the airport, don't we."" Krista Mulrooney, who lives in Edmonton, was among the first passengers to land Wednesday morning. Her father passed away Sunday. ""We're home for his funeral,"" she said. ""I've been trying to get home for my mom and my family.""

Dean Blotto Gray, a photographer for snowboarding company Burton on his way to Japan, wasn't frustrated about being stranded. His crew had ""never seen anything like this,"" he said. ""Being in a hurricane made out of snow --it was quite thrilling. And it made our trip actually better because we stayed a little bit longer hung out with the community more and did some more snowboarding."" Sherry Stinson nearly made it out ahead of the storm Friday, but ended up stuck at a hotel. She said staff and guests all came together in — even grabbing shovels to help hotel workers clear out cars. ""The people that I've met [are] really going to be the shining part of the entire situation,"" she said. Stinson's friend Karen Gray said, despite the exhaustion and intermittent feelings of isolation, she found the entire experience fantastic. ""We all kind of bonded together, hung out, played cards, drank some beer,"" Gray said. ""I don't think I'd want to be stuck anywhere else.""

131,Anonymous,2020-01-22T02:20:47.895Z,"'Thank you for 74 years': Ten Thousand Villages closing Canadian corporate stores, including 2 in Winnipeg","A long-standing fair-trade social enterprise in Canada will be shutting its doors this year. Ten Thousand Villages announced Tuesday it will be shutting down its corporate operations in Canada this year, which includes the closure of its two stores in Winnipeg. In an update on its website Tuesday, the Mennonite Central Committee — the Winnipeg-based charity that runs most of Canada's Ten Thousand Villages stores —  cited a ""challenging retail environment"" as the reason for the decision to shutter all remaining company stores in Canada. The closure also includes Ten Thousand Villages Canada's head office and distribution centre in New Hamburg, Ont., as well as its online shop and wholesale operations. ""It is with the heaviest of hearts we announce the closure of the corporate operations of Ten Thousand Villages Canada,"" the stores said on its website. ""Thank you for 74 years."" After embarking on what it called an ""unsuccessful multi-year sustainability process,"" the Mennonite Central Committee said it was forced to announce the closure. ""For the last 10 to 12 years, this has been a very, very challenging business. Not a decision we took lightly. There simply wasn't a way,"" executive director Rick Cober Bauman said on Tuesday. With major shifts in the Canadian retail landscape and consumer habits, Cober Bauman explained the existing retail model is no longer viable. ""There's simply not enough people coming into our bricks-and-mortar stores,"" he said, adding the company also fell short in online sales and wholesale contracts. Ten Thousand Villages had attempted to create a market in Canada for handcrafted products made by artisans in developing countries. The move affects 10 remaining corporate-owned stores across Canada, including the two currently operating in Winnipeg. Stores in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick are also set to close by the end of May. However, a number of Ten Thousand Villages locations in Canada which are owned and operated by separate boards — including Manitoba stores in Steinbach and Brandon — will remain open. Ten Thousand Villages U.S. — which operates separately from the Canadian enterprise — is unaffected by the change, the Mennonite Central Committee said in its news release. The company stores which are closing will be liquidating inventory in the coming months, with the last store closing by the end of May. The announcement was sad news for volunteers and employees like Jobina Westman, who started with Ten Thousand Villages as a volunteer five years ago and now fills in as acting manager at the Henderson Highway location in Winnipeg. The store has been like a second home for her, she said. ""It's been just wonderful learning about marketing around the world, and what kind of a difference we can make with our dollar,"" Westman said. Many of the store's handmade items come with information about who made the item, what materials they used and how purchasing the item supports global fair trade. ""That is just a beautiful piece to be able to pass on to our customers,"" said Westman. She said she's worried about the artisans around the world who relied on sales at the stores, and hopes customers will find other places to buy fair-trade products. ""I really hope that someone else picks up the torch, and keeps running."" The Henderson Highway store where she works will shut its doors on March 31. The Plaza Drive location, in Winnipeg's south end, is scheduled to close May 29. The store's retail website will also shut down on May 29. The unique fair-trade stores have been around for as long as many consumers can remember. ""I think it's really sad,"" Devina Sirota, a Winnipeg customer, said. ""If you come here, you can actually see the products. But if you see it online, you can't really get a feel for the love that goes into them."" The Ten Thousand Villages chain's origins stretch back to 1946, according to the organization's website, when American MCC worker Edna Ruth Byler visited volunteers in Puerto Rico who were teaching sewing classes to help improve the lives of women living in poverty. When she returned to her home in Pennsylvania, she filled her car with their embroidery and started selling pieces at churches, parties and sewing circles. That work expanded to Canada in 1965, the MCC's Tuesday press release said, with the first Ten Thousand Villages store (then known as Selfhelp Crafts of the World) opening in Altona, Man., in 1972. The Altona store announced its closure late last year. That followed the closure of nine other Ten Thousand Villages stores across Canada in 2018. ""We recognize this has a huge impact on artisans, staff, volunteers, shoppers, all of whom I'm deeply grateful for the contributions that they've all made,"" the MCC's Cober Bauman said on Tuesday. ""We want to recognize the losses, but also recognize the enormous impact that the many people — and Ten Thousand Villages as an organization — has had.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ten-thousand-villages-winnipeg-closing-1.5434881,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ten-thousand-villages-store-closures-1.5434902 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ten-thousand-villages-altona-closes-1.5401222 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ten-thousand-villages-mennonite-central-stores-closed-1.4526076,N/A
132,Anonymous,2020-01-21T15:55:44.741Z,Low vacancy rates for Saint John apartments could spell trouble for low-income renters,"If you're looking for a two-bedroom apartment in Saint John, you might have a hard time finding one.  New numbers from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation show a lower vacancy rate in certain parts of Saint John, including uptown and the south end.  Kelvin Ndoro, an analyst with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, said the vacancy rate for a two-bedroom apartment in the city's south end is at 0.6 per cent.  ""That's significantly low,"" Ndoro said, adding the vacancy rate for a two-bedroom apartment in the same area was 3.5 per cent last year. The overall average vacancy rate for the city is 3.3 per cent, relatively stronger than other regions in the province, and a big change long term.  Seven years ago, the vacancy rate hovered around eight to 10 per cent, among the highest in the country for an urban centre.  Ndoro said the low vacancy rate is because more people are moving to Saint John, boosting the city's population and increasing demand for more apartments.  ""This is accounting for the low vacancy rate we are seeing, especially for the south end."" The city of Saint John has also made development of the south end's residential properties a priority in recent years, including demolishing more run-down buildings. A higher demand for apartments has in turn driven rent up, leading renters to look for apartments with more bedrooms.  ""Units with more bedrooms allow individuals to room together and split rent costs,"" Ndoro said in an interview with Information Morning Saint John. A lower vacancy rate means demand is outpacing supply, which is good news for developers and landlords, Ndoro said, but not so great for renters.  ""[More demand] also increases rent and affordability becomes an issue."" Ben Appleby is the housing team lead for Housing Alternatives Inc., a Saint John-based non-profit that helps people in need find suitable and affordable housing.  He said the high demand for affordable housing has serious implications for low income renters in Saint John.  ""If the rent keeps jumping, they can't afford those units anymore. You have an increase in homelessness amongst a population that typically wasn't homeless before."" Rent prices have increased by four per cent since last year, Appleby said. The average price for a two bedroom apartment in Saint John in 2018 was $755, according to a report from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  ""If that continues to happen, it just continues to price people out of the market.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/saint-john-vacancy-rate-apartments-1.5434424,[],N/A
133,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-05T10:30:00.081Z,NB Power spent more than $178K US on Florida lab this year,"NB Power has spent more than $178,000 US this year to run a lab in Florida at the home of Joi Scientific, a company that claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen. But the lab may not be open for much longer, as questions swirl about whether Joi Scientific's technology works as previously described. NB Power spent $178,413 US (about $237,325 Cdn) on costs associated with the lab, according to records obtained by CBC through access to information. The records capture costs between February, when NB Power opened the lab, up to Oct. 16, 2019. The biggest expense in running the Florida lab has been the $42,372 US for standard lab equipment, followed by  $38,694 US for support staff. The records don't specify how many people were considered support staff or how many people may have been brought in to work in the lab. Other costs included instrumentation, H2 specific equipment, a work station and rent and utilities at the facility, located at the Space Life Sciences Lab at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., where Joi Scientific is headquartered. Two former Joi Scientific employees interviewed by CBC News have raised questions about Joi's technology, saying it doesn't work as previously described. Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland has also said there's no proof Joi's technology is viable. Earlier this month, Holland said the NB Power lab in Florida will continue to stay open until the end of 2019, as a final test is underway to determine the technology's viability. ""Once [the test is] completed, either you send me somebody from MIT who says, 'Eureka!' or it didn't deliver the results and then we wrap things up,"" Holland said on CBC New Brunswick's Political Panel in November. A spokesperson for Joi Scientific did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday before deadline. Last month, Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, acknowledged the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them. Her emailed statement didn't elaborate on those delays or challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement from November said. NB Power spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology, with the help of the Regional Development Corporation. NB Power planned to keep the Florida lab operating ""until we can make a decision whether we can go forward or not,"" NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas told CBC News last month. He said the utility was doing that to ensure it could recoup some of the investment it made in Joi's technology. But the utility hasn't budgeted any money for its Florida lab in the 2020-21 fiscal year, according to documents the utility filed with the Energy and Utilities Board on Tuesday. ""NB Power is obligated to make payments related to the lab space and related equipment until the end of January 2020,"" the documents say. ""The payment for January 2020 is US$16,717. There are no other continuing obligations. NB Power will maintain the licensing rights should there be no further testing or funding by NB Power."" After NB Power's latest rate application, New Brunswick's public intervener, Heather Black, asked the utility to provide Joi Scientific's ""most recent evaluation of the technology and its potential economic viability."" But in its response, NB Power said it couldn't answer those questions ""due to strict confidentiality requirements."" In response to a question from Black about whether NB Power has decided to ""pull the plug"" on the initiative, NB Power said Joi's ""technology is producing hydrogen from seawater,"" but the utility didn't provide further details. ""Additional testing is scheduled in the December time frame which will determine future direction,"" NB Power wrote in its filing. In a separate filing, the EUB asked the utility whether outside experts were asked to help evaluate the investment in Joi Scientific. ""With respect to the Joi Scientific initiative, NB Power had access to third party validation testing,"" NB Power wrote in response. ""NB Power also engaged its own third party to conduct testing."" The utility has never identified the third party that may have validated the testing and hasn't released copies of the those tests, citing a confidentiality agreement signed with Joi Scientific. Both the public intervener and NB Power declined requests for interviews about the utility's EUB filings. Do you have a tip about this story?

He said the city has made some progress over the last few years, but there's still more work to be done. In 2019, the city launched an affordable housing incentive program, introduced new rules to allow developers to increase density and waived permits for new affordable housing projects.    ""We have lots more work to do because we have to put more boots on the ground and more shovels in the ground and get more work and more units out there and build out that supply,"" he said. ""The planning department, the planning board ... we've done a good job, but I think we can do a lot more."" Looking ahead for 2020, Brown said he hopes to continue to expand housing options on the Island.  ""I'm hoping … we will reinstate this fund to waive permit fees for accessible housing and that we look at other possibilities of curbing or increasing the inventory for affordable accessible housing,"" he said. ""And that includes addressing short-term rental housing."" Brown said he hopes to have a bylaw on short-term rentals in place by the end of March.  He also noted the city was able to increase use of public transportation, from 567,000 riders in 2018 to nearly 700,000 in 2019. Brown said he wants to see that number grow by another 100,000 in 2020.  ""By increasing public transit we are taking a big shot at bringing down our carbon footprint,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-affordable-housing-city-of-charlottetown-1.5436088,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-affordable-housing-1.4770173 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-affordable-housing-1.4818338 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241,N/A

An Alberta biologist is refusing to be a gloomy Gus, however, and says there is an upside. ""There was a significant killing of mountain pine beetle in those areas as a result of these very low temperatures,"" Janice Cooke at the University of Alberta told The Homestretch. ""We are seeing patches where we see better than 95 per cent death, so less than five per cent are living in these areas. We will know for sure when May rolls around and surveys are done."" That's two years of help in the fight against those devastating little critters that ravaged much of British Columbia and parts of Alberta in the 2000s. ""From last year, we had a nasty winter as well, and we saw in those May surveys confirmation that a lot of beetles had been killed."" Currently in Alberta, mountain pine beetle are concentrated east of Jasper and around Hinton. ""We also see them trying to make their way into the jack pine of the boreal forest, in the east-central part of the province,"" Cooke said. The mountain pine beetle are tricky to deal with because they spend their entire life underneath tree bark, forcing the province to take a scorched-earth approach. ""The province surveys for beetle-attacked trees in the autumn, creates maps and sends crews in the winter who fall them on the spot and burn them to kill all the larvae."" But even then, the most biologists can hope for is management, not complete eradication, she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/mountain-pine-beetle-cold-snap-1.5436844,[],N/A
136,Travis Kingdon,2020-01-23T10:00:00.526Z,How P.E.I. could help with an increased demand for beef,"The Maritime Beef Council says demand for beef is going up, and P.E.I. might be able to help meet that demand. ""We're actually seeing increased demand for beef regionally, nationally and internationally as well,"" said Brad McCallum, with the Maritime Beef Council and managing director of the Nova Scotia Cattle Producers. But the number of cattle available in the Atlantic region has fallen from 63,700 in 2007 to 42,300 in 2016.   As far back as 2003, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, had a significant impact on the regional herd, McCallum said, and numbers haven't rebounded.  ""As we went through into the early- to mid-2010s we actually saw historically-high market prices,"" McCallum said. ""A lot of the industry participants at that time actually saw that as an opportunity to liquidate their herds and gain maximum value back out of their animals and their farms.""  Russ Mallard, president of Atlantic Beef Products, said that as producers retire, many haven't had a plan to keep their farm going, adding to the shortage of supply in the region.  Meanwhile, the company is expanding and needs more than 15,000 animals to fill the demand, Mallard said. That's a need of 300 per week. ""We know that we get every animal we can locally from the three Maritime provinces, and we find ourselves going to Quebec quite regularly.""   The cattle industry goes hand in hand with the potato industry on P.E.I., McCallum said.  ""Having a rotation within the potato crop allows for the production of grains and also allows for the production of forage, which can be then used to feed cattle,"" McCallum said, adding cattle also produce manure for farmers.  McCallum also said there is some unused capacity in feedlots. ""There are also some that would be sitting empty ... that could be brought back into production,"" McCallum said. ""There's a lot of infrastructure that already exists, it's about maximizing that infrastructure."" With Atlantic Beef Products — the major processor in the region — on P.E.I., McCallum said it makes logistical and financial sense for the animals to be shipped to feedlots here. In order to address the deficit, the beef council is working on educating producers to make them more efficient.  McCallum said he thinks that producers have a role to play in bringing stability to the market.  ""One of the big things that we want to see is producers being more engaged with themselves ... more engaged with the next person down the production chain and then ultimately with the processor and the consumer,"" he said.  ""It's all about knowing what that consumer wants and producing for their requirements and without knowing that, it's really hard to predict, it's really hard to know if you're going to be profitable."" Mallard said given the volatility of the industry, he thinks more of a guarantee, like those that exist in other markets, could help attract people to the industry. ""Price insurance — and that basically gives the producer an advance knowledge of what they'll get for their beef six months out,"" he said. ""And that involves a contract and securing beef futures and it's available pretty widely in Western Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-cows-needed-atlantic-products-1.5436510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dairy-farmers-feed-concerns-1.5353731 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-company-certified-sustainable-1.5238512 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932,N/A

The country's Health Minister Julio Mazzoleni said on Wednesday that the 48-year-old president fell unwell during a trip to the east of the country and returned to the capital Asuncion where the diagnosis was confirmed. He has been ordered to rest. ""The result of the blood test effectively confirms that the president has dengue,"" Mazzoleni said at a press conference. ""He will fulfil his agenda in Mburuvicha Roga [the presidential residence] with some restrictions,"" he said, adding the president was in a ""good general condition."" The diagnosis underscores the potential severity of the outbreak of the disease in Paraguay, which has the second highest incidence of dengue in South American after Brazil. A severe outbreak in 2013 led to 250 deaths in the country. The World Health Organization says the incidence of dengue, which causes high fever and joint pain, has been growing rapidly in recent decades. There is no specific treatment, but early detection and care reduces risks associated with the disease. The minister said Abdo Benitez must complete a rest period of at least 48 hours and will be evaluated day by day in order ""to discharge him when appropriate."" He added that the rest time could last three to seven days. Dengue is an endemic disease in Paraguay, with cases peaking in the summer months when the transmitting Aedes Aegypti mosquito proliferates. The government announced days ago that it is preparing for a strong epidemic that would peak in February. The health ministry has also confirmed that so far this year two people have died due to the disease and another 14 deaths are being investigated.

138,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-23T20:00:43.698Z,'Is that even legal?': Companies may be sharing new credit or debit card information without you knowing,"A Vancouver woman is sounding the alarm for millions of Canadians who have credit and debit cards, after information about her debit card was shared when it shouldn't have been. Vanessa Acuña blames an ""updating service"" that some credit and debit card companies have that allows new account numbers and expiry dates to be shared with merchants customers have dealt with in the past.  Information about the sharing of this kind of information with third party companies is often buried in the fine print of bank and credit card agreements. She thought the details of her Visa debit card — a debit card that can be used for online purchases — were secure. ""[I thought], 'How is this legal?'"" Acuña said after discovering PayPal was given the new expiry date on her Visa debit card without her knowledge. Visa — and other major credit cards — have ""updater"" programs, that automatically provide updated customer credit card information to subscribing merchants, including account numbers and expiry dates. Companies automatically opt-in their customers to the service, whether they realize it or not.  The program is meant to be a convenience for customers and help merchants avoid missed payments on recurring bills. ""I have huge privacy concerns … I would really prefer that they tell you and give you an option to opt out of it. But that's not what they did."" The merchants who get the automatic updates pay for the service.   Thomas Keenan, author of TechnoCreep — a book about how technology is eroding privacy — says financial institutions need to ask themselves if they should be making money by sharing customers' information.  ""Banks make a business out of information sharing. They actually have services — Visa, MasterCard — and they are paid to share that information,"" said Keenan.  Acuña believes that updater service is the reason the online payment system got her card information when it shouldn't have — but when she tried to find out why it happened, she couldn't. Acuña thought what happened to her private information was her decision, when PayPal sent an email in March asking her to update her debit card's expiry date.  She says she ignored the request, since she opened the account five years ago and rarely shops online and didn't want PayPal to have her new card information.  ""Two days afterwards, I got another email saying, 'Oh we updated for you, so you don't have to.' And I just thought 'what?'"" Acuña said. She spent hours on the phone with TD Canada Trust, PayPal and Visa Canada, but instead of getting an explanation, she got three different answers. PayPal told Acuña it got her new expiry date from her ""financial institution or her credit card company.""  Visa and TD both denied giving PayPal that information. ""[They said] they don't know who gave PayPal my information, which I don't think is a very good answer,"" Acuña said. It turns out Acuña's information shouldn't have been shared at all, since only Visa credit — not debit — cards are part of the updating agreement with TD. Yet, none of the three companies involved will explain how her new debit card data ended up with PayPal.  After initially telling Go Public it got Acuña's information from the ""account update services,"" PayPal  backtracked a few days later, saying the account updater service ""doesn't apply"" in Acuña's case. So, how did PayPal get her new expiry date? It won't say, citing customer confidentiality — even though Acuña agreed to waive confidentiality to allow the company to answer Go Public's questions. Visa Canada and TD also won't say who gave her card's new expiry date to PayPal.  ""Visa does not automatically update expiry date information on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email. ""Please refer your questions to PayPal."" ""TD has no ability to automatically update expiry date information with merchants on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders. For more information about the service, we recommend reaching out to Visa,"" wrote Geraldine Anderson from the bank's public relations department. The lack of answers is why banks and credit card companies shouldn't be sharing any credit or debit card information without clear consent from customers, says Ann Cavoukian, who heads up the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto.  ""It's totally unacceptable,"" said Cavoukian, who worked as Ontario's information and privacy commissioner from 1997-2014. ""PayPal is one thing. But your own personal bank where your financial info is stored and kept? As I keep telling businesses, this is not your information. The information belongs to the individual."" She wants to see banks get what she calls ""positive informed consent"" before providing a third party with a customer's information.  ""The banks have to step up and do this. They can't just assume you're OK with them sharing your new credit information.""  Cavoukian wants to see Canada's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, upgraded to match the one the European Union introduced in May. The General Data Protection Regulation is considered to have some of the world's strictest online privacy rules. For now, if customers want to stop merchants from getting updated credit card information, they have to opt out through their banks — although it's unclear if that would have helped Acuña. ""I'm capable of putting in my information online if I need to. It's not a hassle for me, so I definitely would like the option,"" Acuña said She says from now on, she'll take the time to read through all the legalese on those lengthy card agreements, and make sure she opts out of anything that allows financial institutions to share her information with third parties.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

139,Anonymous,2020-01-23T02:46:45.716Z,Death toll from new coronavirus outbreak in China reaches 17,"The death toll from China's new respiratory virus in Hubei province has risen to 17 and the total number of confirmed cases has risen further, state television reported on Wednesday, citing the provincial government. The number of new cases has risen sharply in China, the centre of the outbreak. According to Chinese state television, there were more than 570 confirmed cases as of Wednesday. China discouraged public gatherings in Hubei province, where the virus emerged last month, and tightened containment measures in hospitals, while the World Health Organization (WHO) was due to hold an emergency meeting to determine whether the outbreak constituted a global health emergency. ""There has already been human-to-human transmission and infection of medical workers,"" Li said at a news conference with health experts. ""Evidence has shown that the disease has been transmitted through the respiratory tract and there is the possibility of viral mutation."" The illness comes from a newly identified type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people. Symptoms of the virus, which can cause pneumonia, include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can be passed from person to person. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. WATCH: 'Very high' probability that Canada will see coronavirus, says Toronto respirologist Hong Kong quarantined a 39-year-old man on Wednesday after the city's first preliminary positive result in a test for the new flu-like coronavirus found in an outbreak in central mainland China, authorities said. The tourist from Wuhan came to Hong Kong on Tuesday via high-speed rail from nearby Shenzhen and was detected as having fever at the border. He was in stable condition in an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, Health Minister Sophia Chan said. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, that the rapid flow of people across the Hong Kong border makes the city highly vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak.  ""The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control,"" the National Health Commission vice-minister told reporters. There was evidence that the virus was being spread through ""respiratory transmission,"" Li said. And, the director-general of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said virus was adapting and mutating, underscoring the challenges for health authorities. The Chinese government has provided updates on the number of cases in a bid to head off panic, as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel at home and abroad for Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week. Gao said officials are working on the assumption that the outbreak resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating. Mutations can make the virus spread faster or make people sicker. Thailand authorities Wednesday confirmed four cases, a Thai national and three Chinese visitors. Japan, South Korea, the United States and Taiwan have all reported one case each. All of the illnesses were of people from Wuhan or who recently had traveled there. ""The situation is under control here,"" Thailand Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, saying there are no reports of the infection spreading to others. ""We checked all of them: taxi drivers, people who wheeled the wheelchairs for the patients, doctors and nurses who worked around them."" Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is a semi-autonomous Chinese city, reported one case Wednesday. WATCH: Emerging disease specialist optimistic that coronavirus can be contained   Travel agencies that organize trips to North Korea say the country has banned foreign tourists because of the outbreak. Most tourists to North Korea are either Chinese or travel to the country through neighbouring China. North Korea also closed its borders in 2003 during the SARS scare. Other countries have also stepped up screening measures for travellers from China, especially those arriving from Wuhan. Worries have been heightened by the coming of the Lunar New Year holiday rush. U.S. officials said they will begin screening travellers coming from Wuhan at three major airports — New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. While in Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News that it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the last 14 days.  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said.  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. Officials said it was too early to compare the new virus with SARS or MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, in terms of how lethal it might be. They attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring. Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said ""the disease will continue to develop. It has developed different features compared with the early stage, and the prevention and precautionary measures need to change accordingly."" WATCH: Should Canadians be worried about the coronavirus? Dr. David Heymann, who headed WHO's global response to SARS in 2003, said the new virus appears dangerous to older people with other health conditions, but doesn't look nearly as infectious as SARS. ""It looks like it doesn't transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,"" he said. ""That was not the case with SARS."" Health officials confirmed earlier this week that the disease can be spread between humans after finding two infected people in Guangdong province in southern China who had not been to Wuhan. Fifteen medical workers also tested positive for the virus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has said. Fourteen of them, one doctor and 13 nurses, were infected by a patient who had been hospitalized for neurosurgery but also had the coronavirus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/as-wuhan-virus-spreads-fears-about-pandemic-readiness-1.5435286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494,N/A

In 2007 the town became one of 80 in Canada, and the only one on P.E.I., to join the UNESCO-led Coalition of Inclusive Municipalities. ""It's important to signal that we welcome newcomers,"" said Mayor Steve Ogden. Signing on was timely for the community, coming just before the beginning of the biggest wave of immigration to the Island in a century. Ogden said being inclusive has become part of the process at town hall. It's not a project that is ever complete. ""We do a regular assessment of our programs and services to ensure all our offerings are diverse and inclusive, and that we make sure that all our information is accessible and easy to navigate, and that it's up to date,"" he said. It's not just about including different cultures, but also about different abilities. A hearing loop for the hearing impaired is being installed at town hall, the building — including change rooms for the gym in the community centre — is accessible, and the town hosts a weekly wheelchair basketball league. Ogden said inclusivity means rethinking everything the town does. ""If you're going to cater, why not cater and let people know about other cultures and their dietary practices,"" he said. ""It's not expensive. It's part of doing business. We have to make sure we respect everyone and include everyone.""

On Feb. 23, Chhaya and Narayan Karki, aged 66 and 69, were on the final leg of a trip from their home in Kathmandu, Nepal, to visit their son and his family in Edmonton, with a stopover in Vancouver.  Mohan Karki said Cathay Pacific told him it delivered his parents to the WestJet customer service counter at the airport, and WestJet was to transport the pair to the gate for their final flight to Edmonton.  When his parents failed to arrive, a worried Karki spent hours on the phone trying to track them down. They didn't have a cellphone. ""For about six or seven hours, I kept on calling both airlines, but they never found my parents,"" he said.  Karki then called the RCMP. It took officers 20 minutes to find the couple, located just steps from the service counter. The couple had placards with Karki's name and phone number, in case of an emergency. No one responded when they tried to get help by holding them up, he said. According to an Ontario-based advocate for people with disabilities, services for those who need assistance travelling are ""unreliable and inconsistent"" because airlines are allowed to set their own rules — instead of being told to meet specific standards. ""It is appalling treatment … the regulator should make it clear that [airlines] can't pass the buck to each other,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. Thanh Phan shares that frustration; the same thing happened to his 76-year-old mother at the same airport. In August, Niem Thi Le, who has trouble walking and doesn't speak English, was left in a wheelchair for eight hours after being dropped off at the wrong departure gate by WestJet. Le was on her way home to Hanoi, Vietnam, after visiting family in Victoria. WestJet was supposed to connect her with China Southern Airlines for her next flight. ""My mom told me that the wheelchair attendant just left her there without talking to anyone.… I was shocked … this is a human being,"" Phan said. An employee with another airline eventually noticed Le sitting alone, found someone who could speak Vietnamese and brought the woman to the China Southern Airlines counter. That airline contacted Phan and suggested he call WestJet to find out what happened. He did, asking if someone could help his mother until he could get there himself. ""I said, 'Could you please help her give her some food and drinks.'... They said, no, they didn't do anything wrong and that's not their business,"" Phan said. He called China Southern Airlines back and it agreed to help, bringing Le a hamburger and a drink. Phan complained to customer service and WestJet apologized, saying it would review its internal process. But he said the airline never got back to him to explain what happened. WestJet also told him travellers who don't speak English shouldn't be travelling alone, he said, though they offered him a $100 travel voucher. ""It's very frustrating because they blame passengers, and they did not think that is a serious problem."" Both Phan and Karki are still demanding an explanation from the airlines involved in their respective cases.  ""We sincerely apologize for the stress and worry that these guests and their families experienced,"" WestJet's media relations manager Lauren Stewart wrote in an email to Go Public. ""The nature of these incidents is serious, and we are in touch with both airline partners involved to investigate and make enhancements to our processes to prevent this type of incident from happening again. We are also reaching out to the families involved.""  The airline says it provides mobility assistance to more than 900 guests per day. Cathay Pacific told Go Public it was sorry to hear what happened to the Karkis, adding it followed ""standard operating procedure"" when it delivered the couple to WestJet staff and exchanged wheelchairs. ""The proper turnover to WestJet was made by our staff. Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing this situation with WestJet and we will apply learnings from this experience to future transitions between our airlines,"" wrote Julie Jarratt, the airline's communications director. Lepofsky, who is blind, said he's had his own problems travelling. ""I dread entering Canadian airspace if I'm travelling alone … not because the service is always bad, but because it's not reliably and consistently good."" Airlines have a duty to accommodate passengers with disabilities under Canada's human rights laws, he said. But when that doesn't happen, it's tough to figure out where to turn for help. ""There are multiple agencies involved,"" Lepofsky said. ""The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Transportation Agency — and you could be kicked from one to the other, trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. ""The Canadian Transportation Agency, where you're often kicked to, does not, from the perspective of people with disabilities, have a good track record in this area."" The CTA says it's aware some of the standards are out of date and a binding set of rules is needed. Until now, accessible transportation has been governed by mostly voluntary codes of practice.  The agency has proposed new accessible transportation regulations for airlines and all travel providers. The new rules would be legally binding and impose penalties up to $25,000 for non-compliance. And if another proposed law passes, the Accessible Canada Act, that fine could jump to a maximum of $250,000. ""They need to make sure that passengers don't fall between the cracks,"" said Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency. Under the CTA's proposed rules, airlines would have to provide people who need assistance a place to wait, near personnel who can assist them and will ""periodically inquire"" about the person's needs. Airports would be responsible for providing assistance from curbside to check-in, while the airlines would be responsible from check-in to boarding.  Streiner said the proposed recommendations would have helped in both cases. The agency plans to have the final regulations published before summer and hopes to have the majority of requirements in place in about a year. ""Persons who require wheelchair assistance, including older Canadians, absolutely are covered by these regulations,"" Streiner said. ""We want to make sure that there's no confusion about who's providing assistance and that people aren't left without assistance."" As for Karki, he said that the next time his parents visit, he won't leave them in the hands of the airlines. Instead, he'll try to match their itinerary with other Nepali-speaking travellers. After hearing from Go Public, WestJet called Karki last week, promising an explanation once it looks into what went wrong. Phan said WestJet has yet to follow up with him, adding that his mother is now afraid to travel and will no longer come visit.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

143,Anonymous,2020-01-23T16:58:18.717Z,"World leaders commemorate Auschwitz anniversary, Netanyahu slams Iran","Dozens of world leaders gathered in Jerusalem on Thursday to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, amid a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the United States. Israel has hailed the World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem memorial centre as the biggest international gathering in its history. More than one million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp during the Second World War. Overall, some six million Jews died in the Holocaust. The high-profile guest list for Thursday's commemoration includes Britain's Prince Charles, French President Emmanuel Macron, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence. Canada sent a delegation led by Gov. Gen. Julie Payette. Speeches at Yad Vashem focused on the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust as well as on the recent rise in anti-Semitism rhetoric and attacks worldwide, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu singling out Iran. ""At the core of Israel's establishment is the command — there will not be another Holocaust. As prime minister of Israel, that is my greatest commitment,"" Netanyahu said in his address. Netanyahu then lashed out at Iran, whose nuclear ambitions he says are aimed at building atomic weapons with the aim of destroying Israel. Tehran denies it is seeking nuclear arms. ""I am concerned that we have yet to see a unified and resolute stance against the most anti-Semitic regime on the planet — a regime that openly seeks to develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the one and only Jewish state,"" Netanyahu said, praising the U.S. administration for confronting Iran. Warning of the ""dark shadow of anti-Semitism,"" Macron met French survivors of the Holocaust at a memorial near Jerusalem to some 76,000 Jews arrested in France during the Second World War and transported to death camps such as Auschwitz, where most died. Prince Charles paid homage to his grandmother, Princess Alice of Battenberg and Greece, the mother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth. The Prince of Wales said the Royal Family took great pride in Israel's recognition of Alice's heroism in the Holocaust. ""I have long drawn inspiration from the selfless actions of my dear grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, who in 1943 in Nazi-occupied Athens, saved a Jewish family by taking them into her home and hiding them,"" the prince said. ""My grandmother, who is buried on the Mount of Olives, has a tree planted in her name here at Yad Vashem and is counted as one of the Righteous Among the Nations … a fact which gives me and my family immense pride."" A devout Christian, Alice died in London in 1969 and had asked to be buried in Jerusalem, next to her aunt, who like Alice had become a nun and founded a convent. Steinmeier, meanwhile, was the first ever German president to deliver a speech at Yad Vashem.   ""I bow in deepest sorrow,"" Steinmeier said. ""The mass murder of six million Jews, the worst crime in the history of humanity, it was committed by my countrymen."" With anti-Semitic attacks increasing in frequency in Germany and across Europe, Steinmeier, 64, voiced regret that his country was still dealing with the bigotry and hatred that led to the Holocaust. ""I wish I could say that we Germans have learnt from history once and for all. But I cannot say that when hatred is spreading,"" Steinmeier said. A global survey by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League in November found that global anti-Semitic attitudes had increased, and significantly so in Eastern and Central Europe. It found that large percentages of people in many European countries think Jews talk too much about the Holocaust. ""We must be prepared to confront and expose the vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fuelling hate and violence all across the world and we must stand together,"" Pence told the audience of world leaders. The president of Poland, where the death camp was built by the Nazi German occupiers during the war, is not attending the ceremony due to rankling disputes with both Russia and Israel. Polish President Andrzej Duda turned down an invitation to the conference, expressing dissatisfaction that representatives of Russia, France, Britain, the United States and Germany would speak, while Poland was told it would not be allowed to. Polish leaders have also been angered by comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin last month suggesting Poland shared responsibility for the war. Poland, which was invaded first by Nazi Germany and then by Soviet forces in September 1939, sees itself as a major victim of the war, in which it lost a fifth of its population. Later on Thursday, Putin criticized those who try to rewrite history, though he made no reference to Poland, while unveiling a monument to the residents and defenders of Nazi-besieged Leningrad, Russia's second city, now renamed St. Petersburg. ""Here, as in Russia, people are concerned, alarmed and outraged by attempts to deny the Holocaust and to revise the results of World War Two, to whitewash murderers and criminals,"" Putin said. Poland will host its own ceremony at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum on Jan. 27, as it does every year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-auschwitz-memorial-1.5437321,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rainer-hoess-auschwitz-holocaust-1.5348444 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/poland-auschwitz-merkel-germany-1.5386676 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5268354,N/A
144,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:39:54.065Z,National public health data finds vaccine rates for kids falls short,"New data suggests vaccination rates among Canadian children are falling short. The Public Health Agency of Canada says none of the country's national vaccination goals were met in any of the age groups surveyed in 2017. Dr. Theresa Tam says that means more kids need their shots if we're going to reach sufficient community immunity to prevent disease and outbreaks. While at least 95 per cent of two-year-olds should ideally be covered, researchers found just 75.8 per cent received the multidose vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island were the only provinces to cover more than 80 per cent, while Manitoba and Nunavut were below 70 per cent. Adult immunization: Are you up to date? Download and print this handy record. | <a href=""https://twitter.com/ImmunizedotCa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@ImmunizedotCa</a> | <a href=""https://t.co/khNeBtBL1S"">https://t.co/khNeBtBL1S</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetImmunized?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GetImmunized</a> <a href=""https://t.co/6TBkkzr6yA"">pic.twitter.com/6TBkkzr6yA</a> The study says 2.4 per cent of two-year-olds are estimated to be unvaccinated, with Atlantic Canada having the lowest unvaccinated rate at 1.3 per cent, while British Columbia had the highest at 3.9 per cent. Among seven-year-olds, only girls vaccinated for rubella met the 95-per cent coverage goal at 95.8 per cent, versus 93.8 per cent for boys. That vaccine only requires one dose, compared to two doses for measles and mumps where the national rate was 87 per cent and 86.4 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, none of the three routine vaccines for adolescents met the national coverage goal of 90 per cent, although the Tdap booster came close at 89.3 per cent. Kids aged 14 and 17 get up to three routine vaccinations in school-based programs, depending on the jurisdiction, including for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). The Public Health Agency of Canada routinely monitors childhood vaccination rates through the childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey, which began in 1994 and has been conducted approximately every two years. Experts set vaccination goals in 2017, with the aim of reaching them by 2025. Although the numbers fall short of ideal, Tuesday's study said vaccination coverage among two- and seven-year-olds have not changed much in recent years. The agency said an upcoming report will look at knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Canadian parents regarding vaccination. In other data, the survey found polio coverage for two-year-olds higher at 90.7 per cent, but Newfoundland and Labrador was the only province to reach the 95 per cent goal, at 96.9 per cent. Other provinces and territories came close — including P.E.I. at 93.9 per cent, Nova Scotia at 93.5 per cent and the Yukon at 93.7 per cent. Coverage was lowest in British Columbia at 87.5 per cent, Manitoba at 85.6 per cent and Nunavut at 82.1 per cent. Measles coverage for two-year-olds was 90.2 per cent but when doses administered to those under the recommended 12 months were excluded, coverage dropped to 87.6 per cent. The lowest coverage for seven-year-olds involved five doses or more for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, where only 80.5 per cent of kids were covered. In 14-year-olds, HPV coverage in girls increased to 83 per cent from 74.6 per cent, likely due to increased availability and awareness of this relatively new vaccine, said the study.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-vaccine-kids-1.5436161,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-infants-study-toronto-1.5367821,N/A
145,Paul Withers,2020-01-21T17:14:32.974Z,Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline commits $200M in case of mishap,"The owners of the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline that runs through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have pledged $200 million to cover mishaps on the natural gas line. Federal regulators have ordered the owners of all pipelines in Canada to post guarantees there is money available in case of a leak or other incident. ""What it really means is that in Canada, polluters pay,"" said Sarah Kiley, a spokesperson for Canada Energy Regulator, the agency that has succeeded the National Energy Board. Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline — known as the MN&P line — has been assessed the maximum for a natural gas pipeline, based on the diameter of the pipe and the pressure it operates under. It means that if something were to go wrong, regardless of who is responsible, MN&P would be required to pay up to $200 million to cover costs and damages, Kiley said. ""If they are found to be at fault, there is no limit to the cost that they would have to pay,"" she said Monday night in an interview from Calgary. The owners of large oil pipelines have been assessed a maximum of $1 billion because a leak would cost more to clean up and compensate people who were impacted, Kiley said. Maritimes and Northeast has proposed to cover its obligation with $100 million in insurance and the remainder in credit guarantees from the pipeline owners, based on their stake in the pipeline. This month, Enbridge Inc. pledged $78 million, Halifax-based Emera Inc. $12.79 million and ExxonMobil $9.5 million. ""It's another level of assurance that we provide,"" said Steve Rankin of Maritimes and Northeast. Kiley said the Canada Energy Regulator is currently assessing the financial plan to ensure it meets federal requirements. The 1,100-kilometre pipeline was built in the late 1990s to carry natural gas from fields near Sable Island off Nova Scotia to markets in New England. It travels across Nova Scotia and across southern New Brunswick before crossing the U.S.  border near St. Stephen, N.B. These days the MN&P line only carries natural gas into the region. Both of Nova Scotia's offshore production facilities, the Exxon-led Sable Offshore Energy Project and EnCana-owned Deep Panuke, were shut down in 2018.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/maritimes-natural-gas-pipeline-commits-200m-in-case-of-mishap-1.5434396,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-snowmobile-crash-new-ross-lunenburg-county-1.5434326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-provincial-park-development-golf-eastern-shore-1.5433792,N/A
146,Anonymous,2020-01-20T19:21:36.071Z,"Oil and gas industry must do more to address climate change, report says","The oil and gas industry needs to increase its efforts to address climate change or risk becoming socially unacceptable and unprofitable, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. ""No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, in a statement Monday. The IEA is an independent non-governmental organization that advises countries and industry on sustainable energy. The world is demanding energy services and emissions reductions at the same time, the report says. Social pressures on the industry are rising, it notes, highlighting growing opposition to new infrastructure projects in certain areas and fracking bans. ""Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option."" Some companies have taken steps to address climate change, but the report says the industry as a whole could do more. The diverse industry requires a variety of approaches based on the particular circumstances of individual companies, according to the report, which was produced in co-operation with the World Economic Forum and will be presented at the organization's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The ""immediate task"" for the industry is to reduce its operational environmental footprint, Birol said. Approximately 15 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers, the report says. ""A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,"" said Birol. The most important and cost-effective measure would be to reduce methane leaks to the atmosphere, the report says. Other measures include integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments. The report argues the industry and its resources and skills ""will be critical"" in helping some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies, like low-carbon hydrogen and biofuels, reach maturity. It says that scaling up such technologies and lowering their cost requires qualities the industry has, such as large-scale engineering and project management capabilities. ""Without the industry's input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,"" Birol said. On average, oil and gas companies invest about one per cent of their total capital spending in non-core areas — with the greatest amount in solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Leading companies spend about five per cent, according to the report, which says ""a much more significant change"" in capital spending allocation is needed to accelerate energy transitions. The energy sector can transform without the help of the oil and gas industry, the report reads, but that is a more difficult and expensive path. ""Regardless of which pathway the world follows, climate impacts will become more visible and severe over the coming years, increasing the pressure on all elements of society to find solutions. These solutions cannot be found within today's oil and gas paradigm.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A
147,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-07T22:08:05.248Z,Medical device used during labour falls out of patient 10 weeks later,"As Laura Jokinen made her way home from a walk with her newborn son in October 2018, the shooting pain she'd been experiencing in her abdomen for weeks became unbearable. She limped home and buckled to the floor, screaming for her husband to help. ""It was at that point I reached down and felt a metal device protruding out of my vagina,"" said Jokinen, who works in health care as a risks assessment researcher. ""I freaked out … I didn't know what the device was or where it came from. It looked almost like a battery, and there were wires that were running up inside me. I was afraid to remove it, because I wasn't sure if it was attached to my insides."" The experience points to alarming statistics. Canada saw a major jump — 14 per cent over the last five years — in the number of medical items left inside patients after procedures, according to a study released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), a not-for-profit group that collects data on the quality of health care in the country.  CIHI said 553 such objects were left inside patients over the last two years.  Canada has the highest rate among developed countries of medical items being left inside patients, according to a separate study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That means medical teams across the country need to do a better job of following existing safety procedures, according to Sandi Kossey, senior director of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), a not-for-profit healthcare watchdog. ""There are checks and balances that should happen,"" said Kossey. ""There are enough preventative measures that should be in place, that these things should not happen."" Jokinen, who lives in Parksville, B.C., had to have an emergency caesarean section on Aug. 11, 2018, at the Nanaimo General Hospital. Before surgery, the medical team attached an electrode to the baby's head while he was still in the womb to monitor his heartbeat. Part of the monitor was removed during the C-section. But the medical team forgot to take out the rest.  Two weeks after Jokinen was discharged, she started having complications: an infection of her surgical incision and heavy, prolonged vaginal bleeding. Her doctors prescribed antibiotics but didn't detect what had been left inside her. It remained there for 10 weeks until it dislodged. Jokinen tried to find out, through the regional health authority, what the monitor was made of and how the mistake might have affected her health and that of her baby. ""At that point, he was two months old and I was breastfeeding, so I was really concerned about what risks this posed to his health,"" Jokinen said. Jokinen says she was on pins and needles for more than a month waiting to hear back. The response she finally got, she says, was less than helpful. The Vancouver Island Health Authority told her even the manufacturer couldn't say what the effect might be since the device was only designed and tested for use over periods of 24 hours or less. It said it looked at devices made of similar materials and didn't believe there were any long-term risks to Jokinen or her baby from the breakdown of the components.  Jokinen says she wanted the health authority to take responsibility, but it refused, saying the failure was by the surgeon who is an independent contractor and not an employee.  ""Physicians in B.C. are independent contractors who are licensed and regulated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C.,"" the authority said in an email to Go Public.  Jokinen said she was surprised by  the health authority's reaction. ""They're responsible for their subcontractor's actions and … providing safeguards to make sure that people aren't harmed."" Kossey, at the CPSI, agrees. ""Certainly, they are responsible for what happens under their watch and within their facility,"" she said.  Jokinen chose not to pursue action against the surgeon. Go Public reached out to HealthCareCAN, an organization that represents hospitals across Canada, for comment but did not immediately hear back.  According to the most recent report on the quality of healthcare in OECD countries, a foreign body — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — is left inside a patient in Canada 9.8 times out of every 100,000 surgeries. That's three times the average. The next-highest OECD results were Sweden at 8.3 followed by Netherlands with 4.6 per 100,000. ""The data shows that we're not doing as good as we should be as a developed country,"" Kossey told Go Public.  But she also suggests the reason Canada appears to have more mistakes could be in the accuracy of the reporting itself. ""Some of the other countries … being compared against may have different cultures around how they're collecting and using that information … it's a bit of a mixed signal,"" she said.  Kossey says medical teams need to ensure they do an appropriate inventory of equipment used during all procedures and to communicate clearly with the patient and family members — even in the most chaotic situations — what's being done so there are no surprises. Jokinen was surprised to hear how often something goes wrong. ""That points at a systemic flaw in our healthcare system,"" she said. ""In order to address that, we need to first acknowledge that it's happening. The health authorities need to take responsibility for the actions of their subcontractors and they also have to come up with a mitigation plan to avoid these types of events,"" she said.  The Vancouver Island Health Authority told Jokinen it has made changes. Non-surgical devices like the monitor that was left inside her were added to a checklist of items that need to be retrieved after medical procedures. ""We deeply regret that this patient had a poor care experience and we sincerely apologize to her,"" a spokesperson wrote in its email to Go Public.

148,Anonymous,2020-01-21T17:12:47.018Z,Trucker recounts finding frigid Yukon travellers burning vehicle to stay warm,"Yves Lafond was about half an hour up the road from Carmacks, Yukon, last Monday morning when he spotted it. ""I came out of that curve, and gee, it was a vehicle on fire,"" he recalled. ""You know, you look twice — what do I see? Yeah, it is a vehicle on fire!"" The long-distance truck driver from Whitehorse was the first to find them — three men whose pickup truck went off the road the night before, leaving them stranded in –50 C weather. They had set it on fire to keep from freezing to death. As he approached, Lafond only saw the flaming wreck. ""If there's no vehicle around, like another vehicle around, that means nobody came to help. Where is the driver? Or the people? And I was kind of freaking out a bit,"" Lafond said. Then he spotted them, on the other side of the flames. ""They started waving their hands ... 'OK, alive,' I thought."" The three were alive, but in deep distress. By the time Lafond rolled up, they had been waiting for hours and were dangerously chilled. They scrambled to get into Lafond's warm truck, but it was a struggle.  ""They were moving like robots, really."" Lafond said. By that time, another truck had pulled up behind Lafond and took one of the three stranded travellers in. Then they left the burning wreck behind and headed up the road to Pelly Crossing. Lafond offered them some fresh coffee, but one of the men immediately spilled his cup because his hands were too cold to hold it. As they drove, Lafond heard more about their ordeal.  ""They were telling me some parts, and my foot was going down on that fuel pedal, instinctively. I thought, man, I have to get those guys in the heat, fast."" The men told him they had tried to get wood for a fire, but there was too much snow in the bush. One of them had also started out walking to get help, but soon decided that was a bad idea. Early the next morning, they told Lafond, they were in serious trouble. No cars had passed. One of the men said he had started to feel warm and unzipped his coat — a sign that confusion was setting in.

149,Anonymous,2020-01-23T01:46:25.214Z,Hit-and-run trial adjourned until Friday over security video time code dispute,"The hit-and-run trial of Maurice Johnson in the death of Brady Francis came to an unexpected halt Wednesday for the third time, following a dispute between the Crown and defence about security video time codes. The Crown was expected to wrap its case with the testimony of the lead investigator, who analyzed security video of the road in Saint-Charles where Francis, 22, of Elsipogtog First Nation, was found dead on Feb. 24, 2018. RCMP Const. Mathieu Richard told the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench he reviewed footage taken from two locations along Saint-Charles South Road — the Saint-Charles gas station and the home of Louis Daigle. Richard said he first observed a light-coloured pickup truck similar to the 2003 GMC Sierra seized from Johnson in the gas station video. It was heading eastbound at 9:40 p.m., according to the time code, but the ""readjusted"" time would be 9:33 p.m., he said. On Tuesday, Richard had testified the time on the security camera was about 7.5 minutes fast, so he adjusted the time codes, based on the time on his cellphone. During cross-examination Wednesday, defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux questioned what steps Richard had taken to verify that the time on his cellphone was correct. ""Am I right in assuming you didn't take any steps?"" he asked in French. ""Yes, you are correct,"" Richard replied in French. Lemieux also challenged the officer about what he had done to verify no one had tampered with the security camera system or whether there had been a power outage. Richard said he didn't check either. Lemieux argued Richard had improperly modified his document, entitled Timeline of Events, and that it should not be entered into evidence. Crown prosecutor Pierre Gionet requested time to prepare his response. Justice Denise LeBlanc agreed and adjourned the trial until Friday at 9:30 a.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. Richard is expected to be the Crown's final witness. The defence is expected to call four witnesses. It's not clear whether the accused will take the stand. Earlier in the trial, the former owner and operator of the Saint-Charles gas station testified the time code on her security camera was about seven or eight minutes off from the actual time. The court also heard from the stepdaughter of Louis Daigle, who said the time code on his security camera was off by about two or three minutes. The gas station video shows Francis walking eastbound along the road a few minutes before the light-coloured truck drives past. Lemieux pointed out eight other vehicles are captured on the videos, five travelling eastbound and three westbound. He asked Richard whether any of them were checked for damage. They were not, said Richard. The court has heard the damage to the front of Johnson's truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck. Francis's body was found lying on the side of the westbound lane, between the gas station and a friend's house farther east down the road, where he had attended a diaper party. The Crown argued the video evidence helps complete the picture and prove the Crown's theory that the truck Johnson was driving was the one that struck Francis. Earlier this week, the court watched Johnson's videotaped statement to police and heard from officers who questioned him following the incident. Johnson told police he initially thought he had struck a deer in Saint-Charles during a leisure drive with his wife the night Francis was killed. Under police questioning, Johnson said he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. Elsipogtog First Nation Chief Arren Sock was among those who attended the proceedings on Wednesday. He was in the adjacent courtroom, where a volunteer is providing translation for the family and friends of Francis who do not speak French. The trial, which began on Jan. 13, is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-8-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5435631,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-7-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5434158 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-6-brady-francis-trial-1.5432117,N/A
150,Pegah Salari,2020-01-16T18:50:22.772Z,OPINION | Tragedy broke Iranian community's heart. An outpouring of love will help it heal  ,"I was standing on the second floor at the Saville Centre, watching the team of volunteers prepare the stage about three hours before Sunday's memorial.  Baskets of flowers were being moved around and large framed pictures of the victims of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 were being placed in front of the podium.  Even from that distance, I could see the faces of the victims. It was as if they were watching the volunteers work.  Nasim Rahmanifar's picture, with her beautiful smile; I could imagine so vividly how she would be one of the people helping, if her face was not stuck in that frame forever.   How could a smile that beautiful be trapped forever inside a wooden frame? The picture of Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two little girls fit so effortlessly among the flowers. My goodness, if Dorina or Daria were not gone, they would have been too young to attend this memorial! That is a piece of reality I don't have the strength to focus on. A few feet away, in yet another wooden frame, Dr. Shekoufeh Choupannejad and her two daughters Sara and Saba Saadat were standing side by side. On the far left side, Elnaz Nabiyi's photo somehow looked like the only one who was watching me as I looked at them from above. I cried in silence all through Sunday: getting ready as the emcee, in between the speeches, listening to the tributes, walking up and down from the podium. I cried as I watched people coming in, as I hugged friends and families, as I looked at the non-Iranian crowd who showed up to pay their respects even though they likely didn't know anyone.  A green room was assigned to the speakers and dignitaries; again, I cried as soon as I stepped into the room.  Going in, I wondered if my professor from back when I was a student would remember me.  Dr. Joseph Doucet, now dean of the school of business, saw me and came forward. Before I knew it, I was crying in his arms. It was as if I had graduated a week ago. It's amazing how 12 years can feel like a week and a week can feel like months. Sunday's memorial was a beautiful event.  And I'm not thinking that just because everything went well. The presence of people is what touched many grieving hearts.  With a loss this big, there is no relief. Nothing can help but time. And time doesn't always move like a river, especially not now.  Looking down at the main floor, watching the crowd come in, I thought to myself, ""I wish I could tell you, one by one, how much it means to see you here."" Going down the stairs for sound check, I passed by the media in the room. A CBC camera tech waved at me; I went down the stairs in tears.  How supportive everyone has been, every reporter, news anchor, radio host, freelance writer that I met after this tragic event. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did all these people become my friends? And friend is an understatement. What is the word for a person that you just met, who looks you in the eyes and makes you believe that you are not alone? I looked at the people, Iranian and non-Iranian, sitting side by side. It looked like a freshly knitted scarf, meshed like one piece. I thought, did we always feel so connected, so much like we belong?  When I went behind the podium to start, I felt a little tremble inside. I could see the first words that came out of my mouth, floating like snowflakes, dancing so calmly.  I looked at the crowd and at my words floating in front of me, and all of a sudden I felt so strong.  These are my people, all of them, Iranian or not. I knew that in my heart.  As O Canada was being sung, speaking in front of them didn't seem so hard. I only found out on Monday how many of my friends and co-workers had either attended, or watched, the memorial. Now, a week after the crash, our hearts like broken ceramics, we know it's time for us to speak up.  To glue ourselves back together, one piece at a time, with resilience and all this shared love — like kintsugi, the elegant ancient Japanese art of mending pottery.  The Iranian community has formed a new bond with Canada. This tragedy did break us apart but the love and support we received glued us back together, even stronger now. And like kintsugi, we will slowly heal, and with every day that goes by, we will become closer to our hosting country.  Not ashamed of our scars, we understand that our wounds are what makes us, us. It was –35 C on Sunday, and I believe I speak for every Iranian in Edmonton when I say we had never felt so warm. This column is an opinion.

151,Anonymous,2020-01-17T17:51:43.300Z,Eminem releases surprise album advocating for gun control,"Rapper Eminem has once again dropped a surprise album, releasing Music to Be Murdered By on Friday. The follow-up to 2018's Kamikaze — also released without warning — was announced on Twitter just after midnight.  The Detroit rapper also released a new music video for Darkness, one of the 20 tracks on the album, that depicts a shooting at a concert. The lyrics and storyline of the video specifically allude to the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that left 58 people dead, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The video closes with audio and video footage of news broadcasts from other recent mass shooting around the U.S. as well as an appeal for viewers to register to vote and ""help change gun laws in America."" Warning: The following video contains graphic scenes of violence and strong language ""When will this end? When enough people care,"" reads the text. A link to the music video on Eminem's website encourages viewers to contact or visit several gun violence prevention organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Sandy Hook Promise. The album's cover art features blood spatter and a bearded Eminem clad in a suit and fedora and holding a shovel. An alternate cover features the same splatter as well as a hatless Eminem holding both a hatchet and a gun to his head in an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 album of the same name.  ""Inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!"" Eminem posted via Twitter. Another track from the album, Unaccommodating, has sparked outrage for also touching on a recent tragedy. In a line from the song, the rapper references the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb attack, which killed 22 people outside a concert by American singer Ariana Grande. eminem stans are really trying to defend his joke about a terrorist attack that killed 22 people and gave ariana PTSD...literally bye If y’all are hyping up eminem after his line “i’m contemplating yelling bombs away on the game like i’m outside an ariana grande concert” please unfollow me that’s disgusting Some listeners labelled the line ""sick"" or ""disgusting."" Figen Murray, whose 29-year-old son Martyn Hett died in the attack, took to Twitter to describe the lyric as ""totally pointless"" and ""distasteful."" Ok, I just watched the 11 min clip. Feels like he is piggybacking on the fame of Ariana grande and Justin bieber and says distasteful things about other celebrities. Not clever. Totally pointless. And before all Eminem fans pounce on me, I am not interested and will not engage. <a href=""https://t.co/fE9MbepeqN"">https://t.co/fE9MbepeqN</a> Music to Be Murdered By is Eminem's 11th studio album, according to his website. The album includes work from many collaborators, including Ed Sheeran, Skylar Grey, Anderson .Paak and Juice WRLD, the 21-year-old rapper who died in December.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/eminem-surprise-album-1.5430669,[],N/A
152,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-18T15:48:59.918Z, Did a killer walk free after this man's autopsy?,"A battered body, neck abrasions and signs of a violent struggle. When the RCMP first investigated the death of Preston Lochead at his home in Airdrie, Alta., in 2010, they called in the major crimes unit. The body of Lochead, 36, was found in the basement of his home, next to an overturned table. His roommate told police he saw a man scurrying from the house after the discovery of the body. Police suspected foul play, began interviewing witnesses and brought that man in for questioning. But then came the autopsy. Calgary medical examiner Dr. Evan Matshes told the RCMP that contrary to what they might have thought, Lochead died from cardiac disease. And with no homicide, there was no crime to investigate. The RCMP broke the news to Lochead's widow, Sally Wheeler. ""I was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' I was so shocked that this is what [the RCMP] was telling me,"" she said in a recent interview with The Fifth Estate's Mark Kelley. Lochead's death is one of several cases that came under scrutiny in 2012. Alberta's Justice Ministry ordered a review of some of the autopsies done by a Calgary medical examiner after questions were raised about the accuracy of his findings. Documents obtained by The Fifth Estate reveal that Alberta Justice commissioned that review, which exposed several potential miscarriages of justice. Wheeler said the RCMP told her a few months after her husband died that the autopsy prevented them from laying charges. ""They mentioned that he had a blow to the head and a broken bone in his neck,"" she said. ""But they couldn't take it any further because it hadn't been ruled a homicide and I was like, 'What?'"" Turns out Wheeler wasn't the only one to question the autopsy results. Documents obtained recently by The Fifth Estate show that a second medical opinion from three expert forensic pathologists — written two years after Lochead died — differed from the original medical examiner's finding. They wrote that Lochead's death was more likely a homicide by ""strangulation."" Senior officials in the Alberta Justice Ministry received that report as part of a larger review of Matshes's autopsies, but the findings were buried in court files for several years until unearthed by The Fifth Estate. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Wheeler and roommate Jimmy Dean, who were both in the house the night of the death, say it was obvious to them from the beginning that Lochead was killed. The evening started with Lochead acting as a Good Samaritan. He had gone out to pick up refreshments for an evening poker game and came back with two strangers he met at the store. The strangers claimed their vehicle had broken down at the side of the road. Lochead, a friendly Maritimer and father of three whom Wheeler described as her ""angel,"" wanted to make sure the stranded travellers would not freeze in the frigid November night. Wheeler remembers the two men as Americans who spoke Russian. One of the men appears to have stayed late. Dean went to bed early and woke up just before 7 a.m. to discover the body. He said when he was on the phone to 911, he heard movement in another room. ""That's when I seen this fellow standing in the hallway,"" Dean told The Fifth Estate. ""I told him to stay and he opened the door and took off."" Dean and Wheeler said police later told them that the stranger from the hallway was hiding in an unlocked car down the road. The American was taken in for questioning and treated for injuries he claimed were sustained in a fight with Lochead. Dean said the RCMP told him some of what the American said in the police interrogation.   According to the suspect, a struggle began after Lochead began to have concerns about who the visitor really was. ""That's how the fight started because the guy didn't want to give Preston his ID,"" Dean said. Soon after the death, local news reports indicated that the RCMP were already getting signals from the medical examiner that it might not be ruled a homicide. ""Police are still awaiting Monday's autopsy results to determine if the struggle contributed to Lochead's death or if he died from natural causes afterward,"" the Calgary Herald reported. According to Wheeler, the RCMP told her the American was eventually allowed to return to the United States. Wheeler said the RCMP told her: ""We're keeping an eye on him and we're in touch with the police down there."" But months later, Wheeler said, the RCMP told her that the finalized autopsy report meant they could not lay charges. A later review of 14 of Matshes's medical files would include Lochead's autopsy. That review, commissioned by Alberta's Justice Ministry, stated that the medical examiner made unreasonable conclusions in 13 cases.  Airdrie RCMP told The Fifth Estate recently that Alberta Justice did not provide them with the 2012 report pointing to the death as a homicide. A major crimes investigator at the RCMP was assigned to check their old case file and did not find the report. ""There is no communication from Alberta Justice on this investigation,"" Airdrie RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Laurel Scott said in a recent email. In their peer review report to Alberta Justice, the expert medical pathologists wrote that more ""weight"" should have been given to ""strangulation"" as the cause of Lochead's death. ""A homicide manner [of death] is more appropriate,"" the three pathologists wrote in their November 2012 critique of Matshes's original autopsy. Wheeler is still confused about why nothing happened next. ""There was a fight, he's dead. It was so clear to me,"" Wheeler said. ""Why didn't they reopen the case?"" Eric Tolppanen, now head of Alberta Crown Prosecution Service and then a senior justice official, declined an interview with The Fifth Estate. In a statement, he did not answer directly whether the expert review panel document was provided to the RCMP in Airdrie. Tolppanen said that the RCMP were told that ""this police file would benefit from additional peer review."" He said that the RCMP acted on that advice and later ""sent the file to the Crown for review for possible charges."" Tolppanen said that Crown prosecutors determined there was ""no reasonable likelihood of conviction."" However, the RCMP appear to dispute that version of events.  The RCMP agree that in 2015 they discussed the case with the Crown prosecutor who did not support laying charges. However, the Mounties say they were not told about the expert peer review panel finding of a possible homicide. ""The RCMP is not aware of a formal review that was done on the [medical examiner's] autopsy report,"" Scott said in her email to The Fifth Estate. Wheeler points the finger directly at Alberta Justice for not acting more quickly back in 2012 when they learned the death may have been a homicide. ""Why did nothing happen?"" she said. ""Why did it just stop there? So they determine he was killed, but then say 'Oh, I guess that doesn't matter?' That's not right."" Wheeler is calling on Alberta Justice to provide the documents to the RCMP so that they can reopen their investigation. ""Why wasn't that guy brought back to Canada to face charges?"" she said. Matshes declined repeated requests for an interview with The Fifth Estate. In statements to the CBC, he said he stands by his work. In 2013, Alberta Justice agreed to set aside the report of the expert panel at his request. Matshes successfully argued he was not adequately consulted in the process and that the review was based on limited information. A judge signed off on that agreement in November 2013. In a brief to the Court of Queen's Bench in Alberta, the justice minister said it was ""integral to the administration of justice"" that they continue to investigate the accuracy of Matshes's work and promised to hold a second review panel. In a recent statement, Matshes said he was also cleared by an expert pathologist working for the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons in a related investigation. ""That expert reviewer, who was in possession of all of the evidence that I had at the time I certified the deaths, concluded that I met the standard of care in each case,"" he wrote. The Fifth Estate has also obtained records from that college review. A complaint was made to the college in 2012 about the appropriateness of Matshes's dissections during some autopsies. The college ruled that Matshes was permitted to make those dissections. The college forensic pathologist also concluded that homicide was a likely scenario in Lochead's death. The college expert, whose name was redacted in the report acquired by The Fifth Estate, stated that although cardiac disease may have been a factor in the death, the ruling should have been ""homicide,"" as the violent struggle precipitated any existing physical condition. ""If one determines that the cause of death was cardiac precipitated by the physical altercation, the manner becomes homicide,"" the college expert wrote. The college's forensic pathologist also noted ""evidence of blunt force injury"" and ""neck compression."" The college expert also contemplated the possibility of charges against the killer and noted that careful documentation of the injuries would be essential as the accused might try to argue self-defence. ""If charges were considered, a potential defence in this case would be self-defence. In such a case, documentation of all injuries to the deceased is essential,"" the college review wrote. Today, Wheeler wants Alberta Justice held accountable. ""I want somebody to apologize to his family and to me and for all the people that cared about him,"" she said. ""They just looked at this information and decided it wasn't enough, it wasn't important enough. Well, Preston was damn important to us.""

153,Franca G. Mignacca,2020-01-22T22:14:30.440Z,'It could've gone right through my head': Quebec woman injured by flying ice on highway,"Karen Cliffe was driving along Highway 40 Friday, on her way to pick her daughter up from school in the West Island. As she drove in rush hour traffic, she happened to notice snow blowing off the roof of a truck five cars ahead of her. All of a sudden, she was covered in ice and glass — and felt a sharp pain in her face. ""The windshield was still breaking as I was driving. There were still little pieces that were shattering and coming in the car so by the time I got off, there was not much windshield left,"" Cliffe told CBC Montreal's Daybreak Wednesday morning.  A chunk of ice had come flying off the truck ahead of her, crashing through her windshield. She was in complete shock but still in the middle of traffic. She realized she needed to think fast. ""I tried to get off the highway. It's a bit of a blur,"" said Cliffe.  ""I remember looking to the right, making sure there was nothing beside me and then veering as fast as I could to get off the road.""  After stopping her car, Cliffe sat there in shock. She remembers crying and hyperventilating, unsure what to do next. She eventually called for an ambulance.  Along with her damaged car, she was left with several scratches and bruises across her face and a minor concussion. ""The good thing is it was probably the flat part [that hit me]. The doctor was saying that if it had been jagged, it could've gone right through my head,"" Cliffe said.  Pierre-Olivier Fortin, a spokesperson for CAA-Quebec, said this isn't an isolated incident.  This month alone, there have been several similar incidents across the country.  Earlier this week, a man driving west of Ottawa was injured after a chunk of ice flew off a nearby car and went through his windshield. On Tuesday, a thick chunk of ice flew off a transport truck and slammed into a double-decker bus in Mississauga, Ont. No one was injured in that incident but the vehicle's windshield was damaged.  ""You would think that it's common sense to remove snow and ice from your car, but we see now and then people forgetting that and it's unfortunate because really it's a road safety issue,"" said Fortin.  In 2018, the provincial government updated Quebec's Highway Safety Code to include a section on snow removal.  According to that new regulation, ""no person may drive a vehicle covered with snow, ice or any other matter that may detach from the vehicle.""  Should the driver fail to clear their car of snow or ice, they can be fined. When it comes to trucks, the responsibility to clean the vehicle is split between the client, the company and the driver.  There are several ways drivers can remove ice from heavy trucks, according to Transports Québec's website: mechanical stations, special stations equipped with ladders or staircases, as well as brooms made specifically to reach the roof of the vehicle. As for regular cars, Fortin recommends patience when it comes to removing thick layers of ice.  ""If you have a very thick layer of ice covering your car, it may be a good idea to heat up your car before starting to remove it,"" said Fortin.  ""A strong arm and a scraper is going to do the job."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/highway-40-ice-flies-through-windshield-1.5436475,[],N/A

155,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-08T13:00:00.380Z,The RCMP said it didn't have any records about an investigation. But it had thousands.,"The RCMP is apologizing for saying it didn't have any records about its 11-month investigation into the death of Michel Vienneau, who was shot by a Bathurst Police Force member in 2015. In fact, the police agency had more than 10,000 records about the Nova Scotia RCMP's investigation into Vienneau's death, which led to criminal charges against two Bathurst Police Force officers. The charges were dropped in 2017 after a preliminary inquiry. More than two years after CBC News asked for the records through an access to information request, and more than four years after Vienneau's death, the RCMP disclosed nearly 1,800 pages of documents and more than 1,000 images and videos related to the investigation. That came only after an investigation by the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The RCMP blamed human error, saying the search for records wasn't done properly. ""Although in the end it is clear that we did not meet our obligations, this appears to be a process failure, not the result of any ill-intent,"" Dan Brien, the RCMP's director of issues management and media relations, wrote in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""I am not aware of any intent to hide or suppress information on the part of RCMP personnel."" No one from the RCMP was made available for an interview. Minutes after Vienneau was shot outside Bathurst's Via Rail station on the morning of Jan. 12, 2015, Nova Scotia RCMP officers were called in to investigate. New Brunswick doesn't have its own serious incident response team like neighbouring Nova Scotia. Instead, police agencies from other jurisdictions are often tasked with investigating police-involved shootings or deaths. In this case, the two subject officers were employed by the Bathurst Police Force but worked in the now-disbanded Northeast Integrated Intelligence Unit. The unit, made up of officers from several police forces in the area, including RCMP, focused on gathering intelligence about drugs and organized crime. Vienneau appeared on the officers' radar that day when their supervisor, RCMP Sgt. Ron DeSilva, now an inspector, received Crime Stoppers tips that Vienneau was returning from Montreal with a load of drugs. The tips were false. For months, a team of Nova Scotia RCMP officers pieced together what led to the shooting. They interviewed about 100 witnesses. Lead investigator Larry Wilson described the investigation as ""complex"" and ""exhaustive"" in an email he sent to his team after the investigation concluded. ""The fact that the subjects of this case are police officers added another layer of complexity but each and everyone of you brought an unbiased and professional approach to your tasks,"" Wilson wrote. But when CBC News asked for all records about the Nova Scotia RCMP investigation into Vienneau's death, the RCMP had a surprising response. ""Based on the information provided, a search for records was conducted in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"" Insp. Richard Haye of the RCMP's access to information and privacy branch wrote in a May 2017 letter. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to locate records which respond to your request.""  How is it possible that a division of Canada's largest police force could spend months on a complex investigation into a man's death but not have any records about the investigation? It wasn't possible because it wasn't true. The original request, filed in February 2017, also asked for records that detailed the process of sending the file to the Crown, which has to approve criminal charges in New Brunswick, and about the false Crime Stoppers tips that led police to Vienneau on the day of his death. CBC News filed a complaint about the request in June 2017, suggesting it was inconceivable the RCMP wouldn't have records about a lengthy investigation. ""We posed numerous questions regarding the institution's processing of your request and the nature of their search for the records requested,"" the investigation report from the commissioner's office says. ""A second tasking was conducted and the RCMP located relevant records which were then reviewed to determine which documents could be released.""  An investigator with the Office of the Information Commissioner was tasked with reviewing the records, combing through nine CDs. One CD had thousands of written records on 6,645 pages. There were also more than 3,500 photos, videos or audio records that were reviewed, according to correspondence sent to CBC News. Some of those records ultimately weren't disclosed, for a variety of reasons. Some were duplicates. The final package didn't include any video recordings of what unfolded that day outside Bathurst's Via Rail station. According to the Nova Scotia RCMP's report on the shooting, no such video exists. While the commissioner's investigation prompted the RCMP to disclose records it previously said it didn't have, it doesn't explain what went wrong in the first place. That's problematic for Ken Rubin, an Ottawa-based investigator and researcher who has spent decades using Canada's freedom of information system to draw out information that's in the public interest. ""I think they have to be held more accountable,"" Rubin said about the commissioner's office. ""You can't just go from no records to 10,000 and say, 'Oh, aren't we wonderful. We got the records for you.' No, what happened? Come on.""  In its explanation, the RCMP said it relies on people to search its records. ""In addition to our ongoing challenges related to the scope and volume of incoming requests, we occasionally encounter situations where individual searches do not identify all the documents that they should,"" Brien wrote in an email. ""In this case, through the Information Commissioner's investigation, we discovered that, for a variety of reasons, the document search was not executed properly."" He said not all of the units that should have been asked to search were asked to do so. Others who were searching found no records, which wasn't accurate. ""This situation has provided us with valuable insight into gaps in our system and we will continue to take every opportunity to improve our processes."" Rubin sees the case as part of a larger problem with the RCMP's access to information system. Last year, the RCMP was wading through a backlog of unanswered requests, prompting the police force to reverse a policy that forced members to go through access to information to get their own medical or personnel files. RCMP backlogged with access-to-information requests from its own staff Earlier this year, an access to information officer emailed CBC News to ask whether the requester still wanted overdue records from 2017, noting the RCMP is ""experiencing a high volume of requests with limited resources."" ""It's common knowledge that the RCMP, at least in terms of access to information, has not been that well organized or forthcoming in the last few years and has huge delays and some other problems … they are not the top of the transparency bureaucracy,"" Rubin said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vienneau-rcmp-foi-1.5387196,[],N/A
156,Adam Hunter,2020-01-23T03:26:50.512Z,Sask. government moves to become first province to bar sex offenders from changing names,"In what the provincial government says is a first in Canada, Saskatchewan is taking steps to prevent convicted sex offenders from changing their names. An order in council approved by cabinet last week will require a criminal record check for people over the age of 18 seeking a name change. ""It would not be in the public interest to register a change of name for a person convicted of specific sexual offences in the past 10 years,"" the order reads. Saskatchewan would be the first province to refuse a name change based on a criminal record, the Ministry of Justice said. The amendment of the Change Name Act 1995 will take effect on Feb. 18 this year. ""We are moving ahead with proposed changes to prevent offenders who prey on the most vulnerable in our society from changing their name to avoid public disclosure and scrutiny,"" said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice. The government said the list of applicable offences will be based around those that require a person to register as a sex offender. In 2018, Minister of Justice Don Morgan said the government was considering a change to the act. This coincided with recent cases in the province of convicted sex offenders changing their names. In Regina this week, 50-year-old Gabriel Michael Fisher was in court facing charges related to child pornography. In 2016, he was designated a long-term offender under the name Kevin Daniel Hudec. He legally changed his name in March 2018. He was arrested weeks later. Earlier this month, the Regina Leader-Post reported that a convicted sex offender had moved from the United States and was living in Regina. David Donald Shumey, 76, changed his name to David Donald Stryker. He was convicted of sexually assaulting a minor and committing child pornography offences in the United States. When the issue was raised to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice in early January, it said it was unaware that Stryker had re-entered Canada and had listed an address in Regina.  In 2018, a Saskatoon man, Justin William Pasloski — formerly named Justin Gerard Gryba — was thrown back into the spotlight when it was discovered he had changed his name. He had been convicted in 2016 of making child pornography and sentenced to two years less a day.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-sex-offender-name-change-1.5436548,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-man-child-porn-trial-1.5433507 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/david-donald-stryker-moves-to-regina-1.5418126 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-man-pleads-guilty-child-porn-1.3514636,N/A
157,Anonymous,2020-01-23T12:30:00.602Z,St. John's storm causes empty shelves in grocery stores in central Newfoundland,"If you're noticing slim pickings at stores in central Newfoundland, it's probably because of the blizzard that has shut down St. John's for the past six days. Dominion posted signs around its locations in Grand Falls-Windsor and Gander earlier this week, saying the state of emergency in the capital city was causing product shortages. ""We are doing our very best to deliver the best experience possible given these circumstances,"" the signs read. More than 300 kilometres away, several containers of goods destined for grocery stores are still sitting at the Oceanex dock in St. John's after three cargo ships docks during the state of emergency. It's not necessarily the cause of the shortages in central Newfoundland, since 80 per cent of Oceanex's business is in the St. John's metro region, but it is indicative of the challenges in shipping produce after the storm. Oceanex was given essential service status, and began loading trucks Tuesday afternoon despite the state of emergency prohibiting most vehicles from being on the road. CEO Sid Hynes said the situation is getting better by the day, but the backlog of shipments since Friday has caused delays. ""We have major customers, large customers and until they are able to receive their freight, they're asking us to hold it,"" Hynes told Newfoundland Morning.  In St. John's, food supply was said to be in good shape when stores opened for the first time Tuesday, since most grocery store's distribution centres were well-stocked. They were unable to get trucks out to stores outside the Avalon, however. Erin Higdon of Atlantic Grocery Distributors said her company is used to weather delays, but this was beyond anything they'd faced before. ""There is no doubt with the volume of business that we do that some of those containers [at Oceanex] belong to us, and we're trying to work on the best plan to get them here and out to the customers who need them,"" she said. Higdon said they were working on getting back to normal. Both she and Hynes warned it could take a few days. The storm has been a lesson in food security for the island, said Josh Smee, CEO of the non-profit group Food First NL. It showed the ripple effect when one of the few commercial ports in the province is shut down for days at a time. ""It really does echo through the whole food system on the island,"" Smee said. It's a reality that's not going to change any time soon. Most food enters the province through cargo shipments to St. John's or Port aux Basques and is trucked to stores throughout Newfoundland and Labrador. When Marine Atlantic or Oceanex face lengthy delays, things get sparse. ""That's one inherent kind of weak point in our food system that in some ways is always going to be there,"" Smee said. Another lesson people can take away from the storm is that the way you prepare for an emergency is changing, he said, The typical rule of thumb is to have enough food and supplies on hand for 72 hours. Now into the sixth day, many people have gone well beyond the means they stockpiled before the storm hit. ""We might need to go longer than that [72-hour window],"" he said. ""We're seeing a lot more unstable weather and it's causing disruption to our food systems on a more regular basis."" The province's most recent climate change report, The Way Forward on Climate Change, addressed changes forecast by the middle of this century. One of the predictions is that severe storms could contain at least 20 per cent more precipitation than normal. Smee said people should not just stock up for themselves, but also stock up with others in mind. ""For those of us who are in a position [to stock up], we need to think as a community. How do we support folks who would be really challenged by that level of disruption?"" Hynes, meanwhile, said there are lessons to learn but his company will do its best to get the shipments out whenever they can be received. He said it could be another couple days before all the freight is delivered.

158,"Kate Porter, Joanne Chianello",2020-01-22T15:19:47.678Z,City's hands tied by LRT maintenance contract,"Four months into a 30-year contract with Rideau Transit Maintenance to keep the Confederation Line running smoothly, some city officials say the relationship is already faltering. One outspoken transit commissioner is even calling for the city to break the $1 billion long-term deal, and bring the maintenance of the trains in-house. ""Because clearly, holding back the money is not enough incentive for them to do their job,"" said Sarah Wright-Gilbert, one of the commission's four appointed citizen members. Since the Confederation Line launched in mid-September, the city hasn't paid Rideau Transit a cent. Its monthly payments are supposed to be $4.5 to $5 million, so the group is currently out up to $20 million. Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM) is an arm of Rideau Transit Group (RTG), the partnership between ACS Infrastructure, SNC-Lavalin and Ellis Don that built Ottawa's $2.1-billion Confederation Line. RTM is in charge of maintaining the entire LRT system, including the Alstom Citadis Spirit light rail vehicles. RTM actually subcontracts the maintenance of the trains themselves to France-based Alstom, which did not respond to questions Tuesday.  In the last week alone, one train somehow pulled down 80 metres of overhead electrical cable, and other trains had issues with their wheels, causing them to skid and smoke. Switch issues over the weekend caused hours of delay. When RTG handed over control of the LRT to the city last August, the system was supposed to come with 17 double-car, fully tested and commissioned trains. It's now unclear whether all 17 ever worked. These last few days, so many trains have had issues that, at times, only eight or nine have been available to carry passengers. Transit chair Coun. Allan Hubley pinned the recent problems on RTM not meeting the city's expectations for maintaining trains and dealing with winter-related issues. Hubley and his colleagues will be looking for answers from Rideau Transit CEO Peter Lauch, who is set to appear at an emergency transit commission called for Thursday afternoon. But unlike Wright-Gilbert, Hubley doesn't believe the LRT's issues have become so dire that the city should go through the complicated legal process of breaking from RTM. ""That's bad news if we have to go that route. To me, that's the last straw [when] we're absolutely convinced they don't have the expertise to do what they're supposed to do."" Mayor Jim Watson agreed that it is too early to be talking about the possibility of pulling out of the maintenance contract.  ""I think most members of the public want us to deal with getting the damn trains fixed, first and foremost, and then deal with repercussions with the consortium,"" said Watson, adding he has had no discussions about possible litigation. O-Train Line 1: Afternoon peak services normally use 13 trains for a train every 4 minutes. RTM has provided 10 trains. Trains will run approximately every 5 minutes. <a href=""https://t.co/dHTT4UcS2c"">https://t.co/dHTT4UcS2c</a> In recent days, the city has made a point of emphasizing how it's RTG that is failing commuters, and not the city. It appears OC Transpo boss John Manconi is less willing to speak for RTG — at the news conference last Thursday to address the collapsed 80 metres of electrical cable, Manconi stood at the back, behind reporters. At the next day's news conference, Manconi sat at the table with other officials, but said little. Instead, it appears that the city is insisting that Rideau Transit's Lauch, who has rarely spoken to the media over the years of this project, be on hand to answer questions. While city officials are at pains to focus the blame for the problems on RTM, it is difficult to see what the city can do at this point to improve the system other than holding back maintenance payments — a strategy that doesn't seem to be fixing the trains any faster. As Hubley said: ""It's big money. Wouldn't you love to be making $5 million to do a job? Get to work and do the job.""  Watson is still confident that withholding payments is effective leverage because it hits RTM ""in the pocketbook and also hurts their credibility and reputation both nationally and worldwide. ""But my concern and my preoccupation and that of our staff has been to get these problems resolved find the root causes of some of the problems that continue to happen.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lrt-trains-rtm-contract-1.5434591,[],N/A
159,Garrett Barry,2019-11-04T15:41:35.372Z,RCMP probing Bunyan's Cove finances after complaint from new committee,"The RCMP have launched an investigation into past financial practices at the Bunyan's Cove local service district, following the dissolution of the former committee and a complaint by the new committee's members. Representatives from the new committee say they filed a complaint with the police in late September, the same day they got access to the local service district's bank account. The financial situation means the community's dream of purchasing a new fire truck is now in doubt, and it will have to continue to rely on a vehicle that is nearly a half-century old. ""We had a public meeting when we found out the money was missing, and we had grown men and women here with tears in their eyes,"" said new local service committee chair Annie Perry. In interviews with CBC News, some current and past representatives are raising questions about the community's financial situation. Perry said she believes thousands of dollars is missing from the district's bank account, and she's seen cheques that she believes were written inappropriately before her term began. Perry took her position with the new district committee on Sept. 16, after the Department of Municipal Affairs called for a public meeting and dissolved the former committee. She said there is evidence of unexplained spending between 2017 and 2018. ""There's big amounts of money being written out,"" she said in an interview. ""For a little community, where did all this money go?"" David Squibb, another new member of the local service district committee, and Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, also spoke to CBC News. Each said they believed money may have been inappropriately spent. The new seven-member committee is split, with some other members condemning Perry's choice to speak publicly about the community's finances while a police investigation is underway. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department of Municipal Affairs said it was aware of the complaint to police, which it described as ""possible financial irregularities,"" and was planning a financial audit. The three new representatives told CBC News that thousands of dollars in funding that was earmarked for the purchase of a new fire truck for the Bunyan's Cove Fire Department appears to be gone from the community's bank account. Correspondence between governments show that in 2018, the Department of Municipal Affairs sent $248,131 to the local service district under its fire protection vehicles infrastructure program.  The district and the fire department were expected to raise another $62,034, and borrow even more to cover the HST and GST portion of the purchase. But the purchase of the fire truck was never completed — the truck remains in storage in Clarenville — and as of Sept. 20, the local service district had only $223,919 in its account. ""There's no money there that we're allowed to touch, because the $223,000 is not ours to spend,"" said Perry.   ""And if we don't get this new fire truck that's sitting in Clarenville, that money got to go back to the government."" Nicholson said the local service district has collected another $10,000, as residents have been paying their yearly fees. But the committee has also been stuck with overdue bills that must be paid — and they are not quite sure if more are coming. Perry said the local service district owes three months of bills to the garbage collector and the power company. CBC News obtained financial documents, including photocopies of cheques and partial bank statements for the Bunyan's Cove LSD account at CIBC. The documentation includes photocopies of 12 cheques that were written to Stephanie Chatman, a former member of the local service district committee, and two businesses that are linked to her: Chatman's Convenience and Chatman's Welding. Altogether, the cheques total a combined $96,598. The cheques were written between April 2017 and July 2018, and each cheque shows two signatures. Eleven of the 12 cheques have no information on the memo field that would indicate what the payment was for. The biggest payment, for $32,693, went to Chatman's Welding and was dated July 26, 2018. On Aug. 31, Stephanie Chatman, trading as Chatman's Welding, wrote a $100,000 cheque to the local service district. That cheque was deposited on Sept. 16 — the same day that the provincial government dissolved the former local service district committee. Chatman was one of two remaining members on the committee that was being dissolved. A full committee has seven members, but over the course of 2017 and 2018 committee members had resigned, and the committee was down to two this summer. There were several attempts to hold public meetings to elect new members, but those meetings never attracted enough residents from the community. Stephanie Chatman did not respond to several interview requests from CBC News. Eleven of the 12 cheques written to Chatman or her companies show what appear to be the signatures of two former LSD members — Chelsea Keats and Wade Bowring. When CBC News contacted Keats for comment, Clarenville lawyer James Hughes replied. Hughes wrote that his client was anticipating a call from the RCMP's investigating officer to give a statement as a potential witness. ""The signatures on the cheques purporting to be Ms. Keats's were forged and during that time period when the cheques were written, Ms. Keats was not part of the committee,"" Hughes wrote. Hughes wrote that he advised his client to only speak with police. Meanwhile, Wade Bowring — whose signature also appears to be on 11 of those 12 cheques — declined to comment about financial practices during his term on the committee, or why his signature appeared to be on those cheques. A local service district member said Bowring has told them that he did not sign inappropriate cheques. Reginald Perry was one of only two members who remained active on the local service district before it was dissolved Sept. 16. The other was Stephanie Chatman. Perry said his three years on the committee were ""terrible"" and he ""didn't know anything that was going on."" Perry told CBC News that he spent the majority of his term fighting for access to financial documents, which he said Chatman held.  He alleged his consistent requests were ignored, and also said he wrote to the Department of Municipal Affairs to ask it to launch an investigation. Other former committee members could not be reached by CBC News, or declined comment. Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, said there are discrepancies between receipts provided to homeowners paying their fees, and money that was deposited into the CIBC account. ""From the receipts that I had, there was like $53,000 and change for receipts that people paid for their fees, and the deposit book only shows $27,000 and change,"" she said. The Bunyan's Cove local service district is responsible for providing water service, garbage collection and fire protection for the households in the community. Squibb, who volunteered with the fire department before starting with the local service district committee last month, said there are now questions about how the community will pay for a new fire truck. The new truck would replace a 1971 Ford 750. ""Right now, the old fire truck that we've got there, it leaks water. So every so often, you've got to go fill the tank up, top the tank up,"" Squbb said. ""Two years ago, we had a breakdown with one of the brakes.… We had to order to the States to get parts, because nobody has it anymore."" The fire department raised its own money for the truck, which Squibb says remains in the department's own bank account.  But because other money appears to be missing, the truck remains parked in Clarenville.

160,Heidi Atter,2020-01-21T17:01:51.901Z,Unifor president Jerry Dias arrested at Regina's Co-op Refinery,"Unifor national president Jerry Dias was arrested along with six other members of the union on Monday afternoon amid rising tensions in a dispute with the Co-op Refinery in Regina.  Unifor 594 represents about 800 employees at the oil refinery. The arrests came after Unifor members set up blockades to prevent the flow of traffic in and out of the facility. ""Unifor members had completely blocked the entrances/exits to the Co-op Refinery Complex, not allowing vehicles to enter or exit the property,"" the Regina Police Service said in a statement.  The blockades were taken down Monday evening.  A court injunction issued in December stated that picketers could block someone's access to the refinery for no more than 10 minutes and only to provide information on the union's cause. It also said that anyone who declined to hear the information should be let through. Dias said at a media conference Monday morning that the blockades were set up by members of other Unifor locals. He argued that they therefore did not violate the injunction. ""We'll deal with that in court because our argument today is that we are not violating any injunction at all,"" Dias said.  We need thousands more <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unifor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Unifor</a> members to come to Regina because <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginapolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginapolice</a> have decided to side with <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoopFCL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CoopFCL</a> <a href=""https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV"">https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV</a> Dias, on Twitter, later accused the police of picking sides, and called for more Unifor members to travel to Regina in solidarity. Police did not confirm who else was arrested or if any charges were laid.  Monday marked 46 days since Unifor members were locked out on Dec. 5. The dispute mainly comes down to pensions. A previous deal included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan.  The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive.  ""We are going to guarantee you that not one fuel truck is going to leave this facility. From now on we're not going anywhere,"" Scott Doherty, Unifor's lead negotiator and executive assistant to the president, said. The refinery said in a statement that the blockades were illegal and that it is exploring legal options.  ""Unifor continues to use illegal blockades as a bullying tactic and has brought in extra people to help them to it,"" the statement said. ""Today's actions by Unifor represent yet another violation of the court injunction."" Regina police said they were monitoring the situation. In a statement, police said they were communicating with both sides to keep the peace and advising motorists to avoid the area of Ninth Avenue N., MacDonald Street and Fleet Street. Before his arrest, Dias estimated that about 500 people were brought in from across Canada to Regina and said more are expected. Dias said the union also plans to increase the boycott of Co-ops across Western Canada if a deal isn't made.  ""Clearly the only place that this dispute will be resolved will be at the bargaining table,"" Dias said.  The refinery previously said Unifor hasn't returned to the bargaining table since September 2019.  A video showing a large flare at the Co-op Refinery on Saturday has been circulating on social media.  The refinery said in a statement that the facility momentarily lost power from SaskPower. As a result, some units came down at the same time. ""The flare system did the job it is designed to do in that situation. Power was restored within a minute of the incident, and our highly skilled management team brought the refinery units back online per normal operating procedures,"" the refinery said in a statement. ""Power failures happen occasionally, and our team is always prepared for an emergent scenario such as this."" Dias said flare-ups happen when replacement workers without proper experience are running a plant.  ""We're hoping that the safety concerns are being addressed,"" Dias said. ""We're hoping that the facility is just being taken care of properly, from a maintenance point of view. But ultimately we're not in control of that today. We wish we were but we are not.""

162,"Katie Pedersen, Melissa Mancini, David Common",2019-11-23T16:17:02.731Z,Seniors' homes using 'trespass orders' to ban family members from visiting,"Mary Sardelis wasn't allowed to visit her 97-year-old mother's Ottawa retirement home for almost a year. Sardelis lives less than five minutes away from her mother Voula, but the home prevented Sardelis from seeing her, using sections of Ontario's trespass law. ""For 316 days … I was banned from entering the home,"" she said. ""You have no idea of the toll it's taken."" She could call, but her mother's hearing is poor and she often couldn't understand what her daughter was saying.  ""All I could hear was her fears or concerns. And I couldn't even soothe her."" Sardelis was banned from City View Retirement Community under Ontario's Trespass to Property Act. So-called trespass orders allow private property owners to limit who can come onto the premises and, some experts say, are being increasingly used to keep out family members who complain about conditions in retirement and long-term care homes. It's difficult to know how often homes ban or restrict family members, since families have to breach the trespass order for there to be any record of it. WATCH: Daughter banned from visiting 97-year-old mother at retirement home. Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto, estimates she gets calls about trespass orders in long-term care homes and retirement homes at least once a week.  ""Generally, what happens is that it's a family member who is in visiting their family member and they get upset,"" she said. Marketplace reviewed over a dozen cases of family members from provinces across Canada who say they believe the homes were trying to silence them for advocating on behalf of their loved ones. ""The person maybe raises their voices and the home says, 'Well, that's it. You're not coming anymore, because we see you as a danger,'"" said Meadus. WATCH: Voula Sardelis waves to her daughter on the sidewalk outside her retirement home. ""If [the complainants] were really a danger, they should be calling the police. So if they were actually threatening someone, that's what they should be doing, ""But instead, what they're doing is to try to control their premises, trying to stifle people from complaining and trying to stifle people from speaking out on behalf of these very vulnerable seniors."" The home told Marketplace they prohibited Sardelis from visiting her mother because she was ""aggressive"" towards staff. But she believes she was banned for speaking out and filing complaints about the living conditions at the home which she felt were intolerable. Meadus said in Ontario, homes do not have the right to ban residents' visitors. When it comes to retirement homes, residents who pay to live on the property have a right to receive visitors they choose ""without interference,"" she said, citing case law established in Cunningham vs. Whitby Christian Non-Profit Housing Corp. That case found that banning guests of a tenant would contravene Section 23 (1) of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, which entitles a tenant to ""quiet enjoyment"" of their space. Meadus says in the case of long-term care, they have the same rights under Section 3 (14) of the Long-Term Care Homes Act, which states that every resident has the right ""to receive visitors of his or her choice … without interference."" The home says it ""disagrees"" with that analysis and that it has the right to ban anyone deemed to have breached its ""zero-tolerance abuse"" policy. Meadus has been invited to train Toronto's police officers on how to deal with calls from retirement and long-term care homes that try to use Trespass to Property Act against family members. ""When we talk to police officers, they're surprised and they're usually very grateful that we've provided that information to them. That's not something that they're trained for generally,"" she said. Meadus says often the families she has heard from have negotiated for restricted visits, agreeing to only come into the home during certain hours or under certain conditions.  That was the case for Susan Macaulay, who says her mother's Quebec long-term care home threatened to ban her, and ultimately issued restrictions on her visits. ""I was a thorn in the side of the managers,"" she said. ""They threatened on several occasions to not allow me to see my mother."" Macaulay said the home sent her a letter stating that she would only be allowed to visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. — the two hours of the afternoon when her mom was normally asleep. She said she tried to explain to her mother, who had dementia, why she wasn't going to be visiting as much. ""If I don't come to visit, it's not because I don't want to,"" she recalls telling her mother.  ""I thought that if they stopped me from coming to see her, she would never know why I didn't come."" Macaulay faced restrictions on her visits to her mother for 18 months, until her mother died. In Ontario, the Trespass to Property Act doesn't allow people who have been issued a ban to fight it. Once a notice or verbal warning is given to someone on the property, the only way to fight the ban is to go back to the property and wait for the owner to call the police. Meadus says most of the time, families don't challenge the order, because they would have to get arrested to do so.  But for Mary Sardelis, her fear of being arrested wasn't enough to stop her. In March 2019, she went into the retirement home even though she was banned and waited for the home to call the police and arrest her. She hoped that this way, she would be able to bring the matter before a judge. The police were called, and Sardelis was charged under the Trespass to Property Act. ""Someone had to do something,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it will just keep going on and on and on."" But in October, Sardelis found out she wouldn't have to go to court after all. Her lawyer met with the home's lawyers, after which the prosecutors dropped the charges. The home told Marketplace it will let her visit as long as she follows their rules. Although her battle is seemingly over, Sardelis said on behalf of her mother, she'll continue to advocate for other family members in her community who have been banned from visiting their loved ones. ""I'll do whatever it takes to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" she said. ""I will not stop.""

Last week, a pipe burst on the upper floor of the College Street shelter while no one was there. ""It ended up leaking for a while and it caused a lot of water damage, so we won't be back in this season,"" said Rebecca Whitzman, co-ordinator for the Out of the Cold Emergency Winter Shelter. The shelter moved to the Needham Community Centre gym for two nights on the weekend and is now in the Brunswick Street Mission for one week. The shelter is serving 15 guests per night and is overcapacity, but Whitzman said no one is being turned away. The shelter's insurance company is assessing the damage and Whitzman said it would likely take months to make repairs. The space may have to be gutted and rebuilt. For the last 10 years, the shelter operated in the basement of St. Matthew's United Church in downtown Halifax. Moving to the new location was a big change. The College Street location has bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen where guests can gather and talk while staff cook meals. ""We were just commenting on how beautiful the space was, how cozy it was,"" said Jeff Karabanow, one of the shelter's founders. ""The guests were really enjoying the space. It was a very different vibe than the shelter in the past."" Karabanow said the shelter can't stay long at the Brunswick Street Mission and is exploring where to go next. One church in Spryfield and one church in Fairview have said they are open to the idea, but Karabanow said no final decisions have been made. ""We're just figuring out the transportation issue and seeing if we could get the funds to support folks coming back and forth,"" he said. Karabanow said staff are exploring with the province and the city to see if a downtown location close to their regular clients is available, but he's doubtful one can be found on short notice.

In an interview with Daybreak Kamloops host Shelley Joyce, Camille said he is now recovering at home from a broken shoulder, lacerated kidneys and a concussion.  ""I'm still healing from that,"" Camille said.  Three distressed horses had been spotted near the north end of the range in the Kamloops area. ""They were looking pretty thin and nobody knew who owned them,"" he said. ""I went down there to check them out and possibly get them out of there and put them in better conditions.""

165,David Bell,2020-01-21T00:16:33.546Z,Exceptional is new normal: Experts break down anti-science tropes on extreme weather,"Weather and climate are separate things and, yes, climate change is often the underlying influence of extreme weather we see around the world. It increases intensity and frequency, say two Calgary experts. The intensity of the Australian wildfire, followed by flash flooding in other parts of the country. Military called in to deal with multi-day Newfoundland weather event like none in recent memory. One-in-100-year flood in Calgary in 2013. A common thread between these and other extreme weather events is climate change, which has increased ambient temperatures, making extreme weather as a whole more intense and more frequent. ""If you see what's going on in Newfoundland right now and hear some of the stories, a lot of people don't have this in living memory,"" University of Calgary climatologist Shawn Marshall told CBC Calgary News at 6. ""It comes down to statistical distributions. If you picture a normal curve where you have extreme minima and maxima on either end, climate change shifts that whole distribution and that changes the frequencies."" He says it could be the economic cost of cleaning up that might drive a change in beliefs and actions. ""The costs associated with that could hammer us, could cripple us pretty hard,"" Marshall said. ""This is what the future looks like, more and more commonly. That's very disruptive, very expensive. What used to be exceptional is becoming normalized. It's not necessarily going to be easy for us."" Israel Dunmade, an associate professor in Mount Royal University's earth and environmental sciences department, says that despite tweets and statements by influencers whenever a cold stretch hits, weather and climate are not the same thing. ""Weather is for a short period. Climate is over a long period, usually 30 to 35 years average,"" Dunmade told CBC News. ""Over a long period of time, we are seeing from anthropogenic activities, our economic activities, an increase in ambient temperature. Over the years, as a result of that increasing temperature, it has led to the current climate change."" That increase makes things drier, so wildfires burn more often and with greater intensity, he said. Wind plays a factor, too. ""Increasing temperature increases the capacity of the wind to carry more water. So instead of rainfall coming down, it will be carried to other places. That's why you find more dryness, and more incidents of a lot of fire breaking out,"" Dunmade said. It also melts ice, which contributes to flooding. Again, more often and more intense. When your uncle argues that there has always been extreme weather, therefore climate change isn't a thing, Marshall has a response for that. ""It's pretty hard to always attribute severe weather to climate change, but there is no question that some of these events, especially Australia, have a huge climate change layer to them,"" Marshall said. ""Extreme weather has always happened … but when you add a bit of climate change, more energy, more moisture [in the] atmosphere to the mix, then you start to get things we have not seen before."" And that term used to describe the 2013 Calgary-area floods, a ""one-in-a-100 year event,"" we might need to adjust it. ""Maybe becoming one in 20, one in 10 — that kind of frequency."" Still, Marshall is an optimist. ""Reversing it is going to take a long time — decades, maybe a couple generations — but I think it's possible,"" he said. ""I still hold out hope that, even in my lifetime, I will see it stabilize, I will see our emissions level off. It's really important to reach some equilibrium.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/extreme-weather-climate-change-1.5433908,[],N/A

Lonewater Farm, a remote rehabilitation centre about four kilometres north of Grand Bay-Westfield, will relocate its early addiction recovery program to Ridgewood Addiction Services in west Saint John.  ""The property, is quite large and we see this [move] as a very positive augmentation of services for our clients,"" said Susan Neal, the area manager for Horizon's addiction and mental health services for the Saint John region.  Although the building is in need of upgrades, Neal said Horizon also decided to move the Lonewater program to Ridgewood because clients there have easier access to addiction-based services. Those services include a detox unit, a 28-day rehabilitation program and a team of outpatient counsellors. Lonewater's remote location also played a factor in the move, as well access to the current services on site. The facility at Ridgewood will feature private bathrooms for patients. It's also closer to a bus route, which helps  clients nearing discharge and looking for affordable housing. Lonewater Farms opened in the 1960s. It's a place where men struggling with alcoholism would go to address their addiction while working on a farm. Over time, however, the focus of the addiction centre shifted. It now offers early recovery services, which involves setting up a personalized recovery plan with each client. Resident's participate in group activities and daily communal tasks, like cleaning.  People typically stay at Lonewater between one and three months. Horizon is investing more than $300,000 to renovate one of its existing buildings at Ridgewood into a 14-bed residential early recovery centre, where the former Lonewater clients will be housed.  Although the switch means losing 10 beds for people struggling with addiction, Neal said the Lonewater facility struggles to keep a 100 per cent capacity as is. The average occupancy rate for Lonewater Farm has been around 78 per cent for the past year. That's because not all clients require the level of service Lonewater offers. ""Early recovery is for our most vulnerable male clients specifically,"" she said. ""Not every client that is dealing with a substance use disorder requires this level of service.""

168,Hallie Cotnam,2020-01-22T21:21:32.255Z,"Salty dragonflies mean more mosquitoes, researchers find","Road salt is arguably a life-saving necessity during Canadian winters, but new research shows it may also indirectly boost the mosquito population come summertime. According to a study published recently in the journal Frontiers of Ecology and Evolution, all that salt is leaching into roadside storm ponds, where both mosquito and dragonfly larvae grow. Rosalind Murray, a post-doctoral fellow in biology at the University of Toronto and one of the study's authors, studied storm ponds in the GTA with her research team. These man-made ponds are meant to catch road run-off before it drains into the watershed, but they're also full of tiny life. With no fish or frogs present, the wingless dragonfly larvae, which measure up to three centimetres in length, are the apex predators, and have a voracious appetite: a healthy one consumes an average of 11 mosquito larvae in two hours. ""But the salty dragonflies — the ones that were exposed to the highest level of salt for the longest amount of time — were eating significantly fewer mosquito larvae,"" Murray told the CBC's Ottawa Morning — as few as seven every two hours. ""That might not seem like that big a difference, but if you think about how many ponds and how many dragonflies, this can have a huge impact on ... how many mosquitoes they're actually consuming."" The salt appears to have little effect on the hardy, adaptable mosquito larvae, leaving the population to thrive. ""If you have a very salty environment that has killed off a lot of the potential predators for the mosquitoes, then you might be exposed to even more mosquitoes,"" Murray said. For the good of the planet, can we curb our addiction to road salt? But dragonfly larvae also feed on each other, and salty ones are slower to heal, she said. ""Dragonfly larvae are hugely cannibalistic, so they might pull off a leg. When they're exposed to high levels of salt … they're not as quick at recovering from these wounds."" The researchers followed the salty dragonflies into adulthood, and found they were less healthy. As well as healing more slowly, the insects were also found to be more vulnerable to infection. For humans, this poses a dilemma: using road salt in the wintertime means more mosquitoes in the summertime. Murray said she's not advocating for an end to road salt, but until a healthier alternative is found, she wants municipalities to consider the impact excessive amounts are having on the ecosystem.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/road-salt-environmental-impact-run-off-dragonflies-mosquitoes-1.5435761,[],N/A

It was also illegal to have more than two dogs in one dwelling, or to let your dog bother neighbours with its barking. Pet stores were among the beneficiaries of the bylaw. ""This goes over here,"" said a woman demonstrating a device that resembled a large clip attached to a plastic bag. ""Dog owners are snapping up this one-size-fits-all poop and scoop set,"" said Mesley. The fine for not using such a tool, or any other method, for cleaning up after one's dog was $20. Some 2,000 such fines had been issued in the past year.  Some owners had banded together to create what we now know as a dog park. They had convinced Phyllis Lambert, a prominent member of Montreal's Bronfman family, to allow them to use a ""deserted lot"" for their dogs, which could be seen happily playing in the patchy snow.  With Lambert's signed permission, dog owners had no more worries of hassles from the dog patrol. ""They'd jump out of the bushes ... and start handing out tickets to owners who had their dogs off leashes,"" said Bev Robson. But Gilles Caumartin, head of the five-member dog patrol, said his team wasn't out to get anybody. ""We're not that bad,"" said the uniformed officer. ""We're going to talk to people, explain them the bylaw, and usually we haven't got any problem."" Even Robson admitted she didn't approve of owners failing to pick up after their pets.

Police were called to the centre of the city Wednesday night after receiving several calls about a moose trotting down Cashin Avenue. They followed the moose in a truck with lights flashing, guiding it toward a wooded area as onlookers stared in amazement. ""He looked like he owned the city,"" said Gen Escobar, who managed to snap a few photos as the moose trotted past her. Jason McDonald captured this video Wednesday night: It's not unheard of for moose to come into the city, but Escobar said she was still surprised when she realized the four-legged figure barrelling toward her wasn't a horse. ""There's just like, walls of snow 10 feet high all around us, and then a moose running towards us, and we're like, you know what, that's not the weirdest thing that's happened this week,"" she said. ""It just went with the whole snowpocalypse theme that we've been having."" St. John's has been hit with nearly a metre of snow since Friday, and police said the moose was struggling with high snowbanks, leading it to take main roads into the middle of the city.

About 40 kilometres away in a more rural setting, Holyrood resident Elizabeth Clairmont found a moose in her backyard, perched high upon a snowbank and chewing on the branches of her apple tree.

The Liberal government will contribute up to $20 million over five years to provide for the new Canadian Institute for Climate Choices, which launched on Tuesday.  The institute, which is to maintain independent control over its own research and reporting, is the result of a partnership between 15 climate-focused organizations that answered a federal call for proposals in 2018. ""I hope that we're able to contribute some really good, solid, evidence-based analysis and advice that looks at the issues and complexities of climate and what decisions the country is facing in a more integrated frame,"" said Kathy Bardswick, the institute's chief executive officer. ""The country is facing choices, and they're complex choices and they need to be well supported."" The Canadian Institute for Climate Choices will be overseen by an 11-member board of directors that includes Mel Cappe, a former clerk of the Privy Council, Dave Collyer, former president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, and Christopher Ragan, chair of the former Ecofiscal Commission. Three expert panels — focused on adaptation, mitigation and clean growth — will inform the institute's work. Those panels are made up of some of Canada's prominent experts and voices on climate policy, including Blair Feltmate,  Nancy Olewiler, Mark Jaccard, Nicholas Rivers, Jennifer Winter, Stewart Elgie and Kathryn Harrison. The institute's first report, also released Tuesday, provides a broad overview of global climate change, climate policy in Canada and the possible paths forward, in hopes of establishing a ""starting point for a new conversation about Canada's future in a changing world."" The Liberal government's move to establish and support such an organization echoes a decision made by Brian Mulroney's Conservative government to create the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy in 1988. (Its founding chair was David Johnston, the future governor general.) Over the course of 25 years, the advisory agency produced more than 50 reports on climate change, public policy and environmental protection. The Harper government announced its intention to eliminate funding for the roundtable — $5 million per year — in 2012. At the time, Conservative Environment Minister Peter Kent said the roundtable was no longer needed because there were other organizations producing research and analysis. But another minister, John Baird, later suggested that the Conservative government didn't approve of what the roundtable was saying. ""Why should taxpayers have to pay for more than 10 reports promoting a carbon tax, something that the people of Canada have repeatedly rejected?"" Baird asked, when challenged in the House of Commons. The former roundtable is not the only example of an arm's length institution relied on for expert analysis. In the U.K., the Committee on Climate Change is an independent body that delivers annual progress reports to Parliament, in addition to other research. ""It seems like there is wave after wave of climate announcements, whether it's corporate, whether it is international policy, whether it is climate impacts, like Australia. It just seems like these issues that we're talking about are accelerating and becoming harder to manage and more complicated and more imminent in a lot of ways,"" said Dale Beugin, the institute's vice-president of research. ""So it feels like this is the right time to try to bring some clarity to that conversation for Canadians.""

In a statement, Huawei Technologies denied having anything to do with the protest. ""Huawei had no involvement with the protesters or supporters outside the Vancouver courthouse and is unaware of any plans by those responsible.""  The group did appear in a Central China Television news report, portrayed uncritically as ""protesters asking for Meng's freedom."" However, many in the local media who witnessed the odd gathering suspected instantly there was more to the story. CBC News producer Georgina Smyth said after attempting to speak to some of the individuals, it became apparent they didn't have a clue about Meng or the issues surrounding her extradition hearing.   ""The people I spoke to were either bored or confused as to why they were there and were becoming increasingly agitated and angry at reporters questions,"" said Smyth. ""Many of the signs were the same pink cardboard colour and they had obviously been written by the same person. Others were simply pieces of paper that had text marks on them. A very rush job."" The two protesters CBC spoke with said they didn't know who was ultimately behind recruiting or paying them. They said a woman who identified herself only as ""Joey"" appeared to be the on-site organizer, handing out signs, marshalling the group of actors and distributing payments. When contacted by a Mandarin speaking CBC reporter, Joey denied having anything to do with the protest saying she was in Toronto, before hanging up.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/who-paid-for-the-fake-protest-outside-meng-wanzhou-s-hearing-we-still-don-t-know-1.5436448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/paid-protesters-meng-wanzhou-1.5434613 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/huawei-s-meng-wanzhou-extradition-fight-begins-1.5433840,N/A

174,Yvonne Colbert,2019-11-20T19:47:55.495Z,N.S. man takes one of world's biggest automakers to court — and wins,"Most people might be hesitant to take one of the world's biggest automakers to court. But not Nine Mile River, N.S., resident Ranulph Hudston, who persisted in his battle to have Volkswagen honour its 12-year corrosion warranty. The retired educator wouldn't take no for an answer when his 2007 Jetta started rusting and the company denied his warranty claim. He decided to take Volkswagen to Nova Scotia small claims court, and earlier this month won a judgment of $7,886.40 to pay for the repair costs. ""I was very surprised and very pleased,"" Hudston said of the court's Nov. 7 ruling. ""As I read the decision, I saw a lot of what I put into the case coming back to me as the truth, and the truth coming through felt really good."" His win came despite a list from Volkswagen of possible causes for the corrosion on the Jetta's door sills and rocker panels, including tree sap, bird droppings, shoe buckles and an improperly stored seatbelt. In her ruling, small claims adjudicator Shelly Martin didn't buy any of the excuses, saying she failed ""to see how a seatbelt or footwear could affect the areas in question, as the site of corrosion is not easily in contact with footwear or a seatbelt."" The 12-year corrosion warranty was provided to Hudston when he bought the vehicle brand new in 2007. He first noticed rust on the left front fender when his Jetta was almost seven years old. He went back to Hillcrest Volkswagen in Halifax, where he purchased the vehicle. He was then sent to a Volkswagen-authorized repair shop, which fixed most of the rusted areas and replaced the right quarter panel. But three years later, in 2017, he noticed blistering paint and a small strip of paint peeling on the rocker panels, as well as blistering paint on the front door sills. He took the Jetta to a body shop for repairs and was told the body work under the paint was rusting. He was advised the repairs should be covered under Volkswagen's warranty. Hudston went back to Hillcrest, where he was told to fill out an online inspection request that included acceptance of additional terms and conditions that were not in the original warranty. One new clause said any decisions by Volkswagen were final, while another said repairs must be made ""promptly."" Hudston was subsequently sent for a repair estimate where a technician told him any attempt to clean the rust on the door sill would likely ""blow a hole right through it."" More than a month later, Hillcrest Volkswagen told him the repair would not be covered, saying the corrosion was not the type covered by his warranty. It also refused to cover the rocker panels. Hudston continued to push Volkswagen to pay for the repairs, but the company responded in an email: ""We are unable to base our decisions on information received from independent shops and our decision remains unchanged."" It cited a number of reasons why the corrosion might have occurred — ranging from bird droppings, to rocks, to lack of rust proofing — and also suggested the problem was due to a general lack of maintenance. But in her decision, Martin noted photos of the vehicle showed ""an older but well cared for Jetta, stored in an impeccable clean garage."" The adjudicator said she was not convinced that any of the reasons provided by Volkswagen ""were of sufficient magnitude in the location of the corrosion to be its cause."" She also noted that three technicians that inspected the vehicle suggested it was corrosion covered under the warranty. George Iny, with the consumer advocacy group Automobile Protection Association, said he's not surprised by the potential causes cited by Volkswagen. He said automakers have a template for rust cases that includes 18 reasons why corrosion might have occurred. ""In many cases, they would just throw as many as they can and hope that one or two will stick. They really need only one for the judge to be convinced they are not responsible,"" he said. He calls it ""laughable"" that Volkswagen would say bird droppings are responsible for the rust on vertical surfaces on the lower part of the car. Iny said his organization has heard from dozens of Volkswagen owners who have had difficulty getting their corrosion warranties honoured. As a result, his group has posted tips on its website. Iny noted Volkswagen last year reduced its warranty from 12 to seven years, which he said is still good coverage by industry standards.  ""The impression we have is that they're applying that reduction retroactively and they're not supposed to do that,"" he said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Canada, Thomas Tetzlaff, said the automaker takes all matters of quality very seriously and always honours the full terms of its warranties. He said while the company respects the court's decision, it is now considering whether to appeal. Iny said Hudston's case is a template for other Volkswagen owners facing rust problems. He said people can't go to court and simply say, ""I have a warranty and my vehicle is rusting."" He said vehicle owners need an expert or, at the very least, a report from an expert. Hudston, who has owned numerous Volkswagens and thinks they're excellent cars, said it was the company's own actions that led him to continue his fight. ""They didn't seem to want to hear me. They, in fact, seemed to be stonewalling me and I guess that insulted me. I expect to be respected by the companies I buy products from,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/warranty-corrosion-volkswagen-group-canada-small-claims-court-1.5363613,[],N/A

The government announced the partnership in a release on Monday.  Health Minister James Aylward said there are a number of vacant physician jobs across P.E.I., and it's time the province started exploring new ways to fill those positions.  ""We can do more, we can do better,"" Aylward said. ""Who better to help recruit doctors but doctors, I mean they have the network, they have graduated with other doctors … they might know a doctor that's looking at potentially making a change and so the more people that we can have here on P.E.I. helping to recruit doctors to P.E.I., the better."" There are currently more than 16,000 people on the patient registry. Aylward said the society will be working closely with the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI to come up with recommendations for how physician recruitment efforts can improve. Dr. David Bannon, president of the society, said the organization has been calling for a new recruitment model for some time.  Bannon said the society will be looking at recruitment efforts in other provinces to find a model that could work on P.E.I.

""We're going to do the deep dive and do the research to find out across this country, and perhaps elsewhere, what works best using a physicians-recruit-physicians principle.""   Bannon said the society will also be getting input from physicians and health-care workers from across the Island to find ways to better support new recruits and ensure they stay to work on P.E.I.

176,Anonymous,2020-01-21T22:06:34.512Z,Stock markets down on growing concern about coronavirus in China,"Stocks fell on Wall Street in afternoon trading Tuesday amid global jitters about a virus outbreak in China. The slide came on the first trading day of a holiday-shortened week in the U.S. and followed losses in global markets amid deepening concerns that the new coronavirus spreading in the world's second-largest economy could hurt tourism and ultimately economic growth and corporate profits. Canada's main stock index fell for the first time in seven sessions on concerns about the outbreak. The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 25.11 points at 17,572.28. Six people have died, and 291 have been infected in China, just as the country was preparing for its peak travel season over the Lunar New Year travel. A U.S. citizen who recently returned from China was diagnosed with the new virus in the Seattle area, making the United States the fifth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. ""From an investment standpoint, the risk with any virus is in the scope of its economic impact, and the mere fact that this has spread from China overnight to the U.S. so quickly reinforces the idea that the negative fallout could be global rather than local,"" said Alec Young, managing director of Global Markets Research for FTSE Russell. Asian stocks closed sharply lower. European markets also fell. Within the S&P 500, stocks of U.S. companies that cater to Chinese tourists had some of the biggest losses, along with general travel companies, such as casinos and airlines. Industrial, financial and energy companies were among those that declined. Those losses outweighed gains in defensive sector stocks, including real estate, utilities and household goods makers. Traders also shifted money into U.S. government bonds, sending yields lower. Investors are looking at playbooks for past outbreaks, such as SARS in 2002-2003, where airlines, railways and other transportation companies saw their stocks slide the most, followed by retailers and hospitality companies, according to strategists at Jefferies. Headlines about the spreading coronavirus have given investors an excuse to take profits following the market's recent record-setting run. The three major U.S. stock indexes were coming off all-time highs set Friday. The S&P 500 hasn't had a single-day drop of more than 1 per cent since October. ""Investors have shown a lot of optimism, and that might make some a little bit skittish,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. ""Valuations are elevated. In this sort of environment, I don't think it takes much of a headline to trigger a reaction."" Tuesday's drop for the index follows a strong run. Fears of a possible recession have faded, and investors expect the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, and the S&P 500 has risen in 13 of the last 15 weeks. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 152.06 points at 29,196.04. The S&P 500 index was down 8.83 points at 3,320.79, while the Nasdaq composite was down 18.13 points at 9,370.81. The Canadian dollar traded for 76.53 cents US compared with an average of 76.61 cents US on Monday. The March crude contract was down 20 cents US$58.38 per barrel and the February natural gas contract was down 10.8 cents at US$1.90 per mmBTU. The February gold contract was down $2.40 US at $1,557.90 an ounce, and the March copper contract was down 5.2 cents at $2.79 a pound. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 2.8 per cent Tuesday to 27,985.33 after Moody's Investors Service cut Hong Kong's credit rating by one notch to Aa3 from Aa2. Moody's cited the lack of ""tangible plans"" to respond to issues highlighted by six-month-old anti-government protests and said that may reflect ""weaker inherent institutional capacity"" than previously thought.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the crash deaths in the state's Snowy Monaro region, which came as Australia grapples with an unprecedented fire season that has left a large swath of destruction. Coulson Aviation (USA) said in a statement that one of its Lockheed C-130 Hercules air tankers was lost after it left Richmond in New South Wales with retardant for a firebombing mission. It said the accident was ""extensive"" but had few other details. In a statement, the company said it will send a team to the site to assist in emergency operations. Coulson Aviation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Coulson Aircrane of Port Alberni, B.C. ""The only thing I have from the field reports are that the plane came down, it's crashed and there was a large fireball associated with that crash,"" said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she had conveyed Australia's condolences to U.S. Ambassador Arthur Culvahouse Jr. ""Our hearts go out to their loved ones. They were helping Australia, far from their own homes, an embodiment of the deep friendship between our two countries,"" she said in a statement. ""Thank you to these three, and to all the brave firefighters from Australia and around the world. Your service and contribution are extraordinary. We are ever grateful,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, all we've been able to do is locate the wreckage and the crash site and we have not been able to locate any survivors,"" he said. The tragedy brings the death toll from the blazes to at least 31 since September. The fires have also destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.4 million hectares. Coulson grounded other firefighting aircraft as a precaution pending investigation, reducing planes available to firefighters in New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria state. The four-propeller Hercules drops more than 15,000 litres of fire retardant in a single pass. Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the national air crash investigator, and state police will investigate the crash site, which firefighters described as an active fire ground. ""There is no indication at this stage of what's caused the accident,"" Fitzsimmons said. Berejiklian said there were more than 1,700 volunteers and personnel in the field, and five fires were being described at an ""emergency warning level."" Also Thursday, Canberra Airport closed because of nearby wildfires, and residents south of Australia's capital were told to seek shelter. The blaze started Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures caused conditions in Canberra to deteriorate. A second fire near the airport that started on Thursday morning is at the ""watch and act"" level. ""Arrivals and departures are affected due to aviation firefighting operations,"" the airport authority said in a tweet. Another tweet from traffic police said ""the fire is moving fast and there are multiple road closures in the area. Please avoid the area. Local road blocks in place."" Residents in some Canberra suburbs were advised to seek shelter and others to leave immediately. ""The defence force is both assisting to a degree and looking to whether that needs to be reinforced,"" Defence Minister Angus Campbell told reporters.

178,James Devine,2020-01-21T09:00:00.675Z,Why Iran has little interest in a 'Trump Deal' with the White House,"This column is an opinion by James Devine, an associate professor at Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B., whose research focuses on the politics and foreign policy of Iran. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Iran's growing tension with the U.S. might seem irrational from a Western perspective, but from Tehran's point of view it makes perfect sense. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Iran last week to accept a new ""Trump Deal"" to replace the old, now defunct, Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement. Given the extreme events of recent days, which saw Tehran narrowly avert war with the United States, shoot down a civilian airliner and face renewed domestic unrest, one might think that the regime would be ready to talk. However, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, often described as a moderate, rejected Johnson's appeal outright. There are a number of reasons why Tehran is not interested in negotiating with the Trump administration. First and foremost, Iran thought it already had a deal. Western critics of the JCPOA are quick to point out the many compromises Barack Obama made when the U.S. signed the 2015 agreement, but Tehran also felt it had made painful concessions. The JCPOA did not put an end to all sanctions against the Islamic Republic, only those related to its nuclear program. Moreover, when the deal was in effect, the Iranian government complained that the U.S. used loopholes to keep as many sanctions in place as possible. Even if we are not sympathetic to Tehran's complaints, it would be unrealistic to expect them to reopen talks. If they were to negotiate a ""Trump Deal,"" what would there be to stop future U.S. administrations from demanding more concessions later on? Tehran is also reticent because Trump would surely insist that Iran give up its regional influence, forcing it to withdraw from Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. While Tehran may have extended its reach during the Arab Spring, Iran's leadership likely sees its latest regional moves as defensive rather than ambitious. The instability in Syria and Iraq threatened to sever their alliance networks and create dangerous power vacuums that could be occupied by hostile Sunni extremist groups or the U.S. Trump would also undoubtedly call for Iran to decommission its extensive missile system. From the West's perspective, these weapons are part of Iran's strategy for regional hegemony. From Tehran's perspective, they are essential parts of its deterrence strategy. Without nuclear weapons, Iran's missiles are the main thing standing in the way of potential American and/or Israeli military strikes. Complying with Trump's demands would therefore leave the state defenceless, and invite the U.S. to keep pressuring the regime until it is finally toppled. Given the weight of U.S. power, one might think that Iran has no choice but to renegotiate, particularly if Washington is truly committed to forcing the issue. The Islamic Republic, however, has been remarkably resilient, and probably feels like it still has some cards to play. When Trump scrapped the JCPOA, Iran looked to the Europeans as a means of escaping economic and diplomatic isolation. Once it became clear that the EU could not play that role, Tehran turned to brinksmanship, provoking crises with the U.S. by shooting down an American drone, reportedly having allied militia forces in Iraq fire rockets into American installations, and possibly bombing Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Tehran is essentially playing a game of ""chicken,"" predicated on the belief that the U.S. is at least as averse to war as they are. Therefore, with each escalating crisis, Iran is presenting Trump with a choice; ease-off his strategy of ""Maximum Pressure"" or allow America to get dragged into an all-out conflict. By killing Qassem Soleimani, the U.S. signaled that they could play the brinksmanship game, too. However, earlier last year when Trump called back airstrikes after Iran downed a U.S. drone, he tipped his hand. He may want a new deal with Iran, but not at the cost of war. So, despite U.S. claims to have ""re-established deterrence,"" Iran is unlikely to embrace a ""Trump Deal"" with the White House. And in Tehran's perfect world, the Democrats will win the next election and the new president will walk U.S. policy back from the brink. In the meantime, Tehran will likely continue its strategy with cyberattacks and lesser provocations until it builds to another crisis.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-iran-united-states-strategy-1.5433090,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-uranium-enrichmant-nuclear-deal-1.5428896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458,N/A

The plan, by developer Charles Bird, would see two, four-storey buildings placed on a former church property on Millidge Avenue. It is being recommended by city planning staff, who say the location is in an ""intensification"" area dedicated to greater density. But opponents crowded the two small rooms being used for the committee hearings Tuesday night. The committee also received 37 letters about the project, the vast majority opposed. Many raise concerns about the density and height of the project, which would be placed on a 1.9-acre lot (about seven-tenths of a hectare).       Neighbour Hazel Kerr described the profile the buildings would create as ""a blot on the horizon,"" when compared to the single family homes surrounding it.  ""It's great that the city needs apartments, but there's a right place and a wrong place,"" said another opponent, Yuriy Klitinskiy. Gary Sullivan, Saint John council's representative on the advisory committee, is also a Millidgeville resident. He made the motion to recommend against the 88-unit development.  ""I've had a really hard time with this,"" said Sullivan. ""I know it will be a quality project, I just don't think it's the right thing for that area."" The amount of opposition caught the developers off guard. ""We didn't expect 37 people to show up against this. … We had knocked on all the doors, we thought we understood how the community felt,"" said engineer Andrew Toole, who was representing the proponent on the application. Toole said he would reach out to some of the neighbours to address their concerns before the proposal goes to a city council vote on Feb. 10. A second apartment project, planned for the Gothic Arches site on the city's Central Peninsula got a unanimous recommendation for approval from the committee. A series of supporters spoke in favour of the proposal, which would see a seven-storey building with 83 high-end units constructed on the Wentworth Street property.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-opposition-nimby-height-variance-planning-1.5435711,[],N/A

""People have been in pain, people with swollen faces."" ""We were able to triage some of the patients by checking the answering machine, phoning in prescriptions when we could."" McCarthy and other dental offices were given word at 5 p.m. Wednesday they'd be allowed to open, as one of several exemptions to the city's state of emergency as crews continue to clean up the snow from Friday's blizzard. ""A lot of dental treatment has to be treated very soon, within the first hours if you have a tooth taken out or wounds in the mouth,"" McCarthy said, ""[You need] to be treated before you end up getting an infection."" His biggest challenge was getting inside the building to open because sidewalks have yet to be plowed. And now that he's back to work, some patients scheduled for routine dental work have been cancelling. However, patients with swollen faces and broken teeth ripping into soft tissue were never so happy to see him. McCarthy commended the city for allowing dental offices to reopen.

181,Haydn Watters,2020-01-23T14:22:17.549Z,Here's what the province and teachers get wrong on job action,"Amid the teacher job action, there's been a spate of misleading and false information floating around. And both the provincial government and the unions and its teachers are to blame. It makes an already complex situation — with four teachers unions all in different states of rotating job action — even more complicated to follow. Here are some of the most commons claims that have caused confusion. Education minister Stephen Lecce has often talked about the frequency of teacher union escalation, complaining it happens ""every few years."" He even put out a video on Twitter, showing a timeline of more than 200 strikes in the period from Bob Rae's government in the 1990s to Doug Ford's today. But the strikes shown are misleading, as it includes local school board strikes, rather than just province-wide ones. This means a strike like the one-day event in Sept. 2005 in the Moosonee District School Area Board is included, even though it didn't impact anyone else in the province. Not every union escalates action every few years. And in many cases, it is localized rather than province-wide. The current action is significant, though. It marks the first time since 1997 all four unions are involved in some form of job action. Back then, all unions staged a two week, province-wide strike. With the rolling strikes happening now, many teachers are returning to the picket lines for the first time since then. The province and the unions are also seemingly at odds over what the job action is about. Unions have been focusing on issues like class sizes, e-learning, teacher shortages and school classroom. But the education minister has talked a lot about wages. Most unions have said they want more money than the one per cent increase the province is offering; Premier Doug Ford said he's not willing to consider anything more. ""Make no mistake about it, this is about compensation,"" he said. Lecce echoed Ford's comments Monday, telling reporters compensation is something unions ""choose not to talk about."" But all unions told CBC compensation was on the bargaining table, with the ETFO, OSSTF and AEFO hoping to match inflation — which roughly works out to about a two percent increase. Only OECTA would not specify what it was seeking, saying it would better be discussed while bargaining. It's wrong to say unions aren't talking about it but it's also incorrect to say it's not an issue to unions. As strikes got underway Monday morning, the Kawartha Pine Ridge Elementary Teachers Federation posted a tweet claiming there hasn't been a ""single attempt to bargain."" It was then retweeted by ETFO president Sam Hammond, to his 15,000 followers. Only the French union has future talks planned, set for the end of the month. The province said bargaining with the other three unions is in the ""hands of the mediator."" Unions worry changes to class sizes or the province's plan for mandatory e-learning would cause job losses. Some union members continue to cite 10,000 jobs being lost over five years, a number that was estimated in a September 2019 report by Ontario's financial accountability officer. The FAO said 9,060 fewer high school teachers and 994 fewer elementary teachers would be needed by the 2023-24 school year. The number continues to be shared online but is no longer accurate, given the province has since changed plans after blow back. For example, the province partially backtracked on larger classroom sizes in high school, from the proposed average funded 28 to 25, which means more teachers would be necessary than indicated in the report. The new number is still higher than the previous funded average of 22.5 students per class.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/teacher-job-action-fact-check-1.5435941,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/catholic-school-strikes-hamilton-1.5434486 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940,N/A

The two have announced an educational initiative designed to get more Métis to speak their traditional tongue. Statistics Canada numbers show that fewer than 650 people living in Canada speak the Michif language — a mix of Cree and French. Canadian Geographic's chief executive officer says the magazine's online reach makes it ideal for raising public awareness about Michif language and culture. Gilles Gagnier, who confirmed a one-hour documentary is also in the works, says the magazine will use its vast education network to create classroom materials for teachers. Métis Nation-Saskatchewan president Glen McCallum says identity, language and culture are important to his people. ""When I go to my hometown, I know I belong because I can hear my own language and I can be me. When we know our language, we shall never forget who we are as Métis,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. At a launch event in Saskatoon, Sherry Soll told a story of growing up learning to trap and skin animals, but without knowing her traditional language. Soll, who oversees heritage and language for Saskatchewan Métis, said she hopes the program will give young people the opportunity she never had. ""I get asked all the time, 'You don't speak the language, so why do you think you're good for this position?' My answer? 'Because I know what it's like not to have it,""' Soll said. Gagnier said one goal is to get Canadians thinking about Michif language and culture every day.

After moving to Victoria from Saskatchewan where Hughes was a senior judge, he changed the course of politics and public life in B.C. ""It's a loss for our city and for the country,"" said Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps. Hughes served as B.C.'s first conflict of interest commissioner, from 1990 to 1997, and also served as chief adjudicator for an alternative dispute resolution process involving survivors of abuse in Canada's residential school system from 2003 to 2008. He also served as conflict of interest commissioner for the Northwest Territories and Yukon. In addition, he led numerous investigations and commissions including one in 2005 that followed the violent death of a child in foster care. His work led to the establishment of the Office of the Representative for Children and Youth. The Representative’s Office is deeply saddened to hear of the death of the Hon. Ted Hughes. Our sincere condolences to his family. Mr. Hughes’ report on BC’s child welfare system led to the creation of the RCY. A great and wise man. My condolences to Helen and the family of Ted Hughes. His integrity, belief in the importance of public service and wise counsel will be deeply missed. JC Hughes may best be remembered for forcing the resignation of Premier Bill Vander Zalm. Soon after his appointment as Conflict of Interest Commissioner in 1991, Hughes accepted the task of investigating the conduct of Vander Zalm in connection with the sale of his theme park outside Vancouver to Tan Yu, a Taiwanese businessman. Hughes found that the premier had arranged a meeting with the finance minister and a luncheon with the B.C. Lieutenant Governor for Yu, receiving an envelope full of cash from the buyer. In his report, Hughes concluded that Vander Zalm mixed his personal business with the public interest throughout the negotiation and sale, in violation of his own conflict of interest guidelines.  ""Hughes just did a meticulously thorough report, laid out all the facts, and said the premier is guilty of conflict of interest and that was the word,"" said Les Leyne, the Victoria Times Colonist's political columnist. ""He delivered the word, everybody accepted it. The premier quit about three or four days after the report landed."" While Hughes's reputation spread, along with demand for his services as an inquiry commissioner, his wife Helen Hughes entered municipal politics in Victoria. She served 18 years as a city councillor and took on volunteer roles.  Saanich councillor Susan Brice first met Hughes back in 1988 while she was the mayor of Oak Bay when he invited her to join a review of B.C.'s justice system. ""I have felt probably over the last 25 to 30 years he might be one of the most significant Canadian figures who was called upon to review huge social issues,"" said Brice. ""We are all grieving, we know it was a life well-lived."" Brice says Hughes had been in hospital over the last few weeks with declining health. For their public service, both Ted and Helen were appointed members of the Order of Canada and received honorary doctorates from the University of Victoria. Ted Hughes also held honorary degrees from the University of Saskatchewan and Royal Roads University, and has been awarded numerous accolades for his volunteer work. He acted as chair for the Saskatoon City Hospital board of governors, the Saskatchewan Cancer Foundation, Juan de Fuca Hospitals in Victoria and the Vancouver Island CNIB capital fundraising drive. Hughes served terms as president of the Saskatchewan Health Care Association and the Canadian Hospital Association. He also advocated for homeless people in Victoria, acting in 2008 and 2009 with the mayor of Victoria as co-chair of the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness.

The study, published this month in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at 3.1 million children born in Ontario between 1990 and 2016 and examined who died and from what cause between the ages of one and 24. Researchers excluded those who died in their first year of life, saying those deaths are generally due to congenital anomalies or other causes that are not readily preventable. They found boys and young men had a greater tendency to die, especially starting at age 14, and were three times more likely to do so than young women by age 24. Deaths due to injury also increased after age 14, while intentional causes such as suicide accounted for one in five male deaths from injury between the ages of 15-24, and one in six female deaths from injury in that age group. The study says nearly half of injury deaths were due to accidental poisoning or overdose. Transport accidents were the second leading cause of injury-related death for all sexes from age 15 onwards, accounting for roughly a third. But it notes not all deaths had a documented cause, and it was not known which were confirmed by autopsy or an on scene investigation. Some suicides can be misclassified as accidental poisonings, which could mean more teen deaths were due to suicide than the data reflect, the study says. Lead author Dr. Joel Ray, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, said the jump in deaths during adolescence, particularly in boys, is ""likely"" due to an increase in risk-taking behaviours, but said biological factors and changes may play a role in those behaviours as well. In any case, the study shows more mental health supports are needed for teenagers and preteens, he said. ""We have this upswing [in deaths] right around this age in which we would argue strongly that a lot of these deaths are actually preventable and definitely untimely,"" said Ray, who is also affiliated with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.

185,Scott Larson,2020-01-22T01:28:35.236Z,Government knew of concerns about roof design of Saskatchewan Hospital: NDP ,"The NDP released documents Tuesday showing that concerns had been raised about the roof design at the new Saskatchewan Hospital in North Battleford (SHNB) early in the construction process. The $407-million hospital has been plagued by leaking water, first with defective insulation panels in the outside walls, then with a leaky roof also caused by faulty insulation panels. The SHNB has also had issues with the building's drinking water system, which was deemed unsafe to drink due to high levels of lead or copper. The documents the NDP released Tuesday were obtained via a freedom of information request for correspondence related to the water damage, roof leaks and structural concerns with the roof of the SHNB.  Opposition Leader Ryan Meili said Tuesday that documents received through SaskBuilds and the Saskatchewan Health Authority contained troubling information. ""[The contractor] just powered ahead with a roof that they wound up replacing which means sections of the facility did not open,"" Meili said. ""It means patients not being able to access that space. It even meant some concerns about patient safety as there was fear of roof tiles actually falling in parts of the hospital that were being used."" Meili said the government needs to disclose why they opened the building despite the concerns about the roof. Access Prairies Partnership (APP) is responsible for building the hospital. It is a consortium led by Graham Design Builders. A government document says testing revealed the roof leakage was caused by the modular insulation panels shrinking. The government has said that APP shouldered the entire cost of fixing the walls and roof. In October, a third-party construction audit of the Saskatchewan hospital project was triggered.  The audit will review the quality of materials, equipment, labour and workmanship used during building. It's expected to be completed sometime in the spring. Meanwhile, a process review will look at whether the project adhered to terms in the agreement and use those lessons to apply to future major projects. SaskBuilds Minister Gordon Wyant said in a news release that the government is monitoring the situation at SHNB. ""In any build – be it P3 or traditional – the government does not select or approve individual materials for use during construction,"" Wyant said.  ""In the case of the SHNB the selection of products would have been up to APP and its subcontractors. We understand that in this instance, two different products were used but provided by the same manufacturer and the builder is seeking recovery from the supplier."" The release said the government raised the issue of faulty walls in the fall of 2017 and was told by APP there was ""no issue with the roof, which was constructed at the same time but used different material."" It said the roof failure wasn't identified until 2019. Meili said issues surrounding the hospital and other major builds like the power plant in Swift Current and the Regina bypass show that public-private partnership (P3) projects aren't working. He said it's time to stop building P3 projects and to change the procurement system so that local contractors are favoured. ""The vast majority of the major projects through this government have been done by out of province and out of country companies,"" Meili said. Wyant said the P3 model is working in the case of the SHNB and has saved money for the taxpayer.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/hospital-roof-concerns-1.5435315,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/ndp-sask-hospital-audit-1.5155866 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/ndp-problems-north-battleford-hospital-carillion-1.5401197 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/cupe-concerns-saska-hospital-1.5354293 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/sask-hospital-water-contamination-a-symptom-of-larger-problem-says-ndp-1.5334935 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/roof-replacement-sask-hospital-north-battleford-1.5147542,N/A

The Ottawa monument will honour public servants who lost their jobs from the 1950s into the 1990s, a period known as the LGBT Purge. ""It's something I don't think anyone can really understand unless they go through a discrimination at work that has nothing to do with their skills,"" Martine Roy told Ottawa Morning Tuesday.   In 1981, when Roy was 19 and in training to be a medical assistant with the Canadian Armed Forces at CFB Borden, she was arrested and interrogated for hours about her sexual orientation. In December 1984, she was dishonourably discharged from the military. ""There was a law, black and white, all federal but mostly in the army, where I was, that was saying that if you were homosexual [it] is the same as incest or rape,"" said Roy, chair of the LGBT Purge Fund, which has raised $8 million for the monument.  The fund was created following a class-action lawsuit launched by members of the military, RCMP and civil service. How the Cold War 'fruit machine' tried to determine gay from straight While the federal government apologized to LGBT public servants in 2017 and has given more than $100 million in compensation to victims, Roy said it took a decade of therapy for her to regain her confidence and overcome her fear. ""We were not proud. We were hiding,"" Roy said. ""Many of us never came out ... of the closet. Some killed themselves."" On Thursday, the NCC's board of directors will consider a proposal for land allocation for the monument.

188,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-21T18:02:43.518Z,Is a gravitational wave detection near Betelgeuse a sign the star is ready to explode?,"First it was the strange dimming of Betelgeuse. Now it's a gravitational wave that once again has astronomers scratching their heads over this enigmatic star found in the constellation Orion. Betelgeuse has been grabbing a few headlines lately, as the normally bright star dimmed to its lowest point ever recorded — and astronomers don't exactly know why. Now the U.S.-based Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) has detected a gravitational wave coming from that direction, adding another intriguing detail to what's happening. The first gravitational wave ever recorded — a powerful ripple through space-time caused by cataclysmic events, like two merging black holes — was detected in September 2015. Since then, many more have been found, including one resulting from the merger of two black holes, as well as one from a binary neutron star merger. (A potential black hole-neutron star detection is still waiting to be confirmed.) But seeing as Betelgeuse is still there, a source for the newly detected gravitational wave is unknown. Normally, Betelgeuse is a bright red star found in the left ""shoulder"" of Orion. It's classified as a semi-regular variable star, meaning that it dims periodically, but not on a regular basis. (It has two periods when it dims: roughly once every 430 days and once every six years.) During each cycle, dark spots appear on the surface of Betelgeuse, similar to the sunspots sometimes seen on the sun, but far, far larger.  The type of dimming seen on Betelgeuse now, however, is unprecedented.  Betelgeuse is believed to be roughly 425 to 650 light years away and is huge: likely about 1,400 times larger than our sun and about 14,000 times as luminous. As a result, the star is likely at the end of its life cycle and ready to die. And it will do so in a spectacular fashion relatively soon: As an explosion known as a supernova. All of that means this latest activity has some people wondering if — and possibly hoping — that will happen in the coming days.  Dear Betelgeuse... <a href=""https://t.co/1gO2RDpTNI"">pic.twitter.com/1gO2RDpTNI</a> It's important to note that when it comes to astronomical terms, ""relatively soon"" can mean sometime within a few hundred thousand years. And when that happens, Betelgeuse will be as bright as the full moon and visible during the day. This is what the star Betelgeuse exploding would look like from Earth.<br><br>Credit: NHK/Cosmic Front <a href=""https://t.co/PHJha8NJld"">pic.twitter.com/PHJha8NJld</a> So does this new gravitational wave mean the star is ready to go ""Boom!"" at any moment? Probably not. For one, the wave detection is coming from the direction of Betelgeuse — but not necessarily from Betelgeuse itself, said Salvo Vitale, a physics professor at MIT who works with LIGO. As well, just before a supernova, neutrinos are released from a star. That hasn't happened yet. Added to that, he said, is the fact that Betelgeuse is still shining in the night sky, albeit considerably dimmer than normal. ""So putting all those things together, speaking, of course, only on behalf of myself, I would not think that the gravitational-wave candidate … is in any way related to Betelgeuse,"" said Vitale. There's also the chance that what was detected isn't even a gravitational wave at all. The detection doesn't have the characteristics of any known mergers, so it's a mystery as to what caused the detection. (Sometimes a wave results from noise coming from Earth itself, though this isn't believed to be the case in this instance). A false alarm for something like this would only occur once in 25 years. While that may seem like pretty good odds that it's not a false alarm, Vitale notes that other sources of gravitational waves — such as a neutron star-black hole merger — have false alarms more in the range of one in 1,000 years or one in a million years. ""One in 25 years is good, but it is not exceptional,"" said Vitale. ""There is always, in our business, … this saying that when you are [looking at] odds, a good kind of threshold is: Would you bet your coffee on this? Would you bet your car? Or would you bet your house? ""I am, I think, around maybe between coffee and a meal.""  In the meantime, Vitale said, followup observations are continuing. One of the theories for the deep dimming of Betelgeuse is that its two cycles — the 430-day and the six-year ones — have occurred at the same time, causing the deep darkening we're currently observing.  The question is: How much more could the star dim? ""We're talking about uncharted territory here. We have no idea,"" said Stella Kafka, CEO of the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO). ""It's one of those things that is happening for the first time in its recorded history."" It will take a few years to determine whether the dimming is indeed part of a merging of cycles, Kafka said.  She said she is also excited that, for the first time, it's not the large telescopes and astronomical organizations that are doing the observing: Anyone can see Betelgeuse for themselves, even in light-polluted skies. In fact, because the star is typically so bright, observations with smaller telescopes are needed, as well as naked-eye observations — something the AAVSO is calling on amateur astronomers to do more of. And it's the twin mysteries — the deep dimming and the strange gravitational wave — that makes Betelgeuse so interesting, she said. ""The public is very intrigued and very interested in a star that we take for granted,"" Kafka said. ""How many stars do 'interesting' things? ""This is new science in the making,"" she added. ""It's actually part of our everyday experience, and we don't get to do that very often.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/betelgeuse-gravitational-wave-1.5433653,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/kilonova-neutron-stars-1.5266535 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/telescope-best-image-star-antares-1.4259308,N/A

And they're starting to complain,"" Greer said. Two days after the weekend's snowfall, Greer said she's glad to see the spots in front of her store on Queen Street cleared.  On days when the parking spots are snow-covered, she said she sees about half as many customers coming through the door. Around the corner on Water Street, parking is also very limited. It's something Jennifer Ridgway, owner of Moonsnail Soapworks and Nature Store, is also used to.  ""It's reduced to probably about a half or a third of what it normally is. They've cleared one spot across the street for handicapped parking, but everything else is choked with snow,"" she said. ""They do tend to leave certain streets for last. And I guess Water Street, in my experience down here for almost 20 years, it's been one of the last that they clean out, for sure —  the parking spaces, anyway."" After a storm, Ridgway said she sometimes doesn't bother opening her doors in the morning hours to give the city a chance to clear the snow.  The city said it does its best to remove snow as quickly as possible. There are about 250 kilometres of city streets that need to be plowed. And that, along with plowing sidewalks, takes priority before moving on to snow hauling, said Scott Adams, manager of the city's public works. From time to time, he said, the department does hear from local business owners.  ""We do appreciate their understanding,"" he said. ""They do understand the complexity of it, and we do try our best to get the parking spaces cleaned up."" He said the city currently has six plows, five loaders and 13 sidewalk machines.  ""When we do snow removal, so that's all the removing all the snowbanks from around the meters and all that, we need trucks. We don't have the trucks in our fleet,"" Adams said. ""We have to hire contractor trucks. And if we can't get it done early, if we can't predict when the snow's going to be done, it's hard to schedule those trucks to come in.""  While she still has customers coming in, Ridgway said a harsh winter certainly has an effect on her bottom line. ""We're going to get the people who are making an effort to see us, but it has to be people who are mobile and can, you know, walk and maybe climb over a snowbank, you know, to make it in,"" she said.  The city said most metered parking spaces are now cleared downtown, and the crews are now moving outward to secondary streets.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cold-island-winter-keeping-people-from-shopping-spending-money-1.5050687 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775,N/A

""People have this image of the monster avalanches that occur on huge mountains, but that's just sort of the extreme end of it from our perspective. It can still be a problem on smaller, open slopes,"" said Jennifer Hoffman, a member of Avalanche Canada based in western Newfoundland.    Avalanche Canada is a national not-for-profit organization that educates the public about avalanche hazards and risks.  Any slope steeper than 25 degrees has the potential to be hazardous, according to the organization. Hoffman said even on smaller slopes a person can trigger an avalanche themselves, whether it be on foot, snowmobile or skiing and snowboarding. A change in temperature can also be a trigger. Avalanches in eastern Newfoundland are often not thought of as a threat. On Friday, during one of the worst winter storms in recent history, an avalanche triggered in the Battery neighbourhood of St. John's crashed through a home causing extensive damage. It prompted the city and the fire department to partially evacuate residents from the area.  ""The danger is when we have this kind of extreme event of this sudden massive dump of snow, you have a situation where small isolated features cause problems for people,"" Hoffman said. The organization is also warning of cornices — overhanging masses of snow. Cornices can suddenly collapse or fall, and even small ones can weigh several tonnes. Hoffman said that the snow in avalanches is much like the snow pushed to the end of driveways by snowplows. She said it tends to ""set up"" very quickly.  ""A person that's caught in it has a great deal of difficulty of getting out,"" she said. Hoffman's tips in the event you are buried by an avalanche include trying to get to the edge of the moving snow, raising an arm to try to reach the surface and putting a hand over your mouth to create an air space. But the warning from the organization isn't to deter people from getting outside during the winter, Hoffman said — just a reminder to remain cautious.

192,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:31:40.422Z,N.S. advocate of medically assisted death calls for amendments to federal law,"The head of a Nova Scotia charity that advocates for access to medically assisted death is calling for nationwide amendments to the Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) law. Sheilia Sperry, the head of the Nova Scotia chapter of Dying with Dignity, said late-stage consent and the criterion that a death be reasonably foreseeable must be removed from the law. ""How do you tell what's reasonably foreseeable? As someone said yesterday to me, once we're born, our death is reasonably foreseeable,"" Sperry told CBC's Information Morning in an interview Wednesday. In June 2016, Bill C-14 made it legal for terminally ill patients to access medically assisted death. Since then, more than 6,700 Canadians have used MAID to control when and how they died. But last September, the Superior Court of Quebec found it unconstitutional to limit MAID to only people who are already dying or have a ""reasonable foreseeability of natural death,"" according to the federal Criminal Code. The ruling will come into effect in Quebec on March 11, but Sperry said if the federal government doesn't adjust Bill C-14, then the rest of Canada will be ""out of step."" Since the court ruling, Justice Minister David Lametti has said the government is updating legislation across the country. On Jan. 13, the Department of Justice launched a two-week online survey asking Canadians to weigh in on how far to extend access to medically assisted dying. Sperry said the survey is a step in the right direction. She hopes the removal of the late-stage consent rule will be an outcome, which she's calling ""Audrey's Amendment."" Audrey Parker of Halifax chose to die on Nov. 1, 2018, after suffering from terminal cancer. She was approved for MAID and made a video that was released posthumously, which called for the removal of the late-stage consent requirement. In the video, Parker said she wanted to make it to Christmas, but was worried she'd become incompetent and would no longer be able to consent. Sperry said Audrey's Amendment would allow people to live until their chosen death date, even if they lose mental capacity or aren't conscious to consent. She said once a person is approved for MAID, that should be enough. ""It's highly, highly unlikely, after all the discussion, all the review, that anybody would change their mind,"" Sperry said. ""And certainly if somebody did, the doctor is not going to go through with the procedure."" Sperry is hoping the changes are addressed after the survey is completed and by the time the law in Quebec is established on March 11.

194,"Katie Pedersen, Eric Szeto, Asha Tomlinson",2020-01-20T16:56:56.850Z,Nearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why.,"Like many new parents, Meggan Larson was anxious to learn everything she could about keeping her kids healthy. So, she joined community groups and forums on Facebook, hoping to learn the ins and outs of healthy living as she navigated her new role as a parent. What she found instead were piles of warnings about vaccines. ""It seemed like everywhere I looked, there was [a post about] another child being injured by vaccines — and not a child getting polio,"" she said. ""It was definitely convincing."" As a result, Larson became ""vaccine hesitant."" Unlike strident anti-vaccination activists known as ""anti-vaxxers,"" those who are ""vaccine hesitant"" don't consider themselves against vaccination necessarily; they are just unsure about the safety and/or efficacy of vaccines. The number of vaccine-hesitant parents worldwide is growing. Last year, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy a Top 10 threat to global health. ""You just kind of go down a rabbit hole of information,"" said Larson. ""It seemed like the more you clicked on links that people would post, the more stories you would see. And it just seemed so loud."" WATCH | CBC Marketplace's Asha Tomlinson is joined by associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health Dr. Vinita Dubey, answering your questions on vaccinations and myths. Have a question? Ask on YouTube here: About half of Canadians have some level of hesitancy, according to the Wellcome Global Monitor, a survey by a U.K.-based health foundation that looks at global confidence in immunization. In its latest 2018 survey, only 53 per cent of Canadians chose ""strongly agree"" when presented with the statement ""vaccines are safe"" while 58 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are effective"" and 76 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are important."" Marketplace sifted through studies and arguments, examined anti-vaccination documentaries and attended an anti-vaxx rally in Washington, D.C., to get a sense of the information being distributed. The team also spoke with more than a dozen vaccine-hesitant and anti-vaxx Canadians and heard from many more via email. Many of the arguments and scientific studies seemed reasonable, so Marketplace ran them by specialists. Journalists further consulted with toxicologists, vaccinologists, microbiologists, psychologists and academics throughout this investigation, all of whom confirmed the safety and efficacy of vaccines. So, why does anti-vaxx messaging remain so effective at sowing doubt? Some experts point to our cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that help us understand and remember information. The way that misinformation is disseminated on social media manipulates us — intentionally or not — into wanting to believe it. Dr. Olivier Drouin, a Montreal pediatrician with a background in behavioural psychology, sees these biases at play with parents of his patients. ""They just care deeply about their child, and so those cognitive biases are amplified,"" he said. One bias that vaccine misinformation plays on is our omission bias, or our tendency to prefer inaction over action when we are faced with potential negative consequences, because we will feel less personally responsible for the outcome. Larson says she can relate. ""For me, the worry is paralyzing initially because I don't want to hurt my kids,"" she said. Larson said the misinformation she'd read was convincing, so she was delaying making a decision about vaccination until she felt more sure. ""My kids will be fine for now while I figure out what I'm going to do,"" she recalls thinking. ""And the years just go by — and suddenly, you have a five-year-old who's never had a single vaccine."" Another bias that makes us susceptible to misinformation is our identifiable victim bias, or our tendency to feel more connected to the emotional story of a single victim, rather than a larger cause backed by statistics. If a charity wants to inspire people to donate to its cause, for example, it might tell the story of a single victim rather than explaining why a cause is important through figures and facts. Even though she'd seen the statistics proving the benefits of vaccines, Larson said the individual horror stories were more impactful and sowed doubt. ""I was like, 'Gosh, this is happening all the time, I can't do this to my children,'"" she said. Much of the anti-vaccination information spread online is anecdotal. When parents come to Drouin with doubts about vaccines, he says, they often start with an anecdote they read or a video they saw. ""They always start with the story of somebody — either a celebrity, or some relative, or their hairdresser, or somebody in their environment who had a personal story — so they feel that connection,"" he said. ""I think that's one of the strongest biases I see when it comes to vaccinations."" Another big issue, Drouin says, is a bias called probability neglect, or our tendency to disregard numbers when there's a highly emotional potential outcome — even an extremely unlikely one. ""If I'm with my patient, and I speak about the risk of [requiring] a transfusion, for example, it's one in a million. Well, you know, they're not listening to the number,"" said Drouin. His patients immediately start to worry about their child having to be in the ICU and being really sick, he said. ""The minute I mention the risk, it's forgotten,"" he said. ""They're focusing on the vividness of the image it brings to mind."" The bigger the number, the harder it is to put into context, he says. ""What is one in a 100,000 versus a one in a million chance? Like, it's really kind of a strange number to think about,"" he said. ""We don't even really have context about what it means, even though something might be 100 times more likely."" Larson says she struggled with the numbers even after she had decided to vaccinate. ""It was still scary because I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I hope they're not the one in a gazillion who is going to have some horrific reaction,"" she said. So, what convinced Larson to vaccinate? She had started questioning the rhetoric behind the information she was reading and was talking to her doctor about it. ""I started clicking on the sources that anti-vaccine campaigns were linking [to] and realized that most of them were garbage,"" she said. The scientific studies were not the hard evidence she thought they were. ""Once you actually followed it to the conclusion, it didn't actually state at all what [the messaging] said it did."" WATCH | Meggan Larson's children, along with her sister's kids, came down with whooping cough: Just when she was about to book an appointment to vaccinate, Larson's unvaccinated niece came down with whooping cough — and it quickly spread to all five of her niece's siblings, as well as to Larson's three kids. It was a scary reminder of how contagious many vaccine-preventable diseases are, she said. ""Coming across someone with whooping cough or polio, I mean, you're going to get it, it's a miracle if you don't."" All of Larson's kids fully recovered and have since been vaccinated, along with the children of her her sister, Tara Hills. Hills spoke out about vaccine misinformation back in 2015, but it has taken Larson four years to go public about her experience. ""The only reason that I wanted to share my story is because I don't want people to sit in fear anymore,"" she said. Here are some of the most pervasive concerns Canadians have about vaccines, and why experts say we shouldn't worry about them: It's true that vaccines contain chemicals that would be considered toxic at very high doses. But so does pretty much everything humans interact with daily. Even water is toxic in high enough quantities. Although the idea of a ""chemical"" may sound harmful, everything we eat can be broken down into its chemical makeup. A banana, for example, contains dozens of chemical compounds. The vaccine ingredients that most people are concerned about — mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum — are present in very small, non-toxic quantities. Mercury was previously used as a preservative in some vaccines in the form of thimerosal. It was one of the first ingredients that parents took issue with, and there was so much public concern that it was removed from almost all vaccines, despite the fact that it never existed in quantities that would be considered problematic. Vaccines only ever contained 50 micrograms of thimerosal (equal to 25 micrograms of mercury) per 0.5 millilitre dose. For comparison, that's about the same amount of elemental mercury in a three-ounce can of tuna. Nowadays, mercury only exists in certain types of flu shots. Formaldehyde is another ingredient often of concern. There is only between 0.1 mg and 0.003 mg of formaldehyde in a single dose, depending on the vaccine. Compare that to a 200-gram pear, which contains 12 mg of formaldehyde, or 120 times as much. Formaldehyde is actually a chemical that your body creates itself as part of the metabolic process. Aluminum is another ingredient people are concerned about. It is also found in very low quantities in vaccines for diseases such as HPV and hepatitis. Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food and water and breast milk. Keep in mind that very few vaccinations contain aluminum, and those that do, only contain 0.85 mg per dose. Compare that to 10-20 mg of aluminum in one tablet of buffered aspirin. Antacids can contain anywhere from 104 to 208 mg of aluminum per tablet, or more than 100 times more aluminum than any vaccine. The reason it is added to vaccines is because it helps create the immune response needed to develop immunity. Vaccines work by injecting a dead, weakened or partial version of the virus into the body so the immune system can learn what it looks like and how to fight it the next time it is encountered — before it gets deep within the body and causes physical harm. Adjuvants, like aluminum, make that dead virus look more threatening than it is in order to activate an immune response, prompting the body to learn how to fight the disease instead of immediately flushing it out. It is important to note that all traces of aluminum (and the rest of the ingredients in the vaccine) would still be flushed completely out of the body within a day or two, leaving behind only the lessons learned by your immune cells. The ingredients don't build up in the body, therefore, receiving many vaccines will not stack up the levels of aluminum or other ingredients. Learn more about aluminum and other adjuvants here. The claim that links vaccines and autism originates from a now-discredited 1998 study published in the prestigious Lancet medical journal by former gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield titled ""Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children."" There were 13 authors listed on the study, with Wakefield being the lead author. But in 2004, 10 authors retracted the interpretation of the study after ""serious allegations of research misconduct"" were brought to the attention of The Lancet, including allegations of biased selection of patients and unethical, invasive procedures. The journal also found Wakefield had unreported conflicts of interest, namely, that some of the research was funded by lawyers who were acting on behalf of parents suing vaccine manufacturers. As a result, Wakefield lost his medical licence. Many studies have since been done to test his hypothesis, but all scientifically reputable studies found no link. A 900-page analysis by the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) looked at all relevant studies and meta-analysis, finding that ""the mechanistic evidence regarding an association between MMR vaccine and autism is lacking."" This may sound like the science is simply insufficient, but microbiologist Jocelyn Srigley explained that in scientific terms, ""lacking"" is tantamount to saying evidence is not just weak, but absent altogether. The biggest and most recent study looking for a correlation between vaccines and autism followed 657,461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 2013. This study compared MMR-vaccinated with unvaccinated children and found ""no increased risk for autism."" This study even looked at sub-factors, such as sibling history of autism, autism risk factors or other childhood vaccinations to see if those factors could combine with a vaccine to create a higher risk. But again, it found no increased risk. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a profitable industry, but vaccines are not big money-makers compared to other drugs. Only two to three per cent of the global pharmaceutical profits come from vaccines, despite the fact that most people on earth are vaccinated. In fact, most childhood vaccines have expired patents, and it's estimated that once a generic drug enters the market after a patent expiration, name-brand sales drop by 80 per cent. Physicians often lose money on the administration of vaccines, and some governments have to incentivise drug companies to keep making them because of the fact that the profit margins are so low. Vaccines take lots of time and money to develop because the regulatory standards are higher than for other drugs since they are being injected into healthy people. They may make some money in the first few years, but they also have to carry the burden of cost for all the years of research and development. Vaccines prevent millions of people from getting seriously sick every year. If you're worried about motives, keep in mind that Big Pharma makes a lot more money off people who are sick than people whom vaccines have kept healthy. Even though we rarely encouter certain diseases anymore, such as pertussis or polio, they are only kept at bay because the vast majority of the population is vaccinated. If you talk to older generations, they'll tell you stories of their friends who became deaf, blind, disabled or died from the diseases that vaccines have eliminated in North America. In areas where vaccination rates drop past a certain threshold, we can see resurgence of these diseases, which can be picked up and brought back to countries that had virtually eliminated them. For example, Samoa had a significant drop in vaccination rates over the past few years due in part to anti-vaccination campaigns and an MMR scare after a nurse accidentally mixed up two shots with an expired anesthetic, resulting in two deaths. When measles made it into the community, it quickly infected thousands of people; 81 of those infected died, and almost all of them were babies and young children. Authorities arrested an anti-vaxxer for spreading misinformation during the epidemic while the government was frantically trying to get everyone vaccinated. The only disease that has been entirely eradicated worldwide is smallpox. This was because of a very effective mass-vaccination initiative in the 1960s that managed to drive the disease into extinction. Polio is a candidate for eradication, with only three endemic countries left. Until complete eradication is reached, vaccination is still necessary for highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Measles can live for two hours while airborne, which means if an unvaccinated person entered a room where someone with measles coughed an hour earlier, they would still be likely to catch the virus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccines-trust-1.5181208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955,N/A
195,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:34:58.067Z,"Greenhouse gas 12,000 times worse than CO2 shows surprise rise in the atmosphere","A greenhouse gas that can cause 12,000 times more warming per tonne than carbon dioxide is rising unexpectedly in the atmosphere, despite reports by its major producers, China and India, that they've mostly eliminated emissions of the gas. Atmospheric gas measurements at five stations around the world show that emissions of HFC-23 or trifluoromethane reached a record high in 2018 of 15,900 tonnes, reports a study led by Kieran Stanley, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol. That's a lot higher than the 2,400 tonnes of emissions of that gas reported by China and India to the United Nations Environment Program in 2017, notes the study, published this week in Nature Communications. HFC-23 is a byproduct in the production of the refrigerant HCFC-22, which is a greenhouse gas and depletes the ozone layer. Based on China's and India's reports, scientists had expected to see HFC-23 levels drop 90 per cent between 2015 and 2017 in measurements by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. Instead, the difference between reported and measured emissions during that period is equivalent to all of Spain's carbon emissions for one year, the researchers estimate. ""Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,"" said Stanley in a news release from the University of Bristol. ""Alternatively, or additionally, there may be substantial unreported production of HCFC-22 at unknown locations, resulting in unaccounted-for HFC-23 byproduct being vented to the atmosphere,"" the study suggests. HFC-23 produced during the manufacture of HCFC-22 was traditionally released into the atmosphere. Under international agreements to protect the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol and its 2016 Kigali Amendment, HFC-23 is supposed to be destroyed. However, the phaseout is slower for developing countries such as China and India and isn't officially yet in effect. Nevertheless, both countries were reporting reductions, and India passed a regulation in 2016 requiring incineration of HFC-23. The authors of the new study say more regional  measurements are needed to verify whether that's actually happening.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/hfc-23-1.5435013,[],N/A

CBC News has learned Peterson filed his papers with the party on Tuesday. His team is now collecting the 1,000 signatures from Conservative members he needs to enter the race by the Feb. 27 deadline. ""We cannot have a Conservative leadership race without a voice from the West,"" Peterson told CBC News. ""I am an outsider. I am not an MP but, on the other hand, I've got some business experience that we're looking forward to bringing to the table. And it's vital."" Peterson will formally announce his candidacy next week at High Arctic Energy Services, an oilfield services company near Edmonton. The choice of location is symbolic: Peterson is planting his flag as the party's western-based champion of the energy sector. ""The grassroots of the party are in Western Canada,"" he said. ""So the Conservative Party has to take a leadership role. And has to continue taking a leadership role on the resource file. ""And my candidacy from the heart of the resource sector, from Western Canada, will be a strong, bold platform of policy ideas, including the resource sector, in both official languages across the country."" Peterson said he'll also be pitching policies on carbon pricing for large emitters, digital privacy, deregulating the banking and telecom sectors, helping students with their loans and eliminating corporate income taxes. Peterson is fluently bilingual. He has family in Quebec and said that he and his team will devote a ""big part"" of the campaign to building support there. ""I have a grandson, he is Quebecois. Born a year ago and he's giving me one more reason to come back to Quebec on an ongoing basis. I can't wait to see him,"" he said. ""A big part of our campaign is going to be in Quebec. I was lucky to have lived in France for 10 years as a young man so my French is pretty good."" Peterson said he'd hoped to back Rona Ambrose's leadership bid. The former interim Conservative leader confirmed today that she's not running. ""We're in. We're all in. Once you launch, you can't back out,"" Peterson said. Peterson finished at the back of the pack in 2017 — 12th out of fourteen candidates, with just 0.7 per cent of the vote by the time he was eliminated. Peterson said he knows the current race could be a tough one for him as well, with party heavyweights like Peter MacKay, Marilyn Gladu, Pierre Pollievre and Erin O'Toole primed to run. ""They have the advantage of name recognition. They have an advantage of a network, I'm sure, across Canada,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to be the only candidate who has to meet a payroll, who's hiring and firing people, who's working in the private sector. So we all have our strengths, we all have our weaknesses.

198,Tori Weldon,2020-01-21T21:36:05.171Z,MLA's executive assistant charged with assault of provincial employee,"Shawn Douthwright, the executive assistant to Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Minister Ross Wetmore, is being charged with assaulting a provincial road worker. Court documents say the alleged assault on Scott McLaughlan took place on July 4, 2019, near Second North River, about 28 kilometres west of Moncton. The documents were filed Dec. 27. McLaughlan could not be reached by CBC News for a comment, but CUPE 1190 laid out the allegations, quoting union member McLaughlan, in a news release last November.  The release said Wetmore and Douthwright drove up to a Department of Transportation roadside work site along Route 112, where McLaughlan and other workers were gathered. Wetmore ""shouted at us, insulted us, using derogatory words and saying road workers were incompetent,"" McLaughlan is quoted as saying. The union accused both the Progressive Conservative MLA for Gagetown-Petitcodiac and his assistant of insulting the employees. The release went on to allege that the situation escalated when Douthwright grabbed McLaughlin by the shoulders and shouted an expletive at him. Union president Brent Wiggins alleged this was not an isolated incident and said in the release that there has been ""repeated harassment"" of highway workers by Wetmore. When reached by the CBC, Douthwright replied in an email: ""I look forward to telling my story in the proper venue. I have no comment at this time."" Communications director Vicky Deschênes said there would be no comment from the province because ""it would be inappropriate to discuss a matter before the courts.""  But the alleged assault was addressed in the legislature on three separate occasions late last year.  Robert McKee, the Liberal MLA for Moncton Centre, broached the issue on Nov. 22, 2019, when he outlined the allegations during question period and said, ""we would like to give the minister an opportunity to give his side of the story to the house here this morning."" To which Wetmore replied, in part, ""I've been told that this has been forwarded to the RCMP, so right at the time being I'll have no comment."" McKee then asked Wetmore if he would be willing to step down from cabinet until the matter was fully resolved. Wetmore answered by saying: ""This is an HR [human resources] issue that has been dealt with, and I have no intention of commenting any more until this has been concluded with the RCMP."" McKee accused Wetmore of deflecting and then asked Premier Blaine Higgs about removing Wetmore from his position. ""I can't speak of the particulars of that situation, but I am under the understanding it has been fully dealt with,"" said Higgs, who said that because of privacy issues, he wasn't free to discuss what happened. The next week, questions persisted from the Liberals. Lisa Harris, the Miramichi Bay-Neguac MLA, asked the premier specifically how the matter was dealt with and what consequences there were for Wetmore and Douthwright. Wetmore responded again that it was a human resources issue, and anyone wanting to know more should file an access to information request with the province.  He then spoke about his success as a minister, a response that surprised Harris. ""Mr. Speaker, it is unreal that the member opposite would switch the conversation when we are talking about a serious allegation.""  She again asked if Wetmore would be stepping down. Higgs replied: ""I agree with the member. It is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to have any type of abusive situation, whether it be physical or verbal. We would not tolerate it, and we did not."" He then suggested someone had been disciplined. ""We feel that the disciplinary action was suitable for the situation and that it was done promptly,"" Higgs said. But he did not say what disciplinary action was taken. Higgs said if the RCMP were to investigate, his government would co-operate. An investigation by the RCMP resulted in a charge of assault against Douthwright. He is scheduled for a first appearance in a Moncton court on Friday. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wetmore-douthwright-assault-road-worker-highway-mclaughlan-1.5434988,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/nadine-wilson-assult-charges-withdrawn-1.5375828 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/snow-crab-right-whale-fishing-gear-research-1.5143321,N/A

It was before I turned 19, because my celebration didn't include the traditional first (legal) bar visit. It was before I started university, because I was able to enjoy being the only sober person at the end-of-orientation-week party, where I banked some wild stories to recount to my friends once they recovered from their hangovers. I had had the occasional sip of alcohol as a teenager, and I thought it tasted terrible. I never enjoyed the astringent kick of wine, the malty foulness of beer. But, honestly, who does? Alcoholic drinks taste objectively bad to most people at first. As the saying goes, you don't drink them for the taste, and it's likely that if alcoholic beverages were uncoupled from their euphoric effects we wouldn't drink them at all. The difference between me and most of my peers, I suppose, is that I wasn't enthusiastic enough about the idea of getting buzzed to push through the nasty flavour. My choice puzzled my friends at the time. After all, in our society we drink alcohol not only for its pleasurable effects but as a rite of passage. Alcohol is a symbol of our transition into adulthood, and most teenagers are anxious to enjoy adult freedoms and to prove themselves worthy of adult responsibilities. We indulge in alcohol furtively when we begin to feel suffocated by the authority of our parents and guardians. We partake in alcohol openly to celebrate when our numerical age makes us legally (if not actually) independent from them. When I declined a glass or bottle, I often found myself in the hot seat, being grilled on my reasons for abstaining. Not drinking, I've discovered, is one of the few purely personal choices that can make even strangers deeply uncomfortable. It's a singular experience to be questioned about why you don't drink alcohol, because there are a limited number of answers people consider legitimate. An illness, a religious doctrine, a family history of alcoholism — these seem to be acceptable explanations for abstaining. My reasons? I don't like the taste, I'm having a good time already, I just don't feel like it? These never seem to be good enough, so much so that I've sometimes fallen back on the excuse that there's been alcoholism in my family (which is true, but not a factor) just to cut these awkward conversations short. Why all this public concern over one aspect of my diet? I don't like spicy food or cilantro either, but no one interrogates me about that. Not drinking, on the other hand, is often taken as an affront. This is probably a legacy of the temperance movement, the organized crusade against alcohol consumption that snowballed during the 19th and early 20th centuries and eventually led to prohibition. The temperance movement took a moral stance against alcohol and portrayed drinkers as reckless libertines or hopeless degenerates. As a result, when you say you don't drink, even today, the people around you begin to wonder if you're looking down your nose at them like the temperance teetotallers of yore. Add to that the fact that our society considers alcohol essential for relaxing, socializing, and partying, and the non-drinker becomes a very suspicious animal indeed. Is she a puritanical square, the sworn enemy of all things fun? This heap of cultural baggage makes it difficult for each of us to untangle how we really feel about alcohol from how we're supposed to feel about it, how alcohol really affects our bodies from our expectations of how it should affect them. I know a number of moderate drinkers who've recently given up alcohol after realizing they don't actually enjoy drinking. Alcohol is a depressant. It can lower your inhibitions and relax you, but it can also dampen your mood and make you feel gloomier than you did before. If you're already prone to depression, drinking alcohol may not be a fantastic experience. Others quit drinking because it's getting in the way of their fitness goals (many alcoholic beverages are high in calories but, because they're liquids, don't fill you up) or because they want to save money. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians spend $1,056 per person on alcohol each year. Each of us deserves to assess for ourselves whether drinking works for us, our bodies, and our pocketbooks. So, I propose a reality-based reset of our society's approach to alcohol: Whether you'll be enjoying the occasional drink this month or having a dry January, just remember that, if you're of legal age, drinking is an option, not a requirement.

200,Anonymous,2020-01-23T16:13:58.003Z,Regina event showcases Indigenous women's voices on day that controversial lecture had been scheduled,"An event at the First Nations University of Canada in Regina Thursday is bringing together women to have their voices heard.  Speaking for Ourselves will feature women performing songs and poetry, as well as an open mic. The event runs from 4:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. CST and open to the public.  It comes after a Campus Smudge Walk set to begin at the Tipi Doors at the First Nations University of Canada at 11 a.m. CST. Chasity Delorme said the idea for the event was sparked after the University of Regina invited George Elliot Clarke to speak at the previously planned Woodrow Lloyd Lecture. The lecture had been scheduled for Thursday.  In December, there were calls for the lecture to be cancelled due to Clarke having edited poetry for Steven Kummerfield, who was convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of Pamela George in 1995. Clarke told CBC that he wasn't ruling out reading Kummerfield's work during the lecture. Clarke later apologized to members of George's family, said he would not read any of Kummerfield's poetry at the event and, the following day, cancelled the lecture completely.  Delorme said she and other women were talking before the cancellation and decided to take things into their own hands. ""That's kind of where the seed was planted,"" Delorme said.  Delorme said the organizers kept Pamela George's family's emotions and thoughts at the forefront while planning the event. One of the guest presenters is Chelsey George — Pamela's daughter.  The organizers call their group Matriarchs on Duty, inspired by the traditional role of women in Indigenous society, Delorme said.  ""Historically it was the women who oversaw what happens in the community. Although we had male chiefs to represent us — it was always the women who made decisions,"" she said. ""So we are also reclaiming our space within our communities and taking on the responsibility of protecting our community."" Delorme said inviting Clarke to give the lecture was wrong to begin with.  ""It's unfortunate that the committee who selected him didn't do their research,"" she said. ""Even when they did find out the connection, their lack of empathy is still actually what the community is hurting from."" Truth and reconciliation should have superseded academic freedom of speech in this case, Delorme said.  ""The ripple effect was not only the family,"" she said. ""But an entire community lost their faith in the University of Regina.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/matriatchs-on-duty-hosting-regina-event-1.5437425,[],N/A
201,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:13:02.451Z,Judges reserve decision in William Sandeson's appeal of murder case,"A panel of judges in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal has reserved its decision in the case of convicted killer William Sandeson, who's trying to get a new trial for the August 2015 killing of Taylor Samson in Halifax. On the final day of a two-day hearing, the judges peppered a Crown lawyer Tuesday morning with questions about the conduct of a private detective described as a ""traitor"" by a lawyer for Sandeson. Samson, a Dalhousie University student, was killed in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. The hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway yesterday in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer, Ian Smith, asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes live blogged from court. Smith focused much of his arguments on Bruce Webb, a retired RCMP sergeant who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men — Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe —  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment. Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe. The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, but Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold refused. Smith argued Arnold underestimated the seriousness of Webb's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb. MacLellan said Arnold found Sandeson's fair trial rights were not infringed upon because the witnesses' evidence would have come out even without Webb having spoken to police. She also noted Arnold determined that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. Judges on the three-member Court of Appeal panel spent much of yesterday afternoon and this morning asking MacLellan about Webb's actions. Justice David Farrar questioned Arnold's characterization of Webb ""merely"" telling the police to requestion the witnesses when describing the impact of his actions. ""This is a breach of a duty that Webb had to his client … and it's during the trial process,"" said Farrar. MacLellan reiterated that Arnold found police did not do anything wrong in their handling of Webb's information. She said he considered Sandeson's right to a fair trial against the defence's request for a mistrial. She noted a mistrial is a ""remedy of last resort,"" and a particularly undesirable one seven weeks into a trial.  ""Other less drastic remedies have to be considered,"" said MacLellan. ""The trial judge is in the best position to determine in the circumstances of what has happened here if a mistrial is the best remedy."" Smith also argued that a search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant was not lawful, because there were no ""exigent circumstances"" that justified their actions. But MacLellan argued the situation was urgent, as at that point it was a case of suspected kidnapping and therefore an ongoing concern. She noted Sandeson's first statement to police, which he gave voluntarily, raised concerns with police when they compared his answers to his text messages and found out he had lied about meeting Samson that night. He said police searched Sandeson's apartment because they believed it was the last place Samson had been seen. Smith also claimed that Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officers' aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. MacLellan noted that kidnapping is ""not a bloodless crime,"" and that the investigation was at that point still a kidnapping. She said the phrasing of the officers' questions — such as, ""Why won't you help him, Will?'"" — suggested Samson was still alive. ""It shows that they're very sincere in their belief that this is still a kidnapping and it's nothing more than a hunch, or serious fear, that Samson is dead,"" said MacLellan. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years. In his closing arguments, Smith said a new trial would allow Sandeson to apply for a stay of proceedings. If that remedy wasn't available to him, Smith said Sandeson could apply to have certain evidence excluded from a new trial, such as the evidence from Blades and McCabe.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-snowmobile-crash-new-ross-lunenburg-county-1.5434326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-provincial-park-development-golf-eastern-shore-1.5433792 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/prince-andrew-high-school-name-change-online-forum-1.5433374 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-outbreak-province-sexually-transmitted-infection-1.5433651,N/A
202,Ariel Fournier,2020-01-23T17:32:00.563Z,"For this Alberta woman, the good news was she had contracted a rare, deadly parasite","Cassidy Armstrong went in for surgery last fall to remove what doctors thought was a tumour on her liver. She had been diagnosed with a suspected rare cancer that, even with the surgery, would probably have left her with only a few years to live. Instead, doctors found something even rarer: a grapefruit-sized mass caused by the eggs of a tapeworm.  Armstrong was still recovering in a Calgary hospital in November when doctors told her she likely had a parasite called Echinococcus multilocularis, previously confirmed in fewer than 20 Canadians, almost all of them in Alberta. ""I was still a little doped up on painkillers,"" she said. ""So I said, 'Is that a good thing?' And they said, 'It's definitely better.'"" It was certainly an improvement on the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma, a rare form of liver cancer that typically attacks otherwise healthy patients under the age of 40. It wasn't until a pathologist analyzed the mass that the parasite was discovered.  But it's still a dangerous infection — without surgery, she would have died.  The parasite lives as a tapeworm in coyotes, foxes and, increasingly, domestic dogs. The tapeworm's eggs are spread to other animals, such as rodents, from the feces of infected animals.  When a person accidentally swallows the microscopic eggs, the infection can lead to cyst-like lesions on the liver. But it will only cause minimal symptoms until the growths reach a significant size.  The tapeworm had likely been growing inside Armstrong, 36, for more than a decade.  ""It was almost a Christmas miracle,"" she said. ""It could have been a lot worse."" Armstrong had worked physically demanding jobs — she'd been a motorcycle mechanic in Edmonton before moving to Banff last year to work as a stage carpenter — and was in good health, though occasionally noticed she was fatigued. About two years ago, she felt tenderness in her ribs. X-rays didn't find anything, she said, and eventually the pain subsided.  While in Banff, the pain in her side returned and became almost constant. It was accompanied by a new pain in her shoulder.   She worried she had gallstones and insisted on an ultrasound. That's when the mass was discovered, she said, leading to the cancer diagnosis and grim news that surgery wouldn't guarantee her more than a few more years. ""I would have lived maybe another two to five years. There were a lot of things going through my mind,"" she said. ""Mainly, what's the point?"" Her cancer surgery was the equivalent of an open-heart operation. Surgeons scraped part of her lungs, removed a large part of her kidney and removed the mass from her diaphragm. She has a 14-inch, L-shaped scar on her chest that is still not completely closed, two months after surgery.  Armstrong's parasitic clump is one of the largest physicians have seen in Alberta. And they've seen a few. ""We're definitely the hot spot,"" said Dr. Stan Houston, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta.  To date, there have been 15 cases of Echinococcus multilocularis in Alberta. When Armstrong's case is scientifically confirmed, she will be number 16, he said.  It's believed the strain has been arriving in Canada in dogs brought over from Europe and in foxes imported decades ago for hunting.  It has existed in Europe for around 150 years, and there are about 1,800 human cases every year, mostly in China and Tibet. A 2012 study found that the parasite was well-established in Alberta's wild animal population, with about one-quarter of the province's coyote population infected with the tapeworm. The first Canadian human case was diagnosed in 2013. ""[Before the last decade] we never had people with this disease in all of North America,"" Houston said. ""In the last six years, we've had 15 definitely proven cases, just in Alberta."" Since 2014, Canadian researchers have warned that the parasite could easily be misdiagnosed by physicians as another liver disease or ailment. ""About half our cases were found by accident,"" Houston said. In those cases, imaging revealed an abnormal growth in the liver.  There's no guaranteed cure for Echinococcus multilocularis. Infected patients must take a parasite medication for the rest of their lives to prevent the tapeworm eggs from causing further growths.  A drug called albendazole, normally used to treat other tropical parasites, can act as a preventative treatment. While it is widely available in Africa, Europe and Asia, the drug company hasn't applied to Health Canada to access the Canadian market.  Houston said he applies for special access to the drug every six months on behalf of his patients.  A spokesperson for Health Canada said there are clinical trials in Canada that may lead to approval in the future.  Armstrong doesn't know how she was infected, but suspects it could have come from her work fixing farm equipment or from produce purchased at farmer's markets. Houston said most patients in Alberta were dog owners, but Armstrong hasn't had pets since she was a kid. Houston's main advice for prevention is meticulous hand-washing, particularly if you have dogs at home. Regularly de-worming your dog can be helpful as well.  ""We're hoping to learn more about the ecology of this disease in Alberta so we can give more precise advice,"" he said.  After Armstrong's cancer diagnosis, she went on sick leave and moved back to Edmonton to be close to family during her recovery. She is still struggling with pain as her incisions heal. Armstrong may never know how she got sick, but she believes it is important to raise awareness about the disease. ""It's a scary thing and there's still so much we don't know,"" she said. ""I would like to see more funding for research so more people don't have to go through what I went through.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/parasite-cassidy-armstrong-tapeworm-alberta-1.5436828,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.5166570/brain-surgeons-went-looking-for-a-tumour-but-found-a-tapeworm-instead-1.5166571 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tapeworm-echinococcus-multilocularis-alberta-klein-calgary-veterinarian-disease-coyotes-dogs-1.5224864,N/A
203,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:53:14.614Z,Monty Python performer and director Terry Jones dead at 77 ,"Terry Jones, a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, has died at 77. He had been suffering from dementia. Jones's agent said he died Tuesday evening. In a statement, his family said he died ""after a long, extremely brave but always good-humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD."" In 2016 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which gradually robbed him of the ability to write and speak. Jones's wife, Anna Soderstrom, and children Bill, Sally and Siri, said ""we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades."" With fellow Britons Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and American Terry Gilliam, Jones formed Monty Python's Flying Circus, whose anarchic and surreal humour helped revolutionize comedy. Jones wrote and performed for the troupe's TV series, which ran over five years on BBC and was later picked up in the U.S. by PBS, and their films. Jones directed Monty Python's Life of Brian, with a co-director credit with Gilliam on Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life. He went on to direct the non-Python films Personal Services starring Julie Walters and Erik the Viking starring Cleese and Tim Robbins. He also wrote books on medieval and ancient history, presented documentaries, directed films, wrote poetry and wrote the script for the Jim Henson-directed fantasy film Labyrinth. In 2014, the group reunited for a series of shows at London's O2 Arena, one of which was later filmed, entitled Monty Python Live (Mostly). ""His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programs, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath,"" they said. Chapman died in 1989 of cancer, while Neil Innes, the musician often known as the ""seventh Python"" for his contributions to their songs and sketches, died in December. Palin paid tribute to his longtime colleague in a statement given to Britain's Press Association, while on social media Cleese, Idle, Gilliam and British comedians Stephen Fry and David Walliams were among those remembering Jones fondly. ""He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian — writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have,"" said Palin. You will be very missed old friend. I feel very fortunate to have shared so much of my life with Terry. <a href=""https://t.co/4oNANoIeB2"">pic.twitter.com/4oNANoIeB2</a> ""So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him,"" added Idle. ""Terry was someone totally consumed with life … a brilliant, constantly questioning, iconoclastic, righteously argumentative and angry but outrageously funny and generous and kind human being … and very often a complete pain in the ass,"" said Gilliam. ""One could never hope for a better friend."" ""It feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently away … Two down, four to go,"" said Cleese. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones attended Oxford University, where he began writing and performing with fellow student Palin. After leaving university, he wrote for seminal 1960s comedy series including The Frost Report and Do Not Adjust Your Set before Monty Python's Flying Circus was formed. Jones's roles with the troupe included playing the mother of Brian, a hapless young man who is mistaken for Jesus. He delivered one of the Pythons' most famous lines: ""He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy!"" In Meaning of Life he portrayed Mr. Creosote, the corpulent fine dining patron who at first refuses a ""wafer-thin mint"" after his meal but then consumes it, exploding on his fellow restaurant goers. I loved him the moment I saw him on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963. So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him.

The outdoor retailer, which lost more than $11 million in the past fiscal year, is aiming to cut costs, and change what it stocks and how it staffs, according to an online statement from CEO Phil Arrata. The statement was released after the company's 22 stores across Canada were shut down on Sunday afternoon for a nationwide all-staff meeting, according to employees at several outlets. Store managers read a statement outlining the new direction Arrata plans to take MEC. In some stores that meant a handful of layoffs. MEC declined to confirm a total number. But in his statement, Arrata said the co-op would move away from using casual employees and hire more permanent staff, and aim to sharpen customer service. More than 950 casual staff will be given full- or part-time jobs, with benefits, Arrata said.  ""While MEC is not profit-driven in the same way as the retailers we compete against, we still must be profitable to ensure we deliver great service to our members,"" Arrata said, citing the retailer's co-op model, in an open letter to staff posted online Jan. 20. MEC also plans to sublet its $28-million head office on Great Northern Way in Vancouver.

Employees were seeking better wages and working conditions. Arrata, the former chief financial officer at Best Buy Canada, joined MEC in the summer of 2019 and said he was given the mandate to infuse the chain with more profitability. ""I think we could take on the competition. I think we could do better,"" he told CBC in a recent interview. MEC reported an $11.5-million net loss on $462.4 million in sales in 2018/19.

205,Inayat Singh,2020-01-23T09:00:00.402Z,Alberta's looming multibillion-dollar orphan wells problem prompts auditor general probe,"As Alberta struggles to clean up thousands of oil and gas wells left behind by bankrupt companies, the province's auditor general is set to investigate how the problem became so big and why the industry regulator's efforts to collect security deposits came up so short, CBC News has learned. Often referred to as orphan wells, there are currently 3,406 such wells scattered around the province, usually on the properties of rural landowners, where they lie untended. There are another 94,000 inactive wells in the province, with the worry that many of these may become orphaned as their owners struggle — and taxpayers could be left with the bill. The auditor general's office will look at whether the province is doing enough to prevent wells from becoming orphaned in the first place, and whether it is prepared for more to be added to the list due to ongoing pressure on Alberta's energy economy. ""We will be focusing on both whether the government — and specifically the Alberta Energy Regulator — has the systems and processes to assess whether orphan oil and gas sites are being managed and reclaimed efficiently and economically in the best interests of Albertans,"" said Val Mellesmoen, spokesperson for the Office of the Auditor General of Alberta.  The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), an arm's-length agency of the provincial government that oversees the energy industry and its activities, has a liability management system that is supposed to make sure companies that are permitted to drill have a healthy enough bottom line to pay for cleanup later on.  If a company's estimated assets fall below the cost of its environmental liabilities, the AER can collect and hold what's effectively a security deposit to make sure there's money on hand for cleanup if the company later walks away from the well. But the regulator has been using a formula based on out-of-date commodity prices that has inflated the assets of many companies. As a result, companies were not asked to put down large enough security deposits for future cleanup. The province's own estimate of the eventual cleanup bill for every oil and gas well in Alberta is $30 billion, while the AER only holds $227 million in financial security. ""The promise of this production was that companies would clean up their mess,"" said Nikki Way, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank based in Calgary.  ""I'm disappointed that we're at the point where the 'polluter pays' principle is not being upheld and we're considering cleaning up a bill that was always supposed to be accounted for."" Alberta has asked the federal government to help pay for cleaning up orphan wells. In a November 2019 letter sent by Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews to Bill Morneau, his federal counterpart, the province asked Ottawa for funding and tax instruments to encourage investment in well reclamation. ""This system is just not sustainable,"" said Lucija Muehlenbachs, an economist at the University of Calgary who specializes in the energy industry. ""It's not functioning, so it will have to be completely thrown out the window. But it's many years too late."" The AER uses a liability management rating, or LMR, to determine whether a company has enough money to clean up its wells down the line. If the company's estimated assets — calculated based on the amount of resources in its wells — are less than the estimated cost of cleaning up the wells, the company has to pay a security deposit. But the AER has been using commodity prices from 2008-2010, back when oil prices were much higher, to estimate the value of assets. Even though the regulator assesses these assets every month, because of its use of old commodity prices, many companies that should be putting up security deposits have not had to.  And simply adjusting the calculation now to account for current prices isn't an easy fix, according to the AER, because it could force struggling companies into bankruptcy. ""In many cases, this would have negative consequences for those already facing financial difficulties, and increases the risk that end-of-life obligations would not be addressed,"" AER spokesperson Shawn Roth said in an email. Meanwhile, landowners who agreed to lease their land to oil companies so they could drill wells were promised the companies would clean up after the wells were done producing and restore the surface of the land to its original state. Instead, many are left with inactive wells that nobody is monitoring, let alone cleaning up and closing. Dwight Popowich has an oil well on his property near Two Hills, Alta., about 100 kilometres east of Edmonton, that was drilled in 2008. It stopped producing in 2012, and its owner, Sequoia Resources Corp., stopped operating in March 2018. No remediation work has been done on the well. Popowich is waiting for the well to be transferred to the Orphan Well Association, which is an industry- and government-supported group that is trying to manage orphan wells. But, in the meantime, no one is monitoring the well on his property. ""We don't know if it's safe. We don't know if it's leaking. Nobody's showing up to even take a look at it,"" Popowich said. Sequoia held licences for 2,300 wells when it ceased operations in 2018. For Popowich, the well has become a financial headache in addition to an environmental problem. He wanted to subdivide his land and sell off half of it to help pay for his retirement. But the well is in the way. ""Nobody wants to buy the land if they have to deal with a well that's in limbo,"" he said. Across the border in North Dakota, as oil prices declined, the state saw a growing number of inactive wells, but it has not experienced the same problem with orphan wells as Alberta. North Dakota has strict timelines in place to deal with inactive wells. If a well stops producing for as little as three months, it's immediately flagged. The state also collects a bond from companies upfront — $50,000 US if the company is drilling one well — and can use that money to pay for plugging and remediating wells.  North Dakota, which is the second largest crude oil producer in the U.S. after Texas, has only 1,683 inactive wells — and not one of them is an orphan. The head of North Dakota's regulator says a combination of a bond system and plugging and reclamation fund is essential for preventing orphan wells. ""You've got to start somewhere,"" said Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Alberta, on the other hand, does not have any timeline for how long a company can leave a well inactive. This has raised concerns that many of the approximately 94,000 inactive wells in Alberta may become orphaned before their owners clean them up.  Alberta's industry knows the liability management system needs to change, and the AER and provincial government have said they are reviewing the program. The AER says a new system would gather more company-specific information to gain a more holistic view of whether a company can meet its environmental obligations.  But the government and regulator have to tread lightly on an industry that's struggling. ""We want to see progress on the file, but you have to manage the unintended consequences,"" said Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""You don't want to create more defaults. There are a lot of companies struggling. We are empathetic to that."" Nikki Way of the Pembina Institute says concerns over low oil prices should not stop the government from taking action now. New wells can be treated differently, with more financial security collected prior to drilling. She points out that while the government has to balance the profitability of the industry with any new regulations, the liability problem will continue to grow if nothing is done. ""The pressures aren't going away any time soon,"" she said. ""So the scope of the problem needs to be front and centre and transparent.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-orphan-wells-liability-audit-review-1.5433603,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-redwater-investment-consequences-1.5359734 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/crown-drilling-rights-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-oil-1.5371524 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-orphan-wells-1.5427559 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A
206,Shane Magee,2020-01-21T09:00:00.557Z,Moncton hopes new bylaw prompts development in hard-to-access areas,"Moncton approved a new bylaw Monday the city hopes will help kick-start development in hard to access parts of the city that needs new, and costly infrastructure. ""When you look at the city, all of the easy land has been developed,"" Bill Budd, the city's director of urban planning, told council Monday. He hopes the new bylaw will help fill in the gaps, leading to development in areas previously considered hard to reach.  The new Development Charge Bylaw sets out mechanisms to pay for new infrastructure like bridges or water and sewer lines Budd said otherwise would be too costly for private developers to take on.  Previously, Budd said if the city opted not to pay for capital costs of something like a bridge, the developer would have been responsible for it before any development could start. Budd said that meant a part of the city dubbed the Vision Lands between Wheeler Boulevard and the Trans-Canada Highway that require new roads, bridges and other water and sewer infrastructure was less appealing to develop. The city has long eyed the Vision Lands, which includes about 1,400 acres of mostly undeveloped property, as the next big area for growth in the city.  The bylaw passed second and third reading unanimously Monday following a public hearing. No one voiced objections to the bylaw in advance of the hearing or during the meeting. ""It's too bad we didn't have this years ago,"" Deputy mayor Pierre Boudreau said. For now, the new bylaw applies only to an area along a stretch of Twin Oaks Drive where a new YMCA is under construction in the city's growing north end.  However, Budd said the concepts in the bylaw would be used as the basis for future bylaws to implement the system in other parts of the city, such as the Vision Lands. Before a bylaw is introduced, though, Budd said the city will carry out a study to determine what infrastructure may be needed. The city paid the costs of the study for Twin Oaks, but said future studies may be cost-shared with developers.   Budd listed several areas where the bylaw could be used beyond Twin Oaks and the Vision Lands. One example is the area southwest of the Junction development along the corner of Main Street and Vaughan Harvey Boulevard.  Ivan Rand Drive branches off Vaughan Harvey through the development, but stops at Jonathan Creek. Another portion starts on Main Street near car dealerships. Budd said Ivan Rand is meant to be connected, but would require a bridge over the creek. The development charge bylaw could be used to fund that bridge, he said.  The city previously used a payment mechanism that changes to provincial legislation meant could not longer apply. That prompted the city to hire Watson & Associates Economists Ltd., a consulting firm that's worked with other cities on preparing similar bylaws.  ""I think this will be a model for most municipalities to do this in the future,"" Budd said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-council-development-charges-bylaw-growth-1.5433926,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-ymca-moncton-north-end-1.5343137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-construction-permits-development-1.5315065,N/A

Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins said authorities began receiving calls of multiple gunshot victims in the area of 3rd Avenue and Pine Street about 5 p.m. PT. One person was found dead and five others were taken to Seattle's Harborview Medical Centre by fire and medical personnel, he said. The person who died was a woman around 40 to 50 years old, fire officials told the Seattle Times. Later Wednesday, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg and fire officials said a total of seven people were being treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds. A woman around age 55 was in critical condition, a 9-year-old boy was in serious condition and five men were in ""satisfactory"" condition. Police Chief Carmen Best said based on video from the scene, multiple people fired weapons after a dispute outside a McDonald's. Police, including homicide and gang units, were investigating, she said. The suspects fled the scene and no arrests have been made. Samantha Cook, 40, said she was refilling her transit card in a nearby station when she heard gunfire. ""I was on the first set of escalators,'' Cook told the Times. ""There were a lot of gunshots that started going off — maybe 10 or 11. It was just rapid fire.'' Tyler Parsons told the Times he was was working near the scene when he saw people drop to the ground.

Earlier that night, a man had walked into the emergency room on his own with stab wounds. He was immediately seen and treated by staff and was then sent to rest in a special area for those suffering from shock, said Sylvain Pomerleau, the assistant director of nursing for critical and specialized care at the CISSS des Laurentides. Pomerleau said two men barged into the specialized area soon after. They were asked to leave and were being escorted out by two security guards when one of the men assaulted a guard. The other guard tried to help his colleague and then the other suspect became violent, he said. At that point, a code white, signalling that there is a violent or out-of-control person on site, was issued to staff. He said nurses and attendants who are trained for these types of situations came to their aid and were also injured in the brawl. Pomerleau said all eight staff members were seen by a doctor after the incident. Four have been given a few days off work. He says there were no major injuries. ""The system works well,"" assured Pomerleau. He says there are at least two security guards on duty at all times and the majority of employees are trained to intervene in code white situations. ""We're not worried about the safety of the emergency room, for employees, visitors and the clientele,"" he said. ""But of course we use events like this to make improvements and we'll see what we can do to make sure it doesn't happen again.""

209,Heidi Atter,2020-01-22T18:25:27.767Z,Three places to find colour during achromatic Regina winters ,"A UBC professor says colour can have an affect on mood, happiness and stress. CBC Saskatchewan stepped out to visit three places working to stay bright and beat the winter blues. Where do you go to find colour in the Saskatchewan winters? Email morningedition@cbc.ca  Liane Gabora says colour can elicit positive responses when the weather gets cold, offering a temporary but helpful feeling of warmth and calm. People should try to take notice of their feelings and reactions to colour, said Gabora, who has a doctorate in psychology and is a professor at the UBC Okanagan Campus. She focuses on how the creative process works and how creativity fuels the evolution of culture.  ""People just sort of gloss over that aspect of life and they don't necessarily take note of how colour is impacting them,"" she said. Here are three places in Regina that stand out for maintaining their colour all year round. ""You walk in here and the first thing even before you see the flowers and the display is that you smell the air,"" Colleen Sampson, president of the Regina Garden Associates, said. ""This is a special place and there's something different than you would experience anywhere else and particularly in the prairies."" Regina Garden Associates is a volunteer organization that manages the Regina Floral Conservatory. The donation-based greenhouse has contrasting colours of bright yellows, purples, reds, magenta, coral and a variety of green shades. ""When you come here, you can just sit and relax and breathe in the moisture and your cares seem to fall away."" Green is an interesting colour because of the relation to nature and culture, Gabora said. Green can also help because it stimulates positive feelings such as green on a stop light meaning go. However, Gabora said the feeling can be temporary or not as strong as some people may like.  ""There is some evidence that for example, if you walk into a blue room you're going to feel more calm but in a minute or two that effect will wear off,"" she said.  Some colours can also have positive feelings due to nostalgia.  ""It's really striking how people's colour preferences, they go back way into your childhood and the earliest memories that you have,"" she said. ""They really have these deep roots in the human psyche."" Walking into Dessart Sweets, the pastel walls emphasize the variety of colourful candies that line the shelves. There's items to embrace nostalgia, including Dutch Licorice, Nerds candy, old drinks, and more.  ""I guess it's a bit of sensory overload,"" owner Shelley Patterson said with a laugh. ""My store is small, everything is jam packed.""  Patterson is immediately drawn to the rock candy by the front door. A rainbow of colours in individual glasses greet customers at the entrance. Patterson said she's particularly drawn to pastels.  ""They're not overly bright. They don't have ugly undertones. They just are really pleasant to look at,"" she said. Just down the road from the sweet shop, a place takes a different view on colour. Stepping into Nouveau Gallery, even on stormy days, the light streams into the windows and brightens the space. ""I'm motivated by colour,"" Sharon Eisbrenner, the self-described ""computer monkey"" at the commercial gallery, said. As she walks around, she stops at a landscape that overlooks a waterway.  ""[It] takes you in it beautifully,"" she said. ""Flowers and grasses meandering through a landscape with trees in the distance and nice clouds — it's a happy place. It's a place where there would be birds chirping and quiet sounds and it's a very positive painting.""  Gallery owner Meagan Perreault said she hopes the artwork and colours speak to people.   ""A lot of art elicits a positive response. You'll remember something or it will remind you of a place or the colour will make you happy,"" Perreault said. By using a clean space with pops of colour, Gabora said the gallery is making the right call.  ""I have noticed that colour can be even more striking and have more of an impact when it's used a little bit sparingly,"" she said. ""You can almost become immune to the effect of colour if everything is brightly coloured. But if it's more of an occasional burst, you can appreciate it.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-colour-winter-places-to-go-1.5436162,[],N/A
210,Jason Proctor,2020-01-22T23:58:14.903Z,Crown claims fraud 'at the heart' of case against Meng Wanzhou,"A lawyer for Canada's attorney general told a B.C. Supreme Court judge Wednesday that the criminal case against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is a simple one of fraud. In a concise and occasionally amusing presentation, Crown lawyer Robert Frater told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes she should steer clear of the defence's strict attempts to tie the case to sanctions law. ""Ours is not a complex theory of this case,"" Frater said. ""Lying to a bank in order to get banking services that creates a risk of economic prejudice is fraud. Fraud — not sanctions violations — is at the heart of this case."" Frater's arguments took a little under three hours, as opposed to the two days of arguments in which Meng's lawyers argued that the case against her doesn't satisfy the principle of ""double criminality"" needed for extradition. Meng, 47, is accused of bank fraud over allegations that she lied to an HSBC executive in Hong Kong about Huawei's control of a subsidiary attempting to sell American computer equipment to an Iranian telecommunications company, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Meng's lawyers argued that her alleged conduct would not be criminal in Canada because Canada didn't have the same economic sanctions in place at the time U.S. prosecutors gave the authority to proceed with the extradition. In doing so, they repeatedly noted that Canadians had chosen to go a different route than the U.S. when it came to business dealings with Iran and accused American prosecutors of trying to use Canada to enforce sanctions Ottawa has rejected. But Frater told Holmes her job was not to stand up for Canadian sovereignty. The Crown lawyer took the judge through the central elements of fraud as they apply to Meng's alleged actions. Frater argued HSBC allegedly risked prosecution, fines and loss of reputation by relying on Meng's assurances to make business decisions that put the bank at risk of violating the sanctions. Frater also said the alleged conduct had all the elements necessary to satisfy a charge of fraud in Canada: deceit; deprivation of a person's economic interest; a causal link between the two; Meng's subjective knowledge of the lie; and the knowledge it could have caused loss. The judge wouldn't have to think about sanctions, Frater said. ""End of story,"" he told Holmes. ""I could sit down now."" But he didn't. Instead, Frater continued, offering Holmes another way of considering the facts of the case and the existence of the U.S. economic sanctions — one he said would still result in a decision to commit Meng for extradition. In trying to determine double criminality, a judge is asked to pose a hypothetical question: What if this conduct had occurred in Canada? Frater also accused the defence of trying to apply an ""absolutist"" lens to the question by insisting the lack of Canadian economic sanctions would inevitably mean Meng's alleged lie would be meaningless, because banks couldn't risk any loss from non-existent laws. He gave examples of extradition cases where judges have considered the existence of foreign laws in order to understand the context around the case as a way of judging the ""essence"" of the conduct. ""In all of these cases, common sense prevails as opposed to absolute rules,"" Frater said. The Crown lawyer also answered a question the judge asked Meng's defence lawyers about the possibility of prosecuting someone in Canada for lying over the phone to someone in a foreign country, as a means of fraud. Frater said that would have to be a crime, otherwise, ""it would make Canada the destination of choice for telemarketing fraudsters and other transnational criminals."" Holmes asked Frater about the broad nature of circumstances that can give rise to fraud, and what might happen if the context around a fraud involved a foreign legal situation, like sanctions, that Canadians find offensive. It's the job of Canada's justice minister, not an extradition judge, to make that call, Frater said. ""The answer is leave it to the minister,"" he replied. ""There are different roles to be played at each phase … you have a role that is limited to talking about whether the elements of the offence are satisfied."" Frater finished his arguments by the end of the morning session. The defence is expected to make a short reply on Thursday morning and the matter will then be left with Holmes to decide. If the requirement for double criminality is not met, Meng would be free. But if the Crown is successful, a hearing is scheduled for June in which the defence will argue that her rights were violated on her arrest. If that hearing goes ahead, the defence will also argue that Meng is being used as a political pawn by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he would intervene in her case if it would help get a better trade deal with China. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China last week, with no sign that he had heeded a suggestion from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December that any pact should deal with Meng and the two Canadians who were detained in China shortly after her arrest. Entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were later formally arrested and now face accusations of spying in China, where they are incarcerated without access to lawyers or family. China has also cut off Canadian canola and meat imports in the past year, but lifted a ban on pork and beef in November.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5435521,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341,N/A
211,Frances Willick,2020-01-17T10:00:00.809Z,When donors cross the line: Charitable sector grapples with sexual harassment ,"As Carly Butler got ready to attend another big gala for her job as a major gifts fundraiser, she put on a special dress she'd often wear on such occasions. But for this particular event at a high-end Nova Scotia resort, she took an extra precaution, placing a safety pin at the neckline to be prudent. She'd heard there had been ""bad behaviour"" at the event in the past. As she and her co-workers arrived at the resort, one charity staffer joked to the crew, ""OK, ladies, lock up your vaginas!"" Soon after, Butler had an experience she would later describe as ""a general disrespect"" of her professionalism. Her job as a fundraiser for the IWK Foundation — the charitable organization that supports the women and children's hospital in Halifax — required her to drum up $1.5 million in donations the year she was employed there. During the event, a potential donor asked her to meet him outside in 10 minutes so they could drive his luxury car down a nearby private runway, even though he was drunk. When she said no, he told her she could drive — that there were no police around, and what happened at the resort would stay at the resort. She didn't get in the car that day nearly five years ago. But she worries that younger or more vulnerable women starting out their fundraising career may have. As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across industry after industry, some in the fundraising sector say it's time for their profession to step up efforts to tackle and prevent sexual harassment. Workers in some fundraising roles can be particularly vulnerable to harassment due to the deep power imbalance between fundraisers — who are often young women, and whose jobs depend on meeting donation targets — and donors, who are often wealthy older men. And events like golf tournaments, galas or auction evenings — especially where alcohol is involved — are ripe for abuse of that inequality, say industry insiders. CBC News spoke with nearly a dozen women across the country who work in the non-profit sector. Nearly all had experiences of being harassed by donors or other employees, either with unwanted touching, sexual innuendo or inappropriate propositions. One spoke of a former premier grabbing her butt at an event, another of an older donor putting his hand on her knee and offering to ""treat"" her to a night at the iconic Ottawa hotel Chateau Laurier, while another woman told of a men's group of potential donors leaving a photo of a naked woman on the podium where she was about to speak. Jacquie Stoyek, who worked in marketing at the IWK Foundation for about five years until leaving in 2017, attended the same fundraiser as Butler. She recalled seeing a businessman — already intoxicated first thing in the morning — making comments about a foundation staff member and pretending behind her back to grab her butt. Stoyek said a senior foundation staff member saw that and gave her a look that said, ""Watch out for this one,"" and it became an ongoing joke. The IWK Foundation declined to answer any questions about the fundraising event, saying in a two-sentence statement it is ""unable to provide comment on the specific circumstances"" of Butler and Stoyek's allegations. But at the time — after Butler reported the luxury car incident to her peers and superiors — she was told not to go to future meetings with that donor by herself. Butler said the man cancelled a followup meeting with her when he learned she would not be alone. The IWK Foundation said in a statement: ""With respect to the issue of harassment, it is a very important topic in every sector and we continue to work within our organization to foster a culture of openness, respect and safety."" The foundation would not comment on whether the event is still taking place. A survey on sexual harassment conducted in 2018 by the Harris Poll for the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that a quarter of female respondents and seven per cent of male respondents had experienced sexual harassment in the field. The survey involved about 1,000 fundraisers, including about 900 people living in the U.S. and 100 living in Canada. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, a donor was the perpetrator. But less than half of those who were harassed told their organization about the incident. Beth Ann Locke, who until recently served as the chief philanthropy officer for the B.C. Women's Health Foundation, said women are worried about the questions that will be asked — ""What did you do to make him do that? Did you flirt with him?"" They are also concerned that reporting the incident will hurt their career, say many in the industry. If they no longer work with a major donor who has harassed them, they may not get invited to events, be asked to take on large accounts or meet their donation targets for the year. At small organizations, there often isn't another staffer who can take over an account involving a harasser. Fundraisers are also passionate about the organizations and causes they work for, and are reluctant to do anything that could harm them, say several of the women interviewed by the CBC. Locke is one of the co-founders of Ms. Rupt, a group that aims to spark conversation and action on challenges facing female fundraisers. ""What drives me crazy is that all of us as fundraisers work to help people who have no voice — so whether that's the Amazon rainforest or, you know, dogs in Halifax or people with dementia, right? ""And yet we don't stand up for ourselves and we kind of allow this to happen in our own profession."" Locke said she has experienced several incidents of harassment over the course of her career, including someone asking her to be their ""mistress,"" someone stroking her arm and commenting on her skin and an uninvited hand on her knee under the table. She said the most severe instance of harassment occurred years ago while she was working in the U.S., when a superior grabbed her wrist — which she promptly wrenched away — and then held his erect penis through his clothes, saying, ""This is what you do to me."" Locke said she reported the incident to human resources, which forced the man to take three days off without pay and lectured both parties about ""this kind of stuff going on in our office.""  ""It was like a dressing-down you'd get from your parents,"" Locke said. That type of lacklustre response does not appear to be unusual, according to the Harris Poll survey. Of the respondents who had experienced sexual harassment and told their organization about it, 71 per cent said no action had been taken against the perpetrator. Thirty-five per cent of respondents who took steps to deal with the harassment said they experienced a negative impact on their career after reporting it. Locke said organizations within the non-profit sector need to take allegations more seriously. She said she's heard stories of organizations giving donors or other perpetrators a ""pass"" for harassing behaviour: ""'He's sweet.' 'Oh, don't worry about it.' Even kind of a 'he doesn't know what he's doing' thing.… Or 'they're from a different age when that was allowed.' I've heard that one."" Some smaller non-profits that run on a shoestring budget don't have a separate human resources department to deal with complaints.  Lucy White, a Toronto consultant for the non-profit sector, said one of the barriers to change in the industry is that when people do file complaints about harassment, the cases are often settled out of court and out of the public eye, often with non-disclosure agreements that forbid them from discussing details. ""So the real problem is no one ever admits publicly that they did anything wrong and we never find out any of the facts,"" White said. ""We're left in the dark about how often this kind of thing happens."" That silence also means other organizations and those who sit on their board of directors never learn what kind of financial repercussions can stem from findings of harrassment, and the liabilities their own charities could face if allegations emerge. ""What happens is they think it's not a big deal, right?"" White said. There is some movement afoot to help prevent sexual harassment in the fundraising sector. The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), an organization that has 3,500 members across Canada and over 30,000 internationally, has formed the Women's Impact Initiative to address challenges facing women in the sector. The AFP, which helped commission the Harris Poll survey, is following up on the results by interviewing fundraisers about their experiences of job-related harassment. The association already has a donor bill of rights that outlines what donors are entitled to as a result of their donations, but it is now considering developing a similar document outlining a donor's responsibilities when working with fundraisers. Some in the profession say non-profits should take other concrete steps, including implementing and enforcing clear anti-harassment policies, overtly encouraging employees and bystanders to come forward with complaints and improving diversity on boards of directors. But money is often the bottom line for charitable and non-profit organizations. Perhaps accepting donations from harassers is where the buck must stop, said Caroline Riseboro, the president of AFP Toronto, the largest chapter in the world. ""If targets are missed, boards tend to get nervous. But, you know, boards need to understand if targets are missed because of a harassment issue, then that's OK. Better to keep employees safe than to meet the target or the goal."" Riseboro said she believes most boards do take action when they know about instances of harassment, but board members often don't realize the behaviour is going on. For some in the fundraising sector, any impending cultural change has come too late.  Butler, the fundraiser who worked for the IWK Foundation, left the profession, saying despite the enjoyable aspects of the job, ""there's a whole bunch of distasteful things about it"" — including, sometimes, the dynamic between the people who work in fundraising and donors. ""It doesn't feel great after a while.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-violence-harassment-fundraising-1.4945951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,N/A
212,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-07-08T18:29:27.210Z,"Mother who watched son burn to death in SUV fire joins calls for answers from Kia, Hyundai ","When Carol Nash heard screams for help, she rushed out of her apartment in her nightgown and found her SUV burning in the parking lot — but couldn't get close enough to save her son, sitting in the driver's seat. ""I could not do anything except stand there and watch him die,"" Nash told Go Public. Keith Nash, 48, burned to death on April 19, 2017, in his mother's 2014 Kia Soul while the vehicle was parked outside her low-rise apartment building in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother says Kia has never contacted her to explain what happened. She was devastated when she learned the company issued a recall for the SUV for a potential fire risk in February — two years after her son died. ""I suffer on a daily basis with this because I have no answers,"" she said.  Since 2015, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have recalled more than three million vehicles in North America over concerns the engines could fail at high speeds or burst into flames. A Go Public investigation revealed other models weren't on any Canadian recall lists when drivers experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires. After the CBC News investigation, both Kia and Hyundai vastly expanded the number of recalls in Canada. Hyundai is a part-owner of Kia. Automobile safety advocates and vehicle owners accuse the two companies of downplaying fire and engine failure reports and taking too long to roll out recalls, raising questions about when they first knew of the safety issues and whether more vehicles might still pose a risk. ""We now have multiple years of reports of these catastrophic engine failures and the very slow reaction from the companies,"" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The automakers say they are on top of the problems and are working with Transport Canada to address them. The official cause of death for Keith Nash was smoke and gas inhalation. Fire investigators believe the blaze started in the engine area, but weren't able to determine the exact cause.  In an email to Go Public, Kia suggests that fentanyl and heroin found in Nash's system may have rendered him unconscious and unable to get out of the burning car. The auto giant also says Nash may have caused the fire by simultaneously pressing down on the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle was in ""drive"" mode, causing the transmission fluid to ignite — an issue unrelated to the recall issued two years later, the company says. Go Public put that to Hamilton mechanic Chris Solodko, who has repaired dozens of Kia and Hyundai vehicles following engine failures. He says it's very rare for transmission fluid to catch fire. According to Solodko, Nash would have had to apply an enormous amount of pressure to the brake while holding the accelerator down to keep the SUV from moving and causing the transmission fluid to heat up to the point of catching fire. Carol Nash isn't the only one who wants answers.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they've experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires with vehicles that aren't part of any recall.  Robert Mitchell recalled getting a panicked phone call from his 30-year-old son Ryan on Aug. 11. Ryan told him he was driving the family's 2016 Hyundai Elantra down one of the busiest highways in the Toronto area — the 403 — when the engine seized and started to smoke before bursting into flames.  ""I don't think that a car — any car — should blow up and burn like that,"" Robert Mitchell said from the family's home in Mississauga, Ont. Mitchell's insurance company paid for the destroyed car. According to Transport Canada, the fire started in the engine compartment, but the cause is unknown. Another Hyundai Elantra, a 2018 model, is at the centre of a fire investigation in Windsor, N.S. On March 27, an Elantra that had been parked in front of a duplex for hours burst into flames. The fire spread to the building, but the families inside escaped unhurt.

Transport Canada says the investigation is now in the hands of a private insurance company. Kia and Hyundai are now facing a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and at least two in Canada over the engine breakdowns and fires. The recalls issued so far cover certain Hyundai and Kia models produced after 2011, mostly involving a variety of safety concerns around what are called Theta-II engines. In some cases, the recalls address mechanical issues that could lead to engine failure. In others, software is installed that gives drivers advance warning of an engine problem.  Levine says his organization is seeing other types of engines breaking down or burning. He points out, for example, that Nash's Kia Soul — which was recalled in February — and the Hyundai Elantra don't have Theta engines. ""It's certainly troubling that it's going on at least several years ... these non-crash fires across a variety of makes and models, not only the Theta-II,"" he said. Go Public asked both Kia Canada and Hyundai Canada when they first knew about the engine defects, but neither company answered the question. Hyundai Canada was asked if it had a fix for the engine problems, but again, it didn't respond to the question directly. In an email, Hyundai Canada told Go Public that over the past 10 years, there have been 12 cases of engine fires determined to be a result of an issue with the vehicle itself. ""We stand behind the quality of our products and continuously work to ensure the highest safety standards for our customers,"" spokesperson Bianca Pettinaro wrote. She says the company has issued notices for all the vehicles that could be affected and is keeping an eye on the issues.   In another email, Kia Canada spokesperson Mark James wrote, ""A vehicle engine failure or fire can occur due to any number of complex factors, including inadequate maintenance, arson, or some other non-vehicle source, all cases must be carefully evaluated by trained technicians to determine its cause."" He says Kia has a strong safety record and promptly reports safety-related defects to Transport Canada. Hyundai and Kia are now being investigated by regulators in several countries — including Canada and the U.S. — over safety defects that may have led to engine failures and fires not caused by crashes.  Nearly 540,000 Hyundai and Kia vehicles are now under recall in Canada due to risk of engine failure or fire. Transport Canada is investigating whether more models should be part of the recalls after getting approximately 200 complaints about engines since 2014. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. is investigating engine failures and fires in certain model years. As of the end of March, the regulator had received more than 3,000 complaints of fires not related to collisions, including 103 injuries and one death. Those are the kind of answers Carol Nash is looking for — and that need to come from the automakers involved, she says.  ""I just don't want this ever for any other parent or any other mother to go through what I went through on that day."" Last November, both Kia and Hyundai refused to testify at a congressional hearing that was scheduled to look into the engine fires. That hearing was cancelled after the automakers declined to attend.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

213,Jonathan Montpetit,2020-01-22T21:02:51.940Z,Jean Charest unloads on Quebec's anti-corruption unit as he opts out of Tory leadership race,"Former Quebec Liberal premier Jean Charest has sought to undermine the credibility of an ongoing corruption investigation into his political career, slamming the provincial anti-corruption unit as he announced he won't be running for the federal Conservative leadership. In an interview Tuesday with Radio-Canada, Charest accused Quebec's anti-corruption unit (UPAC) of conducting a ""fishing expedition."" He also cast doubt on the reliability of information gathered by UPAC investigators and defended a friend suspected of defrauding the government. It is the first time since leaving office in 2012 that Charest has directly addressed allegations that engineering and construction companies in Quebec were able to secure government contracts by donating to the Quebec Liberal Party. After Charest had stepped down, a public inquiry heard evidence that during his time as premier, the provincial Liberals benefited from millions in illegal donations. The anti-corruption unit, which Charest's government created in 2011, subsequently opened an investigation into Liberal fundraising practices. Media reports suggested Charest was a key figure in that investigation. In his comments Tuesday, Charest confirmed he'd been singled out by UPAC. He said investigators had questioned a wide circle of his contacts, including former political organizers from as far back as the early 1980s. ""What do you call it when, suddenly, you begin an investigation and you interrogate 300 people about someone's life? Is that not called a fishing expedition?"" asked Charest. The investigation has been going on for six years, and no one has yet been charged. It was ""common sense,"" he said, to ask for the investigation to end. Charest's demand was echoed by the party's current house leader, Marc Tanguay. ""We're asking UPAC, really, to close this investigation one way or another,"" Tanguay said Wednesday. ""It doesn't make sense that it's been six years."" The government, though, scoffed at Tanguay's remarks. ""It's very audacious for a Liberal MNA to make that request,"" said Andrée Laforest, the interim public security minister.  ""We're going to let the investigation follow its course."" MNAs for Québec Solidaire and the Parti Québécois made similar comments. ""Me, I'll believe UPAC,"" said Manon Massé, parliamentary leader of QS. On Wednesday afternoon, UPAC issued a statement saying it was important that the anti-corruption unit ""be able to make its operational decisions with complete independence."" The head of UPAC, Frédérick Gaudreau, said in the statement that he understood the ""impatience"" for answers, and promised to inform the public when the investigation was completed. Tanguay tweeted later to say he respected UPAC's independence.   Though Tuesday's interview with Radio-Canada began with Charest's announcement about the Conservative leadership, the questions focused on the UPAC investigation and the allegations of wrongdoing that hounded his goverment.  Charest said his government wasn't aware that firms were reimbursing employees to get around political fundraising laws in Quebec that prohibit companies from making donations. When his government learned about the reimbursement scheme, which benefited other provincial parties as well, Charest said he immediately tightened the Quebec Liberal Party's fundraising rules. Many of these allegations resurfaced last week when Marc Bibeau — a former Liberal fundraiser and close friend of Charest's — lost a bid to block the publication of UPAC affidavits.  The affidavits were filed in support of search warrant applications — part of UPAC's investigation into Bibeau.  They contained summaries of police interviews with several witnesses, many of whom were high-ranking executives at engineering companies who allegedly said they felt pressured by Bibeau to illegally donate to the Liberals.  In one summary, a witness said Bibeau went around with a business card embossed with a Quebec government logo, even though he had no position within the government. ""I don't believe it. I don't believe one word,"" Charest of the allegations against Bibeau. He said that information in UPAC affidavits had been wrong in the past. He also raised the various governance problems that have checkered the anti-corruption unit's reputation in recent years. ""Do I need to remind you that UPAC is currently under investigation?"" Charest said, referring to its bungled arrest of a sitting MNA in 2017. Though the information contained in the affidavits published last week wasn't new — much of it was initially heard during the public inquiry into corruption known as the Charbonneau commission — it reignited debate in Quebec about Charest's ethics. Several columnists questioned why he would want to re-enter the political fray given the questions raised by the open UPAC investigation.  ""What could be going on in Jean Charest's head?"" began one recent column in the Journal de Montréal. ""Think about it carefully,"" counselled a columnist at La Presse. In Tuesday's interview, Charest said the publication of the documents last week played no part in his decision not to run for the Conservative leadership. ""All this was already in the public domain,"" the former premier said. ""I would never have evoked the possibility of becoming a candidate if I felt for one instant that something like this would lead to criminal charges or would have hindered me."" Charest said he opted not to run because, among other things, he felt the party had changed too much since he led the Progressive Conservatives, from 1993 to 1998.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-charest-unloads-on-quebec-s-anti-corruption-unit-as-he-opts-out-of-tory-leadership-race-1.5435062,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-charest-upac-michel-massicotte-1.5431436 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bibeau-documents-revealed-1.5429946,N/A

215,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:48:27.276Z,Teen activist Autumn Peltier appears at World Economic Forum with criticism for federal politicians,"Teenage Indigenous water activist Autumn Peltier says she doesn't feel the Canada's federal politicians are focused enough on climate change, even after years of her campaigning for them to take action. The 15-year old, who hails from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, shared her dismay at their lack of attention toward the issue while on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Peltier has spent her last eight years putting pressure on politicians to take climate change more seriously, while advocating for clean drinking water in Indigenous communities and serving as the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario. She has urged the United Nations General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet and confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations. While sharing the stage in Davos with fellow teen activists Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Natasha Mwansa from Zambia and Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, she heaped more pressure on politicians back home. ""It is almost like they don't believe climate change is real,"" she said. ""Climate change is a real thing and they are not realizing that."" Her remarks come amid warnings that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and as youth like Peltier are increasingly calling for the globe to band together and address climate change. Peltier said she has received some support from Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Mike Mantha and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, but has found that many of their counterparts are putting their attention elsewhere. ""They are all focused on just money and we need to be more focused on the actual things going on,"" she said. She also revealed that her age plays a role in how seriously she's being taken. ""I personally don't feel that heard from politicians....When it comes to federal government it is really hard to get their attention and be heard by them,"" she said.

216,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:48:53.470Z,Quebec wants to transfer non-urgent 911 calls to Info-Santé,"It's not unheard of for people to call 911 when they break an ankle or have a bad backache — and while sometimes a trip to the hospital by ambulance is warranted, that isn't always the case. To help ease the load on ambulance technicians, the province has been testing transferring non-urgent calls to 811 instead. It's a second triage, of sorts: if the call meets certain criteria, it's transferred to a nurse, who takes over and conducts a more in-depth evaluation on the patient then decides whether an ambulance is necessary. The main job of an ambulance technician is to save lives, says Dr. Élyse Berger Pelleter, who works for the Health Ministry. But with an aging population and a shortage of ambulance technicians in the province, the situation on the ground is far from ideal — putting a lot of pressure on emergency medical services. ""The objective is that ambulance workers respond to cardiac arrest, heart attacks — people who really need their skills,"" Berger Pelleter said. The Health Ministry wants to have the new system fully established provincewide by 2022. Berger Pelletier said she hopes eventually, people who call with non-urgent problems will get a doctor's appointment, if need be. ""The client is satisfied. It's efficient. Everyone is happy. That's where we're headed."" The pilot project is in its third year in four regions: Montreal, Laval, Chaudière-Appalaches and the Eastern Townships. The transferred calls are being handled by a dedicated team of Info-Santé nurses in Laval. The chief of service, Nancy Vachon, says the team is able to handle about 3,000 calls a month. In Montreal and Laval, 23,000 non-urgent calls were transferred to 811 between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. In 20 per cent of those cases — about 4,800 calls in all — the Info-Santé nurse determined there was no need for an ambulance. Officials expect the results to be less impressive in the two more rural regions, because residents living where there is less access to taxis or public transport are more likely to have an ambulance sent to them, Berger Pelletier said. Urgences-Santé, the emergency medical service that covers Montreal and Laval, gets up to 1,300 calls per day, said the agency's director, Vincent Brouillard. He said the pilot project is allowing the agency to respond to real emergencies, relieving the pressure on paramedics in general. It is having another effect, as well, he said: fewer ambulance transports mean there are fewer people in emergency rooms, so it is also easing overcrowding. Those experiencing non-urgent health issues can call 811 directly instead of 911. For non-urgent situations involving Montreal police, the general number is 514-280-2222, or you can call your local station directly.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/911-811-quebec-emergency-non-urgent-calls-1.5432985,[],N/A

218,Don Pittis,2020-01-23T15:35:02.431Z,Millionaires at the World Economic Forum are demanding higher taxes: Don Pittis,"A group of rich people from the United States want governments to raise their taxes. Yesterday, Patriotic Millionaires, the exclusive U.S. club that also includes billionaires, released a letter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that the global rich add their names to a new plan to make the world a better place through global tax reform.  If you own a house in Vancouver or Toronto and are considering signing on — you may not be rich enough. Membership requires a minimum annual income of a million U.S. dollars or assets of five million.  Tax evasion has reached epidemic proportions &amp; contributed to extreme inequality.<br><br>At one of the most obnoxious displays of privilege that is found on the world stage, we're proud to release 'Millionaires Against Pitchforks'<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WEF20</a><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxTheRich?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TaxTheRich</a><a href=""https://t.co/1rEj0530OS"">https://t.co/1rEj0530OS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/l97DGbQhJ5"">pic.twitter.com/l97DGbQhJ5</a> The Davos letter addressed to ""Our Fellow Millionaires and Billionaires Across the Globe,"" appears to be just the latest move to draw media attention to the idea that at least some of the world's richest people think the growing gap between rich and poor is a problem. The PR move, however, has not garnered much coverage in the world's billionaire-owned media. Certainly, governments worried about lost tax revenue have repeatedly struggled to devise global plans to prevent corporations and wealthy individuals from hiding their money offshore — with limited success.  ""Extreme, destabilizing inequality is growing across the globe,"" says the letter released in Davos. ""Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment."" Like Bregman, signatories to the new letter say extreme inequality is driving the world toward a crisis point. In fact, they warn the rich of a potential uprising by the poorer classes. The threat of revolution, they warn, creates a tradeoff between ""those who prefer taxes and those who prefer pitchforks."" As the shortage of signatures on the document may show, if a popular uprising to overthrow the rich is brewing, elites believe they can handle  it. All around the world, including in Canada, Britain and the United States, political parties that favour tax cuts and leaving tax havens alone get the vast majority of financial support from donors. Rather than sign documents to raise their taxes, even the moderately rich often vote with their wallets to make sure taxes stay low. Those donations, often used for campaign advertising, represent money well spent. In the United States, the populist Trump garners support from many poor voters who believe they are opposing government elites; many of the less well off seem willing to vote against their own best interests. In the U.S., lower middle class and poor Trump supporters effectively voted against their own medical coverage. Opponents of pro-tax campaigns often suggest that those who want to pay higher taxes should do so, but of course that would just make the shirkers richer in relative terms. Yesterday's letter is unlikely to be more successful than previous campaigns, including a 2019 effort by the self-described Patriotic Millionaires to persuade government to raise taxes on the rich in New York. At that time, Patriotic Millionaire member Abagail Disney, heir to part of the Disney fortune and a well known advocate of progressive causes, was backing the tax increase.  ""New York will always be New York,"" she said. ""There's no other place like it, and millionaires are concentrated here because of that."" Polls of people across the global wealth spectrum, including U.S. viewers of Fox Television, have shown a majority would like to see higher taxes on the rich. Many of the world's richest people, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and financier Warren Buffet, have complained that the tax system is unfair. But until people are willing to elect governments that promise to raise taxes, changes are unlikely. Despite a widening gap between the richest and everyone else, there are few signs of people sharpening their pitchforks.  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-poloz-1.5436058,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5436112/patriotic-millionaires-urge-the-rich-to-pay-higher-and-fairer-taxes-1.5436119 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fighting-the-corporate-tax-tricks-that-lead-to-inequality-1.2666148 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-media-fake-news-rutger-bregman-1.5027881 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4769851/ontario-pc-voter-worried-about-family-s-future-without-basic-income-pilot-1.4769853 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inheritance-tax-canada-1.4771304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inversions-panama-revenue-quandary-1.3521358 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/paradise-papers-rent-capitalism-tax-havens-1.4389079,N/A
219,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:25:01.242Z,'She didn't deserve it': Gilles Duceppe's family suing seniors' residence where mother died,"Former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe says he's forced to relive his mother's death every day because the luxury seniors' residence where she froze to death last year has not been held responsible.  ""It is like it is yesterday,"" Duceppe told As It Happens host Carol Off. ""They made a lot of mistakes, and we have to change the way of taking care of the old age people in the future.""  Duceppe and his siblings announced Monday that they are suing the Lux Gouverneur Montreal for gross negligence. Hélène Rowley Hotte Duceppe died of hypothermia outside the Montreal residence on Jan. 20, 2019. The 93-year-old was stuck in an outdoor courtyard for six hours after exiting through an emergency exit because of a false fire alarm. It felt like - 35 C outside, with strong winds and blowing snow.  A coroner's report that was released last summer said there was video surveillance, which showed her desperately trying to get back into the building in the early hours of the morning, before collapsing at 11:02 a.m.  Staff didn't find her until 11:40, but by that time she was already dead. The report found that while her death was accidental, it was entirely preventable.  ""She didn't deserve it,"" Duceppe said.  Duceppe said his mother had a ""great fear"" of fires, which came from growing up with stories about the tragic 1927 Laurier Palace Theatre fire in Montreal that killed 85 children — many who were crushed to death as they tried to escape.  When she heard the fire alarm in her residence, she was just following the rules, he said.  ""They didn't look at the cameras, said Duceppe, referring to employees at the residence. ""They told the firemen that they checked if everyone was back in the room, which was not true, and they waited five months before apologizing to the family."" Her access card would not allow her back inside through the emergency exit, and no one at the residence noticed that she was missing. The coroner said an alarm was triggered when she exited, but an employee turned it off 20 minutes later without checking outside. Duceppe said this is unacceptable.  ""Instead of just changing the alarm, you look on the other side of the door,"" he said. ""She was there trying to get back inside.""  None of the claims has been proven in court. The family is seeking $1.25 million for both the suffering experienced by Rowley Hotte Duceppe and the pain her death has caused her seven children. The management of the residence said in a statement Monday that staff remain ""extremely shaken by the death of Mrs. Rowley-Hotte.'' ""The safety and well-being of residents is a top priority for management. Due to the ongoing legal procedures, we will not be granting interviews,'' the statement read. Duceppe said the day before his mother died she told her daughter that she was worried about the people who were living on the streets because it was so cold. She said that she was going to spend the next day knitting warm clothes to give to people in need.  ""And she's the one who died because of the cold,"" Duceppe said.  His mother was in ""great shape"" for her age, he said. Just a month before she died, her doctor told her that she had the ""heart of a young girl.""   She loved to read the newspaper, and she read one book a week, Duceppe said.  His mother didn't want to leave eastern Montreal, where she was born and raised, but the family convinced her to move to an apartment at the Lux Gouverneur Montreal because it was advertised as being secure. Duceppe said they were paying $3,700 a month in rent, not including food, for the apartment.  ""But, the thing is, even if you have the cameras, if you don't use them, it serves nobody,"" Duceppe said.   Duceppe said he wants the government and residence to take action and implement the recommendations made by the coroner in the death of his mother and others. Some of those recommendations include installing an intercom and doorbells outside each emergency exit, and to check stairwells and exits after an alarm is triggered.  ""At least that would prevent … tragedies like that.

220,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2020-01-22T01:38:29.805Z,"Brady Francis was likely standing when struck, pathologist tells hit-and-run trial ","Brady Francis suffered blunt force trauma to his skull, his liver was lacerated, his left lung showed signs of trauma and multiple abrasions covered most of his body, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy testified Tuesday at the hit-and-run trial of Maurice Johnson. ""In my opinion, he died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck"" consistent with a motor vehicle collision, Dr. Ken Obenson told the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench. The body of Francis, 22, of Elsipogtog First Nation, was found on Saint-Charles South Road in Saint-Charles on Feb. 24, 2018, at around 9:40 p.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. Obenson, who performed the autopsy at the Saint John Regional Hospital on Feb. 25, 2018, testified he believes Francis was standing at the moment of impact and may have been projected onto the vehicle that struck him. He was unable to determine if Francis was struck head-on, from the side, or from behind, he said. Francis was intoxicated at the time, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.29, Obenson found — about three-and-a-half times the legal limit. Earlier in the trial, the court heard Francis had been at a diaper party for a friend who was expecting a baby. He was seen afterward walking along the road and had called his parents to ask for a ride home. By the time they arrived minutes later, they found their son's body lying face-up on the side of the road. The trial is scheduled to continue on Wednesday morning, when the Crown is expected to call its final witnesses. The defence plans to call four witnesses. It's not yet clear whether Johnson will testify in his own defence. The court has watched the videotaped statement Johnson gave to RCMP on March 15, 2018, following his arrest. In the roughly four-hour video, Johnson told police he was drinking Diet Pepsi the night Francis was killed, and didn't consume any alcohol or drugs. Johnson said his wife drank eight beers while they drove around in his pickup truck between around 3:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., tossing the empties along the way, but he was behind the wheel when struck what he initially thought was a deer. Cpl. Nicholas Potvin alleged Johnson ""got scared"" the night of the collision and urged him to ""own up."" ""This is your chance to correct the mistake you made by telling the truth,"" Potvin said in French. The officer noted other people reported seeing Francis walking along the road that night and questioned why Johnson did not. He suggested something was affecting his judgment. Johnson repeatedly told the officer he wasn't drinking that day. Although he drank when he was younger, he drinks ""almost never now,"" he said in French. ​​​His wife sometimes drinks a bottle of wine on the weekends. ""Me? I stay at home and watch Netflix and drink my coffee."" The last time he drank was about three weeks before the accident, when he bought a case of 12 beers, he said. ""I don't do drugs,"" he added. During the first part of the interview, played for the court on Monday, Johnson said he and his wife were talking during their leisure drive and he turned his head to look at her for a moment. When he turned back, there was a deer in front of his truck and he didn't have time to brake, he said. He stopped and looked back, but didn't see anything, so he thought the animal had run off and they kept going, he said. ""If I thought it had been a person, I would have stopped."" As the interview continued, Potvin questioned whether Johnson would have been scared if he had stopped and had police arrived. ""Would they have found anything in your vehicle?"" Johnson said he wouldn't have been scared, and asked the officer about speaking to his lawyer. Potvin told Johnson he had already spoken to his lawyer and that he was not obliged to answer any more questions. But he said Johnson was the only one who could ""complete the puzzle … of what really happened that night"" and he pressed him to ""do the right thing."" ""You're a good person, Maurice, a hard worker, a family man, a father, a husband,"" he said. ""Give closure to the [Francis] family."" ""I saw what I saw,"" replied Johnson. ""I did not see a person."" Potvin also grilled the accused about being unsure where the collision occurred. Johnson told a friend it was on Gray Road, while he told an officer the day Francis's body was discovered that it was on Saint-Charles North Road, and Potvin that it was on Saint-Charles South Road. Johnson said he knew he turned off Gray Road and went left and left again and that it was on one of those roads, but he wasn't sure exactly where because ""it was just a deer."" Francis's body was found 1.8 kilometres from Johnson's house, the courtroom heard. Johnson told police he drove home, watched TV and went to bed around 11 p.m. Potvin asked if he noticed the police cars that drove past his house after Francis's body was discovered. Johnson said he did not. The trial began last week and has heard from 32 witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31. Justice Denise LeBlanc is presiding.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-7-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5434158,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-6-brady-francis-trial-1.5432117 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brady-francis-maurice-johnson-hit-and-run-reconstructionist-1.5430142,N/A

222,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-05-18T21:20:39.025Z,Weight loss 'grants' program fails to pay up after participants shed pounds,"This story has been updated to reflect responses from Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization which were posted on their websites after publication of this story.  The ads ran across the country — get paid to lose weight — enticing many Canadians trying to shed pounds to sign up. Go Public has been flooded with messages from some who say when it came time to deliver, the so-called Weight Loss Grants Program wouldn't pay out, or dragged customer claims out for months before cutting a cheque. During our investigation, we heard from dozens of dissatisfied customers unhappy with the program run by a private, for-profit company. Some thought, because of its name, it was a government-run program issuing ""grants."" The Weight Loss Grants Organization now has a notice on its website that the grants program ""has now concluded.""  ""It's good for the consumer,"" said Richel Prevost, of Calgary, who heard about the program on the radio two years ago. At the time, Prevost, 5'6"", was tipping the scales at over 200 pounds and desperate to lose weight.  She thought she'd found the solution — a grant program that would give her access to a high-end diet program then reimburse her for up to 80 per cent of the cost when she lost the weight. She was wrong.  ""I literally worked my butt off and I just don't feel like their end of the bargain is being held up,"" Prevost said. She signed up in September 2017 and paid $2,400 up front to the diet clinic the grants company recommended. She said she was told if she used Dalewood Health Clinic she'd get up to 80 per cent back in a grant, up to 20 per cent if she used a different one.  Prevost said she lost 50 pounds on her own through diet and exercise and reached her weight loss goal five months early. A year later, she is still trying to collect her grant.  ""It felt like they were moving the goalposts,"" Prevost said.""Every time that they asked for something different I complied."" Her grant was recently denied based on a rule that didn't exist when she lost the weight.  The Weight Loss Grants Organization told Go Public Prevost won't be getting her grant because she recorded her final weight five months early instead of on the exact deadline date. That rule was introduced in April, long after Prevost finished the program and submitted her paperwork. ""You can't change the rules like that in the middle and deny me my claim based on something that you implemented after the fact,"" Prevost said.  Jenn Granger from Calgary paid Dalewood $2,100, lost weight, and met all the requirements in October. Her grant was also denied based on the rule that kicked in last month. ""I'm not sure how we would possibly be able to follow such a rule when I submitted [for the grant] six months before they made the change,"" Granger wrote Go Public in an email. The Weight Loss Grants Organization didn't respond when Go Public asked how a new rule can apply to old cases. David Stein, who describes himself as the adjudicator at the Weight Loss Grants Organization, said Granger's grant was denied because the letter she submitted from the medical clinic to prove her weight loss ""does not appear to be legitimate.""  Go Public spoke with some people who say they did get their grants. The Weight Loss Grants Organization's website has a long list of thank-you letters from participants who say the program helped them lose weight.  Those letters are a requirement before the company will even consider paying out a grant.  Larry Smith said he wrote a thank-you letter and last August and received an email saying his $1,920 grant was approved but after months passed with no payout, Smith contacted Go Public. Stein said Smith hasn't received a cheque because he failed to get a required letter from his doctor. No one from the company told Smith. The Better Business Bureau of Central Ontario has given the Weight Loss Grants Organization an ""F"" and Dalewood a ""D"" rating due to the high number of customer complaints. ""Consumers feel like they've achieved the requirements of the grants but for what might be a technical reason, they're not getting the grant at the end,"" said spokesperson Patrick McKeen. Dalewood is now in the process of changing its name to Trillium Weight Loss. It turns out Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are connected. Go Public found the two companies shared an address for years and have a senior manager who works for both companies. In emails and letters to clients, George Scodras refers to himself as the director of operations of Dalewood and of the Weight Loss Grants Program. He was also listed as director of operations for Dalewood on its website, until Go Public started asking questions about his connection to both companies.  All references to Scodras have since been removed from the Dalewood website, while the Trillium website lists him as a ""managing consultant.""  We asked the Weight Loss Grants Organization how much it has paid out in grants since the program started in 2015, and why so many people have complained about not getting money they thought they were due.  ""The total number of grants paid out as of April 30th, 2019, is $733,552.71 (according to info given to me),"" Dalewood spokesperson Marissa Mayles wrote in an email to Go Public. That number can't be verified, but Go Public did speak with other former customers who say they got their full grants after using Dalewood. Clients say they weren't told about any connections between the Weight Loss Grants Program and Dalewood when they signed up. In an email to Go Public, Mayles said, ""we do not feel that there is a conflict of interest … Nobody is obligated to sign up with Dalewood and they can go wherever they like to lose their weight."" Mayles didn't give her exact title, but said she works in the finance and administration departments at Dalewood.  She is also the wife of the company's founder, Darren Morgenstern, who also founded Ashley Madison, the adulterous dating site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Morgenstern sold Ashley Madison in 2007.  Mayles said Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are not connected but, ""the owners are all connected and know each other well and the relationships predate either business."" As for Scodras, she said he's not an employee of either Dalewood or the Weight Loss Grants Organization but ""a temporary consultant ... an impartial disinterested party that is acting on behalf of all parties, including grant applicants.""  Stein said the Weight Loss Grants Organization will continue to honour ""legitimate grant requests,"" even though the program has been shut down. ""There have been too many problems which began for us late last year when we had to start enforcing our rules and having zero tolerance for improper documents, but we had no choice as there were far too many bogus grant claims,"" he told Go Public. The grants company has posted a reaction to Go Public's story on its website. The Dalewood and Trillium websites both have postings saying they're no longer accepting new clients affiliated with the Weight Loss Grants Organization. Prevost said she plans to file a fraud report with police and may try to take the company to court. ""I am not in a position to lose $2,000,"" she said, ""The reason I did this is because I thought I was going to get my money back ... this is crazy.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

224,Lien Yeung,2020-01-23T13:00:00.209Z,Everything is a metaphor: Here's what to eat and avoid at Chinese New Year dinner,"Chinese New Year is a celebration filled with metaphors and superstitions aimed at ushering in as much good luck as possible. That begins at the dinner table for many Chinese families. Here is the meaning and significance behind some of those traditions. A conscious effort is made to have an even number of dishes on the table at Chinese New Year, which typically begins on the occasion's eve. The belief is that good things come in pairs and odd numbers signify death. ""Number eight, number 12 — as long as it's a round number it's nice,"" explained Lee Man a food critic and cultural guide. ""Number seven is the one to avoid."" Like 13, it's considered unlucky. And order lots because the goal is to reflect the hope for an overabundance of food and blessings for the upcoming year. Popular Cantonese-style dishes at Chinese New Year are ones that have auspicious names. A variation of braised dried oysters, sea moss, and pig's tongue, or fat choy ho see sun lei, is a common choice. ""It actually means money, enterprise, and everything coming easily to you all year so whatever you try out will be a success,"" says Man.  Oysters are also desirable because they resemble ancient gold nuggets known as sycee. At home, many families will steam fish and chicken but they're always served whole, says Man, to represent togetherness. The heads and tails are left on because ""beak-to-tail means good beginning and good endings."" If you've got nautical roots, don't turn the fish over even after you've removed the bones to ward off any suggestion of a boat capsizing. Those who are pious tend to go vegetarian on New Year's Day. But even then, dishes like bamboo pith-wrapped enoki mushrooms and egg white pockets or Buddha's veggie feast are filled with references for prosperity. ""Even though you're vegetarian, you're pure of heart, you still want money,"" says Man. ""Those little packets represent old fashioned coin purses."" On the second day of the New Year, many families feast again. But dinner happens after making an offering of gratitude for the previous year to Buddha, the money god or ancestors. Roasted pork is commonly used for the ritual but hand-roasted suckling pig that's been rubbed in spices and sauces is an extravagant alternative. For dessert, sweet and sticky year cake, is served typically only during this time of year. Made from glutinous rice flour, the name leen goh offers the promise of reaching heights. To ensure an auspicious New Year, there are specific dishes that most families tend to avoid. Man says they never order squash. ""Because squash, or gwa, sounds like death,"" he says. Squid and crab are also foods to stay away from. Stir-fried squid is slang for getting fired. When it comes to crab, the Cantonese pronunciation sounds too much like a depressing sigh of exasperation — hai. None of these are rules though, every family celebrates and honours the tradition in different ways. What is universal, is the hope for good health and wealth for all.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chinese-new-year-celebrations-eat-avoid-1.5435571,[],N/A
225,Neil Macdonald,2019-12-17T09:00:00.948Z,Why are photo ops (except Trump's) so brutally boring?: Neil Macdonald,"Any reporter who's ever covered the Middle East can tell you about the Arab leader photo op. It is one of the most curious acts of solipsism ever invented. The beloved leader-for-life, a king or a president, always a man, appears on some hideous filigreed-and-gilded couch or chair, chatting with an important visitor. Maybe sweet tea is served. No questions are allowed. That's it. Lickspittle journalists from the state-controlled media are invited to record the event (usually, no audio is permitted), which is then broadcast at the top of the evening newscast, with gushing narration about the awe and respect and deference shown the leader by his important visitor. I've seen Jordanian television lead its newscast with three identical, consecutive scenes, all on the same royal couch. It's hilarious, and most Western reporters cackle sarcastically when they first see it. I certainly did. In reality, though, photo ops in our democracies aren't much different. Politicians pose and grip and grin, and mouth blandishments, and, like the beloved Arab leaders, are careful to say nothing.  The prime photo op directive, it seems, is to say absolutely nothing. The only difference in the West is that leaders don't order journalists to turn off the audio. (I'll bet they would if they could). So reporters scrutinize faces for the slightest flicker of authenticity. Did the Italian PM roll his eyes for a moment? Did Angela Merkel seem to suppress a snicker? Did Melania Trump look exhausted and scared? The exception, of course, is Donald Trump. No need to examine him for tells or tics. Ever since his elevation by the American public he represents so perfectly, he's been barging into photo ops, elbowing his way to the front, running his mouth, looking desperately bored when anyone else is speaking, using other leaders as props, and disrupting everything. I love it. After a lifetime of suffering through photo ops, it's refreshing. Trump might have a mouth like an open sewer, but at least he says something. Watching him crash around NATO's 75th anniversary get-together earlier this month was particularly enjoyable. He turned a photo op with NATO's obsequious secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, into a 52-minute news conference starring himself, bellyaching about Congressional Democrats. He then did the same thing to French president Emmanuel Macron, beside whom he held court for 41 minutes, telling Macron he should take back French citizens who went off to fight for ISIS and are now stranded in detention camps in Syria. ""Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?"" he asked Macron. ""I could give them to you."" Macron sputtered that Trump should be serious, and that foreign fighters are a tiny part of a big problem. It was fascinating: problems normally handled quietly by diplomats, erupting like burst pimples, right out in the open. During Trump's relatively brief 35 minutes with Justin Trudeau, he bluntly asked our prime minister, in front of everybody, why Canada isn't contributing two per cent of GDP to NATO, as required. Actually, asked Trump, ""What are you at? What's your number?"" Trudeau flailed, tried a little boring message track about his government's commitment to raise defence spending (I was sure he was going to start talking about helping the middle class), and finally, after consulting with his retinue, replied 1.4 per cent.  Well, maybe Canada should be put on a payment plan, gloated Trump. It was those Trump performances that Trudeau and Macron were giggling about at a reception later, when they were caught on camera with the audio turned on. The video went viral, and made headlines, because it was normally scripted leaders caught in a rare moment of honesty. Trump, on the other hand, prefers making fun of people to their faces. A colleague, after watching the NATO coverage for a few days, wrote me asking: ""Why don't more politicians besides an old white racist use these deadly dull canned moments to actually say something?"" Good question. Great question, really. Instead of sniggering at receptions, why don't our leaders stop behaving like wax sculptures of themselves? Wouldn't it have been wonderful, when Trump started bitching about Canada's NATO contribution, if Trudeau had had the bottle to say something like: ""Sure, let's talk about American military leadership. Your country invaded Iraq based on a lie, solved nothing, and caused not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but created ISIS. And now we're learning from your own government correspondence that you had no idea what you were doing in Afghanistan, a mess you actually managed to drag Canada into, and we all spent a lot of blood and treasure for nothing. Great job, Mr. President. Everybody's impressed."" Or, when Trump made his smarty-pants offer to send France some nice ISIS fighters, if Macron had replied: ""Really? Well, let's talk about that. You've been dumping your own prisoners on another country's soil, and holding them indefinitely without due process. Your country has also practised torture as an official policy, and you just pardoned three war criminals. Spare me, Mr. President. Also, and I say this as a Frenchman, your long-tie look is ridiculous."" Instead, the posing and empty statements live on, and will be happening long after Trump lurches off to enjoy the money his resorts have raked in during his presidency. Why does such photo-op mummery persist? Vanity and fear, I'd submit. Some of our leaders, like the Arab potentates, actually think they're so interesting they need only mouth pleasantries to make people listen in fascination. Others take refuge in scripted replies and posed photo ops because they're afraid, probably with good reason, that they'll say something stupid. But Trump has made that all right. Hasn't he? *** Author's Note: A rather doleful column I wrote last September about wrestling with a decision on whether to have surgery done on my Border Collie pup Lola, after we discovered she'd been born with hip dysplasia, generated an awful lot of response from commiserating dog-owners. I can report that we went ahead and basically had her hip joints removed that month, and that she has recovered brilliantly, and now runs like the wind. She's young and light and flexible and athletic, just like me, and that apparently made all the difference. As did post-op laser therapy and underwater treadmill exercise.

""We're going to comb through it and take out some things that might be a little bit archaic, that aren't necessary anymore,"" said Adams. ""Right now our bylaw is too big. There's too much in it. It states that you'd need to have things that a lot [of companies] currently don't have, and they are operating."" The bylaw, for example, requires a taxi stand with a washroom and has rules about the cleanliness of taxis that the city does not have the resources to enforce. There are three companies in the city, all operating in different ways, Adams said, and the bylaw should reflect what the industry is doing now. ""We're hoping that it will leave all the taxi operators on the same playing field,"" she said. Adams said the city will also be considering the arrival of ride-booking services in the review.

227,Ryan Cooke,2020-01-21T12:40:06.054Z,"Food heroes: Domino's dishes up 2,000 free pizzas to feed first responders after blizzard","As emergency workers all around St. John's ground their way Monday evening into the fourth straight day of exhausting work, gifts arrived in unusual boxes: pizza containers.  Boxes were stacked so high, the delivery drivers needed trolleys to bring them to police officers, nurses, prison guards, plow drivers and more. Shaun White, the co-owner of six Domino's franchises around the St. John's metro region, came through with about 2,000 pizzas for the people keeping the city afloat during a state of emergency. ""We figured it was enough to feed 10,000-plus people. We're very proud of the results,"" White told CBC News Tuesday. The idea came together late on Monday, as Shaun White and his wife and fellow co-owner, Melanie, sat home and pondered what they could do to help. The city had been on lockdown since a historic blizzard wreaked havoc on Friday, dumping more than 75 centimetres of snow across the region. White knew they couldn't open the store in a state of emergency, so he called three levels of government to ask for help. City officials gave the green light, and local MHA Sarah Stoodley even came down and spent the day packing boxes. They called the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary to get a number of how many pizzas they would need, and the police provided an enthusiastic response. They had cars on the road and were willing to deliver. ""The bulk of the pizzas that went to the hospitals yesterday — which was in the hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands — the RNC volunteered to take those and brought those to the hospitals for us. That was a great help."" Huge thank you to <a href=""https://twitter.com/DominosCanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@DominosCanada</a> for supplying pizza to first responders during this SOE! Sgt. Green is in shock of their generosity, as you can tell from the video! Members delivered them to St. Clare’s, RNC locations, and other first responders this afternoon! <a href=""https://t.co/bLyieNzJTR"">pic.twitter.com/bLyieNzJTR</a> To pull everything together, White contacted his staff members, who had been missing shifts since Thursday. They were more than happy to help out, donning the blue, white and red polo shirts and cooking up a ton of product. It's estimated the total value of the giveaways was $30,000. White went along for some of the deliveries, and said he was blown away to see how hard people were working throughout the state of emergency. ""The emergency room at the Health Sciences Centre for example, [to see] the staff there, the nurses, the paramedics, the doctors and what they were going through and the burden they were facing.… It was a lot to see,"" he said.  ""But to be able to walk in there with something that could brighten their day and see their faces and the responses, that was just fantastic and made everything worth it for sure."" White thanked everyone who helped out, including the national headquarters of Domino's Canada, which provided support for the giveaway. The Gathering Place is also being lauded for its efforts to feed to people in need on Monday and Tuesday. All staff and volunteers within walking distance of the community outreach centre trekked through the snow to provide a hot meal to clients. About 70 people showed up for lunch on Monday. ""It's been fantastic,"" said volunteer co-ordinator Nancy Elkins. ""We've had some guests that have gone without food since Thursday, so it's good that we were able to open today."" William Fillier was one of the first people in line Tuesday for a meal. He's been trapped inside since the blizzard, but got out for some much needed socialization and a good meal. ""It's a headache. I've never seen this amount of snow,"" he said. The Gathering Place also had medical staff on site for people needed help. Random boxes also began popping up around St. John's throughout the state of emergency, with people leaving items for others to take. ""Take what you need,"" read a sign placed on a plastic container full of canned goods and baby formula on Seaborn Street. In community Facebook groups, people posted items they had stockpiled in case a nearby resident was in need. Boxes of spaghetti, tomatoes, baby wipes, pampers, formula and more were listed as free for the taking. One person posted that they were in need of dog food and vegan food. Within minutes, one person offered to deliver dog food, while another offered to deliver vegan pea soup.

228,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:39:39.620Z,Boeing CEO says company won't scrap 737 Max,"Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun told reporters Wednesday the U.S. planemaker expects to resume 737 Max production months before its forecasted mid-year return to service, adding that it did not plan to suspend or cut its dividend. The company announced a production halt in December, when the global grounding of the fast-selling 737 Max following two deadly crashes in five months looked set to last into mid-2020. Calhoun said the company isn't considering scrapping the Max and expects it will continue to fly for a generation. He also said it won't launch a marketing campaign to get customers to get back on 737 Max planes. He disclosed that Boeing is starting with a ""clean sheet of paper"" on a new midsize airplane but it is not clear if the company is scrapping the existing design. The company said on Tuesday it now expects regulators to approve the plane's return to service in the middle of the year. Calhoun said he did not see recent issues raised about wiring or software as ""serious problems."" Boeing shares fell about 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, rebounding from earlier lows during the day. Calhoun said Boeing isn't planning to cut or suspend its dividend, because the company has the ""financial capacity and capability to do the things we need to do."" The CEO said he ""will stay on that path unless something dramatic changes."" Calhoun declined to provide a specific date for resumption of production, but said it ""will be reinvigorated months before that moment in June, because we have to get that line started up again."" He also said the company would make some changes to the 737 Max production line to make it more efficient. Calhoun said the company ""will slowly, steadily bring our production rate up a few months before that date in the middle of the year."" He said the company was not planning to lay off any employees because of the latest delay in the Max. The latest push back in the forecasted return to service is due to the company's decision to endorse simulator training for pilots before they resume flights, he said. ""We can get this thing back on its horse and we will,"" he added. Calhoun was a director at Boeing for a decade before taking over as chief executive earlier this month. The board ousted Dennis Muilenburg in December amid rising anger among regulators, politicians and customers. He said the company should have not have repeatedly revised the plane's forecasted return. ""It was hard for anybody to trust us,"" Calhoun said. Calhoun said before certification there will be ""a few more things somewhere along the way that the FAA and us will determine need a little extra work and we'll do it. They won't be big emergencies things, they won't be things that take the airplane down.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-will-not-scrap-737-max-1.5436552,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-grounded-until-summer-1.5435040,N/A
229,Wayne Thibodeau,2020-01-22T23:00:00.250Z,P.E.I. food banks serving growing number of newcomers  ,"Newcomers are presenting unique challenges for P.E.I.'s Upper Room Food Bank. About 13 per cent of the clientele at the food bank are now newcomers. Mike MacDonald, executive director of the Upper Room Hospitality Ministry, says the majority of the newcomers who he sees coming through the doors are refugees, primarily the Syrian refugees who moved to the Island a couple of years ago.   MacDonald made his comments during a legislative standing committee looking at the issue of poverty on the Island.  ""It certainly presents some challenges to us, the first one being communications,"" said MacDonald, who has worked with the food bank for nearly 20 years. ""The other is ensuring [we give] them the food that they need, giving them a can of vegetables or a box of Kraft dinner or something is not what they are looking for. They are looking for whole foods, fresh foods. They are looking for bags of flour and fresh vegetables."" The committee has been tasked with developing a costed plan for a basic income pilot project in P.E.I., as well as coming up with clear definitions and measures of poverty and a living wage. The committee was told to have its report back to the legislature by July.  MacDonald said a basic income may not benefit everybody.  ""There are many people that we see that this would be life-changing. There are other people who may struggle because of it,"" he said. ""We do see many people with addictions issues that as soon as they have money and funds in their pockets, unfortunately they are not talking about food, they are not thinking about shelter. Their addiction is taking over and they are servicing their addiction.""  The food bank serves 525 families a month, or about 1,600 people. More than 40 per cent of the clientele are under the age of 18. The Upper Room Soup Kitchen serves 3,500 meals per month. It is open seven days a week. MacDonald said housing, employment and medical issues, both physical and mental health, are the main reasons people seek help from the food bank and soup kitchen. He said the faces may change, but the stories behind them are consistent. ""We're always seeing single parent families and two parent families and we see seniors,"" he said. ""I guess the biggest increase would be people new to our country. That has certainly increased over the last number of years.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-newcomers-food-bank-charlottetown-1.5436580,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-emergency-housing-initiatives-1.5352798 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-upper-room-ys-mens-food-drive-2019-success-1.5339457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932,N/A
230,Logan Perley,2020-01-23T11:54:54.693Z,"Wolastoqi woman releases first children's book, plans for Indigenous-language versions","It took Gail Francis of Negotkuk (Tobique First Nation) years to turn an idea into her first children's book. But all that work comes to fruition when she releases Moonbeam on Monday. Moonbeam is a culturally based children's book about how a pre-contact Indigenous family names their child. The character Moonbeam is told the story of her naming while the family waits for another newborn baby in the village to be named. Francis is a former educator and now an autism resource consultant. She wrote the story of Moonbeam more than 15 years ago.  But bringing the book to life wasn't without its hurdles. Francis teamed up with her niece, Tara Audibert, an animator and filmmaker, who provided the illustrations. But the publishers they approached had a different idea.  ""One of the barriers for my aunt publishing this with a formal publishing house was that they all were like 'We're going to provide you with an illustrator, you can't bring your illustrator,'"" Audibert said.  ""Tara had captured the essence of Moonbeam, I really didn't want another illustrator,"" Francis added. Audibert didn't understand why so many publishers would walk away from a story by an Indigenous woman — illustrated by an Indigenous woman. She said there are probably only a handful in the field in the country. The aunt-niece duo decided to move in another direction with Moonbeam. ""She put it into publishers and then got some rejections,"" Audibert said. ""Then I said that I've self-published my own works and we could just do this."" And that's what they did.  Audibert created a logo and helped her aunt start her own publishing company. Francis Books was born with the intent to release Moonbeam.  Francis found one of the benefits of self-publishing is that she has the power to have the book translated into the two Indigenous languages of New Brunswick: Wolastoqey and Mi'kmaq. ""When I started school I didn't know in English, I had to learn English,"" Francis said. ""When I see the kids coming into school now it's the opposite. They're speaking English and trying to learn their language in school, so it's been a flip in terms of when I started my education."" Francis thinks it is important to recognize the Indigenous languages of each region. New Brunswick being the only officially bilingual province, she thinks that Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqey should be added to the official languages as well. Moonbeam already has Wolastoqey words sprinkled throughout the book, including terms of endearment such as ""t'us"" (daughter). But Francis said a full translation could be used as a teaching tool for a language at risk. ""If we could have the language out there available to them, so that there's resources out there that they could utilize"" Francis added. Francis said she has already had a few organizations and schools purchase several copies of Moonbeam to be used in their literacy programs or classrooms. Francis has plans to release a sequel to Moonbeam and wants the character to become the Wabanaki version of Franklin, the popular children's book series about a turtle. She hopes that she and Audibert can animate the story in the future, as well. Francis and Audibert will be having a book launch event for Moonbeam on Jan. 27 at the ARM Book Nook in Miramichi from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/aunt-and-niece-release-first-self-published-childrens-book-1.5436650,[],N/A
231,Erin MacInnis,2020-01-21T20:45:31.707Z,Halifax AG says municipality's website riddled with problems after 2017 launch,"Halifax's auditor general has outlined several problems with the launch of the most recent iteration of the municipality's website. Evangeline Colman-Sadd presented the report to the municipality's audit and finance standing committee on Tuesday. She found that the website, which launched in 2017, went live before several known problems were fixed, including broken links, missing pages and a faulty parking ticket payment system. Colman-Sadd blamed insufficient testing on some aspects of the site prior to its launch. ""With the paid parking portion of the site, there wasn't enough testing done,"" she said. ""It just didn't work properly."" The report said the system experienced errors in processing credit card payments and reconciling paid tickets. It also said management believed it was necessary to get public feedback by launching the site before fixing the outstanding problems. Website problems were initially being fixed as complaints came in from the public. The city's information, communication, and technology division is now running software to detect and fix broken links on the site. Colman-Sadd said a new payment system will be implemented later this year. Part of Tuesday's presentation was made behind closed doors, but Colman-Sadd would not comment on that portion of the meeting. ""It's not a matter where there's a fraud,"" she said.

232,Michael Gorman,2019-12-18T10:00:00.750Z,N.S. won't protect land with 'globally rare' ecosystem that company eyes for golf resort,"In the tiny community of Little Harbour on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore sits 285 hectares of coastal Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. The name is misleading: it's not actually a provincial park and there are no obvious markings or trails to enter the coastal barrens and wetlands. But the headland, which has been managed as a park reserve, is notable for some of its characteristics. According to the province, it's one of nine sites in Nova Scotia with a ""globally rare"" ecosystem and home to several endangered species. For six years, Owls Head has been one of the provincial properties awaiting legal protection. But that changed last March when, after several years of lobbying by and discussions with a private developer who wants to acquire the land as part of a plan to build as many as three golf courses, the Treasury Board quietly removed the designation, according to records CBC News received in response to an access-to-information request. This sets up the latest situation in Nova Scotia where conservation and environmental protection efforts appear poised to collide with economic development interests as the developer hopes to bring the kind of tourist attraction and job opportunities to the Eastern Shore that Inverness is realizing from the Cabot Links and Cabot Cliffs golf courses. The decision to de-list Owls Head was made using a minute letter, which is protected by cabinet confidentiality and thus not available for the public to see. Government documents, however, make clear a plan which, until now, has been unknown to the public. Lighthouse Links Development Company, which is owned by American couple Beckwith Gilbert and his wife, Kitty, is behind the proposal. They already own 138 hectares of land next to the Owls Head property. Gilbert has a background in merchant banking and has been heavily involved in medical research. He was not available for an interview, but in an emailed statement he said the couple fulfilled ""a dream to own and preserve an unspoiled, natural ocean beach"" when they started buying land in Little Harbour 16 years ago. As he and his wife got to know the community, Gilbert said ""it became quickly apparent that additional employment opportunities in the area were needed to encourage people to move to the Eastern Shore, rather than move away."" The idea for one golf course blossomed into two or three after talking to architects, he said. ""They emphasized that multiple adjacent courses were necessary to achieve profitable operations. Since we didn't have enough land for more than one course, we approached the province and proposed acquiring their unused adjacent land."" Gilbert's vision, according to a letter sent on his behalf to then-natural resources minister Lloyd Hines's executive assistant in 2016, which CBC obtained, is for something similar to the Cabot resort or Bandon Dunes golf resort in Oregon. Chris Miller, a conservation biologist and executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, called the proposal ""deeply concerning."" Miller said the land is important because of how much there is, allowing for more extensive ecosystems than what is typically found along the coast and because so little of the province's coast is publicly owned and protected. ""It's a place where conservation values and nature need to come first and human and economic development is only within the context of protecting those values,"" he said. Like Miller, Nova Scotia Nature Trust executive director Bonnie Sutherland said she had no idea about the change in designation, which still has not been updated on the provincial website. Sutherland's organization was intending to include Owls Head as part of its 100 Wild Islands project, which aims to protect the archipelago off the Eastern Shore. About 85 per cent of that work is complete. ""We're very surprised and disappointed,"" she said. ""To lose that habitat is very significant."" Sutherland pointed to the endangered species known to live and, in some cases, nest on the land, including piping plovers and barn swallows. Other species of ""conservation concern"" known to be there, according to government documents, include the ruby-crowned kinglet and common eider. There are ""unique boreal and temperate plants and lichens"" and Owls Head is one of nine sites in the province with ""the globally rare coastal broom crowberry heathland ecosystem,"" said the documents. But Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin said the government was comfortable removing the designation because the land isn't a priority for legal protection. By removing the designation, the government can now have the land appraised and begin more formal negotiations for a potential sale, said Rankin. The final decision was made by weighing the option to protect with the potential for economic development in a rural area, he said. ""There isn't high biodiversity value when you compare [it] to other pieces of land that we've advanced [for legal protection],"" said Rankin. He said the decision would not affect the government's ability to reach its goal of legal protection of 13 per cent of all Nova Scotia land. The golf project has had the support of Central Nova MP Sean Fraser and Eastern Shore MLA Kevin Murphy. In August 2018, the company hired former provincial Liberal cabinet minister Michel Samson to lobby on its behalf. Owls Head isn't the only Crown land Lighthouse Links wants to acquire. The province is in negotiations with the federal government on behalf of the company to buy about 17 hectares of surplus Crown land next to Owls Head that's home to an automated light beacon and helipad. Ottawa would keep 0.09 hectares, including the helipad and light, and sell the rest to the province for $167,500. Originally the land was offered for $1, but that required the province to use it for a public purpose. Had the province not engaged Ottawa on the offer, the land would have gone to public sale. An order in council approving that negotiation was passed in August (unlike minute letters, orders in council are posted online). Rankin said he sees the company's proposal as a good opportunity and said any kind of development would still have to respect the applicable environmental regulations. ""I see golf courses coexisting with opportunities for protecting the environment,"" he said. Miller, who said such a development would irreparably alter Owls Head, disagrees. There remain about 90 properties with pending protected status from the Parks and Protected Areas Plan of 2013 and Miller has repeatedly called on the province to confer legal protection to all of them, a move that would result in about 14 per cent of Nova Scotia's land being protected. ""The government has been dragging its feet and this is exactly the problem,"" he said. ""The longer it goes before the legal designation is applied, the more and more likely that it's going to get chipped away and that one site here will get tossed [and] another site will get tossed. ""Some economic opportunity of this or that will come along and before you know it the entire plan is undermined."" A spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said officials are unaware of any other negotiations or requests from private parties for land on the Parks and Protected Areas list that hasn't been approved yet for protection.

""It's about Black fathers being present, being involved with their children and doing their daughters' hair, and because [the videos] were going viral, he was like, 'I think the people want to see more representation.'"" Watch the short film Hair Love here: Cherry launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the film and was overwhelmed with donations, raising more than $300,000. The film was later picked up and distributed by Sony Pictures Animation.  Low, who is Afro-Chinese, got involved in the film because of a self-published comic she created called Tension about her own struggles with curly hair.  ""I grew up with a single mother, my Chinese mother, and she also had no idea how to handle my hair,"" Low said.  A friend who had read the comic and worked at Netflix passed it on to one of Hair Love's co-directors, Everett Downing.  ""He read my comic and he was like, 'You know what? This is something that she needs to work on. We need to bring her on the team. The themes in this comic are so much like the themes in the the short film we need to bring her on,' and so that's how I came on,"" Low said.  Although Monday's Oscar nominations created a stir for only nominating one actor of colour and no female directors —snubbing anticipated nominees like Greta Gerwig, Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Murphy, and films like The Farewell — Low says a nomination for Hair Love is a win.  ""People really crave this kind of storytelling and it benefits everybody,"" she said.  ""I really feel like a lot of people might not have considered, you know, a story about a black family relatable to the masses, but you watch it and you could find yourself in it.""

""It has been observed last year in Gaspé, and two years ago there [was] one observed in Maine, which was twice as big as this one, almost 100 metres in diameter."" ""These ice discs have mesmerized people for years and there have been a lot of claims, especially about alien stuff,"" he said. They've also been compared to crop circles.  ""But scientists have been studying the phenomena for years and you know what? They came up with a very simple explanation."" The simple explanation involves ""a magnificent chemical called H2O: water,"" Voyer said. Water is one of the few chemicals with a lower density in its crystallized form, he said. Meanwhile warm water is less dense than cold water, so it rises to the surface. Watch the ice disc slowly revolve in the South Thompson River: Nature's recipe for a rotating ice disc is ""a little open water, a little water current and an ice patch,"" Voyer said. When the temperature warms a bit, water molecules begin to warm up and migrate to the top. If the water surface is covered with an ice patch, those warm water molecules begin to move laterally with the current, creating a vortex like water down a bathtub drain. ""So the warm water vortex will push up the ice cover,"" Voyer said. ""Eventually the ice cover will crack along the edge of the vortex. And the reason for that is because the forces are stronger along the edge and the water is warmer."" The result is a very rough ice disc, which then grinds itself into a perfect circle as it rotates, he said. Ice discs rarely form, because conditions must be perfect: warming temperatures, not too much current and not too much wind.  The phenomenon is often fleeting, lasting a couple of days or a couple of weeks before wind or strong current causes the fragile disc to break apart. ""Also, there is the possibility that during the night there's aliens that will come and throw rocks at it or something like that,"" Voyer joked.  With files from Daybreak Kamloops",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ice-disc-thompson-river-rare-phenomenon-temporary-maine-aliens-1.5436887,[],N/A

In addition to homicide charges, Vale S.A. and TÜV SÜD, the company responsible for inspecting the dam, were charged with environmental crimes. Prosecutors said the 16 individuals charged had worked for Vale or TÜV SÜD, which has its global headquarters in Germany.  The charges, which come almost exactly one year after the collapse of the Vale dam in the state of Minas Gerais, represent a major step forward in Brazilian authorities' attempt to hold individuals criminally responsible for the disaster. Andressa de Oliveira Lanchotti, a state prosecutor, told Reuters earlier this month that Vale and TÜV SÜD employees knew the dam was at risk of collapsing and failed to act. She said state prosecutors believed TÜV SÜD had a significant interest in signing off on the dam's security, particularly after Vale had fired a different inspection firm that declined to do so. The collapse of the Vale tailings dam on Jan. 25, 2019, in the town of Brumadinho was one of the world's deadliest mining disasters and knocked $19 billion US off Vale's market value in a single day. Vale shares were down 2.5 per cent in afternoon trading in Sao Paulo. In a statement, TÜV SÜD said it ""continues to be deeply saddened by the tragic collapse of the dam in Brumadinho,"" and that the company's thoughts ""are with the victims and their families.""

239,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:51:09.229Z,Trump administration OKs building Keystone XL pipeline on federal land,"The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump approved a right-of-way allowing the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline to be built across U.S. land, federal officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday, pushing the controversial $8 billion US project closer to construction though — court challenges still loom. The approval signed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt covers 74 kilometres of the line's route across land in Montana controlled by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said Casey Hammond, assistant secretary of the Interior Department. The 1,905-kilometre pipeline would transport more than 132 million litres (830,000 barrels) of crude oil daily from Western Canada to terminals on the Gulf Coast. Calgary-based project sponsor TC Energy said in a court filing that it wants to begin construction in the next several months, but that's sure to face more legal challenges. First proposed in 2008, the pipeline has become emblematic of the struggle between economic development and curbing the fossil fuel emissions that are causing climate change. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama rejected it, but Trump revived it and has been a strong supporter. The stretch approved Wednesday includes all federal land crossed by the line, Hammond said. Much of the rest of the route is across private land, for which TC Energy has been trying to get permissions to build on. Opponents worry burning the tar sands oil will make climate change worse, and that the pipeline could break and spill oil into waterways like Montana's Missouri River. They have filed numerous lawsuits. Hammond said Interior officials and other agencies have done a thorough review of the line's potential effects on the environment. He said TC Energy had provided detailed plans to respond to any spill from the line. ""We're comfortable with the analysis that's been done,"" Hammond said. Another oil pipeline in TC Energy's Keystone network in October spilled an estimated 1.4 million litres of oil in eastern North Dakota. The company's critics say a damaging spill from Keystone XL is inevitable given the the length of the line and the many rivers and other bodies of water it would cross beneath. An attorney for environmental groups that have sued to overturn Trump's permit for the line said they will ask the judge in the case to issue an order blocking the new approval. ""We know President Trump's permit was unconstitutional, and we have every confidence that the federal courts will set aside these approvals,"" said Steve Volker, who represents the Indigenous Environmental Network. U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana praised the administration's move. ""Trump and his administration are delivering on their promise to get this critical infrastructure project moving after years of unnecessary delays,"" the Republican lawmaker said in a statement. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana initially denied a request from environmentalists to block construction in December, because no work was immediately planned. But he also has ruled against the project, including a 2018 decision that stalled the line and prompted Trump to issue a new presidential permit for Keystone XL to cross the U.S.-Canada border. In Nebraska, the state Supreme Court removed the last major obstacle for the project in August when it ruled in favour of state regulators who had approved a route for the pipeline in 2017. Opponents had argued that regulators didn't follow all the procedures required by state law. TC Energy intends next month to begin mobilizing construction machinery to areas designated for worker camps and pipeline storage yards in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, according to its court filings. It also plans to start toppling trees along the route in areas of South Dakota. In April, the company plans to start building a two-kilometre segment of the pipeline across the U.S.-Canada border. Construction of pumping stations for the line would begin in June.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-administration-keystone-xl-pipeline-federal-land-1.5436701,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-pipeline-tc-energy-south-dakota-water-1.5435455 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-ruling-1.5406064 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tc-energy-corp-organic-expansions-1.5364803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-north-dakota-keystone-spill-oil-tc-energy-1.5363633,N/A
240,Paul Withers,2020-01-21T10:00:00.693Z,Software glitch damages part of new Canadian science vessel,"A software malfunction is being blamed for damaging a critical piece of equipment on board Canada's new offshore fisheries science vessel, Canadian Coast Guard Ship Sir John Franklin. Spooling gear on the starboard trawl winch took off on its own. The winch is used to retrieve heavy gear and nets deployed to gather ocean climate data and fish stocks on board the B.C.-based vessel. The coast guard said the damaged part will be replaced and the winch repaired when the ship heads into planned maintenance next month. At the time of the malfunction, no personnel was in the vicinity, spokesperson Benoit Mayrand wrote in an email to CBC News. An official with the Union of Canadian Transportation Employees said the malfunction occurred in the middle of the night during a patrol last November. ""The shipyard is aware of the issue and is taking responsibility and will complete the repairs under warranty,"" Mayrand said. Franklin was the first large ship built under Canada's national shipbuilding strategy and it was delivered last June. Seaspan Shipyard in Vancouver was awarded the contract to build three offshore fisheries science vessels in a $687-million project. CCGS Jacques Cartier, which will be based in Halifax, was turned over to the coast guard last November. The third vessel, the John Cabot, is expected to be delivered this summer and will be based in St. John's. Seaspan said the sophisticated software and systems on its vessels are tested and approved by independent third parties before delivery. ""As with all large, complex systems, it is not uncommon for minor software anomalies to occur. These are addressed in routine maintenance windows. This is a minor issue isolated to the Sir John Franklin,"" spokesperson Amy MacLeod wrote in an email to CBC. Last March, Franklin struck a breakwater as it was returning from its first week of sea trials. To ensure the ship met its June delivery date, the rudder and propeller were removed from the third offshore science vessel, the John Cabot, and installed on Franklin. ""There are no delays to the delivery of the CCGS John Cabot due to the breakwater incident and no financial implications for the Government of Canada,"" Mayrand said. No parts were needed from the Cabot to repair the Franklin starboard trawl winch. In 2018, CBC News revealed portions of the Franklin hull were re-welded after an inspection uncovered a series of defective joints.

241,Anonymous,2020-01-22T18:05:05.453Z,"Larry Walker, the Hall of Fame ballplayer who actually wanted to play hockey","It was still early in what would prove to be a Hall of Fame career, but Larry Walker was already getting noticed. The B.C.-born slugger found himself on the cover of the first-ever Canadian edition of Sports Illustrated just ahead of the start of the 1993 season. ""It's a great honour,"" the 26-year-old Walker told CBC's Midday, when asked how he felt about the magazine's attention in early April 1993. ""I'm thrilled about it and I'm sure you know family and even myself are going to buy quite a few issues."" The Sports Illustrated profile of Walker mentioned his lifelong love of hockey, a game he was doing his best to keep up with during baseball's spring training season. ""It's tough to do down here in Palm Beach, a lot of people here don't know what icing is,"" said Walker, who spoke to Midday from Florida, where the Expos were taking part in spring training. ""So, I try and do the best I can with [the newspaper] USA Today to catch up on what Vancouver does, what Boston does and you know, keep track of things. "" At that time, Walker was coming off an all-star season with the Montreal Expos in which he had the highest batting average among the members of the starting lineup on his team. He also hit the most home runs and drove in the most runs. And he was still getting better — which probably helped convince the Expos to offer him the $3-million contract he had signed during the off-season. It hadn't always been so easy for Walker, who had grown up in Maple Ridge, B.C., dreaming of being a pro hockey player. When that dream didn't pan out, he ended up on a path to the pros in baseball. But there was a lot to learn along the way, including how to hit more difficult pitches than what he'd seen as a kid in Canada. ""Back home, all I saw was fastballs and what were supposed to be curveballs that really didn't do anything but spin,"" said Walker. ""So, I had to learn a lot of new pitches. The slider, the forkball, the splitter ... the pitchers were just so much more advanced because they had high-school ball and college ball."" Clearly, he'd figured that out by the time he talked to Midday, even though he'd then hit only 58 of the 383 home runs he'd launch out of Major League ballparks during his 17-year career. Walker would stay with the Expos through the 1994 season — the one that unfortunately ended prematurely, wiping out Montreal's playoff hopes. After that, Walker spent nearly a decade playing for the Colorado Rockies. And he was named the National League MVP while playing for that team in 1997. In 2004, he was traded to St. Louis, where he stayed playing with the Cardinals through the following season before retiring from baseball. In January 2020, Walker received notice he was being inducted into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.",https://www.cbc.ca/archives/larry-walker-1993-baseball-1.5053554,[],N/A
242,David Morley,2019-12-30T09:00:00.675Z,Millions of children in need of humanitarian assistance heading into new year,"This column is an opinion by David Morley, president and CEO of UNICEF Canada. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. We are entering the final year of what has been one of the worst decades for children. War, disease and extreme weather events are robbing them of their right to simply be a kid – to have a safe, healthy and carefree childhood. In far too many communities around the world, sounds of youngsters laughing and getting into mischief are being replaced by silence. It doesn't have to be that way. This month, UNICEF launched Humanitarian Action for Children 2020, a report on the world's emergencies. It highlights some of the key challenges children are facing around the world: severe malnutrition, conflict, infectious disease, climate change, and access to education. Children displaced by crises are also vulnerable to increased harm, including gender-based violence, recruitment as soldiers, exploitation, and trafficking. The sheer magnitude of the situation is heartbreaking. The report identifies 59 million children in 64 countries who are living in crisis zones and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 2 million children with disabilities. These are the highest levels since we began keeping records. The projections for the year ahead are just as dire. The main causes are threefold – conflict, climate change and major outbreaks of disease. The number of armed conflicts is at a three-decade high, with many civil wars engulfing entire countries. More than 30 million children are caught in the middle. Yemen has been a battleground for more than four years. Fighting has been going on for six years in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Syria's civil war is now in its ninth year. And these conflicts have no end in sight. Some have lasted so long that many kids are growing up only knowing war. Top priorities in these war-torn regions include providing children with protection, safe water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. And the need is great. In the coming year, for example, UNICEF expects it will need to treat 5.1 million children for acute malnutrition, provide 4.5 million children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, and distribute emergency cash assistance to 1.7 million families to meet their most urgent needs. Immediate responses to crises in the year ahead must also be balanced with the longer-term needs of children, most importantly their education, which is also under attack. During disasters, schools are often used as shelters or distribution centres, since they are usually among the strongest structures. In conflict zones, they are increasingly becoming targets. More than 3,000 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the past three years because of violence and insecurity. Kids are incredibly adaptable, but in any emergency, getting them back into a classroom as quickly as possible is essential. Education to help them reach their potential is obviously important, but letting them be with their friends in a safe space also gives them a return to normalcy. As if wars and conflict weren't enough, millions of children are also threatened by outbreaks of highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Major outbreaks are now hitting the most vulnerable in conflict zones, greatly complicating the ability of aid agencies to respond. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest ever recorded and the first to occur in the middle of a conflict zone. There are 3,000 confirmed cases, including more than 900 children. Measles has also become a threat to children despite safe and affordable vaccines. As with any public health campaign for children, educating the adult decision-makers is the key to eliminating this deadly threat. Climate change is also affecting the most vulnerable. More than 500 million children live in areas that have experienced extreme flooding, while 160 million live in regions that are subject to severe drought. And the number of extreme weather events keeps rising. Mozambique was hit by back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, for example, and rebuilding will take years. Regions like the Sahel in Africa, where livelihoods rely on agriculture, grazing and fishing, are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Solutions demand a long-term commitment. The positive news is that humanitarian organizations have made tremendous progress working with host governments in areas likely to experience extreme weather and flooding, helping to build more resilient communities and better prepare for disasters. Still, the threats children are facing are overwhelming. The amount of funding for emergencies that UNICEF projects it will need in 2020 is $4.2 billion US, a staggering 3.5 times the amount required in 2010, underscoring how frightening the world has become for young people. But as someone who has worked in the international humanitarian sector for going on four decades, I refuse to be discouraged. We cannot give up. The international community, governments and civil society need to come together to protect and defend children's rights. The government of Canada is playing a global leadership role in prioritizing education for children in conflict zones and other protracted humanitarian crises. But as a nation we must do more to help children around the world. People in this country clearly care about children's welfare. I am confident Canadians will rise to the challenge and defend, for every child everywhere, the right to a safe and healthy childhood.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-child-welfare-1.5367654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-war-saudis-houthis-1.5373868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unhcr-refugee-forum-1.5398929 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mali-violence-massacre-children-1.5171664 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/mali-mission-1.5272076 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/violence-against-health-workers-worsening-measles-outbreak-in-congo-1.5377716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107,N/A

""We've been doing this for too long to say that it's wrong."" The community's locally-developed caribou conservation plan was presented as the first act of business at a three-day ""public listening session"" on the caribou harvest, organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board. The sessions have brought more than 60 visitors to the small community of about 130 people, and have been well-attended. According to the plan, one goal is to ""avoid intervention"" by the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources to regulate harvest through tags or quota systems, which it calls an ""unprecedented colonial system of control."" In their place, the plan proposes a bottom-up management system based on mutual respect for and ""inter-dependence with ʔədə,"" the traditional name for caribou. It also says conservation efforts must be guided by the wisdom of elders and the community's traditional law, or ʔeʔa. Among the ʔeʔa principles, the plan outlines are respect for the land, sharing and a belief ""that all things have a spirit and are interconnected."" Colville Lake's caribou conservation plan proposes the revitalization of the community's traditional law through the documentation of harvesting customs, the development of new research standards, and educating youth.  The plan would significantly empower Colville Lake's local renewable resource council, which it asserts is better placed to assess the conservation needs of the herd. Government departments are too ""siloed"" to take the holistic approach to conservation possible on a local level, according to the plan. It commits Colville Lake's authorities to establish and enforce local guidelines. It would also collect and share harvest numbers with partners in the territorial government. ""Although reporting harvest numbers may be alien to the customs of the Dene, it … may serve to prevent the imposition of unacceptable harvest restrictions,"" the plan reads. If fully accepted, the plan would also obligate the government to consult with the local renewable resource council before permitting any proposed mineral and petroleum exploration on the caribou range. That range extends well outside the territory, into Yukon and Nunavut. The plan also asks that the government and exploration companies to consider reporting annually ""what they are doing on the land."" The plan must be approved by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board in its list of decisions produced from the session, due to be released Mar. 31. Then it will head to the territorial government, which will need to decide if and how to implement it under the territory's Wildlife Act. A similar local management plan produced by the community of Deline is still under consideration by the territory after four years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearings-1.5435406,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-bluenose-east-caribou-conservation-decision-1.3741233,N/A
244,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:18:38.451Z,Quebec to comply with ruling that struck down assisted death provisions ,"The Quebec government will comply with a court ruling striking down parts of its medical aid in dying legislation, the province's health and justice ministers announced Tuesday. The province will allow a provision stating those seeking a medically assisted death must be ""at the end of life'' to simply disappear from its legislation, the ministers said, without making any further amendments to the proposed law. The decision means more people will qualify for a medically assisted death, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said, reminding reporters that patients will still have to meet the law's five other criteria to qualify. ""They have a choice,'' McCann said. ""That's the spirit in which we made the decision — the self-determination that a human being who has met all those five criteria ... will have a choice.'' Last September, Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and a section the Quebec law that states people must ""be at the end of life,'' which prevented access to medical assistance in dying for some. The case was brought by two Quebec residents — Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon — who did not meet the criteria and had their requests for assisted death turned down by doctors. Both suffer from incurable degenerative diseases, and lawyers argued the condition that a person's natural death be ''reasonably foreseeable'' before they can receive medical assistance in dying was overly strict. Gladu suffers from post-polio syndrome and medication no longer helps alleviate her pain, the court heard. Doctors gave her about two to three years to live due to her pulmonary condition. Truchon has cerebral palsy. Three of his four limbs were not functional at birth, and he just lost the use of the fourth, but he could continue to live for many more years. The two launched a legal action against the federal and provincial governments, claiming their right to life, liberty and security — guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms — was infringed. Baudouin suspended the application of her judgment until March 11 to give federal and provincial legislators six months to modify the laws, while granting exemptions to Gladu and Truchon to seek medical aid in dying during this period if they satisfied other legal conditions. Neither the federal or provincial governments appealed the decision, although the federal government has not yet announced exactly what it intends to do. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly. The government launched public consultations on the issue. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel said her federal counterpart, David Lametti, is expected to brief provincial ministers this week in Victoria, B.C. ""Theoretically, as long as the federal criteria exists, it applies, so it's in effect until March 12,'' LeBel said, adding it's unclear if the federal government will seek an extension. The chair of the commission that oversees end-of-life care in the province is confident that despite the change in wording, there won't be a flood of people lining up for medical assistance in dying. ""The commission is not afraid that on March 12, the demand will increase tremendously,'' said Dr. Michel Bureau said. ""That's not what we believe.'' But LeBel said the time was right for Quebec to make its announcement, noting the province is about to embark on consultations to broaden the criteria on Jan. 27. ""We've taken our decision so it was the time to announce it,'' LeBel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890,N/A

246,Rosa Marchitelli,2020-01-20T02:26:20.853Z,Caught on camera: Man chases dangerous driver after 911 puts him on hold ,"Sam Gill says he had a knot in his stomach as he watched a driver in front of him barrelling down a busy road in Mississauga, Ont., weaving in and out of oncoming traffic, jumping a curb and hitting a snowbank so hard the impact knocked his headlight off, though that didn't stop him. When Gill dialled 911 for help, he was put on hold.  Just before 8 p.m. on a Sunday last month, Gill spotted the other motorist ""driving erratically — can't stay in his lanes, can't maintain control of the vehicle.""  ""Every second that passed, I'm thinking, 'Oh my god, somebody is going to die,"" he said.  Canadians make an estimated nine million calls to 911 every year, taking for granted that someone will answer, says Holly Barkwell, the Canadian region director of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), an international organization that works to improve 911 service. ""Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere across Canada,"" she says. In reality, Barkwell says, the 911 system might not work as expected because it's fragmented, underfunded and operating on technology that's over 50 years old. ""It's been ignored too long. It's an issue of public safety.""  There are no mandatory standards in Canada, but voluntary standards set by NENA in 2006 say 90 per cent of 911 calls should be answered within 10 seconds, and 95 per cent within 20 seconds. But because there is no national oversight on 911 service, there's no way to tell how Canada measures up.  In Gill's case, he was on hold for almost six minutes (his phone was hands-free) while he chased the dangerous driver — honking and flashing his lights, trying to warn others to steer clear. ""At this point I'm saying to myself … if [911] doesn't answer, should I push him off the road? I might hurt him in the process, but I might save his life and potentially the lives of others,"" he said. Peel Regional Police, which runs the 911 service in Gill's area, says it was swamped with double the usual number of calls at the time, adding it had a ""record number"" of calls in 2019, though an exact number wasn't available.  By the time an operator answered and police arrived, the driver had crashed into another snowbank and passed out behind the wheel, with his vehicle still in drive, Gill said. He says an officer told him the man was drunk. Peel Regional Police wouldn't confirm that with Go Public.  Similarly, Helena Shepherd-Snider couldn't reach 911 when her husband had a heart attack in 2016. Instead, she got a recorded message saying the number was not in service, and to dial zero for the operator. Initially, she says the operator refused to call for her, telling Shepherd-Snider she should do it herself. ""It felt like a double whammy. [I was thinking] where else can I go? What can I do? Time was of the essence,"" she said. After about 15 minutes, she convinced the operator to call 911. She credits fast-working paramedics for saving her husband's life. When the dust settled, Shepherd-Snider discovered everyone on her block — about half a kilometre outside Sudbury, Ont. — had 911 service except the last four houses including hers.  Depending on where you live, 911 is run by municipalities, the police or the province, while telecom companies are responsible for supplying the network needed to connect the calls — an example of how the system is fragmented, according to Barkwell.  When Shepherd-Snider called Bell and the municipality, she says they ""passed the buck"" — neither correcting the issue. Instead, Bell cut off 911 service to her neighbours. ] The company tells Go Public that their block is outside Sudbury's service boundaries and that Shepherd-Snider's neighbours ""had been erroneously provided with 911."" The city says those houses are a provincial responsibility and have separate emergency numbers for ambulance, fire and police. Shepherd-Snider had no idea.  The shortcomings of the 911 system were flagged back in a 2013 CRTC report and, says Barkwell, haven't changed. The report found: One of the biggest problems, according to Barkwell, is that 911 services still use old analog technology, which makes it difficult to locate people using mobile phones. She says mobile apps have a better chance of locating someone than 911. ""The biggest question I get from people often is how come Uber can find me and how come Domino's Pizza can find me but 911 can't find me?"" Barkwell said. A number of recent deaths have highlighted other problems with 911 services, and how they co-ordinate with emergency personnel.  B.C. is promising changes to its 911 system after a woman bled to death after waiting 35 minutes for an ambulance in Vancouver in 2018. An ambulance was dispatched promptly, but attendants were unable to reach her because the doors and an elevator in her building were locked, and firefighters were called in too late.  In Ontario, the deaths of four people in two separate incidents led to dozens of recommendations from the provincial coroner, and to a bill meant to address problems with 911.  ""People have lost their lives and people will continue to lose their lives,"" said France Gélinas, the NDP MPP, who last year put forward Bill 75, which is currently before the social policy committee.  Gélinas says she doesn't believe the Tory government will pass the bill, however, and, when asked by Go Public, the provincial Ministry of Health wouldn't say. Spokesperson David Jensen said the government has established a task force to look at the problems with the system, including the coroner's recommendations. Ontario does not have legislation to govern delivery of 911 service or to provide secure funding for it. Certain provinces, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec do. In March, the CRTC introduced a plan to modernize 911 networks in Canada. As part of that plan, telecoms must upgrade from analog technology to digital by June 30, 2023.  It's a good start, says Barkwell, but doesn't address the many other problems like inconsistent or inadequate funding.  In the meantime, after his experience with the dangerous driver in Mississauga, Sam Gill says he worries what might happen to his family or others if there is another emergency. ""We've lost our faith and that's not a good feeling,"" he said. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

They want their historic Pointe-Claire Village to remain free of high-rise condos. For the most part, elected officials agree. The city has proposed banning buildings higher than two storey on all but nine lots in the village. The city says those nine lots will be allowed a third floor if that floor is set back from the second and built to promote ""commercial vitality and residential projects."" That proposed exemption had citizens furious during a public meeting Tuesday evening as, one by one, they took the microphone to voice their frustration. So many showed up to the meeting that some were turned away at the door. ""Our position is that we think the entire village should be kept at two storeys so that we can maintain its character,"" said Andrew Swidzinski, vice president of the Pointe-Claire Heritage Society. Deborah Fairchild said three-storey buildings are unwelcome and the mayor isn't listening. ""The consensus is very, very clear, that people do not want gentrification,"" she said.  ""They don't want three-storey buildings. They don't want another downtown. They want to keep the character of the village and preserve it as the beautiful place that it is with the open spaces and to preserve the businesses and economy that are already there."" This discussion has been dragging on for a number of years as the city looks to amend its village code — a series of rules aimed at preserving various heritage sites by regulating the appearance of buildings, land subdivisions and new construction. The city has previously suggested setting the cap at six storeys, but residents quickly shot that down — not wanting the quiet, timeworn feel of the village to be overtaken by towering complexes. The newly proposed limit of two storeys on all but nine buildings will affect Lakeshore Drive as well as the properties on Cartier Avenue, south of Lanthier Avenue. Buildings in the area will be limited to 12 metres, no matter if they are two or three storeys.  In a city statement issued Tuesday, Mayor John Belvedere said the proposed changes are intended to make the village ""a destination of choice for all."" After the meeting, he said to keep the village vital, it can't be frozen in time. ""The village did not get to where it is today without change. We need to think of the future and the future is, you know, densification,"" he said. All the buildings would have commercial on the ground floor, he said, meaning there can only be so many residential units on the upper floors given the limited number of storeys. He said the city has been working closely with citizens, ensuring green spaces are preserved while allowing the village to grow economically. ""Right now, the village is busy. We have put a lot of time and energy into the village,"" he said. ""I think anybody is allergic to change. I accept that. I understand that. It's a scary thing, change. But if you don't change, you maintain the status quo, you actually go backward.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pointe-claire-height-restrictions-village-1.5435666,[],N/A

249,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:35:27.902Z,"Mexico begins flying, busing migrants back to Honduras","Hundreds of Central American migrants who entered southern Mexico in recent days have either been pushed back into Guatemala by Mexican troops, shipped to detention centres or returned to Honduras, officials said Tuesday. An unknown number slipped past Mexican authorities and continued north. The latest migrant caravan provided a public platform for Mexico to show the U.S. government and migrants thinking of making the trip that it has refined its strategy and produced its desired result: This caravan will not advance past its southern border. What remained unclear was the treatment of the migrants who already find themselves on their way back to the countries they fled last week. ""Mexico doesn't have the capacity to process so many people in such a simple way in a couple of days,"" said Guadalupe Correa Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University studying how the caravans form. The caravan of thousands had set out from Honduras last week in hopes Mexico would grant them passage, posing a fresh test for U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to reduce the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S. border by pressuring other governments to stop them. Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said 2,400 of the migrants entered Mexico legally over the weekend. About 1,000 of them requested Mexico's help in returning to their countries. The rest were being held in immigration centres while they start legal processes that would allow them to seek refuge in Mexico or obtain temporary work permits that would confine them to southern Mexico. On Tuesday afternoon, Jesus, a young father from Honduras who offered only his first name, rested in a shelter in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, with his wife and their baby, unsure of what to do next. ""No country's policy sustains us,"" he said in response to hearing Ebrard's comments about the situation. ""If we don't work, we don't eat. [He] doesn't feed us, doesn't care for our children."" Honduran officials said more than 600 of its citizens were expected to arrive in that country Tuesday by plane and bus and more would follow in the coming days. Of an additional 1,000 had tried to enter illegally Monday by wading across the Suchiate River, most were either forced back or detained later by immigration agents, according to Mexican officials. Most of the hundreds stranded in the no man's land on the Mexican side of the river returned to Guatemala overnight in search of water, food and a place to sleep. Alejandro Rendon, head of Mexico's federal social welfare department, said his colleagues were distributing water to those who turned themselves in or who were caught by immigration agents, but were not doing the same along the river because it was not safe for workers to do so. ""It isn't prudent to come here because we can't put the safety of the colleagues at risk,"" he said. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday the government is trying to protect the migrants from harm by preventing them from traveling illegally through the country. He said they need to respect Mexican laws. ""If we don't take care of them, if we don't know who they are, if we don't have a register, they pass and get to the north, and the criminal gangs grab them and assault them, because that's how it was before,"" he said. ""They disappeared them."" Mexican Interior Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero commended the National Guard for its restraint, saying: ""In no way has there been an act that we could call repression and not even annoyance."" But Honduras's ambassador to Mexico said there had been instances of excessive force on the part of the National Guard. ""We made a complaint before the Mexican government,"" Alden Rivera said in an interview with HCH Noticias without offering details. He also conceded migrants had thrown rocks at Mexican authorities. An Associated Press photograph of a Mexican National Guard soldier holding a migrant in a headlock was sent via Twitter by acting U.S. Homeland Security secretary Ken Cuccinelli with the message: ""We appreciate Mexico doing more than they did last year to interdict caravans attempting to move illegally north to our southern border."" The National Guard had no business being placed at the border to handle immigration because they weren't trained for it, said Correa Cabrera, the George Mason professor. The government ""is sending a group that doesn't know how to and can't protect human rights because they're trained to do other kinds of things."" ""[The Americans] absolutely must be satisfied with [Mexico's] actions because in reality it's their plan,"" said Correa Cabrera. ""They're congratulating themselves, because in reality it wasn't Lopez Obrador's plan."" Mexico announced last June that it was deploying the newly formed National Guard to assist in immigration enforcement to avoid tariffs that Trump threatened on Mexican imports. Darlin Rene Romero, 25, and his wife were among the few who spent the night pinned between the river and Mexican authorities. Rumours had circulated through the night that ""anything could happen, that being there was very dangerous,"" Romero said. But the couple from Copan, Honduras, spread a blanket on the ground and passed the night 20 yards from a line of National Guard troops forming a wall with their riot shields. They remained confident that Mexico would allow them to pass through and were trying to make it to the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, where his sister lives. They said a return home to impoverished and gang-plagued Honduras, where most of the migrants are from, was unthinkable.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-mexico-1.5435129,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-crosses-into-mexico-1.5433707 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-us-border-detainees-1.5402767,N/A
250,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:31:24.984Z,Indigenous 'Molly of Denali' is more than a cartoon for some,"Charitie Ropati watched the pilot episode of Molly of Denali in her Columbia University dorm room, huddled around a computer screen with friends. ""We were crying,"" Ropati said. ""We realized we finally had positive representation."" Molly of Denali is the first cartoon series with an Alaska Native character as the lead. It premiered in the U.S. on PBS Kids in July. For many, it is more than a cartoon. ""Watching the show is a way for my Native friends and I to bond,"" said 18-year-old Ropati, who's Yup'ik. She had just moved to New York City from Anchorage and was feeling homesick when the pilot aired. ""PBS did such a good job. It is like my siblings, Native youth and myself can see ourselves in it."" The series, in its first season, has Indigenous input at all levels of production, Indian Country Today reported. It includes 38 episodes, a podcast series and a collection of paperback books. The series, a co-production with CBC Kids, premiered on CBC in September 2019. People can watch Molly of Denali on Saturdays on CBC TV and CBC Gem, and on-demand via Gem.  Dorothea Gillim is the series' executive producer, a position she also held on Curious George. After working in the industry for many years, she says this program is special. ""I've never worked on a show where people tear up on a regular basis,"" Gillim said. Gillim says she recently heard about a non-Native family who wanted to make a trip to Alaska after watching the show. They called the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce to learn more about Alaska Native languages to prepare for their trip. Her job as executive producer is multifaceted; she raises money for the show while leading a close-knit team. And she was also involved at the earliest moments of the show to choose writers, producers, animators, and voice actors. One of the talents she gathered was Princess Johnson who is Neets'aii Gwich'in. Johnson is the creative producer of Molly of Denali. Part of Johnson's job is to advocate for Indigenous representation at every level of the creative process. This means making sure things are done ""right"" in every episode, interstitial (a short-program shown between episodes that features Alaska Native children), online tools, games and podcast. She also ensures Alaska Natives are included as writers, actors and producers. A job like this didn't always exist. There are serious implications to many non-Native people creating media about Native people, a 2018 IllumiNative report says. ""The story they adopt is overwhelmingly one of deficit and disparity,"" the report states. ""This narrative can undermine relationships with other communities of colour."" Many say Molly of Denali challenges that. The series was developed with a group of over 60 established Alaska Native or Indigenous participants, who took on adviser, writer, producer, voice talent and musician roles. The participants are from every region of Alaska where the show takes place. For every character that is Native, their voice actor is Native too. Beyond this, there is also a fellowship program for Alaska Native writers. Atomic Cartoons, the lead animation company of the series, holds internships for Alaska Natives. Vera Starbard, who is Tlingit and Dena'ina, is a writer for Molly. She says she has worked on many artistic projects that involve Alaska Native people. ""I've never experienced this level of dedication to getting it right,"" she said. ""Usually my job comes with emotional labour of having to educate others,"" Starbard said. ""This time ... my job is just to write."" Starbard says something surprising is how much work happens behind the scenes. Here's a little bit of how the process works: Writers think of a potential story they pitch to a producer. If their pitch is accepted, they work through many rounds of edits. Writers must decide who the characters are, where the story takes place and what informational text will go into an episode. They have to write every word that a character speaks, including where they chuckle or show forms of expression. After a script is approved and ""polished,"" it is sent to directors and animators. ""And then I don't see the story again until it airs,"" Starbard said. This entire process takes a while. Starbard's first episode took 18 months before it aired. Because the show is in its first season, animators are tasked with creating entire new towns, characters and worlds. Starbard has written four episodes so far. She says her life experiences inspire her story ideas. When writing ""New Nivagi,"" an 11-minute story that follows Molly while she gathers items to make her grandpa's secret ice cream recipe, she says it reflected an experience she knows. Starbard grew up in Alaska and says she had to be ""pretty creative"" to make recipes because sometimes it is hard to find ingredients. So she wrote an entire episode where Molly does the same. Producers of the show use other liberties to showcase Alaska's diversity. One of Molly's best friends is Tooey Ookami, a 10-year-old boy who is Koyukon, Yup'ik and Japanese. The other is Trini Mumford, a 7-year-old African American girl. ""We wanted to reflect the true diversity of Alaska and the public media,"" said Johnson. Alaska is home to 229 tribes. Johnson says it is especially heartwarming to hear about people's reaction to the show. Johnson remembers being in Anchorage when a young girl's mother approached her to say they recently went to a Molly screening. After it was over, her daughter was looking through her closet to find her kuspuk (a hooded shirt with large front pockets) because Molly wore her kuspuk in the show. Another time Johnson remembers being at a children's museum when a mother said her son was showing interest in his Inupiaq culture because of the show. ""That is the ultimate goal,"" said Johnson. ""It is a joy to see that sort of reaction."" And the reactions are from non-Native people too. Johnson heard a story from a friend's son who watched the show and asked what an ancestor was. ""When I go back to the beginning when I first heard of the show I knew the potential impact that the show could have,"" said Johnson. She says it has been worth it because of that. During Halloween, the show released a graphic informing viewers how to dress like Molly. They were especially cognizant of not telling people to wear her traditional regalia. Instead they encouraged viewers to wear a brown coat and boots, blue jeans and pink mittens. The graphic received traction on social media. It was liked more than a thousand times on Twitter. If you would like to dress up like Molly for Halloween, here is how you can do so respectfully. We do ask that people refrain from wearing Molly's traditional Native dress (Regalia) as a costume.

The campaign is called She is Indigenous. Funded by the Province of Ontario, the campaign is led by Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak, the national organization representing Métis women, and supported by a number of provincial and national Indigenous organizations. ""We really want to re-write that narrative that Indigenous women are vulnerable and at-risk individuals. Instead, we see Indigenous women as profoundly kind, ambitious, and inspirational,"" said Tamsin Fitzgerald, senior policy analyst at Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak. Close to 100 women have been featured since the campaign launched in June 2019 online with the goal of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls. It launched the same month as the release of the final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak issued its own report in the fall. With She is Indigenous, Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak wanted to work toward the same goal of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls but from a different approach.  Fitzgerald said the campaign challenges negative stereotypes, educates Canadians about First Nations, Inuit, and Métis issues, and supports Indigenous women by honouring their unique strengths and accomplishments. ""The main goal is to support everyday Indigenous women and highlight their contributions,"" she said. One of those women is Celeste Beauchamp. The 20-year-old Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) from Kahnawake works as a youth reconciliation initiative co-ordinator at Canadian Roots Exchange in Ottawa. She said she likes that the campaign focuses on the inherent strengths of Indigenous women. ""We're empowered in just being women,"" said Beauchamp.  ""We get really caught up in our resilience, constantly fighting for our community, constantly fighting for our land and our languages, that we forgot that we're whole in ourselves. We have to take care of ourselves and honour our own power."" Tenille Campbell, the Dene/Métis poet of #IndianLovePoems and photographer behind Sweetmoon Photography, is another woman profiled in the campaign.  ""I really like the idea of visually taking up space,"" she said. Every other day, She is Indigenous posts a profile of an Indigenous woman on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The plan is to continue indefinitely, and encourage others to participate by nominating themselves or an Indigenous woman in their life. ""So often, one of the main narratives about us is our struggle, which is important, but there's also joy, strength, intelligence, and kinship. There's so many other aspects of being an Indigenous woman other than just surviving,"" said Campbell.

Energy prices in December were up 5.5 per cent compared with a year ago, while gasoline prices were up 7.4 per cent compared with December 2018 when crude oil prices fell amid a global oversupply.

The year-over-year growth in fresh vegetable prices slowed to 1.5 per cent in December compared with an increase of 7.1 per cent in November. Statistics Canada said lettuce prices were down 5.0 per cent compared with a year ago when prices rose due to an E. coli outbreak, which required the stock of romaine lettuce in the U.S. to be disposed of, limiting the supply and driving up prices for other kinds of lettuce. Prices for passenger vehicles in December also rose at a slower pace, rising 1.4 per cent compared with a year ago, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase in November.

254,Steven D'Souza,2020-01-21T20:55:22.413Z,'This is going to be very ugly': Weinstein defence may use prevailing myths about rape to his advantage,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. When opening arguments begin Wednesday in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul's behaviour will be put under a microscope. But so, too, will the actions of his accusers, and some psychologists worry that outdated myths about rape will be used to discredit them. ""I think this is going to be very ugly,"" said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus in the women and gender studies department at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and predatory sexual assault against two women. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Fitzgerald said the defence may employ a tactic commonly used in sex assault cases: turning the focus from the accused to the accuser and playing on misconceptions about victims. One line of defence in such cases is to suggest the rape didn't really happen or that it wasn't really rape. ""They are going to try and capitalize on myths,"" Fitzgerald said. One of the accusers in the trial, who hasn't been identified, alleged Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in 2013. On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers announced they want to use friendly emails the accuser sent to the former producer after the alleged assault in a bid to convince jurors that any contact was consensual. ""There's direct communications between Harvey and women, always friendly, sometimes romantic, that would lead, I think, any reasonable person to think that the claims are untrue,"" Weinstein's lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told ABC News. Fitzgerald, who has written about rape myths and workplace sexual harassment, said there are decades of studies detailing how women behave in certain situations after being sexually assaulted, and the reasons behind that. ""Lots of people remain in contact with their abuser for a whole variety of reasons,"" she said. ""In some cases, because he has a lot of power and he can hurt you."" Trauma psychologist Joan Cook said it's disheartening to already see indications from Weinstein's team that it will be relying on an outdated understanding of how victims of sexual assault behave.  ""There's a lot of ways that men and women who have been sexually violated respond, and it's not the way we think,"" Cook said. ""Most don't go to the police; most don't confront their abuser; and many don't disconnect for various reasons.""  Watch: Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, talks about the defence's strategy Many survivors are in shock or numb after the assault, so they stay silent, Cook said, because what happened to them may not register right away or because they're afraid of the personal and professional consequences of cutting off contact. ""It's not surprising to me at all that people would have kept in touch with [Weinstein],"" said Cook. ""He owned Hollywood, so if you wanted to function there, weren't you going to still try and maintain a connection?"" That was among the reasons Dominique Huett said she stayed in touch with Weinstein, even after she alleged he sexually assaulted her in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2010. She was the first Weinstein accuser to file a civil claim against him. ""I emailed him after the assault happened, but that doesn't mean the assault didn't happen,"" Huett told CBC News. ""It just means I was trying to regain some sense of control back over what he did."" Huett's allegation falls within the statute of limitations, and she hopes charges can still be filed in California for her case. ""I think the old rhetoric of blaming the victim is very outdated at this stage,"" said Huett. ""I think the #MeToo movement kind of exposed how women are not, you know, liars."" Huett is a member of the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers who have come together to amplify the experiences of sexual assault survivors. In addition to questioning the motivation and actions of the accusers, Weinstein's defence is expected to call two experts to testify about memory. The judge, however, limited the scope of their testimony and denied a defence request to have them testify about a phenomenon called ""unwanted voluntary sex."" Cook said the understanding among researchers used to be that memory was fixed and unchanging, but today, it's recognized that the fact that an assault victim's recollections may change over time isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. ""The truth is, memory is much more fluid, and memories can change, and they can be altered over time,"" Cook said. The prosecution will be calling Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist at Temple University in Philadelphia who is an expert on rape and sexual assault trauma. The Manhattan district attorney's office is hoping Ziv can counter some of the myths around sexual assault, including why victims often wait to disclose their assault. Ziv gave such testimony in the second trial of Bill Cosby, who was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a Canadian woman who met Cosby while working at his alma mater, Temple University, in the early 2000s. The prosecution also hopes the four additional women who will be allowed to testify even though their allegations against Weinstein haven't resulted in charges will help establish a pattern of behaviour similar to how the testimony of other women did in the Cosby retrial. The question of how deeply the message of the #MeToo movement has permeated society was an undercurrent during the contentious two weeks of jury selection. Judge James M. Burke cautioned jurors that the case was not a referendum on the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment or women's rights. In narrowing down the jury pool, the prosecution accused the defence of ""systematically eliminating"" younger white women, who are more likely to be aware of #MeToo and possibly sympathize with Weinstein's accusers. In the end, seven men and five women were chosen. Six of the men and two of the women are white.  How educated the jury is in rape myths will be crucial in determining the outcome, Fitzgerald said. ""That's always what's critical in rape cases — the jury has to be willing and able to see through these things,"" Fitzgerald said. The flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, which followed a New York Times exposé in October 2017 that sparked the #MeToo movement, ignited an international conversation about women's experiences. But Fitzgerald says she doesn't think public awareness has progressed as far as people want to believe it has. Fitzgerald worked as a psychological consultant for Anita Hill and her legal team in 1991, when Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Fitzgerald called that moment the first great awakening for American society in the debate over sexual misconduct. She said after that, however, society forgot the lessons learned about women's experiences, and the issue fell out of the national conversation. But with high-profile stars now speaking out, she hopes there will be a more permanent reckoning with the issue on national scale.

256,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-05-06T11:36:21.452Z,Brothers have the same deadly disease but only 1 gets what their parents hope is life-saving treatment,"Two young brothers, both with a deadly genetic disease, could face two very different futures because only one has access to cutting-edge medication. Andre Larocque, 8, and his younger brother, Joshua, 6, have cystic fibrosis.   The relatively rare disease leads to the destruction of the lungs and an early death for most people who have it. There is no cure. Once lung function is lost, there is no way to get it back. ""When I put them to bed at night, I hear Andre go to sleep peacefully and then I hear Josh laying awake in his bed coughing himself to sleep,"" mother Sasha Haughian said during an interview from the family's home in the small Ontario town of New Tecumseth. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling of listening to that and knowing it's just gonna get worse."" Andre is on a medication called Symdeko through a drug trial, but Joshua wasn't selected for the trial and has no access to two similar Health Canada-approved medications. That's because the Ontario government doesn't fund the drugs for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients and his parents can't afford to pay out of pocket. ""It's a progressive, fatal disease ... we have medication right now that more than half the population [with cystic fibrosis] could benefit from, and we're not getting access to it,"" Haughian said. About 4,200 Canadians have cystic fibrosis. There are three gene-modifying drugs available — Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi — that are believed to slow down lung damage caused by the disease. Other treatments only ease symptoms. Access to all three medications is severely limited.  Unlike many other countries, Canada does not have a special process for evaluating drugs for rare diseases. Clinical trials for such drugs are limited by their small pool of potential participants. This makes proving a drug's effectiveness more difficult — which makes convincing provincial governments and private insurers to cover the cost for patients more unlikely, health advocates say. ""It's a heartbreaking situation ... These are symptoms of a larger issue, which is essentially our system was not built to evaluate and fairly assess drugs for rare diseases,"" said Kim Steele, director of government and community relations for Cystic Fibrosis Canada.  Haughian and her husband, Jamie Larocque, say Symdeko has been a life-changer for Andre since he started taking it in January 2018. While he can run around and play hockey with his friends, his younger brother's condition is deteriorating.  ""When we first found out Andre was accepted for the trial, we were so excited,"" Larocque said. ""And then after a couple days, I realized, 'Oh wait, Josh has nothing.' Now that it's been over a year, we're really starting to see Andre just shoot ahead and Josh falling behind, and that's tough."" The family and their doctor believe Orkambi would change that. But the family can't afford the annual cost of $250,000. Their private health-care plan won't pay for it either. They are desperate for Ontario to cover the medication for their younger son. They say the criteria for who qualifies for coverage are too strict.  The medication is only funded for children between the ages of six and 17 who are really sick for a long time — it's called the ""exceptional cases"" criteria. To qualify, a patient must show that they lost 20 per cent of their lung function for a six-week period over the course of six months. That's the standard in three provinces — Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The other provinces and territories don't cover the drug at all and no province funds the drug for adults. Under the rules, less than two per cent of children with cystic fibrosis qualify for Orkambi coverage in Ontario, according to Cystic Fibrosis Canada. And Joshua isn't one of them.  The Ontario Health Ministry says it has not received any requests for coverage since the introduction of the exceptional cases criteria on Feb. 20. The board that recommends whether medications should be publicly funded is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). It's made up of representatives from the health-care system, academia and the public. It decided there wasn't enough evidence of therapeutic value to recommend governments cover Orkambi, but provinces aren't bound by CADTH's decisions.  Steele says a lot of good medications are rejected for coverage because the testing criteria are designed for drugs that treat more common diseases and can be evaluated in large clinical trials. ""We can't do that in small populations. And so, often when our evidence goes to the table for government to look at, they say there's not enough evidence. And our problem is there's not enough people to give you the evidence that you want."" Then there is the cost.  ""It's expensive,"" Steele said. ""I'm not going to shy away from saying price is definitely a concern. However, it's very hard to put a price on life."" The three cystic fibrosis drugs are priced at about $250,000 a year in Canada. But Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society, which advocates that patients with the disease should have access to any medication their doctor prescribes, says that doesn't reflect what the real cost would be if Canada did a better job negotiating with drug companies. He points to other countries where the drugs are available for less than half that price.  The problem, he says, is Canada does not negotiate prices with drug companies until the end of the CADTH review, so many drugs end up being rejected for coverage because of cost. In some cases, provinces won't negotiate at all, or they go it alone instead of negotiating on a national scale and buying in bulk to lower the cost. ""Canada is an outlier. We're the only developed country that either doesn't have a deal, or isn't negotiating a deal,"" MacLeod said of Orkambi. ""Quite frankly, I think it's bureaucrats that have become so baked in the system that they've lost perspective."" Meanwhile, Canadians like Joshua Larocque go without the medications they need, he said. ""It's shameful. Absolutely shameful."" MacLeod is also a lawyer and is heading up a class action lawsuit against the B.C. government, federal government, CADTH and others over the lack of funding for Orkambi. The suit claims governments are ""denying access to lifesaving drugs in a very non-transparent, non-evidence-based manner."" None of the allegations has been proven in court. In an email to Go Public, B.C.'s Ministry of Health said CADTH recommended Orkambi not be funded due to a lack of evidence on two separate occasions.  ""These recommendations are based on clinical and cost factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""And with Vertex setting the cost of Orkambi at $250,000 a year per patient, its cost is unsustainable for public and private drug plans."" In an email to Go Public, a CADTH spokesperson said that over the past five years, the agency has taken steps to clarify and enhance processes to address the unique challenges of evaluating drugs for rare diseases.  Andre and Joshua's parents have repeatedly reached out to Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott.  In October, the family asked for a meeting with Elliott. They said they were told by her office it would happen. They're still waiting to hear when, and their followup messages have gone unanswered.  As opposition health critic, Elliott criticized the government at the time for not funding Kalydeco, one of the three gene-modifying cystic fibrosis medications. The drug was later added to the coverage list in Ontario, but few patients qualify. It's a similar story with Orkambi. In February, Ontario agreed to fund the drug on a case-by-case basis under what's called the Exceptional Access Program. So far, not one cystic fibrosis patient has qualified for provincial coverage under the program's criteria, said MacLeod.   Watch: Elliott challenged the Liberal government to cover Kalydeco several years ago when she was Opposition health critic. The minister turned down a request for an interview with Go Public and didn't respond to specific questions we sent about Joshua and Andre's situation and about access to the cystic fibrosis medications, providing instead a general statement from a spokesperson.  ""Young Ontarians with rare diseases deserve every opportunity to enjoy healthy and happy childhoods,"" spokesperson Hayley Chazan wrote in an email to Go Public.  ""Orkambi, which helps treat pediatric cystic fibrosis, is currently considered for funding in Ontario in exceptional cases … consistent with clinical evidence."" Joshua and Andre's parents are still hopeful the federal government will deliver on a 2019 federal budget promise to implement a rare disease strategy that could help people like Joshua. The family believes Andre will continue to get access to Symdeko indefinitely. The trial is to test the medication on younger children and track it as they grow. It's already approved by Health Canada for children ages 12 and older. Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes both Orkambi and Symdeko. It tells Go Public it has no plans to ask CADTH to review Symdeko for provincial funding, saying the present system for assessing drug coverage in Canada ""has challenges.""  When asked why the cost of Orkambi is so high, Vertex didn't answer, but Cystic Fibrosis Canada says developing medications for rare disease is expensive because the market for them is so small. ""That leaves Symdeko and the other drugs coming down the pipeline completely inaccessible,"" Haughian said. ""Without a proper rare disease strategy for evaluating drugs in place, there is not much incentive for drug companies to even try to develop drugs for rare diseases."" She and her husband worry their younger son will never get the medication he needs. ""I fear Joshua will spend his childhood getting sicker, living in and out of the hospital, needing more and more treatments, and ultimately dying young,"" Haughian told Go Public in an email after the interview, because she didn't want her sons to hear about her fears. ""While Andre is out playing hockey and hanging with friends … and as he gets older and understands more and more, the 'survivor's guilt' he could potentially feel is a dangerous thing.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

257,Anonymous,2020-01-18T17:14:33.959Z,Protests close Louvre museum in Paris amid pension strikes,"Dozens of protesters blocked the entrance to the Louvre museum and forced the famous Paris landmark to close Friday while they denounced the French government's plans to overhaul the pension system. Protesters later chased down President Emmanuel Macron at an evening theatre performance in northern Paris. Video showed protesters chanting and some entering a door as surprised police tried to hold them back. A black car reportedly carrying Macron then sped away under a hail of boos. An edgy tension marked the day as small but determined groups of protesters moved into action to make their complaints against pension changes heard. It was the 44th day of strikes aimed at overturning the plan. The protesters at the Louvre, who included some museum employees, staged the demonstration against Macron's proposals after several hard-left trade unions appealed for public actions to oppose a plan that they said would ""lower everyone's pensions."" The museum's Leonardo da Vinci exhibit marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master's death was included in the closure. Some protesters chanted, ""Mona Lisa is on strike, Leonardo is on strike."" It is the first time since railway strikes and protests against the pension overhaul began on Dec. 5 that the Louvre and its da Vinci exhibit were fully shut down. About 30,000 people visit the museum every day. Some videos on social media showed angry visitors booing at museum protesters to express their disappointment. Some of those shut out of the Louvre were upset, while a few interviewed expressed solidarity with the strikers. ""I think it's fine if they want to protest but they shouldn't block the plans of the people who have flown over here to see an exhibition of Leonardo,"" said Ben Garrett of Dallas. Gerhard Jehle of Germany, who had bought his ticket in advance, shared that view, and said he was ""badly informed about the extent of the strike."" ""I don't understand how this happens,"" Jehle said. ""Public transport doesn't function. The unions have to be controlled with an iron hand."" Argentinian Marcelo Campano, who also had a ticket, said that he understands workers' bid to confront a government they perceive as ""neo-liberal ... So we'll show our solidarity and come back another day."" The action at the Louvre was one of several signs of mounting tensions among strikers. Several dozen people on Friday invaded the headquarters of the CFDT union, which is favourable to a point system Macron wants to put in place to determine retirement benefits. The invaders were seen on video singing and mocking the union's leader. Macron condemned the action as violent, unacceptable and ""shameful for our democracy."" In a more playful bid for attention, dozens of lawyers opposing the president's proposed pension reforms put on a dance show in Versailles wearing their black robes. Unions have called for a seventh round of street marches next Friday, when the contested pension plan is to be presented to the cabinet. The weeks of strikes and protests have hobbled public transportation and disrupted schools, hospitals, courthouses and even opera houses and the Eiffel Tower. Major French retailers Fnac Darty and Casino said that business in France has been badly affected by the strikes, especially during the holiday season. Fnac Darty said the strikes cost it around 70 million euros ($101 million Cdn) in lost revenue. Casino cut its forecast for earnings growth in France, where it does more than half its business, to five per cent in 2019, from a previous 10 per cent. The company estimates that the strikes in December cost it about 80 million euros ($116 million Cdn) in lost revenue. Shares in both companies were down by more than five per cent. The prime minister's office said earlier this week that the SNCF train authority and the RATP, which runs public transport, had lost over a billion euros since the start of the strike. Trains have suffered most, so far losing some 850 million euros ($1.2 billion Cdn). While the number of striking workers has diminished since the movement, the country's trains and the Paris subway were still disrupted Friday. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/pension-protests-shut-down-louvre-1.5432132,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/40-days-of-strikes-show-french-fondness-for-revolution-over-reform-1.5430839 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-strike-1.5399580,N/A
258,Ashley Burke,2020-01-23T12:20:02.986Z,'Alone and lost': Family of Canadian killed in Ethiopian air crash says government 'abandoned' them,"A Toronto mother and father whose daughter died in a plane crash in March say they're heartened by what Ottawa is doing to support victims of the more recent downing of a plane in Iran — but they still feel they were abandoned by their government. Clariss and Chris Moore are haunted by the death of their daughter Danielle, 24, in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. They accuse the federal government of not doing enough to help them and other victims' families through the aftermath. They also question why Ottawa didn't immediately ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 in the wake of another deadly crash in October 2018 off the coast of Indonesia. The two disasters killed 346 people. Just days after the crash in Ethiopia, Canada announced it was grounding all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft and banning the jet from entering its airspace until further notice.  ""I feel so alone and so lost,"" said Clariss. ""I feel that we were abandoned. It took 10 months for our Canadian government to even have a meeting with us. ""We ended up scrambling on our own when the accident happened ... Our government didn't do anything for us."" Their daughter was headed to a meeting of the UN Environment Assembly when the aircraft plummeted shortly after takeoff, killing everyone aboard, including 18 Canadians. Chris said he's calling for a public inquiry to learn why Canada didn't ground the 737 Max immediately after the first tragedy.  ""We want to have some answers and we're not getting them now,"" he said.  ""We want to have the same type of transparency for this crash that the prime minister's asking for from the Iranian government. We want to have the same kind of accountability as well."" The federal government told CBC News it has learned from the recent tragedy in Iran and is committing to being more transparent and open with families of plane crash victims. The federal director general for civil aviation met with families of the Ethiopian air crash victims on Jan. 8 for four hours to answer questions. Transport Minister Marc Garneau plans to meet with families of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims and ask them directly what additional support they need. Canada is handling the loss of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 in Iran earlier this month in a manner quite different from its approach to past international plane crashes involving Canadian victims. One of the major differences is the fact that Iran admitted it shot down the plane. The prime minister is publicly pressing Iran to let Canada help actively investigate the crash to make sure it's a thorough and transparent process. And Canada maintains diplomatic ties with Ethiopia, while it hasn't had a diplomatic mission in Iran since the Tehran embassy closed in 2012. Without an embassy on the ground, the government itself has been providing consular support, mental health services and legal aid, and has offered the families of the victims of Flight PS752 $25,000 for every deceased passenger to help cover their expenses. Liberal MP Omar Alghabra, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, also announced this week the government will match donations made to the Canada Strong Campaign to support victims' families. The Moores said that, other than consular help, they received none of the support being offered to the families who lost loved ones in Iran. Chris Bittle, Garneau's parliamentary secretary, told CBC News the government will do better moving forward. ""If we look at these two tragedies, there are differences, but we know the loss and the pain that the families are experiencing are the same,"" he said. ""We need to be better in terms of openness and transparency with the families."" The Moores, meanwhile, describe the government's offer of more face-to-face meetings as ""insulting,"" since they're coming so long after the event. When PS752 went down, Clariss said, it felt like an echo of the day her daughter died.  ""My whole body jerked,"" she said. ""I feel so sick. I feel their pain. I feel their confusion, their denial, their shattered life, their nightmares."" She said she still wonders what was going through her daughter's mind as the plane went down. ""Was she calling us? Was she calling me?"" Chris said dealing with the bureaucracy involved in a loved one's death in a foreign country has been ""very difficult."" ""There's so many different little minor things, but each minor thing is major from our perspective,"" he said. ""Because you have to relive everything again."" It took the family at least four months to get a death certificate from Ethiopia. When the document arrived, parts of it weren't in English — which meant translators were needed to process government paperwork, book a funeral home and settle Danielle's estate. While the Canadian embassy in Ethiopia helped arrange for the families to visit the crash site, Clariss said it ended in disappointment: they only had 30 minutes on the ground. ""They took us from the site,"" she said. ""That was not enough for me, that I fly from so far away and travel so far away."" The task of claiming Danielle's belongings was especially painful. The couple sifted through an online database of photos of items recovered from the crash site; to claim each individual item they had to prove to authorities that it belonged to their daughter. On what would have been Danielle's 25th birthday, an envelope arrived with her shoes inside — black flats she would have worn to the conference she was supposed to attend. The Moores still can't bring themselves to open that package. The Moores also described the process of bringing their daughter's remains home as ""dehumanizing."" Clariss said that as she stood at the airport with her son, next to the tiny coffin containing the few human remains that could be found, she was left with almost no time prior to boarding to absorb the moment and collect herself. ""My heart stopped,"" said Clariss. ""I wanted to open that coffin to see her face. To lift her up. To comfort her. To hug her."" With little government support, the Moores leaned on other 18 victims' families for help and comfort.  The Moores said together families started requesting meetings with Canadian officials this summer to learn what the government knew about the Boeing 737 Max before their daughter's death. The government, preparing for an election at the time, went into caretaker mode until the new cabinet was introduced at the end of November. The day after the crash in Iran, Nicolas Robinson, the director general for civil aviation, met with families of the Ethiopian air crash victims for four hours and answered questions. The meeting had been arranged with families ahead of time. Chris Moore said he wasn't satisfied with the answers they got about what Canada knew after the Indonesian crash. ""They were very secretive,"" he said. There are two ongoing safety investigations into the Ethiopian Airlines crash taking place in Ethiopia. U.S.-based Boeing is also facing a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department and is being sued by the families of some of the people who died in the crashes. Transport Canada is working with other civil aviation authorities around the world to co-ordinate allowing the 737 Max to fly again. Boeing will be required to make changes to the design of the jet and/or training and procedures of flight crew before the planes can return to service, according to Garneau's office.  In a statement to CBC News, Garneau said he ""knows that maintaining open lines of communication with families is essential going forward."" ""That is our priority,"" he added. ""As minister, I will not lift the flight restrictions on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 until we are fully satisfied that all safety concerns have been addressed by the manufacturer and the FAA and that enhanced flight crew procedures and training are in place.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ethiopian-airlines-crash-2019-update-downing-iran-plane-1.5433988,[],N/A
259,Anna Desmarais,2020-01-23T15:05:15.057Z,Hay River to host N.W.T.'s 1st Arctic Winter Games archery trials,"Twenty archers in the Northwest Territories are set to compete in Hay River this weekend for a spot in the Arctic Winter Games' first archery competition. Archery isn't an official sport of the games, but it could become one. The Arctic Winter Games International Committee is interested in incorporating other events, so for these games, for the first time, they approached a host city about their regionally important sports.  Ian Legaree, the technical director of the Arctic Winter Games' International Committee, said Sport Yukon and members of the Whitehorse Host Society in 2017 recommended adding archery and freestyle skiing to the 2020 sports roster. Legaree said the board chose to add archery because both small and large communities were interested in the sport. No one had recommended archery prior to 2017 because, as Legaree put it, it's still an emerging sport across Canada.  In an email to CBC News, a spokesperson for the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games confirmed that this will be the first time for archery in the games. So far, five regions out of nine have said they will be sending a team of archers to Whitehorse, including Northern Alberta, the N.W.T, and Yukon.  Greenland and the Yamal region of Russia will also send archers to this year's games. The N.W.T.'s team will be decided this weekend, after archers compete for the highest number of points over two rounds. Athletes at the trials will shoot 30 arrows each per round (known as a 300 round). The closer they get to the bull's-eye, the more points they get. Athletes will also be evaluated on their attitude and coachability.  At the Arctic Winter Games, the archers will compete over multiple days in individual and mixed team events, followed by a head-to-head elimination round.  Over the last eight to nine years, archery has been rising in popularity in the N.W.T., said Aaron Wells, executive director of Aboriginal Sports Circle NWT. To boost participation in the sport, the Aboriginal Sports Circle has held archery workshops in partnership with schools and gym teachers in all 33 N.W.T. communities.   This is not the first time the territory has sent archers to important sporting events. N.W.T. archers have participated in the North American Indigenous Games for at least a decade, and last year, four young archery athletes represented the territory for the first time at the Canada Winter Games.  Wells said archery has roots in Indigenous communities in the North — hunters used it to sustain their families.  ""There's always been some sort of interest in … bow hunting for generations in the territory,"" he said. Wells said the expected turnout of 20 athletes for this weekend's trials in Hay River is a good starting point that could show the international community that there's interest in archery.  Archery has been tentatively selected as a sport for the 2022 Arctic Winter Games in Wood Buffalo, Alta.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-archery-trials-nwt-1.5437084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/n-w-t-archery-tournament-takes-aim-at-growing-the-sport-in-the-north-1.4710270 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-dog-mushing-future-northwest-territories-1.5364048,N/A
260,Éric Grenier,2020-01-23T09:00:00.978Z,Quebec is up for grabs in the Conservative leadership race — and it's a prize worth grabbing,"Jean Charest is out — which means Quebec is wide open in the Conservative leadership race. And with every member's vote in the province likely to carry a disproportionate weight, it's a vacant playing field that every candidate will want to occupy. The roster of contestants for the Conservative leadership is far from final. But the list of names it won't include is getting longer. On Wednesday, former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose ruled herself out. In an interview with Radio-Canada on Tuesday, Charest — the former Quebec premier and leader of the Progressive Conservatives in the 1990s — said he would not mount a bid for the leadership. Charest likely would have had lots of appeal in Quebec, as well as the ability to sign up a significant number of new members there. But with Charest now ruling out a run, the race could end up with no candidate from Quebec among the top contenders. The two Conservative MPs with the highest profiles in Quebec — Alain Rayes, Andrew Scheer's Quebec lieutenant, and Gérard Deltell, a former journalist and the last leader of the Action Démocratique du Québec (before it dissolved itself into Premier François Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec) — already have ruled themselves out. Richard Décarie, a former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper, is working on a leadership bid as a social-conservative candidate. He's from Quebec — but the province's aversion to social conservatism will limit his appeal there. Pierre Lemieux and Brad Trost, two social conservative candidates, together took just nine per cent of the vote on the first ballot in Quebec in 2017's leadership race. So Quebec could be a political vacuum that the other candidates have to fill. They would be wise to try — because Quebec's party members offer a lot of bang for the buck. All 338 ridings across the country carry equal weight in the Conservative leadership vote. Each riding is worth 100 points, and those points are distributed according to each candidate's share of the vote. In other words, the candidate who wins 10 out of 20 votes in one riding ends up with the same amount of points as the candidate who landed 1,000 out of 2,000 votes in another riding. Ridings with lower numbers of party members offer candidates a chance to do a lot with a little. The last leadership race offered a good illustration. Nearly 29,000 Conservative members living in Alberta cast a ballot in 2017 — an average of 848 members in each of Alberta's 34 ridings. In Quebec, meanwhile, there were just 9,669 voting members spread out across the province's 78 ridings — an average of 124 members per district. Every vote in Alberta was worth an average of 0.12 points. Every vote in Quebec was worth 0.81 points — nearly seven times as much. Even these numbers were skewed by the regions of Quebec that had a higher concentration of members, such as the West Island of Montreal or runner-up Maxime Bernier's Beauce riding; Beauce alone was responsible for over 1,000 votes. The 34 ridings in Quebec with the fewest members delivered a total of 1,600 votes in the 2017 leadership race — an average of 48 per riding. Each vote cast in those seats was worth over two points apiece. He may or may not end up being the main beneficiary, but former cabinet minister Peter MacKay can take some credit for this voting system. It was one of the conditions of the merger that created the modern Conservative Party. MacKay, as leader of the Progressive Conservatives at the time, insisted on it — and he's defended it at party conventions ever since. If MacKay does emerge as the winner, strong results in Quebec could prove to be decisive. The former Nova Scotia MP might not have as much support in places like rural Ontario and in Western Canada — where there are lots of Conservative Party members and where the old Reform Party and Canadian Alliance had significant support. But it isn't clear yet which candidate is best positioned to become Quebec's top choice. A recent survey by Abacus Data suggests that every candidate still has some way to go. The poll, conducted Jan. 16-17 with a sample of 302 respondents in Quebec, found that 46 per cent of respondents there did not know enough about MacKay to have an opinion. That figure rose to 63 per cent for Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre and 72 per cent for both 2017's third-place finisher Erin O'Toole and fellow Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu. About 13 per cent of Quebecers said they had a positive impression of MacKay, compared to 11 per cent who had a negative one. That split was six to eight per cent for Poilievre and five to three per cent for O'Toole. Considering the small sample size, this suggests no one is likely to have the inside track in Quebec from the get-go. The endorsement of Quebec's 10 Conservative MPs will be highly coveted. They did appear to make a difference in 2017, with those of Rayes and Deltell being among the most valuable. Winning Quebec won't be important just for the contestants in this leadership race — it also will likely be a major factor in determining the eventual winner's chances of becoming the next prime minister. Conservative support in Quebec collapsed after Scheer's poor performance in the first of two French-language debates in October's federal election campaign, significantly reducing the party's chances of forming government. Conservative members motivated by a desire to avoid a third consecutive loss likely will be asking themselves which of the contenders can make the most gains in Quebec. Charest showed some promise on that score. The candidate Quebecers settle on as their next best option will have a leg-up on the competition.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-quebec-1.5434633,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,N/A

Addressing his Liberal caucus this morning as MPs meet for a two-day strategy session ahead of next week's return to Parliament, Trudeau said the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) — also known as NAFTA 2.0 — will be the Liberal government's top priority. ""I look forward to debate on this in the House, I look forward to committees doing their work. But we need to make sure that we move resolutely and rapidly to put into reality this new NAFTA deal that is so good for Canadians from coast to coast to coast,"" he said. Trudeau said millions of Canadian jobs depend on free trade with the United States, and stressed the need for predictability for Canadian businesses. Trudeau just wrapped up a cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, where he announced that a bill to approve the deal will be tabled on Wednesday. Other priorities for the Liberal government include introducing legislation to expand medical assistance in dying (MAID), new gun control measures and steps to tackle climate change. After being reduced to a minority, the Liberal government must have support from another party to pass legislation and the federal budget. Trudeau said the takeaway from the election results is that Canadians want the government to work with other parties to ""make it work"" in the minority context. ""Bickering, grandstanding, petty politics — none of these things create jobs. They don't make anyone's retirement safer or our environment cleaner,"" he said.

At a council meeting on Monday night, the elected members voted unanimously to limit the number of rooms landlords can rent to four, but there are some exceptions. ""Over the last few years, we've been getting quite a few complaints from our residents,"" said Mayor Laurie Boucher. ""We were asked by the community to try to do something about it. And what we decided on as a council is, 'Can we limit the number of rooms that are being rented?'"" The answer is both yes and no. The new lodging home bylaw only applies to new home or ""lodging"" construction. Landlords who already own homes and rent out to multiple tenants will be unaffected. There are more than 90 old Victorian-style homes, with multiple units inside, in the downtown area of Antigonish that will be ""grandfathered in,"" or listed as legal/non-conforming. Boucher said those landlords will continue to be allowed to rent as they choose, but the new bylaw will require they be registered with the town, which will trigger a fire and safety inspection. Boucher said that should address the concerns of students who have complained in the past of living in unsafe buildings. As for neighbours who complain about party houses, Boucher said council is trying to balance their concerns with those of landlords and students. ""Being a university town, we absolutely need places and residents for our students to live. In September, our population doubles in size,"" she said. ""But it's our due diligence to make sure that people in our community are safe and that people have the right to live in their homes and communities without being disturbed. ""We have two bylaw officers that are very knowledgeable within the town and know what's going on.""

266,Rafferty Baker,2020-01-23T00:44:06.404Z,Police working with U.S. art students for fresh clues in 47-year-old Chilliwack mystery,"RCMP are hoping some help from students at the New York Academy of Art will bring in fresh leads to a nearly 50-year-old cold case in Chilliwack, B.C. The case goes back to Sept. 18, 1972, when a man was found dead on a sandbar on the Fraser River near McSween Road. According to Cpl. Mike Rail with RCMP's Upper Fraser Valley Regional Detachment, the case went cold after investigators failed to identify the man or to find any indication that something criminal had led to his death. Earlier this month, RCMP based in Ottawa began a collaboration with the New York Academy of Art, in which 3D-printed skull replicas from 15 cold cases in B.C. and Nova Scotia — out of a total 700 cold cases across the country — were sent to students taking part in a forensic sculpture workshop. The students carefully placed clay over the skulls, beginning by sculpting the muscles, and then the other tissues on top. They used various anatomical markers to determine how features such as ears would be positioned. Now police in Chilliwack are hoping one of those reconstructions helps somebody recognize the unidentified man. ""The goal is to find closure,"" said Rail. ""To provide answers to a family who, for 47 years, has not had an answer to where a loved one was."" Little is being released about the man. Rail said he was 18 to 35 years old when he was found dead, meaning he would be 64 to 82 today. He had brown hair, brown eyes and his teeth had been cared for, said Rail. The man was wearing grey canvas size 10 running shoes and grey wool work socks. Police aren't releasing the cause of the man's death, but Rail said he could have perished anywhere within a large part of the province, given that he was found along the Fraser River. Thirteen other cases are posted on the RCMP's missing persons website, with images and details. All the unidentified remains were found in B.C.  This week another case that was involved in the reconstruction project was identified in Nova Scotia, but investigators say DNA analysis can be credited in that case. The man's identity hasn't been released. Police ask anyone with information about this case to contact their local police detachment. Do you have more to add to this story?

267,Elizabeth McMillan,2020-01-21T21:26:33.948Z,Former N.S. lieutenant-governor says racial profiling 'alive and well',"Former Nova Scotia lieutenant-governor Mayann Francis says the arrest of a black woman in a Walmart last week in Halifax has left her shaken and even fearful of police for the first time. Last week, officers arrested Santina Rao while she was shopping with her baby and toddler. She suffered a broken wrist and numerous bruises and is now facing charges of causing a disturbance, assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest. ""I just went into this deep sense of 'Oh my heavens, we are gone back 100 years,"" Francis told CBC Nova Scotia's Information Morning. Francis served as lieutenant-governor from 2006 to 2012 — the only black Nova Scotian to hold the position — and has spoken out before about racial profiling she said she faces in retail stores in the province. She said a video clip showing police on top of Rao ""scared"" her and brought to mind Viola Desmond, the black woman who was dragged from a New Glasgow, N.S., movie theatre in 1946 for sitting in the whites-only section. Rao has said she paid for electronics in one section of the store and stopped in a toy aisle on her way to ring in some produce that couldn't be weighed at the checkout where she made her first purchase. She said police believed she was concealing items and that when she became upset they cuffed her without explaining why she was being arrested. She was not charged with theft. Chief Dan Kinsella on Monday called the situation ""disappointing"" and said he has referred the case to Nova Scotia's police watchdog. On Tuesday afternoon, the Serious Incident Response Team announced it will be investigating the incident. The Halifax Examiner has posted a video of part of the arrest. The incident has left Francis thinking about what would have happened if she had been accused of shoplifting. ""What if they called and the police came and surrounded me? Would my fear cause me to do something that I would not normally do? Would I show ID if they asked me to? I don't know,"" she said. Francis said the incident's timing is particularly bad because it makes people question Halifax Regional Police's recent apology for street checks, a now outlawed practice that disproportionately targeted black men. Being followed through stores is something with which Francis said she's all too familiar. As a black woman, she said she doesn't have the option of putting things in reusable bags because she has no doubt a staff member would pull her aside. She employs her own strategy of keeping her hands out of her pockets and avoiding opening her bags. ""I just do all of that so that I don't add to the suspicion of being a black woman, which is very stressful,"" she said. ""I'm treated like 'Why are you in this store? You're not welcome.'"" Recently, Francis said she couldn't avoid taking something out of her bag but she did so reluctantly.  ""I just said a little quick prayer and I pulled the backpack off,"" she said. ""So this is what I go through because I don't want to go through what happened at Walmart. ""Look at our own backyard. Canada, Nova Scotia. Racism is alive and well.""

268,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:50:56.319Z,Presidential inaugural committee 'blatantly' enriched Trump family: D.C. attorney general,"The District of Columbia is suing U.S. President Donald Trump's inaugural committee and two companies that control the Trump International Hotel in the nation's capital, accusing them of throwing parties for the Trump family with non-profit funds, and overpaying for event space at the hotel. The city's attorney general, Karl Racine, said the inaugural committee had been ""blatantly and unlawfully abusing non-profit funds to enrich the Trump family."" The lawsuit, announced Wednesday, alleges that the committee abused non-profit funds and co-ordinated with the Trump family to ""grossly overpay for event space"" in the hotel. The committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. It was the latest allegation that Trump and his family have used public and non-profit funds spent at Trump-owned properties to enrich themselves — part of the peril of Trump not fully withdrawing from his businesses while he is president. Trump has maintained ownership but turned the reins over to his adult sons, who have bristled at the charge that they are profiting off their father's presidency. The suit alleges the committee co-ordinated with the hotel's management and members of Trump's family to arrange the events and that committee staffers knew they were paying prices that were ""grossly above market rate"" but didn't consider less expensive alternatives. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million US to host events celebrating Trump's inauguration in January 2017. But the committee's spending has drawn mounting scrutiny. ""District law requires non-profits to use their funds for their stated public purpose, not to benefit private individuals or companies,"" Racine said. ""In this case, we are seeking to recover the non-profit funds that were improperly funnelled directly to the Trump family business."" Prosecutors found that Rick Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who flipped on the president during the special counsel's Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms. One of the event's planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, Gates and Ivanka Trump, according to the lawsuit. Ivanka Trump is the president's daughter and a senior White House adviser. Those concerns included a written warning that the price proposal was at least twice the market rate. But Gates went through with it anyway, at a cost of $1.03 million, the suit says. Our lawsuit alleges the Committee and Trump entities:<br><br>❌Improperly funneled nonprofit funds to the Trump family business <br><br>❌Failed to seek out fair market value for event space and services rendered <br><br>❌Used nonprofit funds to throw a private party for President Trump’s family In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was ""a bit worried about the optics"" of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said. Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to first lady Melania Trump who played a leading role organizing the inaugural parties, had also told Trump, when he was president-elect, and Ivanka Trump that she was uneasy with the offer, Racine said. Winston Wolkoff later followed up with an email to Gates and Ivanka Trump warning that the hotel's proposal was at least twice the market rate, Racine said. Prosecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didn't consider those options. Gates pleaded guilty to charges tied to his lucrative political consulting work in Ukraine and was sentenced last month to 45 days in prison, a punishment that a judge said reflected the extensive co-operation Gates had provided to the Justice Department. Racine's office said investigators did not directly speak with Gates as they pursued the suit. A lawyer who represented Gates for the criminal proceedings didn't immediately return a message seeking comment. The White House didn't immediately return a message nor did the Trump Organization. The suit contends that the hotel went against industry practice and refused to discount the space, and double-booked its largest ballroom with a different organization that was still affiliated with the inauguration, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. Both organizations were non-profits, but the breakfast paid $5,000 for the ballroom. The committee, however, paid $175,000, the suit claims. Prosecutors say the committee also used non-profit funds to throw a private party on Jan. 17, 2017, the night of the inauguration, for Trump's family — a $300,000 affair. The reception was for three of Trump's children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric. ""There will be an after party at the OPO [Trump Hotel] following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric,"" Gates wrote in an email to Ivanka Trump, according to the suit. DJT is a reference to Donald J. Trump. Event staff within the inaugural committee recognized this would not be a proper use of committee funds and had tried to cancel this event, according to the suit, but Gates and the Trump family went ahead anyway. Racine said his office focused on the inaugural committee and the companies that profited because investigators believe that's the best option for them to possibly recover the funds. Racine had been sending subpoenas for months related to the investigation. The inaugural committee was also being investigated by New York and state authorities in New Jersey, who are looking into, among other things, whether foreigners illegally contributed to the inaugural events.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dc-lawsuit-trump-inauguration-1.5436074,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/federal-prosecutors-subpoena-trump-inaugural-committee-1.5006016 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sam-patten-sentence-dc-1.5095972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/politics-trump-foundation-dissolution-ny-1.4950304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-foundation-charitable-funds-pay-back-1.5391499 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mueller-report-other-investigations-1.5072407 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/dc-gates-sentencing-1.5392707,N/A
269,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-28T19:29:08.530Z,"Senior evicted from mental health facility, left to live in tent with rats","Judy Trask can barely sleep at night — curled up in a tent hidden in the bushes of a Victoria, B.C., park, worried that rats will attack, or worse, that she'll be raped. The 65-year-old ended up homeless, she says, after she was given two hours to pack what she could carry and get out of an apartment operated by a government-run mental health program. In March, according to Trask, staff sent her onto the street to fend for herself, handing her only a ""street survival guide"" to get by: a brochure that lists the locations of soup kitchens, 24-hour washrooms and homeless shelters. According to the eviction letter, Trask was kicked out of the mental health treatment facility after staff decided the program wasn't working for her, saying the senior was verbally aggressive and threatening toward staff. ""I mean my God, they think you're just human cattle,"" said Trask, who says she suffers from suicidal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Trask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. She was sent there from another facility in the Comox Valley, more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria, after that program underwent cutbacks, she said. The senior has no ID — it was stolen —and no family that can help. She often doesn't take the mood-stabilizing medications she needs.  She's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria public parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring. While Vancouver Island Health's motto is, ""Excellent health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,"" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham told Go Public the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency shelters ""as a last resort."" She said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database tracking exact numbers. Bloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but said Island Health ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services. Trask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay. Trask is part of a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilities that can result in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges. ""Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,"" he said. That adds pressure on overburdened emergency services across the country. Trask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela — a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre — after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent. ""It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her body when I found her,"" said Tudela.   Tudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification. Trask ended up going back to her tent that night. ""What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,"" Tudela told Go Public. ""That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that … with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'"" In September,  police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors of homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.  She says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a park in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated. Tudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask. She says no one responded. Although the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is ""a very frail woman."" ""She's all about 110 pounds,"" Tudela said. ""She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm."" Mental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in Canada on any given night — and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness. ""There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,"" said Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg. He says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues. He worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings. The AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, N.B. It found that the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. The study, published Oct. 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind using the Housing First model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term. WATCH | Judy Trask shows housing advocate  Carolina Tudela her tent in a Victoria park: Without stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for. ""Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,"" Distasio told Go Public. Go Public put Trask's situation to Canada's first provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken. ""For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,"" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. ""Our government is working to change this."" Darcy says the B.C. government plans to build 2,200 affordable housing units and expand access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit. As for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street. ""You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,"" says Tudela. ""The system is broken … I don't understand the coldness of it all.""

270,Yvonne Colbert,2020-01-22T10:00:25.075Z,Why that cheap flight price in Canada might actually be in U.S. dollars,"Jane Wasson is still trying to figure out how an Air Canada flight booked last year in Canada, to fly across Canada, was billed in U.S. dollars and included some U.S. taxes. But Air Canada said the answer is simple — she was using the U.S. site, where the charges are clearly shown in American dollars and there's a small U.S. flag at the top of the home page. The airline stressed she paid the same fare as she would have on the Canadian site, once the currency conversion was taken into account. But Wasson thought she was paying in Canadian dollars and got a shock when the exchange rate kicked in. ""When you booked online there, was no indication that you were paying in American dollars,"" she said. ""There was none at all."" In August, Wasson sat down at her home computer in Minto, N.B., and booked a September round-trip flight on Air Canada's website, www.aircanada.com, for her husband to fly from Fredericton to Kelowna, B.C., with stopovers in Toronto on both legs. The cost was $801.14. It wasn't until she received her credit card statement in September that she saw Air Canada charged her $1,063.55 for the ticket — an additional $262.41. She contacted the Air Canada call centre, but said the customer service rep was as mystified by the charge as she was. Wasson was advised to file a complaint, which she did. She also called her credit card company to dispute the charge. It was removed. However, Air Canada maintained she owed the full amount, so the $262.41 charge was placed back on her account. Wasson received an acknowledgement of her complaint from Air Canada, followed by a generic response in November that didn't address the issue, but offered her a 15 per cent discount on another flight within the next year. She said she has subsequently booked other Air Canada flights and was charged in Canadian dollars. ""As soon as I learned through my credit card [that I was charged in American dollars], I went back ... but I haven't been able to duplicate the American charge,"" she said. She also doesn't understand why there was a U.S. flight segment tax and a U.S. transportation tax applied to the ticket for flights that were only in Canada. This isn't the first time an Air Canada passenger has been charged in U.S. dollars. In December 2018, B.C. resident Doreen Hucal said she was billed in U.S. dollars when she booked her flights on the Air Canada app. At the time, Air Canada said Hucal was using its American website, even though Hucal insisted she was using the app. In July 2017, the Competition Bureau issued a news release urging people to double-check the type of currency being used by companies online. It referenced purchases including furniture, clothes, jewelry and travel packages. It said some websites don't clearly identify which currency they are using, and that the dollar symbol could represent either Canadian or American dollars. ""Ensuring that you are shopping on the company's Canadian website (with an address ending in "".ca""), or selecting Canada as your country of origin can help, but it does not guarantee that the price shown is in CAD,"" said the news release. CBC News contacted the Competition Bureau to ask whether it has received complaints about airlines charging Canadians in U.S. dollars, how many complaints it's received and which airlines were involved. But the Competition Bureau said it wouldn't answer those questions because it's required by law to conduct its work confidentially. In an email to CBC News, an Air Canada spokesperson said as an international carrier, the airline sells tickets to people around the world and flights can be purchased in several currencies. ""Aircanada.com has pop-ups asking customers to confirm their country the first time they visit it or if users have not visited the site in a while,"" Pascale Dery wrote, adding customers should always check to ensure they are on their preferred site. Dery said the country is clear because of the flag at the top of the page, and changing countries and currency can be done by simply clicking on a tab. ""Customers are advised several times during the booking process of the currency they are purchasing in, including prior to completing their purchase,"" Dery added. CBC Halifax used the U.S. site to start booking a trip and it did clearly show the charges in U.S. dollars. CBC then cleared the cache of the computer and attempted to book again on the following day, which yielded a pop-up message that said, ""You are about to open the aircanada.com edition for UNITED STATES, but it looks like you're located in or your previous selection was CANADA."" Dery said that message isn't a new feature, but Wasson insisted there was no pop-up on her reservation. Meanwhile, Dery said all tickets are fully refundable within 24 hours of purchase, so customers should check the itinerary receipts sent to them at the time of booking to ensure everything is OK. Air Canada said it's willing to refund the $16.80 US flight segment tax to Wasson and has provided a link for her to submit her claim.

271,Holly Gordon,2020-01-22T21:02:12.027Z,"'Women are still missing in the music industry,' updated 2020 study reveals","While the numbers are slightly better this year compared to last, the message is the same: ""women are still missing"" in popular music in 2020. In its third update of the now annual study, titled ""Inclusion in the Recording Studio?,"" the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative looked at the Hot 100 Year-End Billboard charts and the 2020 Grammy nominations to see how women fared on the gender parity scale, comparing this year's numbers to last year's study, as well as their full data range from 2012-2019.  In the January 2020 version of the study, the Initiative concluded that ""women are still missing in the music industry,"" with women representing less than one-third of all performers and 12.5 per cent of songwriters across 800 songs, with women accounting for 2.6 per cent of producers across 500 songs.  But there were minor improvements toward gender parity in the study: the percentage of women artists in the 800-song sample increased over 2019 after a two-year low, jumping to 22.5 per cent from 2018's 17.1. (The biggest year in the study's record was 2016, with 28.1 per cent, while the lowest was 2017, at 16.8.) This year's study also showed that the ratio of men to women producers is 37 to one for 2019, while it was 47 to one in 2018. This year, like last year, artists of colour were well represented, with 56.1 per cent of the artists coming from ""underrepresented racial/ethnic groups"" — Drake being the top performer, with 37 counted songs. But the study also concluded that ""women of colour are invisible as producers,"" as only eight out of 1,093 producing credits went to women of colour. While the study showed that the gender gap at the Grammys continues, this year's numbers hit an eight-year high for women nominees (20.5 per cent in 2020), with women most likely to be nominated in the best new artist and song of the year categories. Categories like producer of the year, where only one woman has been nominated in the last eight years (Linda Perry, in 2019), and record or album of the year, where less than 10 per cent of nominees are women, continue not to improve significantly. ""While these shifts are small, collective action takes place when multiple companies, in multiple positions of gatekeeping, take action,"" Dr. Stacy L. Smith, the Initiative's founder and director, told Billboard. ""We're starting to see change."" In March 2018, two months after the inaugural USC Annenberg study, the Recording Academy established the Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion — the same year that Lorde was the only woman nominee in the record or album of the year categories, and shortly after then Grammy president Neil Portnow said women needed to ""step up"" in order to fix the #GrammysSoMale trend. It aimed to address diversity and inclusion at the Grammys, releasing a report with 18 recommendations in December 2019. Two years later, the numbers are slightly higher but the Grammys are facing more scrutiny: Deborah Dugan, former Grammys CEO, alleged this week that she was ousted from the Recording Academy after reporting sexual harassment and pay disparities, among other complaints, in the Grammys' nominations process. Dugan was placed on administrative leave last week, after six months as CEO.  The 2020 Grammy Awards will take place on Jan. 26.

272,Alyssa Leippi,2020-01-22T10:00:00.296Z,My genes are stacked against me; it's made me a fighter,"Growing up, cancer for me was something that old people got. I lost my maternal grandmother before I even got a chance to meet her, my paternal grandfather by the time I was six and my paternal grandmother at 13.  It wasn't until my mother was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 48 that it became real: this disease doesn't just hit elderly people. My mother's cancer was a rare one: hemangiopericytoma, a type that can be dormant for long periods of time. She went through brain surgery, radiation and lost the vision in her left eye. She ultimately kicked that cancer in the butt.  But it wasn't long after that my mother's cousins were diagnosed with cancers of their own — all three before turning 55. All of their mothers had died from cancers similar to the ones they were now diagnosed with. The similarities were too much for one of my cousins who worked in the healthcare field. With the help of her doctor, they figured out that Lynch Syndrome runs in my family. Join CBC Saskatchewan's Sam Maciag for the January edition of The Novel Idea Society book club. This month, we'll be reading Daughter of Family G: A Memoir of Cancer Genes, Love and Fate by Ami McKay, which deals with the topic of Lynch Syndrome. Lynch Syndrome gives the carrier a genetic predisposition to a laundry list of different cancers, meaning there's a mutation in their genes that makes them more likely to become ill. And it's hereditary.  Lynch Syndrome can be identified through the same genetic testing process as the breast cancer BRCA gene test, which has surged in popularity since Angelina Jolie came out about her genetic history.  It wasn't helpful that my entire family is in Ontario, where the high population causes more roadblocks to testing.  Here in Saskatchewan, it starts with your family doctor, then testing in Saskatoon. When you start genetic testing, you have a counselling session to prepare you for the information you could find out. I feel like my attitude of ""it's not 'if,' it's 'when'"" prepared me for this meeting. Since my mom was diagnosed the first time I truly believed that it was an ""I will get cancer in my lifetime"" situation.  I also had made the decision early in my life that children were not for me, so having a hysterectomy or mastectomy wasn't a major concern. These are preventative surgeries that you can have if you are positive about your genetic makeup, to help you with your chances of avoiding the cancers that affect these organs.  I've taken a different approach, though. At the same time my cousins and mother were going through their genetic testing, I stumbled into an online test group with a health and fitness professional, which led me to understand more about how diet could play a role in my health and my fight against cancer.   My mother was diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer during this time of discovery. This was a hard one. The accessibility to information that the Internet provided wasn't always a benefit to her mentally during this fight. It provided her with a black hole of information, very little of which was positive. I was also an adult this time around, which gave me more insight into what was going on. Seeing her struggle through the fight the second time really pushed me to start researching ways to make my body somewhere cancer doesn't want to grow. Knowing what is in my family history has given me two options: either cause me to live in fear or push me to educate myself on what I can do to give me the best chance to live a long life. I personally have chosen option two and used it as a way to help others succeed in their lives. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

273,Anonymous,2019-12-20T17:00:00.792Z,"I worked hard to raise a feminist daughter, but her racy online selfies make me feel I failed","This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage. For more information, please read our FAQ.   To some, ""feminist"" is a label that every empowered woman and progressive man should wear proudly. It is not controversial — it stands for the idea that every woman is a complete human being. Women are not less than men. Women deserve equal pay, equal say and equal rights in any society.  To others, ""feminist"" is a problematic term because of the biases and expectations that accompany it. Within the world of women, a feminist can be rejected as such for not following certain rules or can find herself scrutinized for failing the movement — because a feminist is expected to look a certain way, speak a certain way and live a certain way. Here are two conflicting views of what feminism means today, as told in this point-counterpoint by one Montreal mother and her teenage daughter.  I don't think expecting my daughter not to post sexed-up selfies amounts to 'slut-shaming': Jennifer Morrow Last summer, I stumbled onto my teenage daughter's social media account. What I found confirmed my worst fear: I had failed to raise a feminist.  There, among the pouty-faced selfies, was a photo of her posing, Sports Illustrated-style, on a jet ski in her bikini, brandishing her middle finger at the camera with a smirk on her face. My heart sank.  ""Who is this person?"" I asked myself. All her life, I've tried to model feminism: taking her on marches for women's rights, reading to her from books like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should all be Feminists and surrounding her with a community of strong, independent female friends.  I realize now that the wisdom of my mother's ""Women's Lib"" generation doesn't cover the challenges of raising a feminist daughter in the 21st century.  Indeed, most young women seem so put off by the identity politics that come with calling themselves feminists that they're rejecting the label altogether.  ""What's the big deal?"" Clara asked me when I confronted her about the offending photo. ""It's just a picture."" Where do I start?  As I write this, 14 beacons of light are shining in the night sky over Montreal, in memory of the women killed in the Polytechnique shooting.  They are stark reminders that our daughters are still vulnerable to violent men who will do whatever it takes to keep women silent and subservient.  Feminism seeks to create a new world where that isn't the reality they face.  My daughter believes a photo of herself sitting on a jet ski in her bikini represents girl power. But it actually just looks like the media has poisoned that message entirely and used it to perpetuate the status quo.  We want our girls to grow up brave, confident and assertive.  But they are drip-fed gender-conforming, sexualized images to the point where they think it's perfectly normal to strive to meet male-defined expectations of them — the more performative and sexy the better.  What is the point of these images? The question answers itself, and I find the porny subtext deeply disturbing.  Girls like my daughter can afford to be ambivalent about feminism. They live in a society that is relatively safe for girls, especially if they are privileged and white. As far as she is concerned, my pontificating about the need to fight gender stereotypes is just an old-fashioned demand to cover up her body — also known as slut-shaming. What is a mother to do? Ever since I first held her in my arms, all I wanted was for her to be happy and safe. This thing called feminism is a complicated gift.  One day, when she's out of the house and I can't hold her daily, I hope she will unwrap this complicated gift and find what she needs inside — the tools to navigate an even more complicated world while staying true to herself. 'Would a boy be punished for looking too sexy?' asks Clara Morrow-Coffrant When my mother confronted me with the pictures on my Instagram, I thought ""What's the issue? It's not that big a deal.""  I told her that everyone posts photos like this. Also, it's not like this is anything new to our society. For example, Barbie is a hypersexualized children's toy that is given to girls as a sort of role model. Yes, she now comes in more shapes and colours, but we still think of her as having a perfect body and perfect blond hair. My mother thinks I'm too young to be putting this sort of image online, but I am not ashamed of it. What I, as a young woman of 15, post on social media doesn't define me. It is not the whole of who I am.  Am I a feminist? I don't know. The fact is that feminism today is much too difficult to define because everybody has a different perspective on what it means.  Of course, I believe in equality, but you are putting all the burden on me to police my self-expression in the interest of feminism — something I don't completely understand and can't get a real definition of.  Would a boy sitting on a jet ski be punished for looking too sexy?  Anyway, statistics show that my personal safety doesn't depend on what I wear. I also think that people are much too quick to judge a girl based on how she looks. You can judge me if you want to, I really don't care. My posts are for me and my friends. They are meant to be funny and ironic. It's not that deep. It's not political.  Instagram is just for fun. I'm still young, and I am allowed to make a few mistakes as I figure out who I want to be. This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage.

274,Shane Magee,2020-01-23T09:00:00.931Z,"Moncton, Dieppe break building permit records as construction booms","The skyline tells the tale: new buildings are popping up across the Moncton region thanks to a construction boom that's seen record-setting building permit values amid an increasingly competitive residential housing market. ""We have some pretty impressive stats,"" Moncton Mayor Dawn Arnold said at a city council meeting Monday.  ""We're shattering building permit records … We've got cranes every direction we look, and we are, as has been said, the economic engine of the province."" Across the metro area, new hotels and apartment buildings are rising as large new commercial and industrial buildings are built or expanded. John Wishart, CEO of the Greater Moncton Chamber of Commerce, called it ""a nice collision of metrics"" leading to economic growth. Building permits worth $378 million were issued in Moncton, Dieppe and Riverview last year, the municipalities reported. The building boom comes as residential vacancy rates continue a multi-year decline and rent costs rise. That can make it harder to find an apartment, particularly one that's affordable. The region's residential vacancy rate fell from 2.9 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in October 2019, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The low vacancy rate has prompted developers to build homes and apartment buildings. ""You just have to look around Dieppe, Riverview and Moncton to see the amount of building complexes going up, and the majority of them are apartment or condo buildings,"" Nadine Fullarton with the Moncton Northeast Construction Association said in an interview.  The organization represents general contractors, trade and sub contractors and suppliers to the construction industry. Fullarton said members of the association have reported a 30 to 40 per cent increase in developers offering contracts for apartment and condo buildings. In 2019, Moncton issued building permits for 16 new apartment buildings with 727 units, 68 new single-unit homes, and 114 duplex units.  Combined, residential permits accounted for 37.7 per cent of $257.4 million in building permits issued last year, a new city record. Last year was also record-setting for Dieppe, where permits worth $96 million topped a $90 million record set in 2016. Dieppe's figures include permits for 314 new housing units, though the largest single permit was for the city's new arena complex. In Riverview, the town issued permits worth a total of $25 million, shy of the 2015 record of $29 million.  All of the construction activity means steady employment for people in the construction industry, Fullarton said. It's meant a shortage of workers in some trades that prompted the organization to plan a national and international recruitment campaign. The region's immigration strategy calls for 2,700 to 3,500 immigrants per year by 2024 to sustain economic growth and fill jobs.  Wishart said there are downsides, including the increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment from $698 in 2018 to $732 in October 2019. ""If you're bringing jobs to the community and you need to find housing for them, that is becoming difficult, especially for families,"" Wishart said. ""Maybe it's a good problem to have, but I'm not sure we can build (housing) fast enough and or at the right types."" In recent years, monthly home sales reports from the Greater Moncton Realtors du Grand Moncton have described the region's housing market breaking records. Parise Cormier, president of the association, called it a sellers market. The inventory of homes on the market has hit a 15-year low, which she said has resulted in some homes getting multiple purchase offers. ""Prices are slowly creeping up, but we don't have markets like you see in bigger cities,"" Cormier said. The average price for a single-family detached home in Greater Moncton stood at $197,600 in December 2019, up 4.6 per cent from a year before and 18.9 from five years earlier. Cormier said while the association representing realtors doesn't have firm data, anecdotally they're seeing a lot of people moving from more expensive markets in Canada.  A home selling for about $200,000 here would sell for about $1 million or more in Oakville, Ont., she said.  ""A lot of people are coming back home, a lot of people are retiring here, a lot of people coming here to start a family,"" Cormier said. ""We have a better quality of life, we see a lot of immigration and our employment is pretty steady."" But rising prices and increasing rents also make the city less affordable for those with a low income. Moncton has struggled to deal with people who are homeless. Lisa Ryan with the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee told CBC in December that there needs to be a stronger push to build more affordable housing.  ""When we see developments coming into our community, or no policies attached to that, we need to get brave at saying this is wrong,"" Ryan said.  On Monday, Moncton council ratified a new policy to be implemented later this year that could allow developments with affordable housing to move through the city's approval process faster. The decline in vacancy rates isn't limited to residential housing.  Ian Franklin, a vice-president with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Atlantic, said the office space vacancy rate downtown is ""quite low,"" around four per cent. ""There's obviously a need for more office (space) downtown,"" he said. But he said he's not aware of any firm plans for new office buildings over the next two years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-dieppe-construction-vacancy-rates-housing-1.5436533,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-construction-permits-development-1.5315065 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/charles-leblanc-moncton-fire-department-homeless-tent-city-1.5298120 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-council-downtown-development-1.4949560 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-greater-moncton-riverview-dieppe-1.5093986,N/A
275,Benjamin Shingler,2020-01-22T14:52:53.093Z,"'We want to be part of the solution,' Grand Prix president tells inquiry into sexual exploitation of minors","The head of Montreal's Grand Prix sought Tuesday to defend the annual auto race from charges that it drives sexual exploitation and human trafficking, while at the same time signalling he is open to seeking new measures to crack down on the problem. ""We want to play a role, and we did start to play a role,"" said François Dumontier after testifying before a provincial commission examining the sexual exploitation of minors.  ""We want to be part of the solution."" Dumontier described the three-day event held every June in Montreal as the ""most important tourism event in Canada.""  He stressed, however, that the Grand Prix organization doesn't control everything that happens over the course of the event, which takes over much of downtown. Many of the events, he said, aren't organized by the Grand Prix itself.  ""There's so many things going on in the city that we don't know about. We learn those events sometimes at the last minute and most of the time I would say that it's not the image that we want to the Grand Prix to have to or to receive,"" he said. Still, Dumontier said he recognized the race must play a role in raising awareness among patrons and working with police to prevent sexual violence.  Before last year's Grand Prix, police asked taxi drivers and hotel workers to contact authorities if they spotted a possible case of sexual exploitation. The program is called RADAR — a French-language acronym meaning ""identify, act, denounce, help and restore."" Eve Paré, the director of the Association des hôtels du Grand Montréal, said her industry, too, is taking steps to address sexual exploitation. Hotel staff have been instructed to look for signs of trafficking and prostitution, she told MNAs at Tuesday's hearing. Such signs might include a young girl accompanied by a much older man, clients who insist on paying cash, and clients who repeatedly ask for their linens to be cleaned. ""It's all about training and making sure they are on alert at all times,"" Paré said.  Groups advocating for sex workers have argued such initiatives will render sex workers more vulnerable by driving the industry further underground. The head of Stella, a Montreal-based sex worker organization, delivered that message once again Tuesday. Sandra Wesley, Stella's director, called into question the purpose of the commission itself and questioned what she said were the assumptions that sex workers are helpless, abused by men and unable to make their own choices. She also said that, in her own group's experience, the vast majority of sex workers are over 18.  A preliminary report released by the commission last year cited a study that found four out of ten Quebec victims of sexual exploitation are minors.  The commission held a first round of hearings in Quebec City in November.

276,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-19T10:00:00.694Z,Late fee to renew medical licence in N.S. frustrates doctor,"A physician who is licensed in Nova Scotia says the timelines and late fees for licence renewals are another barrier to recruiting doctors to the province. Dr. Ajiri Ikede, a Dalhousie University graduate who works in Ottawa, maintains a licence in Nova Scotia to keep his options open. It's common for physicians to have licences in multiple provinces. Licences for Nova Scotia doctors expire each year on Dec. 31 and the annual fee is $1,950. Ikede incurred a late fee of $487 for paying his fee after Nov. 30, but before the end of the year. ""I said, 'How can I be late on something that hasn't expired yet?' And they said, 'Well, that's our policy as long as you don't meet our renewal window,'"" he said. Ikede compared it to home or auto insurance, and said it would be unacceptable to charge late fees early. It's up to each province's medical college to set rates and renewal rules. In New Brunswick, a licence is $600, but the late fee is $200. Ontario also charges a 25 per cent late fee, but that kicks in after the licence expires. Newfoundland and Labrador is the only other jurisdiction that charges a late fee before a licence expires. Ikede admits he was repeatedly warned by email that his fees were due. He's been licensed in the province since 2010 and never missed the deadline before. ""Imagine if you got an email the first week of November knowing that your licence is good till the end of the year,"" he said. ""That's not going to be on the top of your priority list of the other 150 emails you get that day."" Ikede isn't alone. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia said about 100 other physicians were issued a late fee this year. It said the late fees add a layer of protection for patients. ""Our legislation requires that a physician's licence is suspended if not renewed by year end,"" it said in a statement. ""When this happens, the first week of January may have cancelled surgeries or closed clinics or emergency departments."" Last year, more than 500 physicians renewed on the last day before the late fee took effect, the college said, while the remaining 100 were charged the $487 fee. ""These 100 physicians would have had their licences suspended by force of law, and patient care would have been interrupted dramatically,"" the statement read. Ikede said he understands the necessity for deadlines, but said the 25 per cent fine is extreme. He said it took five minutes to renew his licence online. ""The college is getting almost $50,000 every year just from late fees collected in the month of December,"" he said. ""That seems like a lot of money to me to be collecting and when you consider that the removal process is pretty much automated."" Ikede said he's so frustrated that he plans to stop renewing his licence in Nova Scotia. The college said it will waive Ikede's late fee and review the ways it communicates with physicians in the future.

The community's South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. appeared before the legislatures's Health and Social Development standing committee Wednesday. South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. has invested in a medical office in its community centre and is offering a doctor who wants to set up there a year's free rent and all the medical equipment in the centre for free. It's also been advertising independently to recruit a doctor, and that has run it afoul of Health PEI policy. ""Health PEI directed us not to use the word Crapaud. They wanted to do their own advertising and they have the position advertised as all of Queens west, which would include Charlottetown,"" said Lisa Gallant, secretary for South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. ""That concerned us because we don't want to see medical services being moved out of our rural area into an urban center."" In an emailed statement to CBC News, Health PEI said it is its policy not to advertise for individual communities. ""We advertise physician positions based on network or county,"" the statement said. The agency said it has been working with Crapaud to find a doctor, and intends to continue to do so. It noted while no doctor has established a permanent practice in the clinic, four doctors have been seeing patients there at walk-in clinics. ""We appreciate the community of Crapaud's concerns and desire to ensure residents of the South Shore region have access to health care services,"" the statement said. ""Our discussions with community representatives have been meaningful to date and we look forward to continuing those conversations in future."" But Gallant said while Health PEI has told South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. it is supportive of its plans, the advertising restrictions suggests something else. ""When they tell us we can't use the word Crapaud in our advertising I think that sends a strong message to the contrary,"" she said.

The Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (OSDCP) allows low-income seniors to visit a dentist for free, but the paperwork and few approved dentists mean there's a lengthy wait. The program was announced in June 2019 but only launched the application system at the end of November. For Rogers Villeford, he's already spent six months with bleeding gums — and just last week another filling fell out.  ""I've had this for about six months ... every day I bleed,"" said Villeford. ""I take mouthwash and keep it in there awhile and swish it ... every morning I spit out blood.""  Villeford's income is about $18,000 a year. He was accepted into the OSDCP, but the appointment he was given is nearly two months away.  ""What good are [the dentists] if you have to wait?"" said Villeford. Locally the OSDCP is run by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. According to the director of health promotion, dentists under the program started seeing patients two weeks ago.  ""Our first senior seen under the program was Jan. 6,"" said Nicole Dupuis.  Dupuis said so far the program has seen about 15 patients, with another 46 appointments already booked. Appointment bookings are as far away as March. According to Dupuis it takes about one month between filling out the application to receiving a card that gives you access to the program. After the card comes in, seniors can book an appointment — but the first appointment is typically just a consultation.  ""We'll have more appointment times going forward,"" said Dupuis. ""We have had a wait list in our clinics ... a month is actually not too bad. We hope it won't get too much longer beyond that time frame."" Villeford decided he can't wait that long, so he made an appointment with a dentist — but he'll have to pay out of pocket for his treatment.  ""I don't want to lose my two front teeth,"" said Villeford, who expects to spend about $500 on the visit. ""It's a sham."" Similar to the Healthy Smiles Ontario program, there is an emergency service that might be available for people who need immediate treatment. To get emergency dental care, seniors would have to fill out a form signed by their medical provider that states they need treatment right away.  Villeford said the WECHU gave him an emergency appointment for Tuesday, but it won't include any work like fillings. Instead it will be to address what the health unit might consider are more serious problems.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/seniors-dental-program-ontario-windsor-teeth-1.5433138,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-government-regular-dental-care-seniors-1.5366082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/senior-dental-program-windsor-essex-1.5134955 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/windsor-essex-health-unit-budget-2020-lean-1.5347818 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/dental-problems-out-of-emergency-rooms-more-funding-ontario-dental-association-1.5002474,N/A

It was the first chance for people in the city to buy food since eastern Newfoundland was hammered by a powerful winter storm and stores remained closed under a state of emergency. On Tuesday — the fifth day of a state of emergency in St. John's — the city amended its restrictions to allow grocery stores and pharmacies to open until 6 p.m. The City of St. John's announced on Tuesday evening that shops can operate the same on Wednesday, with the addition of taxis being allowed to take to the streets full time. ""We've been outside since about quarter after nine, but I'm not sure how it will be for the people at the end of the line,"" said customer Holly Delaney. ""People are still being really calm and helpful, and no one is being mad or upset."" By 11 a.m., some locations had begun closing doors and turning people away to clear out the lineups inside the store. Pat Griffin, who was waiting in line for an hour outside the Stavanger Drive Dominion, said employees quickly started turning people away — shouting from the doors it would be a five-hour wait inside before they could check out. Some people waited 2½ hours inside the stores to reach the checkout. Staff members at Sobeys handed out water to customers while they stood in line. The city told people to get enough food to last 48 hours, suggesting the state of emergency will continue as crews clean up after a record-smashing blizzard on Friday. Pictures from inside a different Dominion location show a picked-over dairy aisle. In the snack section, the chips had been mostly reduced to Cheetos and corn chips. Donna Robbins described the lineup as ""madness,"" and said you couldn't even force your way around the store. ""You just had to stay behind and wait until you got your turn to get your hands into the cooler to pull out something,"" she said. ""Basically it's just grab and go."" Joe White was at Bidgoods, a small grocery store in the Goulds neighbourhood of St. John's, with his wife before the store opened. He figured it would be past 11 a.m. before they got inside. ""By the end of the day there won't be anything left [in] any of the stores anywhere in St. John's,"" White told CBC Radio from the parking lot. Before the doors opened at Costco, about 200 people were already in line. David Hurst, who works for a hotel in downtown St. John's, was on the hunt to feed both the hotel guests and staff.  ""Milk for cereal, bread for sandwiches … and some supplies to make a nice pot of soup,"" he said, laughing. As residents piled onto narrow, snowy streets, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary pleaded with people to carpool and find ways to limit traffic on the roads. ""We want to avoid having a gridlock occur,"" said Const. James Cadigan. ""The roads are still very much in the process of snow removal."" At least seven cab companies in St. John's did their part to curb the amount of traffic on the road, offering to drive people back and forth to the store for free. The City of St. John's said they are all on standby for seniors and people with mobility issues after the city lifted a ban on taxis during the state of emergency. Blackmarsh Road Dominion is on wheels... oh boy. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/snowmegeddon2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#snowmegeddon2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/JwWzHX8Uys"">pic.twitter.com/JwWzHX8Uys</a> Mayor Danny Breen stressed it was only for people who couldn't otherwise get to the store. Tom Lambe, manager of City Wide and Bugden, said the cab companies were happy to help. ""This is for people that don't have a vehicle or people, like the elderly, who need to get out and get groceries and a bit of medical supplies, or drugs, medication. They can give us a call,"" Lambe said. Stores around the city prepared for a hectic day, in some cases placing limits on products, such as Coleman's rule of two loaves of bread per person. At a Sobeys on Merrymeeting Road, hundreds of people were ready to file into the store before it opened. Milk, eggs and bread were at the top of most grocery lists.

Fresh produce might become an issue as its shelf-life is shorter than other items. There also might be a shortage of chicken, as the stores' primary source is St. John's-based Country Ribbon, which has been closed for the last few days. Sobeys had two of its three distribution centres open and were scrambling to restock shelves as fast as possible ahead of Tuesday morning. ""A big problem, obviously, is the amount of snow in our loading docks and loading bays, so we have been working with our dedicated snow removal team to get those cleared,"" said Sobeys spokesperson Violet MacLeod. Coleman's also had staff at its locations on Monday night in anticipation of the influx of traffic in the morning.

Trudeau, speaking at a news conference after a three-day cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, said pushing forward with the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is the government's most pressing priority, as millions of jobs depend on the new trade pact. ""On Monday, we will present a ways and means motion, and on Wednesday we will table legislation to ratify the deal,"" he said. With a minority government, the Liberals need support from another party to pass legislation in the House. Trudeau expressed the hope that all parties will negotiate and come together on ratification. ""On NAFTA, those discussions will of course engage and activate as we accelerate, as we move forward with the ratification process in the House,"" he said. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on his government's plans for ratification of the revised NAFTA ""What we are doing is reminding everyone in the House and across the country of how important it is to secure the most important trading relationship for future generations."" Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen said that while her party is ""the party of free trade ... we expect the Liberals to provide for proper due diligence by allowing Parliament to study the impacts that the deal will have on important sectors of our economy, such as auto, agriculture and aluminum."" NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh also said New Democrats want to see the fine print. ""How can Canadians trust the Liberals to get this right when they spent months saying they had the perfect deal and mocked us for saying it needed to be changed?"" Singh said in a statement released by his office. ""Now they're trying to take credit for changes they said were impossible. ""[Canadians] can count on us to look carefully at this agreement. We're going to discuss it in caucus and in the debate in the house and see if it actually delivers for Canadians."" Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said his caucus members won't agree to swift passage of CUSMA unless they're convinced it's a good deal for Quebec. ""If Mr. Trudeau expects of us to go against what are obviously the best interests of the regions of Quebec, he will not be happy with my answer. It will be no,"" he said. ""There will be no fast-track, whatever it requires. It will not happen."" During the meetings in Winnipeg, cabinet ministers heard from expert guest speakers on the state of the economy, the fight against climate change and pressing global affairs. Ministers also drilled down on individual files linked to the government's top priorities. Ratifying the so-called NAFTA 2.0 — the trade deal known domestically as CUSMA — tops that list. ""This is an absolute priority, not only for the government but for our workers, our industries, people from all provinces,"" said Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez Monday. ""So I call upon the opposition to support us to make sure we ratify this as quickly as possible."" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who led the NAFTA renegotiation talks and is in charge of pushing it past the finish line, noted that the agreement was ratified by the U.S. Senate last week and by Mexico before Christmas. ""Now it's Canada's turn,"" she said, adding that debate and ratification of the agreement is crucial for ensuring stability in the Canadian economy. New legislation on medical assistance in dying (MAID) is also at the top of the Liberal legislative agenda. Justice Minister David Lametti said this week he plans to table a bill in February. While not offering details on when a bill might be on the way, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said new gun control measures are another key government goal for the session. The government continues to consult with various stakeholder groups, municipalities and law enforcement agencies in order to keep a campaign commitment to allow communities to control or ban handguns, and to prohibit military-style assault weapons. Blair said Monday that the legislation must be flexible enough to adapt to different needs across the country. ""We know that the environments in different parts of the country are varied, and it's important, I think, to make sure that the laws that we bring forward are effective in every place in keeping communities safe,"" he said. As the ministers were holed up in closed-door meetings, they were also dealing with other pressing external issues. Watch: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says balance is crucial when dealing with changes to medically assisted dying legislation The government responded to a request from Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball to assist in snow clearing operations after a massive blizzard. About 300 troops were deployed to the province. Also hanging over the cabinet retreat were questions about Iran's willingness to surrender the flight recorders recovered from the crash of Flight PS752 over Tehran, which killed 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada. Iran initially said it would release the black boxes to Ukraine or France, but recent reports suggest that may no longer be the case. Today, Trudeau said Canada continues to ""pressure"" Iran to turn over the black boxes to a third country, such as France. ""It is not simply a question of having the right experts in place to analyze the black boxes. There is the question of significant technological requirements that cannot be done in Iran,"" he said. ""That is why we are calling upon Iran to release the black boxes to a reliable third country that has the technological capacity and personnel to properly analyze those boxes."" Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne held a call Monday with the International Co-ordination and Response Group (ICRG) made up of representatives from Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom, the countries that lost citizens in the crash. In a readout after the call, Champagne said Iran had been co-operating with foreign experts in the investigation ""to date."" ""Members of the ICRG call on Iran to move the black boxes to a facility with all the technology and expertise required to quickly and reliably download and analyze the data without delay,"" the readout said.

282,Anonymous,2020-01-21T23:50:42.375Z,"Soaring rates of Indigenous people in prison 'unacceptable,' says federal watchdog","Read Story Transcript Indigenous people in Canada make up about five per cent of the country's population.  And yet, according to a new report by the Correctional Investigator of Canada, more than 30 per cent of people in federal custody are Indigenous.   That's up from 25 per cent just four years ago — and has the investigator, Ivan Zinger, calling the ""indigenization"" of Canada's correctional system a national travesty.  Zinger spoke with As it Happens host Carol Off. Here is some of their conversation. Over-representation of Indigenous people in federal prisons reaches 'disturbing' historic high You call the 'indigenization' of Canada's prison population ""nothing short of a national travesty."" What do you mean by that? What we note is that, when ... a man or woman who are non-Indigenous leave the penitentiary, that person — he or she — has been replaced by an Indigenous man or woman. We have about 14,000 men and women, who were incarcerated at the federal level. So that has remained stable for the last four years. But the profile of the inmate population has changed and we see, more and more, a larger proportion of Indigenous people being incarcerated. And that is, in my view, unacceptable. Another alarming number is 42 per cent of the female population in this system is Indigenous at this point. What do you make of that? I think it speaks to inequality on how the Indigenous communities are benefitting from socio-economic rights, cultural rights, political rights, Indigenous rights. Something is not working in the community in terms of our broad public policies. In many ways, we can take the profile of the prison population and use it as a barometer to gauge the success or failure of our broad public policies. So something is broken. What do you think is broken? We had the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. We had the Inquiry into the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women [and Girls] that gave us lots of clues as [to] what's broken. In my role as correctional investigator, I can tell you that when it comes to the administration of sentences, it's just not working. Indigenous offenders remain longer in jail than non-Indigenous offenders. They're more likely to be housed in higher security, where there are fewer programs. They are more likely to be subject to use of force to [be] placed in segregation — or now into the new structured intervention units. They're more likely to have their parole suspended or revoked. And these are all things that Corrections have control over. And the correctional outcomes are terrible. And the recidivism rates — and for example, in the Prairies, for Indigenous [it's] over 70 per cent. So it's a revolving door, and Corrections isn't contributing to public safety in the way that it should. And certainly based on the large investment that Canada is making on federal corrections. It's true they have no control over admissions, of who is sent to prison and for how long. However, it's called Correctional Services Canada (CSC) for a reason. It's supposed to offer services — rehabilitative services that would reduce the risk of reoffending. You know, issues like providing services for mental health, providing services for addiction and trying to de-affiliate people who are involved in gangs, et cetera. And those services are supposed to be tailored to the inmate population. And with respect to the Indigenous, we're not getting the the lower rates of reoffending that we deserve, based on the investment. You see in the report that the CSC, has tweaked the system to make improvements, but you say that it needs dramatic change. Can you give us some examples of the dramatic changes you'd like to see the government implement?  Corrections is exceptionally well-resourced. It's a ratio of 1:1. So for every prisoner, there's one employee of Corrections. We actually have 37 per cent of our penitentiaries that have more employees than inmates.  Those are staggering numbers, and if we are going to spend that kind of money, we do need to get outstanding correctional outcomes.  My organization, as well as the commissions on Truth and Reconciliation, the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women inquiry [and] parliamentary committees have all suggested to reallocate a significant portion of the services … to fund Indigenous communities and groups to provide for the care, custody and supervision of Indigenous people.

Born in Brockville, Ont., DeBlois is the writer, director, and executive producer of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. The third instalment of the trilogy has been nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature. The DreamWorks Animation film stars Montreal's Jay Baruchel as a now grown-up Viking named Hiccup, who embarks on yet another adventure with his dragon, Toothless. The star-studded cast includes the voices of Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill. The villain Grimmel is voiced by F. Murray Abraham. This isn't DeBlois's first rodeo, nor his first Oscar nod. He was also nominated for each of the first two instalments of How to Train Your Dragon, and he co-wrote and co-directed the Oscar-nominated Disney film Lilo and Stitch in 2002. So far, he hasn't brought home the hardware. ""I kind of know the drill a little bit, and I also know the disappointment of losing, so it's a measured excitement,"" DeBlois told CBC's Ottawa Morning.

DeBlois, whose father was a butcher, recalls having a steady supply of paper to doodle on in his childhood in western Gatineau's community of Aylmer. ""He would bring home these rolls of butcher paper which hung in a closet beneath the stairs, and I would just pull out sheets of it and draw all over. I was encouraged from an early start by my parents."" As he developed his skill, DuBlois said his main inspiration was a cartoon barbarian. ""I learned to draw from studying Conan. The anatomy was so ripped."" DeBlois studied animation at a summer program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont.

DeBlois said he's taken his mother to every Academy Awards ceremony he's attended.

284,Anonymous,2020-01-23T01:58:18.287Z,Canada's Larry Walker chooses Rockies over Expos cap for Hall of Fame plaque,"Canada's Larry Walker said his Hall of Fame plaque in Cooperstown will have a Colorado Rockies cap, not a Montreal Expos hat.  The Maple Ridge, B.C., native spoke with Hall officials after he was elected Tuesday in his 10th and final appearance on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot. Walker received 76.6 per cent, narrowly surpassing the 75 per cent required for induction by just six votes. ""I'm on cloud 9 right now,"" Walker told CBC's The National Tuesday night after the result was revealed. WATCH | Walker jokes about SpongeBob outfit: The former Colorado Rockies and Montreal Expos slugger is just the second Canadian elected to the Hall. Pitcher Fergie Jenkins of Chatham, Ont., was inducted in 1991. ""It's a hard decision, being a Canadian,"" Walker said of his cap choice. He added the key to picking the Rockies is that Colorado was ""where the majority of my damage was done."" The Hall makes the final decision after consulting with the player. Walker batted .381 with an 1.172 OPS and 154 home runs in 597 games at Coors and .282 with 229 homers and an .873 OPS in 1,391 games elsewhere, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. That left him at .313 with 383 homers and 1,311 RBIs overall. pitcher with a career record of 20-37. Asked whether he would be in the Hall if he hadn't raked in the thin air, he quickly replied: ""absolutely not."" ""I get it. Coors Field's a great place to hit. There's no backing away from that,"" he said. ""But I believe with that, I did it better than anybody else at that ballpark. So that had to be some consideration, I guess."" WATCH | Walker's journey to baseball began after end of hockey dream: Walker, the 1997 National League MVP, is joined in this year's induction class by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who amassed 99.7 per cent of the vote. Jeter fell short of a unanimous ballot by just one vote in his first year of eligibility. Walker, like Jeter, put on the cream-coloured Hall of Fame jersey. When he took the phone call Tuesday informing him of election, he was wearing a garish yellow-and-black SpongeBob SquarePants shirt. His 20-year-old daughter Canaan sent a text ""Way to go, dad. You're trending,"" he recalled. ""I knew we're going to go sit outside and hang out up front, so I just wanted something a little warmer,"" he said. The induction ceremony will be held in Cooperstown, N.Y. on July 26. Jenkins said he didn't expect to be hanging on to his status as the lone Canadian in Cooperstown for long. ""I was anticipating him being elected maybe five or six years ago,"" Jenkins said with a laugh. ""But I'm pretty happy for him. I know he's happy, I know his family is proud of him. ""He put up some really good numbers and he's well-deserving of the Hall of Fame."" Jenkins had already retired before Walker made his major league debut with the Montreal Expos in 1989, but he said he followed along from afar as Walker's career played out over 17 seasons. As the first Canadian Hall of Famer ever inducted, I couldn’t be prouder and happier to welcome my friend and fellow Canadian Larry Walker to the Hall! 🇨🇦 <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/halloffame?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#halloffame</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/Cdnmooselips33?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Cdnmooselips33</a> <a href=""https://t.co/Ve1VuGvlgO"">pic.twitter.com/Ve1VuGvlgO</a> The two first met in 2009 when Walker was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in St. Marys, Ont. Jenkins, who was inducted into that Hall in 1987, spoke to Walker after his induction and the two took a photo together — which Jenkins shared Tuesday night on Twitter in a congratulatory message for his countryman. Jenkins and Walker, despite a 24-year age gap, have similar stories when it comes to their early baseball days. Both initially dreamed of becoming hockey stars — Jenkins maintains he was ""a pretty good defenceman"" — and both were noticed by scouts as teenagers at a time before Canadian high school players were eligible for the MLB draft. Jenkins said the induction ceremony is likely the moment it will all sink in for Walker, and the moment his life will change. ""The biggest thing is you're able to put 'HOF' behind your name, and people recognize your career because of the fact that you're one of the best,"" he said. ""That's what Larry Walker is now — one of the best — and it's a nice thing to get that recognition for playing your career."" Walker hit an eye-popping .366 with a league-best 49 homers, 46 doubles and a career-high 130 runs batted in during his MVP season. His .452 on-base percentage that year, as well as his .720 slugging percentage, also topped the NL. Walker signed with the Expos as an amateur free agent as a 17-year-old in 1984, five years before Canadians were first eligible for the MLB draft. His shift to baseball came after Walker had been cut from a junior hockey team. Walker made his MLB debut in 1989 and played six seasons with Montreal before signing a free-agent deal with Colorado. He capped his career with 144 games over parts of two seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals from 2004 to 2005.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-baseball-hall-of-fame-induction-press-conference-1.5436265,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-baseball-hall-of-fame-induction-1.5434761 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-sr-reaction-hall-of-fame-1.5436032 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/mlb/larry-walker-reaction-baseball-hall-of-fame-1.5436160,N/A
285,Kory Teneycke,2020-01-23T09:00:00.675Z,It's Stephen Harper's party - and he'll do what he wants to,"This column is an opinion by Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for prime minister Stephen Harper, manager of the recent Ontario PC Party campaign, and currently a partner at Rubicon Strategy. Teneycke will remain neutral in the federal Conservative leadership campaign and has recused himself from work Rubicon is providing for the MacKay campaign. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Even five years after his defeat, the presence of Stephen Harper still defines the Conservative Party of Canada. In any other party it would be a bit odd for a past leader to be so dominant in the race to replace his successor's successor. But not in this one. Only 17 years ago, it was a much younger, more ideologically strident Stephen Harper who forged a new party from the shattered pieces of the PC Party (which had become an Atlantic Canadian regional rump) and the Canadian Alliance (Preston Manning's failed effort to rebrand the Reform Party). As a Reform Party staffer and later as a Member of Parliament, Harper had always been a hardliner. Critical of Manning for his lack of conservatism and dismissive of those advocating the need for the two right-of-centre parties to merge. In running for the Canadian Alliance leadership, he was full of bravado about the ability of the CA to best the PC Party electorally. But in what would become a telling sign of his future approach to governing (best described as pragmatic, conservative incrementalism), in 2003 Harper adjusted course and engineered the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. On matters of party discipline, Harper would sometimes in half-jest quote Louis XIV: ""l'etat c'est moi"" (I am the state). Harper wasn't just the first leader for the first half of its existence, he was the Party. And everybody knew it. Even in departure he continued to maintain a low-profile but powerful role as a director of the Conservative Fund – the body that holds the purse strings for party operations and campaigns. His recent departure from the Fund generated headlines and speculation. Some ""unnamed sources"" have alleged this was to free him to attack potential leadership candidate Jean Charest. It is unlikely that was ever true, but given Charest's decision to not enter the race, it clearly is no longer a motivation. Even if Charest had entered the leadership he would have had to kiss the ring of Harper's legacy, and adopt positions similar to those of Harper on a range of issues — including conservative cultural issues such as gun control. Harper doesn't need to campaign for or against anyone in the party leadership race. Every candidate will be attempting to claim some degree of ownership or continuance of the Harper record, and quietly intimating that they have his private approval. There is no path to victory running against Harper's legacy. The decision to leave the fund is more likely, as National Post columnist John Ivison suggested, an effort to sidestep Andrew Scheer's expense account scandal – of which private school funding is rumoured to be only the tip of the iceberg. Harper has a near anaphylactic intolerance for expense account abuse. While he did get criticism for charging his personal stylist to the Party, Harper's legacy governing is one of transparency. His reforms brought in pro-active disclosure of expenses for cabinet ministers and their staff. And back in Reform Party days he was the alleged source for blowing the whistle on then Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's use of party funds to fix his teeth and purchase bespoke suits. Regardless the reasons for his departure from the Fund, it makes no difference. It is still Harper's party. It is the electoral coalition that he built that is the foundation of the party – not just nationally, but in provinces like Ontario as well. Fundraising letters sent on behalf of the party bring in the most money when sent under his name. Most telling, numerous polls demonstrate Harper continues to be the most popular potential leader for the Conservative Party – by far. He would easily achieve a first-ballot victory if he chose to enter the race (which I predict he won't). Of course, the Conservative Party will need to evolve. It was a mistake for the Scheer campaign to run on a mildly updated version of the Harper 2015 platform. But at its core, the conservative electoral coalition is quite strong. And that is thanks to Stephen Harper.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A
286,Paul Palmeter,2020-01-23T12:44:40.090Z,Eagle watch draws birds and tourists to tiny Nova Scotia community,"If the eagles around Sheffield Mills could talk they would likely call Malcolm Lake the chicken man. When Lake pulls into the open Nova Scotia field with several dead chicken carcasses in buckets, dozens of large eagles can be seen in nearby hardwood trees anxiously awaiting his arrival. ""They know my vehicle and as soon as I get up there and open my door I can hear them begin to chatter away in the trees,"" said Lake. Lake collects dead chickens from several nearby poultry farms. After he throws the carcasses into the field the eagles keep their distance until Lake walks away. Then they slowly begin to approach the dead birds in the snow, before long dozens of eagles come out of the trees to feed. ""The most I've ever counted here was 92 eagles the week before last,"" said Lake. ""I've had up to 80 eagles here in the last seven days."" Lake feeds the eagles twice a day from late December to late March. He's excited for the 29th annual Sheffield Mills eagle watch which begins this weekend. ""It actually goes back to the '80s when the eagles were an endangered species in this county,"" said Lake. ""Back then the Nova Scotia government asked the farmers to throw out their dead chickens to give the juvenile eagles a better chance to survive the winter, the rest of the year they fend for themselves."" Last year eagle watch saw more than 5,000 people gather in the area to witness the majestic birds perform their amazing aerial displays as they descend on the field. Many of the visitors are amateur photographers who come from far away to see the eagles. Ron and Jane Todd are from Framingham, Mass. They honeymooned in Nova Scotia 40 years ago and this week they drove 12 hours so they could see the eagles up close. ""You don't often see something like this, so many bald eagles,"" said Jane Todd. ""We know we'll see something different each time."" The Todds are staying at a nearby bed and breakfast. Eagle watch is spread out over the next two weekends and has a big economic spinoff for the area. ""Eagle watch will bring in a lot of different people to the community that we don't normally see,"" said Jason deGraaf, who operates a local gas bar and convenience store in nearby Canning. ""It's going to be quite a busy two weekends for us."" The eagle watch festivities include pancake breakfasts and entertainment at the local community hall. All money raised will stay in the community. ""It's crucial for us, for our community hall, as it's our main fundraiser,"" said Meg Hodges, a member of the Sheffield Mills Community Association. ""It kind of keeps the lights on and the roof on and makes it available to our community, so without eagle watch we probably wouldn't have our hall.""

287,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-22T15:11:34.498Z,"As teen recovers from near-fatal accident, his family bonds with teen who struck him","As Alex Nelson lies in a dimmed room at the Saint John Regional Hospital, he grips a set of cream-coloured rosary beads.  They were a gift from Hanna Bordage, the 16-year-old girl who was driving the black Honda that struck him earlier this month near the corner of Prospect Street and Duncan Lane in Fredericton. ""Alex has not let go of it since,"" said his mother, Terri Taylor. The crash left the 18-year-old with a serious brain injury, and he spent days fighting for his life. ""I just keep trying to remind myself of the little bits of light through all this darkness,"" Taylor said. Although Taylor wishes she could go back in time and change what happened that day, she wouldn't take back meeting the Bordage family. The near-fatal crash on Jan. 8 sparked an unlikely friendship between the two Fredericton families, who otherwise might never have met. The families have supported each other in Facebook messages, a joint visit to the hospital where Alex is staying and a handwritten note about forgiveness. ""We're going to get through this together,"" Taylor said. Over the past two weeks, Taylor has used Facebook posts to keep family and friends updated on Alex's recovery from the crash. One of the posts asked readers to pray for the driver who hit him. That's when Hanna decided to reach out to Alex's family. She sent a Facebook message to Julia, Alex's 16-year-old sister. Hanna introduced herself and asked how Alex was making out in hospital and apologized over and over again for striking him.  ""She didn't mean to hurt him,"" Taylor said. The two families decided to finally meet in person. Hanna, her mom, aunt and grandmother met over the weekend at the hospital in Saint John.  ""You don't know what to say,"" said Hanna's mother, Joemana Bordage. ""You just know you have to be there."" Hanna sat outside while her mother went into Alex's hospital room. She wasn't ready to meet him face to face just yet.  Both mothers understood. When Alex's mother told him Hanna's mother had come to visit, he reached out and squeezed Bordage's hand.  Weak and unable to speak clearly, he whispered into his own mother's ear. He asked about Hanna. ""He is fighting for his life in a hospital bed and he is concerned about Hanna,"" said Bordage, who held back tears at the time. Then Bordage gave him Hanna's rosary beads, which she'd received after her baptism at six months old. He weaved the beads through his fingers. ""That's how we get through things,"" said Bordage. ""We pray.""' Hanna, a Grade 11 student at École Sainte-Anne in Fredericton, was driving home from school in a snowstorm on that day in early January. The newly licensed driver knew the roads were poor. And Hanna's father cautioned her to be careful and drive slowly — even if it angered other drivers. The teen even turned the music off inside her car to concentrate. The avid soccer player and straight-A student said she was driving 20 kilometres below the speed limit when she spotted a pedestrian walking in the same direction on the side of the busy street. There aren't any sidewalks in that area. She swerved into the median of Prospect Street — putting herself in danger — while trying to dodge the pedestrian, who was Alex.  But it was too late. Her car hit Alex and sent him into the ditch. Hanna immediately called 911. When paramedics arrived, Alex's face was swollen and covered in dirt.  There was blood everywhere. Just before the crash, Alex told his mom he was going for a walk to Tim Hortons.  The Grade 12 Fredericton High School student battles anxiety and depression, so walking was a way to clear his head. ""The last thing I said to him was, 'Be careful and I love you,'"" said Taylor. About 20 minutes later, she heard sirens about 100 metres from her home. She didn't think anything of it and drove her daughter, Julia, to work at the north-side Dairy Queen. When she returned home, Taylor noticed her son's black Sorel boots weren't in the doorway. ""I had this sickening feeling consume me."" Instinctively, Taylor ran out of the house, in her navy snowflake pyjamas and white slippers, to the accident scene, where police confirmed it was her son who had been hit. Alex was immediately sent to the Saint John Regional Hospital. He had surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The surgery lasted just over an hour, but ""felt like a million years,"" Taylor said.  ""We were just moments away from losing him."" Taylor is adamant the crash wasn't Hanna's fault. In fact, she believes the teen's quick reaction is what kept Alex from suffering more serious injury. ""She is as damaged emotionally as my son is physically,"" Taylor said. There haven't been any criminal charges following the crash. Alex will be staying at the hospital for several months and will move to the Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation in Fredericton after that. Taylor and Bordage have been texting and talking over the phone — especially on the bad days. They share jokes, laugh and cry together. ""We'll forever be family now,"" Taylor said. Alex has broken bones on the right side of his skull and his maxillary sinuses are shattered. He is relearning how to walk and eat on his own. The right side of his face is paralyzed.  In the future, Alex could struggle to walk and talk — he could even lose his memory and cognitive ability. Doctors still don't know whether he'll be the same person he was before the crash. But he did manage to write his first sentence this week:   ""I'll always forgive.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/car-crash-friendship-mothers-brain-injury-1.5433745,[],N/A
288,Catherine Cullen,2020-01-22T22:35:29.945Z,"Social conservative MP Derek Sloan running for Conservative leadership, promises 'bold ideas'","MP Derek Sloan can count on two hands the number of days he's spent in the House of Commons. But the newly elected Ontario MP insists that won't hold him back in the Conservative leadership race. ""Let's say you had someone who had the cabinet experience ... but they're kind of boring and their ideas are same-old, versus someone who has bold ideas and is more engaging,"" he said. ""I would say the playing field would be almost level at that point."" The Belleville, Ont.-area MP is the second member of Conservative caucus to announce he's running for the leadership; MP Marilyn Gladu is also running. And while they haven't officially announced, both Erin O'Toole and Pierre Poilievre are organizing leadership campaigns and are expected to make their bids official in the coming days. Businessman Rick Peterson announced Wednesday he would make another attempt for the party leadership. He finished 12th in a 14-person race in 2017. Former interim leader Rona Ambrose, meanwhile, put an end to speculation about her interest in the job today, confirming in a Facebook post that she will not run. Sloan, a lawyer and former small business owner, said he has a list of ""30, 40 bold ideas on anything conceivable that I've been able to come up with,"" including tax cuts and poverty among seniors. But he said he won't reveal any of them until the leadership campaign is officially underway. Sloan said he identifies as a social conservative — but doesn't want to typecast himself as the race's designated so-con candidate. ""I'm not running specially to only make a point on those areas, although I am a social conservative and I have opinions,"" he said. Still, Sloan argues there's a legal vacuum on abortion in Canada and Canadians deserve to see the issue debated by their representatives. The Conservative Party's constitution doesn't allow a Conservative government to bring forward a bill on abortion, he said — so any change would have to come from an individual MP putting forward a private member's bill. ""Bring on the discussion, bring on the debate,"" he said. Unlike many members of the Conservative caucus, Sloan said that while he favours balanced budgets, a return to balance would not be his priority as Conservative leader. ""I'm more of a 'build the right structure and things will take care of themselves' [candidate],"" he said. The right tax cuts and economic policy would create an economy robust enough to drive the federal budget toward balance, he said. ""I got into politics for one reason, and that is to make the Conservative party the dominant force in the country,"" he said, adding the party can't rely on being Canadians' first alternative ""when the Liberals mess up."" That can be achieved, he said, if the Conservatives have ""bold platforms on everything."" Sloan said he's been ""aggressively"" taking French lessons and describes his own French as mid- to high-level intermediate. He did agree to answer one question from CBC News in French; he stumbled during his response, then laughed and described it as ""vaguely intelligible."" Sloan said he considers himself ""officially"" in the race, although he's still completing the paperwork and collecting the members' signatures required by the party. The Conservative Party's first deadline — when candidates have to come up with $25,000 and 1,000 signatures from party members — is Feb 27. Sloan insisted he's in for the long haul.

289,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-17T20:45:50.416Z,Jury selected for Harvey Weinstein rape trial,"A jury of seven men and five women was selected Friday for Harvey Weinstein's rape trial after an arduous two-week process, setting the stage for testimony to begin in the next week. The final tally mostly erased a gender imbalance that, just hours earlier, led to complaints by prosecutors that the defence was deliberately trying to keep young women off the panel. ""They are systematically eliminating a class of people from this jury,"" prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said.  The defence said it wasn't specifically targeting young women, but didn't want jurors who were too young to understand the way men and women interacted in the early 1990s. ""That was a different time in New York and on planet Earth,"" Weinstein attorney Arthur Aidala said. Weinstein, 67, ambling out of the courthouse, didn't comment when asked his thoughts on jury selection. ""Ask Donna!"" he said, referring to lawyer Donna Rotunno. Three alternate jurors — one man and two women — were also chosen. They will sit through the trial and take the place of any jurors on the main panel who can't make it through to deliberations.  Weinstein, the former studio boss behind such Oscar-winners as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could face life in prison.  The tussle over juror gender comes amid a selection process that has been far from easy.  Weinstein's case has attracted widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement, as dozens of women have come forward over the last two years with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. That's made it tough for Weinstein's lawyers, prosecutors and Burke to find a fair and impartial jury.  Each day for nearly a week, whenever Judge James Burke introduced Weinstein to a new batch of potential jurors and asked if they couldn't be impartial, dozens of hands shot up.  Weinstein's lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can't possibly give Weinstein a fair trial. Cognizant of the media attention and the weight some people are putting on the case, Burke has cautioned potential jurors: ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."" Of more than 600 people summoned as potential jurors in Weinstein's case, some have marked themselves for disqualification by admitting they knew one of Weinstein's many accusers, had personal experience with sexual abuse or read Catch and Kill, a book by Ronan Farrow, one of the first reporters to bring the allegations against Weinstein to light.  There were others like supermodel Gigi Hadid, who reported for jury duty and wound up in the Weinstein pool, who even said they had met the defendant. One man's wife starred on a show that Weinstein's studio produced and said he couldn't be impartial. One woman said she couldn't be impartial because she has a ""close friend who had an encounter with the defendant in his hotel room.""  Another man was scratched for saying he couldn't be fair-minded because he had often spotted Weinstein in Tribeca, the lower Manhattan neighborhood that hosts an annual film festival. ""On several occasions I've seen him on the phone screaming at someone,"" he said of Weinstein. In the end, the jury includes the author of a upcoming novel that she describes as involving young women dealing with predatory older men. The defence, out of challenges, argued against including her on the jury, but Burke said she could serve. The defence then asked for a mistrial over her inclusion on the jury, but was denied. Weinstein lawyer Rotunno said the woman had lied on her jury questionnaire, but prosecutors noted she disclosed on the form that she was a novelist. That so many people in the running to be on the jury have had experiences involving Weinstein or his accusers speaks to the breadth of his alleged abuse, as well as the ubiquitous nature of celebrity in New York, where stars are frequently spotted by paparazzi and the public alike riding the subway, shopping for groceries and walking their pets. Then there have been other issues, including at least one instance of what jury consultants call ""stealth jurors"" — people eager to serve, especially on a high-profile case, because they hope to make a point or a profit.  On Thursday, Burke threatened to hold a potential juror in contempt of court for asking his followers on Twitter ""how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel.""  Opening statements are expected next Wednesday. The trial could last about six weeks.  During the phase of jury selection called voir dire, where lawyers attempt to size up people who have assured the judge they could be fair and impartial jurors, the lawyers' concerns were in evidence. Addressing a pool of prospective jurors Thursday, prosecutor Meghan Hast signaled concerns that the sight of Weinstein, who's been using a walker since back surgery last month, could influence their attitudes about him. ""Is there anything about Harvey Weinstein, looking at him today, that makes you feel that there's no way that man's a rapist?"" she asked. No one responded. Defence lawyer Damon Cheronis told the panel that they would hear testimony from Weinstein accusers who might get emotional and cry on the witness stand. He also asked the potential jurors whether they were familiar with the concept of ""victim shaming."" Another one of his questions: ""Does anybody think an individual could have sex with someone that they may not find attractive for reasons other than love?"" No one responded. Prosecutors plan to call at least four women to the witness stand who have accused Weinstein of violating them, but whose allegations weren't the basis for the New York charges. As jury selection was getting underway last week, California prosecutors charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting two women there, one of whom who is expected to testify in the New York case.  Burke ruled Friday that if Weinstein testifies on his own behalf, prosecutors can't question him about that accuser on cross examination. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-hadid-1.5426418 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-recusal-rejected-1.5420656,N/A
290,Dan Ralph,2020-01-22T01:56:19.376Z,Canadian Laurent Duvernay-Tardif didn't need long to get into Super Bowl mode,"It didn't take Canadian Laurent Duvernay-Tardif long to get into Super Bowl mode. On Sunday, the offensive lineman and the Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl with a 35-24 AFC championship win over the visiting Tennessee Titans. That secured the franchise its first berth in the NFL title game in 50 years. Duvernay-Tardif, from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Que., will be playing for a championship for the first time as a football player on Feb. 2 against the San Francisco 49ers in Miami. But that didn't take away from his focus during all the on-field chaos and celebrations on Sunday. ""I just went back home, grabbed dinner with family and friends and went to bed,'' Duvernay-Tardif, 28, said during a conference call Tuesday. ""I think that's the way you have to approach it because the next day I was back in the gym getting ready for the week of practice that started [Tuesday]. ""I celebrated the moment on the field, went back home grabbed a nice dinner and the next morning when I woke up I was already in a Super Bowl mindset,"" he said. The Chiefs' veteran right guard is a converted defensive lineman who played collegiately at McGill University in Montreal. The towering six-foot-five, 321-pound Canadian will become just the second player in school history to play in the Super Bowl. Linebacker/long-snapper J.P. Darche, a Montreal native, was the first. The former Toronto Argonaut played for Seattle in its 21-10 Super Bowl loss to Pittsburgh in 2006 in Detroit. Darche played nine pro seasons with the Argos (1999), Seahawks (2000-06) and Chiefs (2007-08). Duvernay-Tardif and Darche will both make the trip to Miami with Kansas City. Darche, 44, is currently one of the Chiefs' team doctors. Ironically, Duvernay-Tardif graduated from McGill with his doctorate in medicine in May 2018. That made him the first active NFL player to hold a medical degree although he must still complete his residency. After missing most of last season with a broken leg, Duvernay-Tardif will complete his sixth NFL campaign — all with Kansas City — playing in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs selected Duvernay-Tardif in the sixth round, No. 200 overall, in the 2014 NFL draft. In March 2017, Duvernay-Tardif signed a five-year extension with the Chiefs. The deal was reportedly worth $41.25-million US, with $20 million guaranteed. Kansas City's Andy Reid is just the seventh NFL head coach to lead two teams to the Super Bowl. But Reid lost in his only other appearance, that being Feb. 6, 2006 when the New England Patriots edged the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21. ""Coach Reid is more than a coach, he's also a mentor for me and the team,'' said Duvernay-Tardif. ""The team he's put together the last five years is really talented and I think we owe him to go all the way this year. Personally, he's kind of the one who understood what I was trying to do with medical school and football and gave me the opportunity to combine both at the highest level. If it wasn't for him, I don't think I would've been able to do it so I'm really grateful.'' The Chiefs will chase a second Super Bowl title — they downed Minnesota 23-7 in Super Bowl IV — after mounting consecutive comebacks this year. After spotting Houston a 24-0 advantage, Kansas City rallied for the 51-31 victory before reeling off 28 straight points against Tennessee to erase a 10-0 deficit. ""We're going to have to address that . . . because the further you get along in the playoffs the better the teams are and you can't really allow yourself to be behind,'' he said. ""But I feel like no matter what happened those last two weeks were really good learning opportunities and as a team I think we all showed character because were able to stick together. If we're able to fix it and have that kind of confidence going into the big game I think it will help us.'' Of course, having Patrick Mahomes at quarterback certainly helps. Duvernay-Tardif admits Chiefs players are routinely amazed by Mahomes' play. Kansas City had its way with a Titans defence that had allowed 13 points to New England and 12 versus Baltimore previously. But with Mahomes under centre, the Chiefs amassed 27 first downs and 404 yards of total offence. Duvernay-Tardif said Mahomes gives the Chiefs a huge edge heading into the Super Bowl. ""I think Pat is the greatest quarterback right now playing in the league,'' he said. ""Sometimes we look at the jumbotron and it's, 'Oh my God, how does he do that?' It's almost not human the amount of things he's able to process at the same time.'' Duvernay-Tardif admits being so close to a first-ever football championship can be a little nerve-wracking. ""I feel like after every season I've played football . . . you go to the playoffs and you always finish out the season losing,'' he said. ""This is the only time so far in my career that I have an opportunity to finish a season winning and after that there's nothing else, you've reached the top. That gives me goosebumps thinking about it.'' Especially when thoughts of a Super Bowl title were so very distant when Duvernay-Tardif was playing at McGill. ""For me throughout my whole career, it's been kind of a one step at a time approach,'' he said. ""It was only once I started being a consistent starter for the Kansas City Chiefs that I began having that vision of going all the way to the top and winning the Super Bowl.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/laurent-duvernay-tardif-superbowl-1.5435592,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/laurent-duvernay-tardif-kansas-city-chiefs-mcgill-1.4002410 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/laurent-duvernay-tardif-ranked-no-1-for-2014-cfl-draft-1.2496189,N/A
291,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-21T20:24:18.942Z,Over-representation of Indigenous people in federal prisons reaches 'disturbing' historic high,"The over-representation of Indigenous people in federal custody has reached a new historic high, according to a statement released Tuesday by the Office of the Correctional Investigator.  In the statement, Correctional Investigator of Canada Ivan Zinger described the continuing trend of the increasing number and proportion of Indigenous people in federal prisons as ""disturbing"" and called for bold and urgent actions from corrections and government.  Indigenous people account for roughly five per cent of the population in Canada, but when it comes to federal custody Zinger said they now account for more than 30 per cent of the federal inmate population, up from 25 per cent four years ago.  Indigenous women now account for 42 per cent of women in federal custody.  Zinger said despite the findings of royal commissions and national inquiries, court interventions and political promises, over the last three decades, ""no government of any stripe has managed to reverse the trend of Indigenous over-representation in Canadian jails and prisons."" ""The Indigenization of Canada's prison population is nothing short of a national travesty,"" he wrote.   There are many layers of historical and contemporary factors at play when it comes to understanding why Indigenous people may be more likely to be criminalized, according to Zinger.  But once an individual comes into the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), he said the service needs to accept its share of responsibility in the overrepresentation instead of recusing itself from responsibility.  Zinger said, for example, that Indigenous people are more likely than others to be placed in maximum security institutions, serve higher proportions of their sentences behind bars before getting out on parole and are also returned to custody at much higher rates that non-Indigenous people.  ""In failing to close the outcomes gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders, the federal correctional system makes its own unique and measureable contribution to the problem of over-representation,"" said Zinger in the release.  Zinger said overall there's been a decline in the number of people in prisons but that since April 2010 the Indigenous population in prisons has increased by 43.4 per cent. In comparison, the non-Indigenous prison population has declined in that same time period by 13.7 per cent.  Zinger is now calling on CSC to make ""dramatic changes"" to help reduce the over-representation and for the federal government to take a leadership role in directing those changes.  CBC reached out to CSC for comment, and was passed on to Public Safety Canada. Jordan Crosby, director of parliamentary affairs for the ministry, said in an emailed statement, ""we know there's much more work to do."" ""The overrepresentation of Indigenous people in correctional institutions is an unacceptable situation that we are working very hard to address."" Crosby said several actions have been taken by government in the past four years to address the situation including legislative changes that are meant to streamline the bail system, investments to support reintegration of previously-incarcerated Indigenous people and the opening of a new healing lodge in Winnipeg.  He also mentioned government commitments to expand diversion programs and the plan to introduce legislation to implement the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Patricia Barkaskas, director of the Indigenous Community Legal Clinic in Vancouver, said the continued trend of increasing over-representation is not surprising.  In her view, Zinger's newly released figures are evidence that ""the Canadian state continues to ignore its role in criminalizing Indigenous Peoples and creating this situation and not addressing it. ""Indigenous people aren't the problem, it's the system. It's Canada's colonial system,"" she said. She said government and institutions often point to the Gladue ruling as a way to remedy over-representation by taking into consideration the influence of things such as residential schools, the Sixties Scoop or child welfare system on Indigenous offenders, but said it's not being implemented properly and in some cases isn't being applied at all.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indigenous-overrepresentation-prison-oci-statement-1.5434712,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5434678/soaring-rates-of-indigenous-people-in-prison-unacceptable-says-federal-watchdog-1.5434693 https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/locked-up-at-12,N/A
292,Laura Osman ,2020-01-23T09:00:00.474Z,"Homeowners, advocates call for end to Tarion monopoly ","Homeowners who've fought for years for restitution after discovering defects in their newly built homes are demanding the provincial government reconsider its efforts to reform the Tarion home warranty program and instead open it up to private insurers. They were joined by consumer advocates — and even a former high-ranking Tarion employee — at a provincial standing committee on justice policy Wednesday in Ottawa, where they called for an end to Tarion's monopoly. The Progressive Conservative government has pledged to overhaul Tarion after a damning report by the province's auditor general in October, charging the warranty provider was overly influenced by builders and failed homeowners. ""Tarion is broken and beyond repair,"" said Julie Bellefeuille, who's been struggling for years to get necessary repairs to her new home in east Ottawa's Cardinal Creek neighbourhood. Cardinal Creek homeowners locked in battle with builder Homeowners forced out over construction flaws call for reform She told the committee that navigating Tarion's ""broken"" system left her struggling with financial and emotional damages. ""Families are left to fight the broken system that failed them,"" she said.  The government's proposed overhaul will not address the core problems, Bellefeuille said, since the corporate culture will endure. She instead called for the government to open the warranty system to private providers.  ""What matters most is giving the people of Ontario a choice,"" Bellefeuille said.  Bellefeuille's message is one that's been heard often over three days of committee hearings, according to NDP MPP Tom Rakocevic, who attended meetings earlier this week in Windsor and Brampton. Rakocevic put forward a private member's bill in opposition to the government's proposed legislation, one that calls for a multi-provider model.  Last month, Consumer Services Minister Lisa Thompson announced the government had decided — after extensive consultation with the public and members of the building industry — to reject opening up home warranties to other providers. In a statement to CBC Wednesday, Thompson said making improvements to Tarion will yield benefits that a private model would not. ""By increasing the accountability of a single provider and making the significant changes to the governance of Tarion, there will be more enforcement mechanisms built into the system – which is what new home buyers in Ontario deserve,"" Thompson wrote. ""In a private insurance model, these protections are not built in, are difficult to enforce, and are not guaranteed."" Carleton MPP Goldie Ghamari shares the minister's reservations about privatizing home warranties. ""If we go to a private model, we lose government oversight and accountability,""  Ghamari told the committee Wednesday. Ghamari said while she believes in a free market economy as a Progressive Conservative, she also struggles with the idea of allowing more providers into the system.  For example, Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk  would not be able to assess a private insurance company, she said.  Lysyk expressed similar concerns in her recent report, though a 2015 review of Tarion by Chief Justice John Douglas Cunningham concluded that Tarion must be dismantled.  Ghamari also pointed out that a multi-provider model actually might not give consumers much choice, as they would be forced to go with whatever insurance company the builder chose. But Karen Somerville with Canadians for Properly Built Homes, a homeowner advocacy group, pointed out that at least people would be able to choose the builder that offered the best insurance. ""Research shows that competition is a critical driver of performance and innovation,"" said Somerville. ""Research also shows that competition encourages lower prices, better products and better service."" Dave Roberts, Tarion's former director of enforcement, told the committee the culture at Tarion before his 2017 retirement favoured builders, and workers were incentivized to avoid making payouts to homeowners.  ""Consumers were secondary, the builders were first,"" he said.  Roberts also called for home warranties to be opened up to third parties, which he said is best for consumers. ""[Tarion] cannot adjust to the market without going through regulation changes. They cannot offer upgrades for better protection or longer protection,"" he said.  The government, which has been in public consultation about Tarion's future since early last year, said any specific changes to Tarion will be decided after this round of consultation. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/tarion-hearing-monopoly-ottawa-1.5436115,[],N/A
293,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:20:08.084Z,Feds give $500K to project to help promote northern mining,"The federal government is spending $500,000 to lure investors to develop untapped mineral resources in Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.  Yukon Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell announced the initiative in Vancouver on Sunday, on behalf of Mélanie Joly, federal minister of economic development and official languages.  The Yukon Mining Alliance will use the funding to showcase the opportunities in the North at the annual Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference for the next three years.  Bagnell says the conference is the largest of its kind with over 1,000 exhibitors and 25,000 attendees from around the world, and this year's event will take place in Toronto in March.   He says the alliance will establish a key presence at the conference including a media centre, an all-day forum with information on the North and a networking event.  It's part of the Invest Canada North initiative which aims to promote the territories as attractive investment destinations and create jobs for Indigenous and northern residents. ""Mining investors from New York or London may not know about the strong Indigenous corporations we have in the North and all the assets they have to bring to projects. They may not know about the strong mining organizations we have,'' Bagnell says.  ""They may not know about how open and welcoming the territorial premiers are ... and their governments are to mining. They may not know about the millions of acres of undeveloped mining potential they could invest in.'' Yukon Premier Sandy Silver says his territory is a top-tier mining destination with rich geological potential.  ""Yukon has an awful lot to offer investors,'' he says. ""We are a geopolitically safe jurisdiction and our governments take pride in our work to forge strong, mutually respective partnerships with Yukon First Nations for the benefit of all Yukoners.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/federal-government-money-for-northern-mining-1.5433222,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/territorial-outlook-summer-2019-1.5209133,N/A
294,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:14:40.760Z,Unifor fined $100K for disobeying court injunction against blockades,"A Regina judge has ruled that Unifor must pay a $100,000 fine for ""'intentionally and deliberately"" disobeying an interim court injunction which prevented prolonged and extended blockades at the Co-Op Refinery Complex. The decision was handed down by Justice Timothy Keene on Wednesday during a contempt hearing at the Court of Queen's Bench. ""There was also an attempt, during argument, to persuade this Court that somehow the order was hard to understand or could be interpreted in a fashion that excused the Union's actions,"" Keene wrote in the decision, which referenced Justice Janet McMurtry's order. ""I have already found this is not the case."" The fine is related to events in December where Unifor members blocked FCL employees at the complex from entering or exiting the facility at various points. It is unrelated to barricades erected by the national union body this week. In a press release, the Federated Co-operated Limited applauded the decision handed down and asked the locked out picketers to remove the fencing which had been set up at the complex. ""Justice Keene's ruling this morning makes it very clear that it's important that tensions in this dispute be de-escalated,"" Vic Huard, vice president of customer experience and stakeholder engagement, told CBC Radio's Blue Sky on Wednesday. Scott Doherty, national representative for Unifor, repeated that the union believes the injunction applies to the Local 594 and not the national body. ""Our plan is to hold the line,"" Doherty said over the phone Wednesday. Doherty said there has been some discussion with the lead negotiator for Co-op but there are no immediate plans to return to the bargaining table. The judge noted the union was unapologetic. In December, after picketers blocked trucks from entering the refinery, a Regina judge issued an injunction stating picketers could block trucks for a maximum of 10 minutes.  Fourteen people — including Unifor national president Jerry Dias —  were arrested and charged with mischief Monday after picketers set up blockades to prevent the flow of traffic in and out of the refinery. Dias said the lockout has national repercussions. ""What's happening here in Regina is a fight for all workers and every union in the country understands that,"" Dias said in a release. National presidents of CUPE, the Canadian Federation of Nurses and the Canadian Labour Congress also joined Kevin Bittman, president of Unifor 594, on the picket line. On Tuesday Saskatchewan Federation of Labour (SFL)  president Lori Johb joined picketers. Johb told the picketers that the SFL fully supports them. ""The province and the country are watching,"" Johb said. ""Workers across Canada are rooting for you and I want you to know that you're not in this fight alone."" Johb called on all workers, union and non-union, to join the picket line. She said Co-op Refinery Complex has abandoned co-operative principles. Johb also called on the police to stop arresting picketers. ""Arresting innocent workers as they fight for what's right does not help the situation in any way."" The dispute mainly comes down to pensions. A previous deal included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan.  The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/lockout-co-op-refinery-regina-unifor-sfl-1.5436131,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-fences-barricades-tuesday-1.5434389 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/meet-the-scabs-union-labour-dispute-1.5421854,N/A
295,Morgan Modjeski,2020-01-23T12:00:00.328Z,Some Onion Lake residents say info about diphtheria not coming fast enough after 2 cases confirmed,"People in the community of Onion Lake are feeling uneasy after two cases of a rare infection were found in the area, but health officials say there's little to no risk of the infection spreading further. Last week, Indigenous Services Canada wrote to band leaders of the Onion Lake Cree Nation near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border indicating that two cases of diphtheria had been diagnosed — one on the reserve itself and the other in a nearby community. For one mother, the diagnoses have been troubling. ""I am terrified,"" said Roxanne Littlewolfe, a mother of six and educational assistant in Onion Lake. She said she's been hearing a lot of the same from other people in the community, especially mothers who have just had children. Littlewolfe said many people have questions and she doesn't think enough information about the infection is circulating in the community. ""There's not enough information for us to go on it,"" she said. ""It's just going ear-to-ear and mouth-to-mouth."" The Onion Lake Health Centre has posted some information about the illness on it's Facebook page, but Littlewolfe said she'd like to see a community-education event organized because some in the area aren't connected to the Internet or social media. ""If they had somebody come in to actually speak about the 'do's and the don'ts' and the 'what ifs' I think our community would have a better understanding."" According to the Centre for Disease Control in the U.S., diphtheria is an infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. The infection occurs in the respiratory system or on skin. With treatment, 1 in 10 diphtheria patients die and that number jumps up to 5 in 10 if left untreated. Officials say the Onion Lake diphtheria cases were not linked to one another. Albert Jimmy, the health director of the Onion Lake Health Board Inc. said band leadership is working to distribute information about the infections. Fact sheets have been distributed to schools, teachers, healthcare professionals and in the community at large.  Jimmy said he had plans to go on local radio Wednesday to relay information about the infection, but the broadcast was delayed. Instead, the broadcast will take place Thursday. He said leadership is working with Indigenous Services Canada to make sure information is flowing. ""I understand people are scared, they were texting me and some parents weren't going to be sending their children to school, so we have to reassure them,"" he said.  Jimmy said medical staff in the area treated the infection quickly and were able to contain its spread.  ""All we need to do is keep people informed more and we're trying to do that,"" he said.  When asked about the idea of hosting a public event to inform members of the community about the infection he said ""we're open to all suggestions"" and it's something he'll be approaching leadership about this week.  Dr. Ibrahim Khan, Regional Medical Health Officer with Indigenous Services Canada, said the community did an excellent job identifying and containing the infection. At this time, no additional resources have been requested. ""So far, I have offered all sorts of support to the community, but they say they are O.K. and if they need anything they will let us know,"" said Khan.  He said he's also had an opportunity to speak with the affected patients and their families directly and has been in frequent contact with health officials and nurses on the frontline in the community.    Khan said if the community decides to host an event to inform community members, representatives from Indigenous Services Canada will be present.  ""I'll be there. Our nurses will be there. Our team will be there,"" he said. In the letter sent to Onion Lake leaders last week, it explained that people may be at risk of infection because the vaccination rate for diphtheria in the Onion Lake area is below the desired target. However, Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the medical health officer responsible for overseeing communicable diseases within the Saskatchewan Health Authority said the provincial vaccination rate for the province is solid.  ""My understanding is even on First Nations communities their coverage for this vaccine is very high ... more than 90 percent of the population have been immunized with vaccine that protects against diphtheria,"" he said.  He said there hasn't been a case of diphtheria in the province for ""many years"" and stressed that professionals in Onion Lake took the correct steps to contain the infection.  Anyone with concerns about their own or their child's immunization record should get in touch with their local health officials to ensure all vaccines are up to date.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/diphtheria-onion-lake-1.5436957,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-sask-vaccines-1.5117395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/african-swine-flu-university-saskatchewan-1.5422544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-coronavirus-1.5434143 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/two-cases-diptheria-onion-lake-cree-nation-sask-1.5434377 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-warned-about-coronavirus-2020-1.5436690,N/A
296,Terry Roberts,2020-01-23T10:29:03.089Z,"With St. John's funeral business at a standstill in wake of blizzard, families struggle to say goodbye","Dozens of funerals have been put on hold in St. John's and area because of the extended state of emergency, and that's putting added stress on families trying to say goodbye to loved ones, and those who take care of the dead. ""People are going to have to be patient. Wait their turn, basically, is what it's come down to,"" said John Anderson, who manages Caul's Funeral Homes. ""It's very difficult. I feel for them. But that's the reality of this state of emergency at this time,"" added Father Cecil Critch, a Roman Catholic clergyman at the Basilica of St. John the Baptist. There hasn't been a memorial service at Caul's since Thursday, the day before a record-breaking blizzard delivered a massive amount of snow and punishing winds to much of eastern Newfoundland. St. John's implemented a state of emergency as the storm intensified, forcing businesses to close and vehicles off the streets. While restrictions have slowly been lifted, funeral homes remain closed. Churches are also closed, and most cemeteries — buried in a thick blanket of snow — are not expected to be ready to accept burials until next week. ""It's going to take us two to three days to clear it out,"" said Gordon Holden, who manages five cemeteries on behalf of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's. And when cemeteries are finally reopened, said Holden, it will be difficult to find burial plots because most grave markers are buried under the snow. ""We're going to have to start digging,"" said Holden. There's an unprecedented backlog of funerals at Caul's. Every wake room is filled. Bodies are lined up in the embalming room. ""We have 20 people in the building right now — that could be an urn or a person. That's quite a number of people awaiting services to take place. I've never seen it like this before. Never,"" said Anderson. Anderson knows of at least two cases of people dying during the height of the storm, and not being removed from their homes for up to 48 hours. One way to correct this in the future is to allow funeral homes to collect bodies during a state of emergency, with assistance from the city or other authorities, said Anderson. Some remains have been at the funeral home for a week, and services have been repeatedly rescheduled, only to be cancelled again, he said. So the home has stopped making any plans, until the all-clear comes from the city. Considering the snow-clogged condition of the streets, he agrees, it would not be wise to allow funeral homes to resume normal operations. ""If we had the general public here today, Lemarchant Road would just be filled. It wouldn't be fair to the neighbourhood,"" he said. So while the focus since Friday's storm has been on the living, it clearly hasn't been easy either for those who take care of the dead.

297,Anonymous,2020-01-23T10:29:33.045Z,"1 dead, 5 missing after snowmobilers fall through ice on Quebec's Lac Saint-Jean","One man is dead and five others are still missing after a tour group's snowmobiles went through the ice along Quebec's Lac Saint-Jean Tuesday night. Quebec provincial police launched a widespread search Wednesday, but were unable to locate the missing people before nightfall. Two of their snowmobiles were found underwater, but have not yet been brought to the surface. After dark, police said they will continue to monitor the area, but scale back the intensity of the search and divers will return to the water in the morning. During the search Wednesday afternoon, a provincial police pilot was injured when their helicopter crashed into the water. The injuries were not life-threatening and no one else was aboard, police said. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada says it is deploying a team of investigators to probe the crash. The deceased snowmobiler was identified as Benoît Lespérance, a 42-year-old Montreal man, who was serving as a guide to a group of eight tourists from France. He died several hours after being admitted to hospital. Lespérance was an accredited snowmobile guide who was trained in 2010, according to Quebec's council on human resources in tourism.  The group was driving across a snow-covered channel, between the towns of Saint-Henri-de-Taillon and Alma, when the ice gave way beneath them. Police said a person who went through the ice was helped out of the water by two members of the group who had managed to brake and avoid falling in. The three of them then drove to shore and called emergency services from a store in Saint-Henri-de-Taillon. Firefighters from Alma recovered the guide from the water. He was transported to hospital, but died Wednesday morning. The three survivors have since been discharged from the hospital in Alma.  ""Physically, they are doing well. But morally, they are shocked,"" said Laurent Barbot, a French consular official. Sûreté du Québec Sgt. Hugues Beaulieu said the group deviated from the marked snowmobile paths — which are inspected daily — and went out onto the lake. ""They must not have known the area well, because it's an area known for having critically thin ice because of the current,"" Beaulieu said. Members of the SQ, the Alma fire department and Canadian Armed Forces searched the area overnight.  The SQ's diving team arrived Wednesday morning to assist in the search. Late in the evening, Sgt. Béatrice Dorsainville said divers found two snowmobiles in the water at the mouth of the La Grande Décharge — an outlet for Lac Saint-Jean.  The snowmobiles will be removed Thursday morning, she said. Quebec Municipal Affairs Minister Andrée Laforest was on site Wednesday afternoon to thank rescue workers for their efforts throughout the day. She said that snowmobiling is a very popular activity in Quebec for residents and tourists alike, ""but it's important that it is done safely."" ""Of course, it's concerning,"" Laforest said. ""Were [the snowmobilers] lost? That will be part of the investigation."" Tuesday night's accident on Lac Saint-Jean took place during International Snowmobile Safety Week.  Five people have died in snowmobile-related incidents in the province since the 2019-2020 winter season began, not including the accident on Lac Saint-Jean. In total, 104 people in Quebec have died while snowmobiling since 2015. Saint-Henri-de-Taillon mayor André Paradis said he was shocked by the news. A snowmobiler himself, Paradis said he doesn't know how the group wound up on the channel. ""No one understands why they would go there,"" Paradis said. ""It's the worst place to go. It's completely incomprehensible."" The group of snowmobilers spent Monday night at Relais 22 Milles, a lodge about 100 kilometres from the shores of Lac Saint-Jean in La Tuque, Que. The lodge is located on a Trans-Québec snowmobile trail. Owner of the lodge for four years, Christine Reis said she knew the guide who died. Lespérance was staying at her place twice a week at times, she said.

298,Chad Pawson,2020-01-20T02:00:43.897Z,"Canadian painter Gordon Smith, a beloved master, has died at 100","Gordon Smith, a Canadian painter known for his large-scale abstract work and influence on other artists, died on Saturday, Jan 18, 2020. He was 100. Smith was born in East Brighton, England in 1919 and came to Winnipeg in 1933 where he enrolled at the Winnipeg School of Art. His career as a painter and teacher spanned right up until his death. ""A key figure in Canadian art, Smith lived his life with a generosity and grace that was a gift to the world,"" said Vancouver's Equinox Gallery in a statement. Most of Smith's work reflected the landscape and natural world around him. His pieces are often a sweeping tangle of form and colour. He had his first professional exhibition in 1938.  His artistic career included two major retrospectives at the Vancouver Art Gallery, more than 25 solo exhibitions at Equinox Gallery, participation in biennial exhibitions in Canada and Brazil, as well as significant commissions including the design of the Canadian Pavilion for Expo '70 in Osaka, in collaboration with Arthur Erickson. He also produced and major works for public buildings in Washington, D.C. and London, U.K. In 1941 he married Marion Fleming and their marriage spanned 70 years. Fleming died in 2009, but together they founded the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation for Young Artists which supports art education for young students. Robert Heffel, the vice president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, began selling Smith's work in 1995. Heffel and his wife, along with his brother David and his wife,became close with the Smiths. ""Gordon Smith is probably the most loved artist, the most loved you'll ever know, everybody that met him, loved him."" said Heffel. ""He was just such a warm, genuine person."" Heffel said every day, right up until the end of his life we went to his studio. ""Everyday he painted, that was his life, that's what he lived for."" Smith taught at the Vancouver School of Art and at UBC from 1956 to 1982 when he retired from teaching to focus on painting full time. In 2017, he created an exhibition called ""Black Paintings,"" which reflected his time as an Intelligence Officer in the Canadian Infantry. In the past decade his works became more sought after as buyers around the world paid record amounts for Canadian works from artists such as Emily Carr, Jean-Paul Riopelle and The Group of Seven painters. In 2013, Smith's 1965 abstract Red Beach was featured on the cover of Heffel Fine Art Auction House's contemporary catalogue and ended up fetching $93,600, three times the high-end of its presale estimate. ""It's fair to say that when you put his great paintings beside other great paintings, he stands out as one of the greats, for sure,"" said Heffel. Smith received many accolades over the course of his career including the Order of Canada in 1996, the Order of British Columbia in 2000, the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2009 and the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts in 2007. ""Gordon Smith, an exceptional artist and uniquely generous human being, will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to know him,"" said Equinox.

299,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:58:29.094Z,Crown wants 10 years for man guilty of killing common-law wife,"Crown prosecutors are calling for Irving John Hastey to be sentenced to 10 years in prison for the 2018 killing of his common-law wife in her St. Stephen home. Hastey, 55, pleaded guilty to manslaughter Nov. 29, 2019, about 11 months after Crystal Ann Tracey, 52, died in her apartment on Christmas Eve, which was also her birthday. Police were alerted to a disturbance at Tracey's apartment just before noon. She suffered multiple stab wounds and died at the scene as paramedics tried to revive her. Hastey was also found unresponsive at the scene and was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The Crown is also seeking a lifetime weapons and ammunition ban and that Hastey submit to a DNA order, the prosecution told Saint John Court of Queen's Bench during Wednesday's sentencing hearing. Hastey was charged with second-degree murder two days after Tracey's death. He initially pleaded not guilty, but later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. Justice Darrell Stephenson will deliver his sentence Monday. Shara Munn and Patrick Wilbur represented the Crown, and Brian Munro served in defence. Dressed in bright orange sweats, Hastey sat in the prisoner's box as Tracey's two sisters told the court he was abusive and they saw this tragedy coming. Valerie Tubbs said in a victim impact statement the couple was together for more than 30 years and have three grown children. ""This is the legacy you have left for [your] children. This will be the burden they will carry,"" Tubbs said, speaking directly to Hastey. ""That makes me angry. How dare you. I don't understand how a father can do this to his children."" Tubbs said she talked to her sister the day before her death about holiday arrangements with plans to see each other on Christmas Eve. It was the last time they spoke. ""Every year at Christmas I will mourn the loss of my sister,"" Tubbs said. Marilyn Little said in her statement to the court she feared for her sister and her children for years. ""For many years when the phone rang and I saw it was Crystal's number, I didn't know what to expect. Was she okay? The kids? Would I hear him yelling in the background?"" Little said. ""I predicted this 20 years ago."" Tubbs said she was hopeful Tracey could lead a happy and productive life after moving into an apartment on her own. ""We will never know,"" she said. We haven't come far enough to curb domestic violence, she said, expressing fear Hastey will hurt her when he's released. Munro, who agreed to the recommendation of 10 years less time served, said it was a dysfunctional family environment. He did mention his client pleaded guilty, saving the court from a trial. Police received a call from Tracey at 11:16 a.m. on the day of her death, according to the statement of facts read by Wilbur. Tracey, who was calling from her apartment at 16 Schoodic St., requested Hastey be removed from her residence. The call was transferred to the local operator, but the line went dead. Police were dispatched from the nearby detachment. The prosecution played a recording of the call. Hastey could be heard in the background, becoming increasingly hostile. An officer arrived on scene at 11:22 a.m. and gained entry into the apartment by kicking down the locked door. Both individuals were found lying on their backs — Hastey unconscious in the bathroom and Tracey in the kitchen with a knife sticking out of her chest. She was alive and moving, Wilbur told the court. The officer spoke to her and she communicated by squeezing her hand.  Paramedics arrived but could not find a heartbeat, and attempts to revive her with chest compressions and a defibrillator were unsuccessful. Paramedics determined she was dead at 11:43 a.m. The post-mortem ruled the cause of death as multiple sharp-force injuries to the chest and abdomen. Tracey suffered seven to eight stab wounds in her chest and back, extending into both lungs and her liver. The knife, which was seized by police, belonged to Hastey — a present from his mother the previous Christmas. After determining Tracey had died, paramedics turned their attention to Hastey. He had an injury to his chest and was later taken to hospital in Moncton, where a stent was removed and he regained consciousness. The court heard the couple had been drinking that morning.  The toxicology report indicated Hastey had a blood-alcohol content of 145 milligrams per decilitre and had consumed methamphetamine and amphetamine.Tracey had a blood-alcohol content of 269 milligrams per decilitre.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-john-hastey-manslaughter-crystal-ann-tracey-1.5436721,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-hastey-crystal-tracey-st-stephen-1.5378833,N/A
300,Aly Thomson,2020-01-21T19:33:32.917Z,N.S. declined to seize insurance money granted to mentally ill man who killed wife,"Nova Scotia's Justice Department twice told the province's Supreme Court it would not apply to seize life insurance money granted to a Cape Breton man found not criminally responsible for killing his wife. The detail is noted by Justice Frank Edwards in followup comments to his ruling last week that Richard Maidment is entitled to his wife's life insurance, which totals $200,000 plus interest. Maidment, 42, who also uses the surname McNeil, killed Sarabeth Forbes on April 18, 2017, in the home they shared in Gardiner Mines, N.S. He was found not criminally responsible in December 2017. Two years earlier, Forbes named Maidment as beneficiary to her life insurance and her son as a contingent. In granting the money to Maidment — and not to the couple's 12-year-old son, who is now being raised by his grandmother — Edwards noted Maidment doesn't benefit from a crime because he didn't commit a crime and is not a criminal. Last week, a law professor noted there is precedent for provincial governments to intervene in such cases, under the province's Civil Forfeiture Act. In additional written comments released Monday, Edwards noted the court notified the province's attorney general of the claim for the life insurance, made by Maidment's mother on his behalf. Edwards said in a letter dated Aug. 6, 2019, a solicitor of the civil forfeiture unit of the Justice Department wrote that ""the province of Nova Scotia will not be participating in this matter."" After the unit was advised that Forbes's mother, Emeline Forbes, had filed an counter application for the insurance money on behalf of the couple's son, a lawyer for the department advised the court that it ""does not have an interest in the proceedings."" Edward noted that because the province did not intervene in the case, ""My decision did not deal with provisions of the Civil Forfeiture Act."" The Justice Department declined an interview request. But in a statement, spokesperson Barbara MacLean noted the Civil Forfeiture Act only allows for forfeiture of property — including money — to the province, and not to third parties.  ""To clarify, this means when applying the act under any circumstances, forfeited money would go into the general revenue of the province, and would not be able to be given to a third party."" MacLean declined to comment further, as it is a ""private legal matter.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/richard-maidment-life-insurance-nova-scotia-justice-department-1.5434765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/mayann-francis-racial-profiling-santina-rao-arrest-1.5434509 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/maritimes-natural-gas-pipeline-commits-200m-in-case-of-mishap-1.5434396 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cliff-jumper-logan-latulippe-glace-bay-1.5433339 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841,N/A
301,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:48:01.672Z,"No hesitation to send ambulance for Cynthia Blackjack, nurses tells inquest","Two nurses testifying at the Cynthia Blackjack inquest in Yukon said there was no hesitation to send an ambulance to pick up the ailing woman, the day she died. Nurse Terry Ogilvie was working at the Carmacks Health Centre on Nov. 7, 2013, when the call came for an ambulance to be sent to the house of Blackjack's grandmother. The coroner's inquest, now underway in Whitehorse, is looking at the circumstances around 29-year-old Cynthia Blackjack's death later that day, during a medevac flight to Whitehorse. One of the central questions raised at the inquest so far is whether Blackjack should have been transported to Whitehorse General Hospital sooner. The Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, of which Blackjack was a member, has suggested ""systemic racism"" as a potential factor. In 2018, the Yukon Court of Appeal found that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of severe dental pain. The day before she died, Blackjack was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital — a two-hour drive away. Staff at the health centre say they tried to help find Blackjack a ride, but were unsuccessful.  Ogilvie told the inquest that her memory of the day Blackjack died is spotty, but she recalls at least three nurses and two doctors who saw Blackjack in Carmacks on that day. She said that's an unusually high number of staff. Ogilvie also said anyone with symptoms like Blackjack's would get an ambulance or medevac to Whitehorse as soon as possible. Deb Crosby, the former nurse in charge of the Carmacks Health Centre, also testified on Wednesday and supported Ogilvie's claim that there was no hesitation to send an ambulance. She told the inquest jurors that staff at the health centre could almost always arrange rides to Whitehorse for patients. But Crosby said she had to be cautious about sending Carmacks's only ambulance out of the community. ""You're always thinking about the worst-case scenario,"" she said. When Blackjack arrived at the health centre on Nov. 7, staff immediately called Whitehorse for a medevac flight, Crosby said. According to Ogilvie, the Carmacks nurses were devastated when RCMP later told them Blackjack had died on the plane before reaching Whitehorse. The nurses' testimony marked the start of the Whitehorse portion of the inquest, which is expected to continue at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre until Jan. 31. The first two days of testimony were held at the recreation centre in Carmacks. In Carmacks, the inquest heard from some of Blackjack's family and friends. They described her as a kind and loving person with a lively sense of humour.  The inquest jury heard that Blackjack had problems with alcohol, but her cousin, Dacia Tulk, testified that Blackjack was excited to start a new job with the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation. Blackjack's friend, Vanessa Charlie, said the ambulance she called for Blackjack took more than two hours to arrive. According to logs entered as evidence, it took the ambulance 20 minutes to get to Blackjack and another 20 to get her to the health centre. Witnesses in Carmacks also testified that nurses at the health centre are frequently dismissive of Indigenous patients, especially if those patients have been drinking. ""They [health centre staff] weren't very nice,"" Tulk said. ""Not at all."" Charlie also told jurors that three weeks after Blackjack's death, she called an ambulance for a white man in the community. That time, she said, the ambulance arrived in 10 minutes.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-whitehorse-1.5436843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,N/A
302,Anonymous,2020-01-22T20:46:49.552Z,"Risk of new coronavirus spreading to the North low, say territories' top doctors","Health officials in the Northwest Territories and Yukon say the risk of the new coronavirus spreading to the territories is probably low. Dr. Kami Kandola, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer, said her office is monitoring the situation and that right now, the majority of reported cases globally are related to exposure in Wuhan, the city in mainland China where the virus was first reported. There are no direct flights to Canada from Wuhan, said Kandola, and Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports are screening travellers who are at risk.     ""It's just important that the initial ports of entry won't be through Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — it will be through these larger cities,"" she said.  The coronavirus belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging in severity; from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), says the Public Health Agency of Canada. Coronavirus is not currently as serious as SARS, said Kandola, but it's likely the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases. As of Jan. 20, 282 cases of the virus were confirmed, and six people had died, according to the World Health Organization. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the United States, and all are linked to people who had travelled from mainland China.   ""The situation right now, from the Public Health Agency of Canada is that the risk is extremely low,"" said Kandola. However, she added, that can change with the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, when millions of people travel around China and abroad.  ""We don't know what the situation is going to be after that,"" she said.  Kandola urges people travelling between Canada and China to look at travel advice issued by the Canadian government. In Yukon, chief medical officer Brendan Hanley said the risk of seeing the virus in Yukon is ""probably fairly low,"" but said it's worth being vigilant. ""I mean, look how kind of random it was that it showed up in Seattle. It's something we need to be vigilant for, prepared for ... We don't want to miss that case, should it arrive,"" he said. At the Nova Hotel in Yellowknife on Tuesday, tourists expressed mixed feelings about the coronavirus outbreak.  Sandy Lee, a traveller from San Francisco with roots in Hong Kong, said she's ""getting nervous.""  ""Hopefully we can prepare,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I don't know, because now Chinese New Year is coming up [and] people will be going back to their own region to visit their relatives."" Bing Yem is a visitor from Toronto whose family is originally from mainland China.  ""We can manage the situation ... no worries,"" he said, adding he believes China's government will be able to control the situation. ""Our friends in China, they still travel,"" he said. The symptoms of coronavirus mimic other common viruses, such as a fever, coughing and shortness of breath, said Kandola.  She said people can protect themselves and others by washing their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds, and by coughing and sneezing into a tissue or their elbow. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.  While the risk of catching the new virus is low, other viruses, such as influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are circulating around the territory. Kandola said people with cold- and flu-like symptoms should stay home, and if their symptoms are severe, they should go to the emergency room. Front-line health practitioners are being told to ask patients about their recent travel history to Wuhan, said Kandola. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/coronavirus-nwt-risk-1.5435448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-tlicho-region-whooping-cough-1.5428641,N/A

As of Wednesday, there have been 544 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17 deaths. At least one confirmed case has been reported in the U.S. Symptoms of coronaviruses, which are a large family of viruses, cause a range of illnesses from the common cold to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).

304,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:20:36.259Z,"Air bag woes force Honda, Toyota to recall 6M vehicles","Two different air bag glitches have forced Toyota and Honda to recall over six million vehicles worldwide, and both problems present different dangers to motorists. The Toyota recall affects about 3.4 million vehicles globally and is being done because the air bags may not inflate in a crash. The cars have air bag control computers made by ZF-TRW that are vulnerable to electrical interference and may not signal the bags to inflate. The problem could affect as many as 12.3 million vehicles in the U.S. made by six companies. It's possible that as many as eight people were killed when air bags didn't inflate. U.S. safety regulators are investigating. Honda's recall covers about 2.7 million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada with Takata air bag inflators. But they're a different version than the ones blamed for 25 deaths worldwide. Still, it's possible the air bags could blow apart a metal canister and hurl shrapnel at drivers and passengers. Both recalls were announced on Tuesday. In a statement, Toyota said the computer may not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can happen in crashes, such as when the vehicle runs under a different vehicle. The problem can cause incomplete opening of the air bags, or they may not open at all. Devices that prepare seat belts for a collision also may not work. In most cases Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control computer and a wiring harness. But in some vehicles dealers will inspect the computer to determine if it needs the filter. Owners will be notified by mid-March. The recall covers certain 2011-19 Corollas, the 2011 to 2013 Matrix, the 2012 through 2018 Avalon and the 2013 to 2018 Avalon Hybrid in the U.S. Toyota wouldn't say if it will offer loaner cars to people who fear their air bags might not protect them. A spokeswoman suggested that owners call its customer hotline to discuss their issue at (800) 333-4331. In March of 2017, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating problems with ZF-TRW air bag computers. The probe was expanded in April of last year to 12.3 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Fiat Chrysler from the 2010 through 2019 model years. Toyota joins Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler in issuing recalls for the problem. Four deaths that may have been caused by the problem were reported in Hyundai-Kia vehicles and three in Fiat Chrysler automobiles. The investigation was upgraded after investigators found two serious crashes involving 2018 and 2019 Toyota Corollas in which the air bags did not inflate. One person was killed. Toyota said it's cooperating in the probe, which is continuing. NHTSA is evaluation how susceptible the air bag control units are to electrical signals as well as other factors that could stop air bags from inflating. In documents, the agency said that it didn't find any other cases of electrical interference in Hyundai, Kia or Fiat Chrysler vehicles that used the ZF-TRW system but were not recalled. The Honda recall, also announced Friday, covers certain Honda and Acura vehicles from the 1996 to 2003 model years. Honda vehicles included are the 1998 to 2000 Accord Coupe and Sedan, the 1996 to 2000 Civic coupe and sedan, the 1997 to 2001 CR-V, the 1998 to 2001 Odyssey and the 1997 and 1998 EV Plus. Acura vehicles covered are the 1997 and 1998 2.2CL, the 1997 to 1999 3.0CL, the 1998 and 1999 2.3CL, the 2001 and 2002 3.2CL, the 2001 and 2002 MDX, the 1998 to 2003 3.5RL, and the 1999 to 2001 3.2TL. The front driver's inflators being recalled are part of a recall announced by Takata in November covering at least 1.4 million vehicles from five automakers. Honda said it's recalling a larger number of vehicles to make sure it gets all of the bad inflators. In this case, the inflators don't contain ammonium nitrate, which is blamed for previous Takata problems that have killed 25 people and injured hundreds worldwide. But three of the newly recalled inflators exploded and hurled shrapnel, two in Japan and one in Texas that injured a driver, Honda said in a statement. The company said in all three cases, the inflators were exposed to excessive moisture. In Texas, the car had a salvage title with a date that coincided with a major flood, while the two cases in Japan were in salvage yards where the windows are typically left open, the company said. ""Honda believes that the risk of improper air bag deployment in its vehicles remains very low at this time, but we cannot absolutely guarantee the performance of any recalled part,"" the company said in a statement. Owners will be notified in mid-March, but replacement parts won't be available for another year, Honda said.

Today, Chimiugak lives at an outpost on the Bering Sea called Toksook Bay. At 90, she is considered an elder, and she is about to become the most well-known woman in her tiny town: She will be the first person counted in the 2020 U.S. census, taken every 10 years to apportion representation in Congress and federal money. ""Elders that were before me, if they didn't die too early, I wouldn't have been the first person counted,"" Chimiugak said, speaking Yup'ik language of Yugtun, with family members serving as interpreters. ""Right now, they're considering me as an elder, and they're asking me questions I'm trying my best to give answers to, or to talk about what it means to be an elder."" The decennial U.S. census has started in rural Alaska, out of tradition and necessity, ever since the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. The ground is still frozen, which allows easier access before the spring melt makes many areas inaccessible to travel and residents scatter to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. The mail service is spotty in rural Alaska and the internet connectivity unreliable, which makes door-to-door surveying important. The rest of the nation, including more urban areas of Alaska, begin the census in mid-March. On Tuesday, Steven Dillingham, director of the census bureau, will conduct the first interview. Because of federal privacy laws, the bureau won't confirm Chimiugak will be the first person counted, even though it's the worst kept secret in her hometown. After the count, a celebration is planned at Nelson Island School. It will feature local Alaska Native dancers and traditional food, which could include seal, walrus, muskox and moose. Robert Pitka, tribal administrator for Nunakauyak Traditional Council, hopes the takeaway message for the rest of the nation is of Yup'ik pride. ""We are Yup'ik people and that the world will see that we are very strong in our culture and our traditions and that our Yup'ik language is very strong."" For Chimiugak, she has concerns about climate change and what it might do to future generations of subsistence hunters and fishers in the community, as well as the fish and animals. She plans to talk about it with others at the celebration. ""She's sad about the future,"" her eldest son Paul said. Chimiugak was born just after the start of the Great Depression in western Alaska, her daughter Katie Schwartz of Springfield, Missouri, said. Chimiugak was one of 10 siblings born to parents who lived a nomadic lifestyle and traveled with two or three other families that would migrate together, her son said. Chimiugak and her 101-year-old sister from Nightmute, Alaska, are still living. In 1947 Chimiugak married George Chimiugak, and they eventually settled in Toksook Bay after the town was founded in 1964 by residents of nearby Nightmute. There are five surviving children. George worked maintenance at the airport and she did janitorial work at the old medical clinic and babysat. Like other wives, she cleaned fish, tanned hides and rendered seal oil after her husband came home from fishing or hunting. Her husband died about 30 years ago. Chimiugak is also a woman of strong Catholic faith, and told her son that she saved his life by praying over him after he contracted polio. For hobbies, she weaves baskets from grass and remains a member of the Alaska Native dance group, which will perform Tuesday. Chimiugak will be dancing in her wheelchair. She taught children manners and responsibility and continued the oral tradition of telling them stories with a story knife. Chimiugak used a knife in the mud to illustrate her stories to school children. She drew figures for people or homes. At the end of the story, she'd use the knife to wipe away the pictures and start the next story with a clean slate of mud. ""She's a great teacher, you know, giving reminders to us of how we're supposed to be, taking care of subsistence and taking care of our family and respecting our parents,"" her granddaughter Alice Tulik said. ""That's how she would give us advice.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/native-alaska-elder-us-census-1.5434762,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/alaska-population-decrease-1.5420850 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/skagway-news-owners-giveaway-1.5431784,N/A

William Acorn, 83, of Charlottetown was originally charged last fall, as a result of an investigation by the major crime unit of Charlottetown police into a historical sexual assault complaint. Those charges included sexual assault, sexual touching and invitation to sexual touching. Four new charges, including sexual assault, were laid Nov. 20 by Charlottetown police. They involve the same alleged victim as the previous charges. All of the alleged incidents involving that victim took place between 2009 and 2014. At a brief court hearing Wednesday in Charlottetown provincial court, defence lawyer Brendan Hubley appeared on Acorn's behalf. It was the first court date for the case, since police filed the additional charges.  Hubley told Judge John Douglas that electronic equipment had been seized and is currently being analyzed by police.  Crown prosecutor Nathan Beck told the judge the prosecutor's office does not know when the analysis will be complete. Acorn is also charged with secretly making a video recording for a sexual purpose. That incident, alleged to have taken place in 2017 according to court documents, involved three victims. In addition, he is charged with making a death threat against the child victim, and with improper storage of a firearm. That firearm was a Smith and Wesson revolver, according to court documents. Acorn was known for hosting Bill's Country Jamboree, a P.E.I. cable television show that ran for 25 years. He worked as a deputy sheriff in the provincial courts until his retirement. Acorn has not entered pleas on any of the charges, and the charges have not been proven in court. He did not attend court Wednesday. The case was adjourned to Jan. 30.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bill-acorn-sexual-assault-charges-1.5344636 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewer-clog-charlottetown-1.5435153,N/A

""You know when I got in this chair, I'm going to be very honest, my attitude toward persons with disabilities and wheelchairs was very ignorant, and when I say ignorant, I mean not knowing,"" Leer told host Carolina de Ryk on Daybreak North.  ""The thing was I realized everybody in a wheelchair is the same as you and I ... The problem is the space we've allowed for all the humans in the world is not designated for a wheelchair."" Leer says one example is when she tries to park her car. Leer continued her work as a traffic instructor after the accident, in part by using a specialized vehicle that she can drive while sitting in her wheelchair.  However, the vehicle requires a lot of space around it so that she can get in and out of her car safely. To get in, she presses an automatic button on a remote to extend a five-foot ramp out of the drivers side. The wheelchair itself is around three-feet wide.  ""[Any parking space] needs to have an extra, I say, 12 feet beside of it for me to park in,"" she said. And those spots are hard to come by. Leer tries to park next to empty spots, but if she returns to find someone has parked in it, she has to find that person, so that they can move their car. This week, Leer met with the South Fraser Active Living group in Vancouver. The group has already petitioned local municipalities about changing their parking space bylaws.  Leer has already reached out to the provincial and federal governments.  B.C.'s Social Development and Poverty Reduction Minister Shane Simpson said Leer's experience highlights the need to make the province more inclusive and accessible.  ""We're developing the province's first accessibility legislation, which will be informed by the ideas, experiences and feedback we heard from people like Kristen,"" Simpson said. ""We know there's more to be done, but our government is making accessibility a priority."" His ministry says one aim of the legislation would be to create accessibility standards.  Leer said she'll be reaching out to her mayor and council next.  ""When you can't get around in your area, there's no point in being anywhere and people are staying home because of it,"" Leer said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessibility-fort-nelson-1.5430035,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housebound-by-snow-disability-advocate-pleads-shovel-your-sidewalks-1.5427600 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessible-taxis-vancouver-1.5234791 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-curious-case-of-the-misplaced-curb-1.5002770,N/A
309,Sara Minogue,2020-01-21T20:23:24.880Z,Giant Mine's remediation team still has a to-do list,"The Giant Mine remediation team opened public hearings in Yellowknife on Monday with some big promises.  ""The project will provide value to residents, and return a site that is greatly improved,"" said project director Chris MacInnis.  MacInnis also laid out the stakes of any delays to the cleanup: anywhere from $15 to $20 million in extra costs to the taxpayer for every year the cleanup is delayed.  The team is presenting its final closure and remediation plan to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board this week in the hope of obtaining a 20-year water licence and a five-year land use permit. It's the last major hurdle before the $1-billion cleanup finally begins.  But MacInnis made it clear that the final closure plan may not be completely final.  ""It is only with the confidence of an approved final closure and reclamation plan that the project can complete the final detailed design,"" MacInnis said. ""We have proposed a phased approach to submissions that will present these detailed designs to the board for approval to allow active remediation work at the Giant Mine site to start in 2021."" In other remarks, Natalie Plato, the remediation team's deputy director, explained that the team had yet to file a quantitative risk assessment, ordered by the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board. She promised that would be done by February, before the water licence is issued.  She also said a planned stress study, part of the team's health effects monitoring, had yet to take place. The study is expected to look at how stress related to the possibility of arsenic exposure may affect human health. Plato said they don't believe this should be a condition of the water licence, as it will not affect project design, but rather, how the project engages with the public. The board will hold four more days of hearings — on top of months of presentations — to determine whether that phased approach can satisfy all parties who want to see the work done right. More than 100 people attended Monday's session. At least one interested person is confident the project is going in the right direction. Ed Sangris, Dettah chief for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, opened his remarks by saying that Giant Mine ""significantly and fundamentally changed the people of the Yellowknives Dene.""  And while Sangris said it was a little strange to be holding hearings after so much important work at the site had already happened, such as the dismantling of the roasting complex and the removal of the headframe (both deemed safety priorities), he's optimistic about the process.  ""Giant Mine has never benefited the Yellowknives Dene. We were not consulted and we did not receive any compensation from Giant,"" he said.  ""With this process, we have the opportunity … to return to what was taken from us, the opportunity to reconcile with the past, the opportunity to change."" The hearings continue on Tuesday.

""I feel like it is my responsibility to take care of this. It's the minimum I could do,"" he said. Masoumeh Ghavi and her sister, Mahdieh, died two weeks ago when Iranian forces shot down Ukraine International Flight 752 as it left Tehran. Fifty-seven Canadians were killed — revised down from an earlier estimate of 63 — plus dozens of students travelling to Canada to study. Masoumeh had been studying engineering at Dalhousie University since August. In her apartment on Queen Street, the apples in the refrigerator were still fresh. ""I still am shocked. I can't believe she's gone. I was texting with her right before takeoff. She was giving me the time that she would get here, so I could pick her up. It's really hard,"" Hamidi said. He's been close with Ghavi's father for 20 years. She was working part time for his technology company while she studied. Her younger sister, Mahdieh, was travelling to Halifax for the first time, also to study. Masoumeh bought a new toaster and kettle for their apartment, which were still in the box as Hamidi packed them up. This process of packing up is being repeated in homes across the country. ""Everybody who knows ... anybody who has been in this tragic accident, you feel pretty much the same. They all are in pain,"" Hamidi said. One of the men helping Hamidi empty the apartment broke down weeping as he watched two others dismantle Masoumeh's bedframe.

312,Jason Warick,2020-01-22T12:00:00.202Z,Proposed oil project in northwest Saskatchewan generates controversy,"A proposed oil project in northwest Saskatchewan is fueling controversy. Calgary-based Serafina Energy plans to extract 8,000 barrels of oil per day near Glenbogie, which is near the town of St. Walburg about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. The Serafina Glenbogie SAGD project will require nearly five million litres of water per day from the North Saskatchewan River. The provincial government said the project does not require an environmental impact assessment, according to a Ministry of Environment document. That's not sitting well with Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation Chief Ron Mitsuing. He said the project must not go ahead until their questions are answered around water use, waste water and other issues. ""Not right now, until all the concerns are met. For sure, the water and how it's going to affect our lakes. Everything that happens there is going to flow directly to our lakes,"" Mitsuing said. Grant Ferguson, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security, said more testing should be done before resource projects such as Serafina's are approved. He said there also needs to be a broader public debate over the best uses for Saskatchewan's finite fresh water supplies. The government document said the water taken represents 0.03 per cent of the river's total flow. Ferguson noted that amount will be taken out of the water cycle daily for 20 years and that while the Serafina project is large, it's one of many oil and gas projects removing fresh water from the system. ""At the end of the day, that water is not going back into the hydrological cycle,"" he said. The proposed project will extract oil through a relatively new but increasingly popular method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). It's used for solid bitumen deposits which can't easily be pumped to the surface through previous cold water methods. With SAGD, steam is injected hundreds of metres underground and let out through pipes running horizontally through the desired layer of bitumen rock. The bitumen melts and seeps into another pipe, and is then pumped to the surface for processing. The waste water will be injected into the ground. That's a common method, but in the Estevan region and other jurisdictions the water is released much deeper. Many of the regulations are federal and provincial, but some of the approvals were granted at the local level. The rural municipality of Frenchman Butte approved Serafina's water intake proposal and its plan to construct a thermal plant, subject to a number of conditions. When asked if the RM supports the overall project, RM Reeve Bonnie Mills Midgley said the approval process ""speaks for itself."" Mills Midgley said she and her council may have more detailed comments following a meeting later this week. Serafina spokesman Chris Bartole said a small initial drill is underway and will be reclaimed immediately afteward. Bartole said the regulatory process is continuing and they continue to engage with Indigenous communities. ""Our objective has always been to respond meaningfully to any concerns brought to Serafina's attention by First Nation and Métis communities. He said there's no set date for construction of the main project. The work done on the Glenbogie project is ""the most comprehensive assessment ever conducted for this type of development in Saskatchewan."" He said much of the land selected has been recently harvested by the forestry industry or approved for future harvest, and they've taken special precautions to protect groundwater. CBC News also requested interviews with officials from the provincial government and the town of St. Walburg. Neither request was granted. Ferguson said the oil and gas industry has a long history in the province and has provided many jobs. That's made government regulators comfortable, even ""complacent,"" about the environmental effects, he said. ""We've gone forward with these things without ever really going through the rigorous environmental assessments done in other places,"" he said. ""We do need better baseline information."" The drilling area includes several plant species deemed ""extremely rare,"" such as Michigan moonwort, white bog adder's mouth and smooth wild rose, according to the Ministry of Environment document. To minimize impact, Serafina is promising to start construction outside of growing season and to preserve topsoil for replanting. Part of the project is located on pasture or crop land, and the rest is within the Bronson Provincial Forest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/oil-project-generates-controverst-1.5434928,[],N/A
313,Steve Silva,2020-01-22T19:09:32.574Z,'Kind of surprising': Yukon sisters denied switch to shorter Yukon Quest race,"Two sisters from Mendenhall, Yukon, say they're disappointed they won't be able to compete in the Yukon Quest this year, in part, because it's too late to switch to a shorter sled-dog race. Lori Tweddell, 18, her twin sister Louve Tweddell planned to compete in the annual 1,609 kilometre sled-dog race between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse this winter. Those plans changed after the twins recently failed to finish a qualification race. In order to qualify for the Yukon Quest, racers must have completed a 483-kilometre race and a 322-kilometre race in the previous three and a half years. Last year, the Tweddells successfully completed the Yukon Quest's shorter race, known as the Yukon Quest 300. They set out to complete a 483-kilometre race in Alaska earlier this month, but decided to quit halfway through. ""Sadly, I could not finish the race, and the condition that the trail was [in], and the weather, and I guess bad luck as well played a major role,"" Lori said. While this meant they couldn't compete in the longer Yukon Quest race, the sisters hoped they'd be able to instead run the Yukon Quest 300 again this year. But that's not possible, according to Shayna Hammer, executive director of the Yukon Quest International Association (Canada). The deadline to apply for or switch to either race was Jan. 3. Others have tried to join after that date but were declined, Hammer said. ""I was really upset because we prepared for years,"" said Lori. ""It could be understandable, but we had registered, we paid for everything,"" Louve said. ""It was just kind of surprising not to be accepted."" Frank Turner, a previous Yukon Quest winner, said the Tweddells should be allowed to participate. ""You don't protect the bad rule by saying, 'That's the way it was done in the past.' If it's a bad rule now, then it should be dealt with now,"" he told Radio-Canada. Hammer said the Yukon Quest's board, which consists of representatives from the U.S. and Canada, will make a recommendation to the rules committee to prevent a situation like the Tweddells' from happening again. There is currently an acting rules committee for the event, since the previous six-member committee resigned last summer after reviewing the rules.   Speaking on Tuesday, Hammer referred to ""some differing directions between the [former] rules committee and the organization,"" but said she didn't know the exact reasons for the schism.  The acting rules committee plans to meet this spring.  Fifteen teams are registered for the longer race this year, and 21 teams are set to run the Yukon Quest 300. Both events begin Feb. 1 in Fairbanks, Alaska. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-sisters-races-1.5435216,https://www.cbc.ca/archives/broken-legs-hypothermia-dogs-the-yukon-quest-1.5004546 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bike-winter-high-school-fat-bike-yukon-year-round-1.5431709,N/A
314,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-23T17:01:50.351Z,Doomsday Clock moves ahead to 100 seconds to midnight,"In its annual announcement, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock ahead to 100 seconds to midnight. The clock was introduced in 1947 and is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to destroying civilization. Typically, the hands are moved forward or back depending on how vulnerable the world is. Midnight represents a catastrophe. While the hands of the clock typically move a minute at a time, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved it forward by 30 seconds in 2017 and 2018, stopping at two minutes to midnight. It remained unchanged in 2019. ""It is 100 seconds to midnight. We are now expressing how close the world is to catastrophe in seconds — not hours, or even minutes,"" said Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ""It is the closest to Doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Doomsday Clock. We now face a true emergency — an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error or further delay."" In making the announcement, Bronson said the clock needed to be recalibrated — which is why it was moved 20 seconds — due to new concerns not taken into account in the past, including climate change. The farthest the clock's hands have been from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, at the end of the Cold War.  ""What we called the new abnormal last year … now has become apparently an enduring reality,"" said Robert Rosner, chair of the bulletin's science and security board. In reaching their decision — which was made in November — the scientists said they took into account three concerning issues: nuclear weapons, climate change and cyber-based disinformation. ""As long as nuclear weapons remain in existence, it is inevitable that they will one day be used, whether by accident, miscalculation or design,"" said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, a group of world leaders working to promote human rights and other important world issues. Sivan Kartha, a member of the bulletin's science and security board and senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute, said the state of the world demands an emergency response, citing the record-breaking heat waves and floods in India, recent hurricanes and the wildfires that raged from the Arctic to Australia in 2019. ""If the Earth warms by what we tend to think of just a few degrees … we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization,"" said Kartha, who was also the author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Former California governor Jerry Brown, who is the bulletin's executive chair, gave a fiery speech. He said while he's not a scientist, he recognizes the importance of the symbolic clock and that it's the only way to let the world know the threats to civilization. ""We're on the Titanic ready to hit an iceberg,"" Brown said.

315,Keith Boag,2020-01-22T10:34:41.585Z,Trump's defenders emboldened by their certainty of a win: Keith Boag,"""Why should this trial be different than any other trial?"" asked U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff as he opened the Democrats' case for convicting the president and removing him from office. ""The short answer is, it shouldn't."" But of course Schiff knows that politics assures the impeachment trial will be different, and in the most important ways. The Republican Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, drafted rules for the trial that allowed the possibility there might be no witnesses heard and no evidence presented even from the House investigation that produced the articles of impeachment that form the basis for the prosecution.  Watch: Rep. Adam Schiff makes his argument against the proposed trial rules On Tuesday, on the first day of the trial, Republicans rejected three Democratic efforts to obtain documents and evidence.  A trial without witnesses and evidence is not a trial, the Democrats complain — a seemingly compelling argument on the face of it. But the Senate is not a courtroom, and McConnell is proud to say the majority of his ""jurors"" are in lockstep with the White House to assure an acquittal. And that's the crucial distinction between any other trial and the Senate's trial of Donald Trump. The verdict is effectively already in: Democrats need 67 votes to convict and they don't have them — they're 20 short. Republicans believe they can't lose. So the battle over the rules governing evidence, witnesses and so on isn't really about the case Republicans and Democrats can make to the Senate so much as it's about the case they can make to the TV viewing audience.  That's a battle about whether the public will perceive the seemingly inevitable acquittal of Trump as justice or a sham. It's about what Americans are allowed to see and to hear to help them make up their own minds about whether to remove the president from office when they have that chance in November's election. With no easily imagined way to lose the case, Trump's defenders seem emboldened to embrace some brazen tactics, like using the platform of the trial to spread demonstrably false, easily discredited claims. ""The president has done nothing wrong,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone assured everyone in his opening statement for the president's defence Tuesday. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. That's certainly the president's position. But Cipollone knows that it's officially untrue that the president did nothing wrong.  A report last week from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said the president flat out broke the law. It said he violated the Impoundment Control Act when he directed a freeze on nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved — the exact thing at the very heart of the impeachment case. Cipillone also repeated a false characterization of the House intelligence committee's investigation of Trump when he said Democrats held secret meetings in a basement office on Capitol Hill.  It's true neither the public nor the media were invited to those meetings, but that hardly makes them secret. Some 48 Republican members of Congress had access to the meetings and were allowed to ask questions, nine of them sitting on the committee itself. The testimony and evidence they all saw and heard — the Republicans included — they all kept secret, as they are routinely required to do in those circumstances. There was one truly secret detail about the House investigation: The ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, was apparently personally involved in the Ukraine scandal and didn't tell anybody. It seems he and a member of his staff were secretly active players in what Nunes nevertheless publicly dismissed as nothing but a ""hoax"" while he sat on the committee hearings about it.  That inconvenient little bombshell was alleged by Lev Parnas, a small-time operator and indicted (for campaign finance schemes) former associate of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas unexpectedly started blabbing to the media in lengthy interviews last week, and he had a lot to say. If the Trump team hadn't been so sure that the Senate trial was a lock, they might have worked harder to get to the bottom of the story so they'd be better prepared to contain the blast when the former Giuliani conniver turned against them.  Parnas — until recently a supporter of Trump — described a broad conspiracy to lean on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and extort political favours from him to help re-elect Trump in November. He tied the conspiracy directly to Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and Nunes, among others, and he produced documentary evidence.  Both the president and Nunes have said they hardly know Parnas. But photographs of Parnas with the president, and the fact Parnas seems to have Nunes's cellphone number, argue otherwise. The White House brushed it all aside with a comment about Parnas's criminal indictment and a suggestion he can't be trusted to tell the truth. But this is the risk of Trump, and Republicans have known it since the beginning: They have no idea from one day to the next what they might be called upon to defend.    Now, and with the spotlight on them, there really is no telling what they might be asked to swallow in this unique trial that Trump and his team believe they can't possibly lose, no matter the evidence. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A
316,Katie Toth,2020-01-20T23:00:51.099Z,Workshop to train N.W.T. health-care workers about vaccine-hesitant parents,"In the midst of a whooping cough outbreak in the Northwest Territories, the territory's chief public health officer is addressing one factor in the spread of the disease: families who hesitate to vaccinate their children.  On Wednesday, chief public health officer Kami Kandola said there were 20 lab-confirmed cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis, in Yellowknife, Behchoko and Whati. Four other people are believed to have the infection based on a mix of symptoms and epidemiological links. Eleven of the 24 people who got whooping cough were unvaccinated, according to the territorial health department. In a press conference on Thursday, Kandola said this was partially because of ""vaccine-hesitant parents, absolutely."" Canada sets targets for ideal vaccine uptake, Kandola told CBC News on Monday. For the vaccine that responds to pertussis, Canada has a target of 95 per cent uptake. But in the Northwest Territories, as of 2017, only 80 per cent of two year olds had received the vaccine. ""We are below the target, and I'm hoping that with ... spreading the word we can get more and more parents to make sure that the children are up-to-date on their vaccines,"" said Kandola. Kandola was speaking outside a workshop that was organized months before the pertussis outbreak. The Canadian Pediatric Society was training front-line health workers on how to deal with parental hesitancy to vaccines. According to the the Northwest Territories' health department, 52 people in the N.W.T. and Yukon took part in the workshop.  Dr. Sam Wong, the president-elect of the Canadian Pediatric Society, chaired the event. He has a message for front-line workers who deal with vaccine hesitancy: keep the lines of communication open and stay patient. Wong, who also works as a consulting pediatrician in the Northwest Territories, says it's important for health care providers to listen to parents' questions and concerns so they can offer evidence-based answers.  ""We always hear about the 'anti-vaccine people,'"" Wong said to CBC News, adding it's much more common for parents to be unsure about vaccines than opposed outright. ""If their concerns are addressed then they may actually be interested in actually having their child vaccinated.  ""Sometimes it takes a little bit of communication to find out what the concerns are."" Wong says there have been times where he had three or four conversations and doctor's visits before a parent became interested in immunizing their child against diseases like pertussis or measles, mumps and rubella.  The Canadian Pediatric Society suggests providers ask patients and their parents about what the fears are so they can be addressed, and focus on the issues on the parents' minds. For example, if pain is the concern, Wong would let a parent know babies under three months — who haven't yet experienced the world of solid food — can be distracted from it with a few drops of sugar water. ""Babies are not exposed to a lot of flavours ... it's kind of mind blowing for their taste buds. They're like, 'Whoa, what is this that's in my mouth?' They don't actually feel the pain."" Hesitancy to vaccines is not the only reason people fall behind on their shots. Sometimes other commitments result in families postponing immunization appointments.  Kandola also wants people to stay on top of any booster shots they may need. In the case of this pertussis outbreak, five of the people who contracted whooping cough had been vaccinated in the past, but didn't have their shots up to date. Some vaccines require multiple doses to remain robust, and no vaccine is 100 per cent effective.  She says even families who are vaccinated should call their public health office if they have pertussis-like symptoms.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-vaccine-hesitation-workshop-1.5433106,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-cheat-sheet-1.5431394 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whooping-cough-pertussis-nwt-confirmed-1.5396024,N/A
317,Sophia Harris,2020-01-23T09:00:00.107Z,"U.S. border officers were told to target Iranian-born travellers, officer alleges in email","U.S. border officers working at multiple Canada-U.S. border crossings were instructed to target and interrogate Iranian-born travellers in early January, said a U.S. border officer in an email obtained by CBC News.  The allegation follows reports that up to 200 people of Iranian descent travelling from B.C. — many of them Canadian or U.S. citizens — were detained and questioned for hours at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, Wash., during the weekend of Jan. 4.  On Friday, Jan. 3, the U.S. assassinated Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, intensifying tensions between the two countries.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told CBC News that the ""current threat environment"" prompted it to implement an ""enhanced posture"" at the border. However, it denied detaining Iranian-born travellers and said the delays at the Peace Arch crossing were related to staffing issues during a busy holiday weekend.  The U.S. border officer challenges CBP's claims in an email he sent to Blaine-based immigration lawyer, Len Saunders. Social media posts that CBP is detaining Iranian-Americans and refusing their entry into the U.S. because of their country of origin are false. Reports that DHS/CBP has issued a related directive are also false. Saunders believes the officer reached out to him because the lawyer has been openly critical of how CBP allegedly treated Iranian-born travellers.  Saunders confirmed the U.S. officer's identity and said that he works on the front lines. He asked that CBC News keep the officer's name confidential, because the person fears repercussions from his employer.  To further protect the officer's identity, CBC isn't directly quoting from the page-long email.  In it, the officer told Saunders that CBP's Seattle Field Office — which covers the Canada-U.S. border from Washington State to Minnesota — directed border officers to ask Iranian-born travellers counterterrorism questions.  The officer claimed that the sole reason Iranian travellers were detained and questioned that weekend was due to their ethnicity. He alleged that the operation was unethical and possibly unconstitutional. In his email, the officer also told Saunders that after the detainment of Iranian-born travellers made national news on Jan. 5, the operation was suspended. CBP declined to comment on the content of the email without reviewing it first. To protect the officer's identity, CBC declined to send it. Saunders said he also recently spoke with another U.S. border officer who worked the weekend of Jan. 4 at a Washington State border crossing different from the Peace Arch. Saunders said the officer confirmed the Seattle Field Office had directed frontline staff to target Iranian-born travellers.  ""It confirms my suspicion that this was not just happening at Peach Arch,"" said Saunders. He also said that the officers' claims confirm his beliefs about how Iranian-born travellers were treated at the border.  ""They violated American constitutional rights by interrogating them and detaining them,"" alleges Saunders. ""What's next? Where does it stop?""  Although there are allegations that travellers with ties to Iran were targeted at multiple U.S. border crossings, Saunders believes the focus has been on the Peace Arch because a big group of Iranian-Americans travelled through that crossing Jan. 4, on their way home from a concert in Vancouver.  ""It was because there was a large group that it got attention. That was just by chance,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's a lot more cases we don't know about."" Not all Iranian-born travellers held at the Peace Arch in Blaine were returning home from a concert.  Iranian-born Canadian citizen, Sam Sadr of North Vancouver said he and three relatives were heading to Seattle when they were detained at the crossing for more than eight hours on Jan. 4.  ""Why us?"" said Sadr who was visiting the U.S. for the first time. He said he counted more than 120 people of Iranian heritage being held for questioning that day. ""As soon as they released me, I told the officer, 'This is called discrimination.'""  Negah Hekmati, an Iranian-born U.S. Citizen, was returning home with her husband and two children after a ski weekend in Canada. She said her family was held for questioning at the Peace Arch crossing for five hours during the early hours of Sunday.  ""They had our car keys, they had our passports,"" she said during a news conference on Jan. 6. ""I am here today because of my kids. They shouldn't experience such things. They are U.S. citizens and this is not OK."" To get to the bottom of what happened, 70 U.S. congress members sent a letter to CBP on Jan. 6, demanding answers. ""We are deeply concerned about the experiences of those impacted this past weekend and the potential that this may be the start of a new policy at our borders and airports illegally targeting those of Iranian descent,"" stated the letter.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is now investigating the matter.  CBP declined to comment on the investigation. ""As a matter of policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not comment on pending litigation,"" spokesperson Mike Niezgoda said in an email. Homeland Security didn't respond to CBC's request for comment. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-border-peach-arch-crossing-iranian-travellers-cbp-1.5436384,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/iranian-canadians-detained-interrogated-at-us-border-1.5415782 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/iranian-canadians-detained-interrogated-at-us-border-jayapal-congress-1.5416404 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/preclearance-act-federal-government-u-s-border-1.5429662,N/A
318,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old started Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago and since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, covering a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When Burke was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died as the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaning off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into the driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. He was a mess and he got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.  ""Like 'How can I help? How can I move this forward? Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke — no relation to Matt — was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years, from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his life and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month ago and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing on the podcast was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example — that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died Matt was in shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said. ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does, is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at a time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person, ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recent guest on the podcast. McPhee said listening to Matt and his guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence to take his turn at the microphone. When McPhee was younger he struggled with his mental health, and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they can be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizing a traumatic story, to ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listeners walk away with is that mental health issues are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, Matt does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

319,Erica Johnson,2019-05-13T19:21:56.898Z,RBC customer out of pocket after fraud: What you need to know if you e-transfer money,"A system to transfer money online — used over a million times a day in Canada — is not as safe as it advertises, says a Royal Bank customer who had $1,734 stolen during an e-transfer. The theft occurred after Anne Hoover of Peterborough, Ont., e-transferred money from her RBC account to her friend Fran Fearnley, only to have a fraudster intercept the transaction and divert the money to his own account at another bank. ""I always use e-transfer,"" says Hoover. ""I thought it was a safe way to send money."" An RBC manager says an internal investigation indicated that Fearnley's email account had been hacked, and when Hoover sent the e-transfer, the fraudster figured out the answer for the security question necessary to deposit the money, and then redirected it to a different bank account. An expert in online privacy protection and security says financial institutions have opted for convenience over security, which makes strong email passwords and equally strong e-transfer questions and passwords essential. ""How you manage those passwords is very important,"" says Claudiu Popa, author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook and a cybersecurity expert who advises government and companies. ""Banks and financial institutions have made it very easy to transfer money via email. Unfortunately, with convenience comes lack of security."" Hoover and Fearnley had just returned from a trip to Mexico on March 18, when Hoover went online and used her bank's Interac e-transfer system to reimburse her pal for trip expenses. But when Fearnley opened the email and tried to accept the payment, she got a message saying the e-transfer had already been deposited. The women called RBC's fraud department and a bank employee provided the name of the fraudster, his email, and said he'd transferred the money to a TD Bank account. ""This is clearly a complete stranger,"" says Fearnley. ""How could that possibly have happened?"" The two friends headed to their local RBC branch, where they are both customers — Hoover, for more than 30 years. The bank blamed the theft on Fearnley's email security. Hoover's security question to her friend was: ""Who is my favourite Beatle?"" The fraudster would have had a one in four chance of getting it right — John, Paul, George or Ringo. In a test of RBC's Interac system, Go Public was given four chances to answer the security question correctly. ""The manager continued to insist ... that it wasn't really their problem. It was now our problem,"" Hoover says. Eventually, the manager offered Hoover half the missing funds as a ""gesture of goodwill."" Hoover filed a report with Peterborough police, but an officer told her that it's difficult to clamp down on online fraud and her fight to recoup the money could take ages and would likely be fruitless. Hoover says she feels misled by the bank's website. A webpage about RBC's digital security tells customers they're ""fully protected"" and will be reimbursed ""for any unauthorized transactions."" But when Hoover pointed that out to bank officials, she was told customers aren't protected if they use weak passwords when transferring funds online. RBC declined an interview request from Go Public. In a statement, AJ Goodman, RBC's director of external communications, wrote: ""As part of our electronic access agreement, clients commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" That information is on the bank's website, but only if a customer reading RBC's ""Security Guarantee"" clicks on a few different links to get to a clause in the fine print of a section called ""Security."" Interac makes the same security promises online as RBC, telling customers in bold print that they are ""protected from fraud losses."" No one from Interac would agree to an interview with Go Public, directing questions to RBC. In a statement, the company's senior manager of external communications, Adrienne Vaughan, wrote that Canadians must ""protect their email and passwords so they do not fall victim to cybercrime and they can safely transact online."" In another, similar case, Dr. Sylvia Veith of Prince Albert, Sask., lost $7,000 when she used Interac to e-transfer money to her son's hockey league in June 2017. That money was intercepted and her bank — RBC — blamed a weak password to a security question and told the physician there was nothing that could be done. RBC would not comment on Veith's case, except to reiterate the importance of strong passwords. Police say an investigation is ongoing. ""This idea of transferring money by email is much more risky than people realize,"" says Popa. ""Companies don't report [incidents] because they don't want an investigation from the privacy commissioner, from other regulatory bodies."" Popa says people have been desensitized to the risk of email transfers ""very quickly, almost too quickly"" because they use email all the time, so they figure it's safe. What banks and other financial institutions have done, he says, is sacrifice security to get a high number of people using the system. Last year in Canada, there were more than 371 million e-transfers worth more than $132 billion, according to Interac Corp., the biggest online funds transfer service in the country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre told Go Public that it received 163 reports in 2018 involving e-transfers that were compromised, resulting in money being transferred to fraudsters. Popa did a quick search of Fearnley's email on www.haveibeenpwned.com, a website that tracks data breaches and reports almost eight billion occasions when personal accounts have been exposed. The same email address could be acquired from several different sources. Popa found her email was compromised on two sites when hackers attacked LinkedIn and Verification.io ""That means people have found those e-mail lists. They have sold them to others,"" says Popa. ""Different people have taken what they've needed from those lists, and that's how they got compromised, very likely."" The cybersecurity expert says financial institutions and Interac need to require something called ""two-factor authentication"" to better protect people's accounts. ""Every time you log into an account you need to use a second factor,"" explains Popa. ""A code that arrives as a text message or as a separate email to a different email address that is only valid for a few seconds or a few minutes after it's received."" He says the financial industry knows more security is needed, but is more concerned about getting customers to use the e-transfer system. Some financial institutions offer two-factor authentication as an option, not a requirement. Go Public asked RBC and Interac why they don't require two-factor authentication. Both declined to address the question. Hoover says she's learned the hard way that strong security questions and passwords are crucial. She's escalating her case to the RBC Ombudsman, hoping to prompt the bank to better warn customers they could be liable for losses even if they're victims of fraud. She's also closing her business account at RBC, after decades of loyalty. ""How can I feel confident [in RBC] when, in fact, I've had money stolen from me — clearly stolen,"" says Hoover. ""This isn't secure, and people need to know."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

320,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-21T22:52:34.707Z,Trudeau says he hasn't spoken to Queen about security costs after Harry arrives in Canada,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday he has yet to speak to the Queen about Prince Harry and Meghan moving to Canada — and there's no agreement between Canada and the U.K. on how to pay for the security costs associated with protecting the high-profile couple. British tabloid outlets have reported that Trudeau has agreed already that Canada would pay for the couple's security. The London-based Evening Standard reported that Trudeau has ""privately assured the Queen"" that Canada would shoulder the costs of protecting Harry and Meghan. However, Trudeau said Tuesday the Canadian government has not yet brokered such a deal. ""I have not spoken to Her Majesty directly. Discussions continue to be ongoing and I have no updates at this moment,"" Trudeau said. Speaking at the federal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg today, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said the government has not yet conducted a security ""assessment"" to learn what might be required to protect the two while they're living in Canada. He said Harry and Meghan are not receiving protection from Canadian security personnel. Canada is not paying for the guards spotted alongside the two in B.C., Blair said. The Daily Mail, citing unnamed security sources, reported Tuesday that Meghan is being protected by officers from the London Metropolitan Police with support from the RCMP. But Blair, the minister responsible for the RCMP, said that ""right now,"" RCMP officers ""are not engaged in providing those security services."" Under Canadian law, foreign security officers protecting dignitaries are forbidden from bringing firearms into the country without the ""express written authorization"" of the RCMP. A spokesperson for the RCMP said the national police force would not comment on the security arrangements. Blair said certain individuals, such as heads of state and royal family members, are considered ""internationally protected persons (IPP)"" under the UN Protection of Diplomats Convention, which obliges Canada to provide a certain level of security. The definition of an IPP, according to the Criminal Code, is limited to the Queen and other members of the Royal Family who ""[accompany] that person in a state other than the state in which that person holds that position or office."" But because Harry and Meghan essentially have renounced their royal titles, Blair said their status is in question. ""Their position as internationally protected persons has therefore changed. There is an assessment done by our officials who have a responsibility to maintain safety for people who are vulnerable within our society. And so, that work is ongoing but that has not yet been resolved,"" Blair told reporters Tuesday. Harry was reunited with his wife and his son Archie in B.C. overnight after nearly two weeks apart. Harry negotiated a separation agreement of sorts with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William last week, an agreement that included a promise to give up most of the trappings of royal life in exchange for Buckingham Palace's permission to live most of the time in Canada. During a Saturday speech, Harry said it was with ""great sadness"" that the two were separating themselves from the Royal Family and its home base in the U.K. He said he and Meghan had ""no other option"" but to cut ties in the hopes of achieving a more peaceful life. The prince, who has agreed to stop using the His Royal Highness title, flew on a commercial airline to Canada accompanied by protection officers. Photographers captured Harry leaving a WestJet aircraft on the tarmac of Victoria International Airport. The couple have agreed to stop receiving British taxpayer funds — money allocated to the couple through the Sovereign Grant — but the question of who will pay for their security remains unresolved. The estimated price tag for that sort of security varies widely, with some experts pegging the cost at $1.7 million a year and others suggesting it could be many times that amount. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has circulated a petition demanding Ottawa refuse all requests for public funds to support Harry and Meghan while they're in Canada. The petition has been signed by 80,000 people in less than a week, according the federation, a lobby group that calls for lower taxes and smaller government. ""Canadians are pleased to welcome the Duke and Duchess to Canada — but have made it crystal clear that taxpayers should not be forced to support them while they are living here,"" said Aaron Wudrick, the group's federal director. ""All Canadians wish them well as they realize their ambition of financial independence."" The paparazzi have been a source of some frustration for the couple. Meghan has been photographed almost constantly on Vancouver Island since her arrival there following the initial bombshell announcement earlier this month that she and Harry were moving to Canada. Meghan was photographed carrying baby Archie while walking two dogs in a Victoria-area park. Sky News, a British broadcasting outlet, reported Tuesday that lawyers for the couple have issued warnings to would-be paparazzi. Lawyers have said photographs of Meghan, published in British outlets like the Daily Mail and the Sun, were taken without her consent. The lawyers alleged the photographers have used long-range lenses to take pictures of Meghan inside her home, a $14-million mansion located just north of Victoria. Photographers have set up a camp of sorts near the driveway of the mansion.

321,Emma Smith,2020-01-21T23:31:25.967Z,N.S. municipality looks to create 'business park on the sea' for oyster farming,"A municipality in southwestern Nova Scotia that boasts ideal conditions for farming oysters wants producers to know it's open for business. The Municipality of the District of Argyle, which includes communities such as Pubnico, Tusket and Wedgeport, has identified 19 ocean sites it hopes to lease to companies interested in farming oysters. This ""business park on the sea"" is one of the first aquaculture developments of its kind in Canada, according to the municipality.  ""There's a large body of water that is quite warm and oysters grow there naturally,"" Charlene LeBlanc, the municipality's community development officer, told CBC's Information Morning. A handful of farms have operated in the waters off the Municipality of the District of Argyle for about 20 years, but LeBlanc said it's not easy to get the necessary permits. ""There's a lot of red tape into getting a lease, so we thought that we'd make it easier for investors to get into business for the shellfish,"" LeBlanc said. As part of that, the municipality has gathered oceanographic data on currents and tides, as well as biophysical data. ""We've been doing the legwork making it to able to get to lease a lot faster,"" she said. In 2017, the Municipality of the District of Argyle received provincial funding and started working with the province to test water quality at several sites. ""What we need to grow oysters is good pH, nice warm temperature, which we have, salinity and phytoplankton. And it's the perfect recipe in our waters,"" LeBlanc said. She said municipal staff also needed to make sure the currents were ideal and the sites didn't impede the view of homeowners or get in the way of lobster fishermen. Because oysters are suspended in the water in black mesh bags, they can cast a shadow on species below, including eelgrass. ""We certainly are not going to pick any sites that are going to be on top of eelgrass,"" LeBlanc said. Sarah Stewart-Clark, an associate professor of shellfish biology at Dalhousie University, said determining where to set up a farm has a lot to do with how much phytoplankton is there for the oysters to eat. ""You would never take the entire surface of a bay and float oyster cages in it,"" she said. ""It''s always in mind, how do we farm these filter feeders in a way that's not going to harm the environment?"" Stewart-Clark said oyster farming doesn't share the same reputation as open-pen salmon farms, which have been criticized for their use of pesticides, antibiotics and the waste that's produced. She said when the oysters eat tiny phytoplankton, they also filter the water. ""The farmers are simply adding oysters to the estuary,"" Stewart-Clark said. ""All of the food, all of the oxygen, everything that's required for the oysters to grow, comes from the natural ecosystem."" Nova Scotia can't keep up with the demand for oysters, she said. ""Sometimes on an oyster farm, oysters that are two years away from maturity are already sold, so the market is there,"" she said. The province produces about $3 million worth of farmed oysters a year, according to Stewart-Clark, while Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick produce $13 million and $12 million, respectively. ""We really play up our seafood production and when it comes to shellfish, we're not keeping up with the other Maritime provinces,"" she said.

This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy — conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.  Forecast: No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains. U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.   Forecast: Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019. Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election.

324,Anonymous,2020-01-21T16:50:18.447Z,Trump lauds U.S. economy at Davos as trial set to begin in Washington,"Thousands of kilometres from his Washington impeachment trial, U.S. President Donald Trump took centre stage in Davos, Switzerland, to tout the success of the American economy, while criticizing the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday. Trump, marking his second meeting of global political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum (WEF), also told a packed auditorium that trade deals struck this month with China and Mexico represented a model for the 21st Century. ""The Fed raised rates too quickly and has lowered them too slowly,"" Trump said, taking aim at the central bank's policy decisions. In a wide-ranging address pitched to appeal to the Davos crowd, touting the achievements of his administration despite his unorthodox approach, Trump picked up on some of the themes he voiced when he first addressed the WEF two years ago. He thanked overseas companies for investing in America and said the U.S. was on far better economic standing than he had imagined when he took office three years ago. WATCH: Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg offer differing views on climate at Davos ""The time for skepticism is over,"" Trump said as he invited more foreign money. ""To every business looking for a place to succeed...there is no better place than the U.S.,"" he added. At a conference in which the main theme is the environment, and in which climate activist Greta Thunberg is a star guest, Trump spoke about the economic importance of oil and gas. Thunberg was in the audience throughout Trump's speech. As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down. Trump said the U.S. would join the one trillion tree initiative being launched at the WEF annual meeting, but called activists ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers."" ""I'm a very big believer in the environment. I want the cleanest water and the cleanest air,"" he added. Thunberg later responded by referring to ""empty words and promises"" by world leaders. ""You say children shouldn't worry... don't be so pessimistic and then, nothing, silence."" Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz said the strongest thing about Trump's speech was that it was scheduled between sessions on climate change. He criticized Trump's swipe at climate pessimists. ""As if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there,"" Stiglitz said. ""It's astounding."" In Washington, the impeachment trial begins in earnest in the U.S. Senate after the Republican president was formally charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December with ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges. Thunberg doubled down on her criticism that world and business leaders aren't taking the threat of climate change seriously. She dismissed some of the measures bandied about by governments and companies, such as setting long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and planting billions of new trees to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. She told a panel of the WEF that ""planting trees is good of course but it's nowhere near enough."" ""It cannot replace mitigation,"" she said, referring to efforts to drastically cut emissions in the near term. Thunberg accused leaders of ""cheating and fiddling around with numbers"" by talking about cutting emissions to 'net zero' — emitting no more carbon than is absorbed by the planet or technical means — by 2050. Responding to those who have accused her of doom-mongering, Thunberg said her message was simply based on scientific facts, not irrational fears. ""My generation will not give up without a fight,"" she said. Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told reporters at the WEF on Tuesday that the world needs to prepare for potentially millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change. His comments came after the UN Human Rights Committee (UNHCR) made a landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, including in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate, meaning richer countries may become a rising source of refugees. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Pope Francis also had a message for the high-powered participants at the economic forum in Davos: people, not profit, must be at the core of public policy. Francis issued written greetings to remind delegates of the ""moral obligation"" to place ""the human person, rather than the mere pursuit of power or profit, at the very centre of public policy."" He says the forum provides an arena where ""political will and mutual cooperation can be guided and strengthened in overcoming the isolationism, individualism and ideological colonization that sadly characterizes too much contemporary debate."" Francis is also encouraging the forum's deliberations to boost solidarity with those suffering ""social and economic injustice and whose very existence is even threatened."" A Vatican cardinal is representing the pope at the gathering, which started Tuesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-davos-investment-impeachment-1.5434306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rich-poor-oxfam-report-divide-1.5432930,N/A
325,Laurie Fagan,2020-01-22T19:37:37.284Z,CHEO bursting at the seams,"Ottawa's children's hospital, CHEO, operated over capacity two out of every three days during the first half of 2019, more than than any other acute-care hospital in the city.   That startling statistic comes from data obtained from Ontario's Ministry of Health through an access to information request by CBC. From January to June, CHEO took in more patients than it had room for on 121 of 181 days, or 66 per cent of the time. On seven of those days, the children's hospital was operating at over 120 per cent capacity. Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals are filled beyond capacity nearly every day, new data reveals By comparison, Toronto's Sick Kids was only over capacity 41 days during the first six months of the year. The data comes as the provincial government promises health reforms it vows will put an end to ""hallway medicine"" — when hospitals become so crowded patients have to be assessed and treated in corridors because there are no beds. Dr. Lindy Samson, chief of staff at CHEO, said the reasons are many: a busy flu season, a growing population and the hospital's status as the only one in the region dedicated to children. ""When you're the only facility, it really impacts us significantly,"" she said. An increase in the number of young people seeking care for mental health issues also put a strain on the hospital's emergency department, Samson said. The pressure on the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit is hitting some of the hospital's sickest children especially hard, Samson said. ""When those most critically ill children need care and if it's full, we have no choice but to send them out of the region,"" she said. ""It's the solution of last resort."" Elective surgeries — everything from tonsillectomies to spinal and even heart surgeries — are also being postponed as a result of the overcrowding. ""These aren't just things that can wait for months and months,"" Samson said. ""It is so hard, and our hearts go out to the children and their families, and we never take it lightly and we work hard to try and reschedule it.""  Rose Anne Devlin, a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa whose research has focused on health care in Ontario, believes the province could ease the pressure on hospitals by creating more family health teams — doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners who work together to provide primary care to patients outside the hospital setting, typically in the evenings. The province created 184 of the teams between 2005 and 2012, and added another three last year. Devlin is calling for more to ease the strain on overcrowded hospitals. ""Something has to happen,"" she said. ""A hospital is a very expensive place to treat conditions that primary doctors could provide."" In anticipation of this year's flu season, CHEO has used a one-time, $1.5-million bailout from the province to open nine more beds, but the funding runs out at the end of March. In an attempt to boost efficiency, the hospital has also hired a ""flow coordinator"" to oversee admission and discharge. Since December, department heads have been convening for a morning huddle in a newly created command centre where they, too, try to manage admissions and coordinate tests so patients can be discharged as quickly as possible at the other end. It's led to fewer cancelled surgeries and faster admissions, Samson said. ""This year felt like the year we had to try something differently,"" she said. ""Coming together as a command centre was the best way, and we're seeing some early positive results.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005,[],N/A
326,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-07T18:30:27.851Z,'A slap in the face': Little-known rule says airline can keep your money without delivering what you pay for,"A Calgary-area couple is fuming after paying Air Canada hundreds of dollars for an upgraded flight package, then being told a little-known rule allows the airline to keep their money without delivering on what it advertised. Instead, the airline offered Linda and Rick Borsato 20 per cent off a flight within the next year. ""You're treated like you're an afterthought,"" said Linda. ""'We have your money and sorry you weren't happy. Maybe we'll do better next time. Here's a discount.' That's a slap in the face."" Aviation experts say airlines can upsell passengers without being obligated to deliver or to pay compensation — because the industry's regulator lets them make their own rules outlining their obligations to passengers during a flight. ""It's not really fair,"" says Prof. John Gradek, who lectures about aviation management at McGill University in Montreal.  ""Unfortunately, that's the conditions by which the Canadian Transportation Agency has allowed the airlines to promote their fares."" Go Public found WestJet, and some U.S. airlines like American Airlines and Delta have similar rules as Air Canada. Air Canada and WestJet both say they deal with such situations on a case-by-case basis.  On a trip to Hawaii in April, the Borsatos paid $519 extra to upgrade from the airline's ""basic"" economy fare to ""comfort"" economy, which includes advance seat selection. That was the selling point for Rick, who is six feet, four inches tall and wanted more legroom. Air Canada changed their itinerary three times after the Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March.  But it wasn't until the Borsatos arrived at the airport on April 13, that they discovered they'd be getting fewer than half of the extras they bought. The airline didn't deliver on the advance seating, the early boarding or the complimentary alcoholic beverage — though the couple was able to check their first bag for free and got extra travel points. The Borsatos say an Air Canada agent told them they could get a refund when they returned home. But their refund claim was rejected based on a set of rules that Air Canada wrote itself, and which passengers automatically agree to when they book. The airline's Rule 30 says services that are part of a fare package, like the one the Borsatos purchased, are ""not guaranteed,"" and ""no compensation will be offered for their unavailability."" ""I just can't wrap my head around how that happens,"" Rick said. ""We've paid them for a service and didn't get it, but they've written [this rule] in such a way that they don't owe us anything. What other industry can do that?"" The airline won't disclose how often passengers don't get the services they pay for under the various fare packages. In an email to Go Public, spokesperson Angela Mah says Air Canada ""always makes every effort to ensure that services are provided to the best of its abilities."" She added that the ""no compensation"" clause was included in the rules ""for additional clarity."" Compensation is handled on a ""case-by-case basis,"" she said.  After the couple escalated their complaint to Air Canada management, the airline upped its offer by adding a $200 coupon to the 20 per cent discount. They declined that offer. ""We don't want to travel with Air Canada knowing that we can pay for a service that they don't have to provide us and that they don't have to refund our money,"" Linda said. The Borsatos complained on May 27 to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the industry regulator which decides whether an airline's rules are reasonable, and has the authority to force airlines to drop or amend rules. The Borsatos' complaint is among 33 filed over Air Canada's Rule 30 since the CTA began tracking disputes related to the rule two years ago. In its nine-page response to the Borsatos' complaint, Air Canada says Rule 30 is ""reasonable,"" and that the complaint should be dismissed because the grounding of the 737 Max planes was out of Air Canada's control. The Borsatos say they understand operational issues come up, but say Air Canada shouldn't be able to keep the money if the purchased services can't be provided. After Go Public contacted the airline, it agreed to issue a full refund, but only if the Borsatos signed a confidentiality agreement and drop their complaint with the CTA. The couple refused. Mah, the spokesperson, said ""such agreements are common in business during dispute resolutions.""  It's common for airlines to advertise certain perks but not deliver on some or any of them without compensating passengers, according to Prof. Brent Bowen from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.  ""Most of the travelling public is not aware of it,"" said Bowden, who has been running an online study on airline quality for years.  ""This is how the airlines have gone from rags to riches in the past decade … they unbundle everything and don't really reduce the ticket cost to you."" He says occasional travellers should be wary of booking bundled fares that promise — but don't guarantee — extras, because they'll rarely get their money's worth. Air Canada started offering bundled fare packages in 2003 and it expanded and renamed the packages last year.  Fare packages aren't addressed under Canada's new Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which kicked in July 15. But they should be, according to Ian Jack of the Canadian Automobile Association, who had input into the new regulations through the government's various consultations with stakeholders.  The new regulations are ""not perfect"" and fare packages are ""one area for future improvement"" Jack said.  Officials should improve ""the way that various fare classes are advertised and… [how] carriers to make clear what you're getting."" In the meantime, the Borsatos hope the CTA will force Air Canada to drop or modify Rule 30, and want their refund with no strings attached. Their case is still under review.  ""How many people aren't getting what they're paying for?"" Linda Borsato asks. ""That's why we pursued this and are following through on it… either way we have nothing to lose now."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-rule-30-fare-classes-1.5304450,[],N/A
327,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:41:49.657Z,"Netflix snags 125,000 new Canadian subscribers as streaming competition heats up","Netflix recruited more Canadian subscribers in the final months of last year as it responded to an onslaught of new competition from Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus with an array of buzzworthy TV series and Oscar-calibre movies. The global streaming company attracted 125,000 paid sign-ups in Canada during the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 2019, helped by popular TV series The Witcher and acclaimed films Marriage Story and The Irishman. Yet, while the results were an improvement over the 96,000 Canadian subscribers who joined in the third quarter, the company's subscriber growth was down from the 218,000 new members who joined during the last three months a year prior. Part of that slowdown could be attributed to the arrival of both Apple and Disney which launched their hyped streaming services within days of each other. Disney Plus, in particular, left a solid impact on pop culture when its Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian sparked an obsession with viewers over the so-called Baby Yoda character on social media. Netflix says despite the widespread attention both new streaming platforms attracted, there was a ""more muted impact from competitive launches"" outside the U.S., including in Canada. Reed Hastings, the company's chief executive, downplayed the arrival of Apple and Disney, saying in a call with investors that before they showed up a formidable competitor for viewership already existed in global powerhouse YouTube. Spencer Wang, the company's vice-president of finance, suggested the notion of the streaming wars is overplayed by outsiders. ""I know it's exciting for folks to talk about — you know the clash of the titans and all that kind of stuff — but really the big thing that's going on is a transition from linear entertainment to streaming on demand entertainment, which is really, really big,"" he said. ""It's very similar to the transition the industry went through from broadcast to cable."" The latest Canadian figures were outlined as part of a broader commitment to provide its investors with a more extensive quarterly report that fleshed out data on growth in key countries. More detailed breakdowns of its regional membership numbers and revenue cover four regions — Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East & Africa; and U.S. and Canada. The North American region was the lowest membership growth area for the streaming company, which it attributed in its financial report to ""recent price changes and to U.S. competitive launches."" Canadian revenues were higher at $241 million US in the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2019, marking an increase from nearly $164.9 million in the same period a year earlier when the company was phasing in a price increase with users across the country. Overall, Netflix added 8.8 million worldwide subscribers during its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations. Netflix had said it expected to add 7.6 million subscribers, and analysts thought the service would fare even better. The increase pales slightly next to the 8.9 million subscribers the service added in the fourth quarter of 2018. A report released Tuesday by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on the state of the country's communications industry offered further insight into the popularity of Netflix in Canada. The 2019 Communications Monitoring Report outlines that subscription-based video-on-demand services — which include Netflix, Crave and Quebec-based Club Illico — generated $2.5 billion Cdn of revenue for the entirety of 2018.

According to Ackerman, the Salvation Army has seen a considerable rise in demand over the past year as B.C's forestry industry has continued to founder.  ""The Salvation Army is very efficient in how they manage things, and they have significant partners in the community [...] to ensure that the food is used in a timely fashion and to the best of its use,"" Ackerman told CBC's Andrew Kurjata.  She said the money will flow to the food bank, the soup kitchen, and be used for meals to feed schoolchildren and seniors in need. Fort St. John received the provincial money through British Columbia's Community Support Grants Program. Dwindling supply, high fees blamed for downturn in B.C.'s forestry industry The northern resource town is one of many across British Columbia currently hurting from a major downturn attributed to high log prices and dwindling timber supply. With scores of mill closures across the province, more than 6,000 people lost their jobs last year alone, resulting in an 11 per cent drop in provincial forest revenues. Meanwhile, 3,000 forestry union workers on Vancouver Island remain on a strike that recently entered its seventh month.  In September, the provincial government committed $69 million to aid thousands of laid-off forestry workers in B.C.'s Interior, where at least 22 mills ceased operations in 2019.  Shortly after meeting with Premier John Horgan and other mayors from northern B.C on Tuesday, Fort St. James Mayor Bev Playfair extended the municipality's state of local financial crisis for the sixth time.  The small town at the foot of Stuart Lake first announced a state of financial crisis this past July after operations ceased at the local mill, leaving 226 residents without a job. This latest closure marks the third time the facility has shuttered. The mill's new owner, Hampton Lumber, plans to build a new mill, though it's not expected to be up and running until 2022.  $69M in aid coming to beleaguered forestry workers in B.C.'s Interior ""It's had a huge impact on our community,"" said Playfair about the local decline in forestry.  She commended the provincial government for its financial support of B.C.'s beleaguered forestry industry but said she's heard only crickets from Ottawa.  ""We haven't had any federal help,"" Playfair said. ""We need federal funding."" ""I don't think the forestry workers have been recognized like the automotive industry, the steel workers, the oil industry in Alberta,"" she continued. ""In all the conversation in the last six or eight months, I've never heard the B.C. forestry workers recognized or mentioned. And we have a lot of people hurting right now that are losing homes, losing vehicles."" 'People may not recover': B.C. lends $5M to forestry contractors for equipment costs as strike continues Prince George Mayor Lyn Hall echoed Playfair's comments about the lack of federal support, as did Premier John Horgan. ""Forest workers are critically important to British Columbia and they need to be treated as fairly and equitably as other sectors across the country,"" Horgan told reporters.  Last week, the provincial government made $5 million in loans available to help forestry contractors in danger of losing their equipment due to the ongoing strike.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/forestry-fort-st-james-salvation-army-1.5437120,[],N/A

Greg Hooper, owner of Uncle Mayn's Convenience in St. George, signed a letter of intent to buy the Campobello Village Mart for an undisclosed amount. After the store announced it was closing, people from the island called Hooper asking if he'd be interested in taking the store over.  ""I threw [the owners] an offer and we agreed on a price and now we're going to see if we can make it work,"" Hooper said.  Richard and Patricia Bent, owners of the store, announced the closure on Facebook on Dec. 31. The store was set to close on March 31, laying off four employees.  A declining local population and lack of support meant it was no longer feasible to operate the store, the owners said. Only 800 people live on Campobello Island permanently, but in the summertime that population swells to 3,000.  The Campobello Village Mart is the only store in the area that sells groceries, alcohol and lottery tickets.

The city says the state of emergency will remain in effect until 6 a.m. NT on Saturday, if nothing changes. The city will confirm Friday.  For Thursday, there are no changes to travel restrictions, taxis, or pharmacies and food stores, but all medical, health and dental practitioners, as well as veterinarians, are now permitted to open as of 8 a.m. People who live in St. John's but work outside of the city are now also permitted to travel. ""There's been a lot of fantastic work done, and we're getting there, but we don't feel that the streets are at the safety level that we need to be in order to take off the state of emergency right now,"" St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said Wednesday evening. ""We need you off the roads. We've got a lot of heavy equipment that's moving around here ... we want to make sure that we can get this straightened out as soon as possible,"" he said.  WATCH | Avalanche of snow crashed through couple's window: Breen said most of the challenges in terms of traffic came from neighbouring municipalities having different regulations on their states of emergency. Once things begin to return to normal, Breen said he wants to modernize the city's state of emergency plan. ""I think we all agree that this is work that needs to be done, and needs to be done soon,"" he said. Earlier Wednesday, St. John's International Airport opened for the first time since the record-smashing blizzard brought daily life in eastern Newfoundland to a standstill with hurricane-force winds that kept equipment parked during critical hours of the storm. Main thoroughfares are now open, Breen said.  Taxis were also back on the road Wednesday, and most medical clinics have been given the go-ahead to open.  Supermarkets — the sites of frantic shopping Tuesday, as thousands of people poured through the doors to buy milk, bread and other items for the first time since last week — will be open again for an eight-hour period. Breen said he understands that some residents are wondering why the city didn't let people know that certain stores would be open again Wednesday, potentially avoiding the long lines seen at some stores Tuesday. ""It's a good question. We didn't know they would be open today,"" he said. Schools, government offices and courts will remain closed for the rest of the week, and many streets are still so choked with snow that they can't accommodate Metrobus vehicles. Breen said Metrobus managers are working on a plan to get the streets ""to a point where we can get them back.""  On Wednesday afternoon, Memorial University and College of the North Atlantic also made the call to remain closed until Monday.

He's ex-military, he's got a son with a disability, he was snowed in he could not get out of his house,"" Bragg said. Bragg said other people have been calling for assistance to clear their sheds, and some on vacation out of the province asking if their cars could be shovelled out.  ""But I cannot stress enough, this line is set up for support for vulnerable people who need to get out of their home, who have not been out since Friday,"" he said.

Bragg said he reached out to the Canadian Red Cross to set up an additional line for help, and hoped to have it ready later on Wednesday, but it was not established by 8 p.m. Eastern Health said it's still offering only emergency services at its facilities in St. John's on Thursday and Friday.  Meanwhile, if you're expecting a package in the mail, don't hold your breath. Canada Post said it's holding off on deliveries until the state of emergency is lifted, and afterward people can expect ""significant delivery delays"" as the agency plays catchup. Heating oil deliveries, however, resumed Wednesday. Breen said the nearly week-long state of emergency order means both businesses and the municipal budget will take a hit, calling the loss of income ""significant.""  Ball said his government will work with municipalities to figure out the full costs of the emergency and discuss disaster relief. ""It'll take some time to get this all calculated,"" he said.

331,Anonymous,2020-01-21T14:32:00.971Z,Fredericton city council focuses on gender as it moves to address lack of diversity,"Fredericton city council voted unanimously Monday night to adopt several resolutions that it hopes will help create more gender diversity at council tables.  Coun. Kate Rogers, the only woman on council, noted last night that several of the city's standing committees are made up entirely of men. Rogers began raising the issue publicly last summer when a committee to look into development at the New Brunswick Exhibition grounds lacked any female representation from the city.  ""It was difficult to go and speak publicly about colleagues — very well intentioned, good people — and to have to speak publicly,"" she said. ""But it amplified the discussion and it brought it out into the public and that's what was required so that we could move forward. I feel we've come a long way in a few months."" The resolutions from the Ad Hoc Committee on Gender Diversity, which was struck after Rogers brought her concerns forward, include: Adopt the Fredericton Council Code of Conduct by-law and policy Provide on-going professional development for Councillors and Committee members Require the completion of the GBA+ (Gender-based Analysis Plus) online training course for all chairs of committees. Other members of council have expressed interest in taking this course as well. Amend the Administrative report to include GBA+ lens, among others The committee was made up of Rogers and Coun. Greg Ericson, as well as city staff representative Michele Cronin, Joanne Wright, the dean of Arts and Professor of Political Science at the University of New Brunswick and Margot Cragg, the Executive Director of the Union of the Municipalities of New Brunswick. There are no women on the finance committee, public safety committee or land development committee, Rogers said. ""If you have more diverse voices there … it just makes for a richer more meaningful discussion."" Committee members are appointed by the mayor and approved by council. The recently passed resolutions will not change that process. Several people, mostly women, came to watch the council-in-committee meeting on Monday night. Committee meetings don't typically attract an audience.  ""We wanted to come here for solidarity,"" said Marg Milburn, who came to support the resolutions. ""And also, I just can't believe we had to come to this meeting, like, I'm just — it's 2020.""  Councillors echoed their support for the resolutions, and some even asked why they didn't go further.  ""I think we should be appointing a commission to look into all of the various issues that are associated with gender equity and gender representation … in order to facilitate more women in government,"" said Coun. Stephen Chase.  Coun. Eric Megarity suggested it was time the city had a representative from St. Mary's First Nation.  ""We both inhabit the same piece of territory, we're on their land and it goes back many many many years and it's time to work together and move our city forward,"" Megarity said.   Increasing gender diversity is a first step, Rogers said in an interview with Information Morning Fredericton. ""We need to become more diverse in many ways around the council table and in our working committees. We identified gender and thought that we would start with gender ... and then we can address many of the other identities.""  Rogers said the positive discussion and unanimous vote is encouraging. ""That made me feel like we've come a very long way,"" she said. But there's still work to be done, said Coun. Greg Ericson. Some details still need to be hammered out, like how the city could go about appointing voting community members to standing committees.  ""It's in a bylaw already, but none of the specifics are worked out. Do they get a vote? What kind of speaking privileges do they have? What's the process for how we'd go about selecting these members from the community?""    For now, Rogers expects the recommendations will make councillors and committee members more aware of sexist and misogynistic behaviour.  ""Part of this training will make people more aware that it exists and their part in it,"" Rogers said. ""I would say both at the staff and the council level we haven't talked about it and when we have talked about it, there's been denial that it's existed or that it's too overwhelming to address.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-council-gender-1.5434177,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-city-council-female-councillor-1.5206326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-council-diversity-concerns-1.5204768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-approves-all-male-1.5221187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/councillor-kate-rogers-gender-committee-1.5244945,N/A

The City of St. John's announced Tuesday afternoon that the airport, which has been shut down since Friday's punishing storm, can resume commercial operations as of 5 a.m. NT Wednesday. Airport employees will be allowed to travel to work earlier than that. The state of emergency will remain in effect for St. John's on Wednesday, but the city is easing its restrictions when it comes to certain activities: St. John's Mayor Danny Breen told CBC Radio shortly after the city announced its continuation of the state of emergency that he has been in contact with city food banks, but most are having trouble opening due to snow blockages. ""[We're] just working on that this evening to see when they can open up. So, that's an ongoing thing that we're working on, and hopefully we'll have something more on that soon,"" Breen said. Peter Avery, CEO of the St. John's Airport Authority, told CBC Radio that the airport is prepared to open on Wednesday and get back to business as usual. ""We're in pretty good shape right now. All of our main facilities, and our airfields, parking lots and roadways are cleared. So, we're ready for the go-ahead tomorrow morning,"" Avery said. ""There's no question about the ability for our airfield to accept the aircraft.""  Avery said St. John's International Airport is expecting at least 2,000 passengers inbound on Wednesday, with the same amount looking to fly out.  He said Air Canada has added additional flights for Wednesday's run, and will be potentially upgrading to larger aircraft to fit more passengers. WestJet has followed suit, Avery said. ""It'll be a busy day. We ask people to exercise caution and also to carpool and take taxis where you can,"" he said.  Residents were getting a hint Tuesday of what life was like before the blizzard, as some businesses opened their doors for the first time since the city was slammed by a massive snowstorm. Gas stations, pharmacies and grocery stores opened at 10 a.m. with city officials urging residents to stock up for at least two days — but also to remain civil and drive slowly. As community food sharing groups pop up online and supplies inside homes dwindle, grocery stores were overwhelmed as thousands of customers showed up to shop.  At least one supermarket issued a pre-emptive limit of two loaves of bread per customer. Some supermarkets had to close their doors for periods of time to let long queues run through the checkouts.  Outside, cleanup efforts continued.  ""We have never seen it like this before,"" Ball said on Power and Politics Monday night, describing the volume of snow the city has to remove or push aside in order to allow vehicles through the streets. Cleanup efforts are expected to take so long that all metro-area schools are closed for the rest of the week. ""This is a student-first decision around safety,"" said Tony Stack, chief executive of the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD).  ""Having that volume of students on the roads in the condition that they're in … would be problematic."" Stack said the goal was to give people enough notice so they could make other plans. Breen said there was at least one cut through the ""vast majority"" of streets in the city. As for clearing sidewalks, Breen said it's something that will be happening, but it won't be immediate. Transportation Minister Steve Crocker said that outside the city, cleanup of provincial roads is going well. Crocker said there are still challenges with highway off-ramps in the metro-area, but he was hopeful that Witless Bay Line on the Southern Shore would be opened soon. ""We had one truck through there now, and we're widening it. It's still not opened but we're hoping to have it opened later today or early tomorrow,"" he said. ""Most of our main arteries right now are in fair, winter driving conditions.""  There has been widespread praise for estimated 450 military troops who are helping with the post-storm recovery. Personnel and equipment landed on the island Sunday night and will likely remain until at least the end of the week.  Members of the Canadian Armed Forces spent much of Monday digging trenches from front doors to streets. ""Yesterday was a busy day,"" said Maj. Kerry Sears of 37 Service Battalion. ""There's a lot of handshaking, a lot of hugging the soldiers."" Troops are doing everything from clearing heat pumps to helping doctors get to work, and have assignments coming in from all directions. Some of their top priorities include clearing roads, attending to elderly and sick residents and ensuring that people who need medical care get to hospitals and clinics.  Those needing information or assistance can call the following numbers: Read more stories from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-storm-day-five-1.5434251,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/grocery-stores-open-st-john-s-1.5433593 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,N/A
333,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:08:14.631Z,Indigenous pipeline supporters slam human-rights advocates over Coastal GasLink stance,"A collective of First Nations who support the liquefied natural gas industry in British Columbia say human rights advocates failed to do their research when they called for the Coastal GasLink pipeline project to be halted. The First Nations LNG Alliance has issued open letters to the B.C. human rights commissioner and the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination over statements they made about the pipeline. The commissioner and committee both called for the project to be stopped in the face of opposition from Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, who say the project has no authority without their consent. Both said the free, prior and informed consent of all affected Indigenous groups should be granted before any project is allowed to proceed. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline's 670-kilometre path but the Wet'suwet'en chiefs say within their territory, those councils only administer small reserves and it's the hereditary chiefs who hold jurisdiction over a broader area covering 22,000 square kilometres. Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, says in the letter to human rights commissioner Kasari Govender that the pipeline was approved through a democratic process that Indigenous people participated in freely, and neither the committee nor commissioner consulted supportive Indigenous groups before taking a position. No one could be reached for comment at the UN committee and Govender was not available for an interview Tuesday. ""It is disheartening to see that the input from 20 First Nations, who participated extensively during five years of consultation on the pipeline, and have successfully negotiated agreements with Coastal GasLink, is so easily dismissed by the B.C. Human Rights Commission,"" Ogen-Toews says in one of the open letters. Ogen-Toews was elected chief of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation, representing 255 members on and off reserve lands, for six years. The Wet'suwet'en First Nation covers a smaller area than the Wet'suwet'en Nation, over which the hereditary clan chiefs claim authority. The letter accuses Govender of ignoring the social and economic benefits already realized by workers and communities from the project. More than one-third of work on the project has been completed by Indigenous people and Coastal GasLink has earmarked $620 million in contracting opportunities for First Nations in the province, it says. The letter also accuses both the provincial commission and the UN committee of issuing public statements without talking to supportive First Nations. ""Both groups know nothing about the importance we place on finding a way out of endlessly trying to manage poverty, and finding the kind of opportunities for our First Nations people that non-Indigenous people have enjoyed for centuries,"" the letter says. The UN committee also called on the federal government to stop two other major resource projects, the Site C dam and Trans Mountain pipeline expansions. Na'moks, a spokesman for the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, has said they will never consent to the project. The chiefs issued an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink after the B.C. Supreme Court extended an injunction on Dec. 31 to the company. The RCMP has established a checkpoint along a logging road that leads to a pipeline work site, as well as two camps and a small settlement established by supporters of the hereditary chiefs.

And they weren't going to let a blizzard, which ground everything in the St. John's region to a standstill, stop them. ""I promised Brianne that on January 18th when we went to sleep, we would go to sleep as husband and wife,"" Chris, 26, told As It Happens host Carol Off. But the odds were stacked against the couple from Carbonear, N.L., given that meteorologists were forecasting at least 75 centimetres of snow with gusts exceeding 150 km/h for the St. John's region on the Avalon Peninsula beginning Friday. On Saturday morning, Brianne learned that the reception had to be postponed because the venue was buried under a heap of snow. But Chris told Brianne: ""We're still getting married in the church."" Then there was the laborious task of clearing Chris's driveway and digging his car out on Saturday morning so he could get to his future mother-in-law's home, next to St. Joseph's Church in Harbour Grace, N.L., where the wedding ceremony was to take place. However, the priest told Chris in a call that the church was damaged from the snow and high winds, so it wouldn't be safe to hold the ceremony there. ""I was almost ready to give up,"" Brianne, 25, said upon hearing the news. But the priest said that if they were that committed to getting married that day, he would let them hold their ceremony in the basement of his parish home. About 150 guests were expected on Saturday, but about 40 people were able to make it. Most of Brianne's bridesmaids showed up except for Chris's sister and brother-in-law, whose street hadn't yet been plowed. So Chris's mother ended up FaceTiming the ceremony so they could watch it.

335,David Friend,2020-01-21T14:15:00.624Z,Nine times lucky? Alberta's Northern Cree takes another shot at Grammy gold,"Even the biggest pop stars might want to clear the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday when Northern Cree arrive dressed to impress. It's the ninth time Alberta's Indigenous singing group is nominated at music industry's biggest night, and co-founder Steve Wood says he's planning a few surprises. Among them, expect members of the 17-person act to sport traditional Cree designs that could easily overshadow the edgy threads worn by Shawn Mendes and Lil Nas X. ""Even if you're famous, you don't want to be next to us on the red carpet,"" Wood says with a chuckle on the phone from Maskwacis, Alta. ""Taking nothing away from any of the artists, what I'm saying is that people are always looking for something they haven't seen before."" Since the group's first nomination in 2001, the 58-year-old leader of Northern Cree has become somewhat of an expert in grabbing attention on the red carpet. A couple years ago, the act wowed onlookers when they pulled up wearing vibrant beaded vests, a sharp break from the steady flow of black tuxedos and designer looks on the carpet. Northern Cree didn't win the Grammy that year, but they had everyone talking. This year, they're nominated in the best regional roots category with their 40th album, When It's Cold - Cree Round Dance Songs, a collection of tracks that acknowledge the good times (The Hippity Hoppity) and the hardships (To All MMIW) a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women). Their Grammy category is stacked with other favourite contenders, including six-time Hawaiian nominee Amy Hanaiali'i and Rebirth Brass Band, a past winner from New Orleans. Northern Cree carries a longer history with the Recording Academy than the rest of them, but the singing group is running zero for eight on Grammy wins. While leaving empty-handed for so many years would've left many artists feeling slighted, Wood insists his fellow members are nothing less than auspicious winners even without a golden statuette to their name. ""If you look at the positives, it's giving us an opportunity to get recognition for our music,"" he explains. ""We're representing First Nations people across North America, but we are also representing the Canadian public. That's why we're going to do the best that we can, always."" Wood created Northern Cree with his brothers Randy and Earl in 1982. The group originates from the Saddle Lake Cree Nation in northern Alberta, but includes members from the Treaty 6 area, including the Frog Lake Cree Nation, Onion Lake Cree Nation, Samson Cree Nation, Louis Bull Cree Nation and the Poundmaker Cree Nation. They've performed on global stages, which included an opening spot for the Tragically Hip during a Canada Day concert at London's Trafalgar Square. Most of the group's members juggle career jobs outside of music, several of them school teachers. Wood is an education administrator at an Alberta junior and senior high school on top of balancing the group's schedule. That's one of the reasons the Grammy Awards offers Northern Cree a platform they can't find anywhere else. Not only are international audiences watching the big event, but the auditorium is packed with fellow musicians, which can lead to new opportunities. Several years ago, rapper M.I.A. and singer Santigold picked a Northern Cree sample for their own original song, while more recently Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy docuseries Who is America? used a pounding electronic track by producer DJ Shub, featuring Northern Cree, as its title music. And when Northern Cree was nominated in 2017, the Grammy organizers asked the group to play as part of the pre-telecast awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The performance shook the room, even before Mexican singer Carla Morrison joined them on stage. Wood says it's those pure Grammy moments that mean the most. ""I like to get the music out in its original form,"" he says. ""When we hit those mainstream stages, the audience is in a little bit of awe until they can feel it. But when they feel it, it turns into a rock concert.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/maskwacis-northern-cree-band-grammy-awards-1.5434335,[],N/A
336,Sam Juric,2020-01-23T00:11:27.373Z,Horse and wagon ride offers seniors chance to reconnect with roots,"A group of seniors ponied up in the cold for a horse and wagon ride on Wednesday morning.   After a horse's memorable visit to Colville Manor in December, staff at the Souris nursing home wanted to give its residents another chance to connect with horses.  For many of the residents, regular contact with horses was once a frequent occurrence. ""I think it's very important and we try to connect with the community,"" said Carol Anne Matheson, recreation manager at the nursing home.  ""Make the community a big part of our residents' lives here because coming from the community to a nursing home, we don't want to isolate anybody from past things that they did."" For organizers, it was an important chance for residents to enjoy some fresh air, connect with the animals and get in touch with their roots.  The group of seniors bundled up with blankets, hats and scarves, more than willing to endure the chilly weather with the hopes of making a special new memory on the 30-minute ride.  Jean Savoie was so charmed by the manor's first horse visit, that she now keeps a framed picture of the pair in her room.  She said embarking on the ride was a ""beautiful"" experience.  ""I love sleigh rides and I love animals,"" Savoie said. ""That horse, I could keep him."" When Savoie heard that staff were arranging for a wintry ride she could hardly keep her excitement to herself. ""I thought, 'Now I'm not going to miss this,'"" she said.   ""We had horses when we were small, we grew up with the animals, and I used to be around them all the time, so I'm schooled up with them."" For Vivian Blaisdell, who also lives at Colville Manor, the ride took her back to her days in St. Charlotte, working with horses. ""I'll remember everything about it, it was beautiful,"" Blaisdell said.  Matheson said she hopes the seniors will hold the joy of the ride close to their hearts.  ""It was heartwarming to see the residents, the faces that, when they saw the horse in the entryway.… A lot of these folks had horses back years ago,"" she said. ""There's nothing more therapeutic than animals.""  Matheson said staff at Colville Manor will certainly be planning similar events in the future. ""Just seeing their faces on the wagon was just — everything."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sleigh-ride-seniors-souris-1.5435046,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-stratford-inclusivity-unesco-1.5434823 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-intersection-safety-1.5436264,N/A
337,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-12-05T09:00:15.727Z,"Canadian stats on impaired driving deaths incomplete, years out of date","Canada's statistics on impaired and distracted driving fatalities, as well as drowning deaths, are incomplete and years out of date because the BC Coroners Service has repeatedly failed to share its data with the agencies that compile the national numbers. A CBC News investigation has determined that the information gap, which in some cases stretches back almost a decade, has held up the publication of annual reports and caused safety organizations to guess at countrywide trends and put asterisks next to their findings. And it's creating headaches for advocates and policy-makers who want to know if laws and enforcement measures are working as they should. ""It's appalling,"" said Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada. ""We're almost [in] 2020 and we're still working off 2014 [numbers]. We've had historical events in this country, like the legalization of recreational cannabis, with the big issue and debate around driving and what effect it's going to have, and we've got nothing. Nothing."" The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA), an interprovincial body that deals with highway safety, traditionally releases its annual Alcohol and Drug Crash Problem report each January. Drawing on police, insurance, coroner and medical examiner data from across the country, it's the definitive source on what has gone wrong on the country's roads. But the last CCMTA report came out almost three years ago in January 2017. And it was based on 2014 data — or in the case of British Columbia, extrapolated 2010 numbers.  The Ottawa-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF), an independent non-profit that gathers and analyzes the data for the CCMTA report, says it has been having difficulty prying numbers out of the BC Coroners Service for years. ""We've been trying to get that data because it represents anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of the population,"" said Steve Brown, who oversees TIRF's national fatality database and co-authors the Alcohol and Drug Crash report. ""We're doing everything at our end. We've filled out all the research agreements and that type of thing."" Earlier this year, the BC Coroners Service finally provided its 2011 and 2012 figures. But the holdup continues for the province's more recent years; that's in contrast to other Canadian jurisdictions, which have all provided their road death numbers through at least 2016. ""You think, in the information age, that it would be easier to get data, but that's not always the case,"" said Brown. ""We're … just trying to be as patient as we can with this."" B.C.'s death disclosure problems have also affected an annual report on water fatalities across the country. This past summer, the Drowning Prevention Research Centre released its 2019 findings — based on 2016 data — noting that absence of definitive numbers from Canada's third most populous province. ""They weren't ready and we just made the call that says, better to have three territories and nine provinces with their data, and let B.C. catch up by next year,"" said Doug Ferguson, CEO of Drowning Prevention Research Centre. Ferguson said his centre was still able to glean partial B.C. drowning death information from police and media reports, but it's likely that they missed some cases. He worries that the incomplete report might hamper municipalities or other water safety agencies as they try to fine-tune and target their public awareness campaigns.  ""You're not flying blind, but you're using old data,"" said Ferguson. ""There is no other source as valid as a coroner's office."" Andy Watson, a spokesperson for the BC Coroners Service, attributes the delays to the surge in deaths caused by the opioid crisis and the declaration of a provincial public health emergency in April 2016. ""One of the challenges that we were faced with a couple of years ago, really, it was the illicit drug crisis was expanding, and hitting British Columbia, I think, disproportionately harder than other provinces,"" said Watson. ""It was a reprioritization of resources at the time."" But given that the timely sharing of B.C. data was a problem well before the spike in fentanyl and carfentanil overdose deaths, other issues appear to be at play. In a followup response, Watson allowed that the BC Coroners Service has been slowed by ""a myriad of factors,"" including privacy concerns, revamped research agreements, the creation of a new electronic data management system and turnover in staff. Regardless, the agency is promising to do better and says it will hand over its 2013 through 2017 road death information to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation at some point next year. ""The best I can tell you at this stage is that we are working on that and catching up on that now,"" said Watson. ""We recognize the importance of that data and that's why we're making it a priority at this stage."" For safety groups like MADD Canada, however, the promise rings hollow. Murie says his organization has been looking for alternative data sources so it can analyze trends and critique government policy without having to wait for the various federal and provincial agencies to get their act together. ""To be honest with you, in the last year or so, I have just kind of given up,"" he said. ""Because even if they were to put out data for tomorrow and it's [for] 2015, what does it tell us?"" It's all in sharp contrast to the coroner-based process in the United States, which produces updated national numbers each spring via the federally funded Fatality Analysis Reporting System. ""That's great that B.C. is going to get caught up,"" said Murie. ""But, you know, the Americans have already produced their 2018 data, and next year, in April, they'll do 2019. ""They can do trend data. We can't.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/death-data-information-gap-1.5384278,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fire-truck-stolen-winnipeg-arrest-1.5379840 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drunk-driving-twice-quebec-breathalyzer-for-life-1.5369145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/great-lakes-drownings-2019-1.5231362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-crisis-vancouver-election-1.5284444,N/A

""We each need to take time to get out of our own bubble, to understand other people's trials, tribulations.

"" It's important to promote a new generation of Canadian writers, said Brugel. ""We do need new voices and we do certainly need people who haven't been represented to continue to add to our culture and add to the beautiful novels that have already come out of Canada,"" she said. The brisk, passionate daily debates, set for March 16-19, will be moderated for a fourth time by comedian and host Ali Hassan.

The Second World War veteran lives by himself in Eastport, N.L., does his own cleaning and cooking, and loves a good game on the VLTs at his local legion, a building he was instrumental in establishing decades ago — just one of his many achievements during a century of life. Today, Jan. 20, he turns 100. Good genes, he says. ""My father was 92. And my grandfather was 98. And my brother died [when] he was 99 and three months. And I've outdone the whole works,"" said Bull. Born to George Henry and Suzanna Bull, Chesley Bull says he started working on his father's vessel, the Magic, as a boy. ""I was in Grade 8 then. I went on to Labrador when I was 13 years old. And I spent seven summers out there. And I had a man's pay when I was 15,"" he said. ""When the war broke I tried to join up in St. John's and I had to come back in my own district to join."" He signed up for the navy in Glovertown on March 18, 1941, and was called for duty July 1 of that same year. ""We joined the ship and went across the Atlantic. Pretty near 200 ships in the convoy with 46 days going across the Atlantic. Landed in Liverpool. Then we joined the train and went down to the Ganges. We did our training there."" Bull says the memories of his war days are vivid in his mind — like the time he was bitten by a barracuda, or when there was an bomb attack outside his boarding house. ""They dropped a bomb and glass went all over me."" After 5½ years overseas, he returned to Eastport on Christmas Eve 1946. He began working at Terra Nova National Park, then moved on to become postmaster of Eastport, and also served as the first mayor of the town. After retiring from the post office, he went back to the water at age 60. He bought a boat engine and five gill nets and went fishing for the next seven or eight years, he said.  ""Made more money in one day than a month [as postmaster],"" said Bull. Bull was married for 67 years to wife Viola, who died in 2017. The couple had one daughter, Marion. These days, the centenarian brags about his 20/20 vision and loves to crack off-colour jokes every now and then. He still drives in the daytime, and most recently made the near 300-kilometre trek to St. John's last fall. And he loves to fish and hunt when he can, with hopes to get a moose licence next season. He makes his own wine, beer, and coffee liqueur, giving more of it away than he consumes. He says he'd rather have his nightly drink of scotch whisky instead. Besides his good genes, he credits one thing for his lengthy life.  ""Work. I never stop.""

He made the comments following a survey that said the oil and gas sector owes $173 million in unpaid taxes to rural municipalities — more than double since a similar report was done last spring. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Kenney said the sector has seen a few bankruptcies in the past year while other companies are barely hanging on. ""You can't wring money from a stone,"" Kenney said, suggesting that could be the case for a number of smaller natural gas producers who are having trouble right now. ""The best solution, in our view, is to create a future for those companies that are struggling."" Rural Municipalities Alberta (RMA) distributed a survey of its members Monday that showed the amount of unpaid taxes from oil and gas companies had grown by 114 per cent since a similar survey last March. Years of low oil prices have left many small producers in dire straits but rural communities say those unpaid taxes are leaving significant holes in their budgets. The RMA said legislative gaps make it difficult to recover lost taxes from energy companies. When an oil and gas company goes bust, municipalities rank below regulators as creditors, the association said. Al Kemmere, president of the RMA, told CBC News Tuesday he will meet with the provincial minister of municipal affairs next month to discuss the situation. Asked about the premier's comments, Kemmere agreed there needs to be discussion about solutions, but cautioned rural municipalities only have so much flexibility under the Municipal Government Act. ""We are also in a very limited scope of what we can do, too, because [while] other levels of government can … build a deficit into their budget, we cannot,"" Kemmere said. ""That limits us again on what we can do and how we can find solutions. We either balance a budget every year or we are in contempt of our own act."" Kenney said rural municipalities have the legal ability to take action when taxes go unpaid. But Kemmere maintained they don't have that authority other than through the civil courts — something he said could be ""really messy"" and puts risk on taxpayers. On Tuesday, Kenney was asked how the province would find a balance between the rural municipalities and the industry. He said he didn't view them as competing priorities but competing realities.  ""On the one part, the municipalities need the revenue and they have every right to assess it and and to seek to collect it — they have the legal right to collect it,"" Kenney said.  ""But for companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, they have no cash and very little in the way of assets. There's not a lot to go after. ""So I would just say with the municipalities, you know, work with us to try to create the best conditions to turn that economic situation around."" The industry is seeking reforms to how taxes are assessed on oil and gas companies. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, Ben Brunnen, vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Monday. ""What we're seeing is a need to update the way our assets are valued inside municipalities,"" he told CBC News. ""If we do that, we'll find a way for companies to then … perhaps invest more because the economics are better over the long term and our industry will come out stronger."" On Monday, Ponoka County Reeve Paul McLauchlin said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin told Canadian Press. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs."" A group concerned about the unpaid taxes, the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, is planning a protest outside the McDougall Centre in downtown Calgary on Wednesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-oil-and-gas-taxes-1.5435254,[],N/A

Mostly Muslim Gambia launched a lawsuit in November at the United Nations' highest body for disputes between states, accusing Myanmar of genocide against Rohingya. Thursday's ruling dealt only with Gambia's request for so-called preliminary measures, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. While the court's final decision could take years to reach, the 17 judge panel made clear in a unanimous ruling that the court believes the Rohingya are in danger now, and steps must be taken to protect them. The Rohingya remain ""at serious risk of genocide,"" presiding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf said, reading a summary the decision. Myanmar shall ""take all measures within its power to prevent all acts"" prohibited under the 1948 Genocide Convention, the ruling said. Myanmar must report back within four months. It ordered the government of Myanmar to exercise influence over its military and other armed groups to prevent ""killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life intended to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017, and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. UN investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent."" Moments before the court in The Hague began reading its ruling, the Financial Times published an article by Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in which she said war crimes may have been committed against Rohingya Muslims but that refugees had exaggerated the abuses against them. During a week of hearings last month, Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, had asked the judges to drop the case. The court's rulings are final and without appeal, although it has no real way of enforcing them. ""The court is of the opinion that the Rohingya in Myanmar remain extremely vulnerable,"" said Yusuf, the presiding judge. ""Moreover, the court is of the opinion that the steps which claimed to have taken to facilitate the return of Rohingya refugees present in Bangladesh, to promote ethnic reconciliation, peace and stability in Rakhine State, and to make its military accountable for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, do not appear sufficient."" More than 100 Myanmar civil society groups published a statement saying they hoped international justice efforts would ""bring forth the truth"" and end impunity. ""Political and military policies have always been imposed with violent force and intimidation upon the people of Myanmar, systematically and institutionally, on the basis of their political and religious beliefs and ethnic identities and continue until the present,"" the statement said.

""We fill one dumpster a week,"" said Steven Stewart. ""That could go to three when it all gets going."" The city will have a new screening facility up and running in a couple of weeks to help deal with the gunk. It's part of $12 million in upgrades undertaken to handle increased waste at the Charlottetown plant. The new screening facility will be housed in a separate building on the plant's waterfront property on Riverside Drive. The new, finer screen will replace a decades-old machine that currently sifts all manner of items out of the sewage that flows from the homes of Charlottetown residents. ""This looks like somebody's Calvin Kleins,"" said Stewart, as he used a pitch fork and gloved hands to pick through a knotted wad of cloth and elastic that turned up in the pipes in recent days. The name of the designer-label undergarment was clearly visible. Over the years, staff have removed many curious items: an animal horn, bones, children's toys, cash. A pair of crinkled $5 bills are kept in the plant as examples of what can turn up. One worker told CBC he once found a $50 bill.  And a set of dentures.  Staff estimate they remove a ""five gallon bucket"" of untreatable items from pumping equipment every day. It takes valuable time, and puts staff at risk, according to Stewart. ""You get syringes. Sometimes we have razor blades,"" said Stewart. ""It's a hazard to employees because on a daily basis we have to go in and unplug these things from our pumps. ""Don't put anything in the toilet that isn't toilet paper or number one or number two."" Despite the ongoing problems, city residents are ""quite conscientous,"" according to Charlottetown's sewer and water manager. ""People have educated themselves,"" said Richard MacEwen. ""Island Waste Management does a great job of explaining how the waste-handling system works and people have embraced it."" The advent of disposable wipes has created a new challenge in recent years, according to MacEwen. ""They're not flushable,"" said MacEwen. Cooking oil and grease also clog pipes and should not be poured down kitchen drains. The city of Summerside says it's having trouble with people flushing mop heads. They say staff continue to pull mop heads out of clogged sewage pumping equipment on a regular basis.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewer-clog-charlottetown-1.5435153,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-east-royalty-wastewater-charlottetown-plant-1.5426796 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-sewage-treatment-1.4004557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewage-green-1.4023899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-wastewater-treatment-consolidation-1.4131259 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775,N/A
347,Sara Minogue,2020-01-22T16:11:49.180Z,"Giant Mine remediation plan lacks vision, details, says City of Yellowknife","It's not quite clear what the former Giant Mine site will look like 10 years from now, or who will be in charge of how the land is used.  The issue has come up repeatedly during public hearings in Yellowknife this week. The Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board is considering the Giant Mine Remediation Team's application for a water licence and land-use permit to begin its 10-year, $1 billion cleanup just a few kilometres from the city's downtown.  The City of Yellowknife recently drafted a 20-year community plan. It describes the entire Giant Mine area as ""undevelopable.""  In a presentation to the board Tuesday, city administrator Sheila Bassi-Kellett made a plea to the project to lay out options for what the Giant Mine site could be used for down the road.  ""This land must provide potential value to our citizens,"" Bassi-Kellett said. ""What that value will be, whether it's recreational or industrial, whatever it may be, this has got to be a collective decision from all our residents.""  Questions have been raised over who exactly is in charge of future land-use planning for the site. On Monday, the remediation team talked about ""constraints"" on land use planning, while saying land-use planning lay outside of its authority. A representative for the territorial government, the land's owner, pointed out that the territorial government doesn't do land-use planning within municipal boundaries.  In 2010, the remediation team proposed cleaning the entire site to an industrial standard for arsenic contamination. The team later promised to restore parts of the site to a residential standard for arsenic. That opens the possibility for a variety of land uses, but the city wants to remediation team to help ""re-establish a concept of what that land use might be,"" said Todd Slack, the city's special advisor on Giant Mine. ""I've been a land-use planner for more than 10 years and I've never seen a land-use plan come at the tail end of a process,"" Slack told the board. ""The city can't drive this forward on its own. The range of possible land uses now is unclear."" After reading a short poem (actually song lyrics, written specifically for the land and water board), Alternatives North also raised concerns over the lack of detail included in the closure and reclamation plan, including how the site will look.  ""The [closure and reclamation plan] thus far does not appear to apply a consistent approach to design of the site's final appearance,"" said Michael Nabert.  ""If the visual appearance of various aspects of the site do not communicate a consistent message to future generations, our capacity to clearly communicate what they need to know will be diminished,"" said Nabert. The board will also hear from two federal government departments, the Giant Mine Oversight Board, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, the North Slave Métis Alliance and the Yellowknife Historical Society before deciding whether, and on what terms, to issue the remediation team its licence and permit. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-hearings-tuesday-1.5435900,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-remediation-to-do-list-1.5434166 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187,N/A
348,Marina von Stackelberg,2020-01-21T13:59:55.031Z,'They have a monopoly': Northern Manitoba First Nations decry Perimeter Aviation following crash,"A group of northern Manitoba First Nations says Perimeter Aviation has longstanding issues after a plane crash on a remote community left passengers ""very shaken up."" ""This large corporation, which profits almost entirely off northern First Nations, is letting our First Nations down,"" Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak wrote in a statement late Monday night. MKO represents 26 northern Manitoba First Nations, including Shamattawa. The flight from Thompson to Shamattawa landed around 5 p.m. Sunday, but while taxiing to the airport, veered off the runway and ran into a snowbank, snapping one of the plane's propellers. The 11 passengers and two crew members were not injured. The turbo prop plane, built in 1987, suffered minor damage, Transport Canada said. The Transportation Safety Board has been notified. ""It has really affected a lot of the passengers psychologically,"" Shamattawa Chief Eric Redhead said. Redhead said his First Nation and others in the north have had longstanding issues with Perimeter, and he feels the airline is not taking this latest event seriously.  ""What does it take for Perimeter to step up? We don't want anyone to get hurt for them to take action,"" Redhead said. Redhead said First Nation leadership met with Perimeter's vice-president of operations for an hour and half on Monday. ""We've met with Perimeter [on] numerous occasions to address capacity issues and safety issues, and that was the same thing. It was the same spiel that they gave us every other meeting,"" he said. ""It didn't seem like a meaningful conversation. It didn't seem like things were going to get done, as usual. We were very disappointed in Perimeter and their management."" The company plans to meet with leadership again in the future, Carlos Castillo, Perimeter's VP of commercial operations, said in an emailed statement. ""We have been serving Manitoba's northern communities for 60 years and take our commitment to them very seriously and are very proud of our track record,"" Castillo wrote. Shamattawa is currently in a 10-year exclusive contract with Perimeter, signed by the First Nation's previous leadership, Redhead said. That means Shamattawa can only use Perimeter at its airport until 2027. Redhead said Shamattawa and six other First Nations are looking to break similar contracts, and he's in discussions with other carriers. ""They have a monopoly on air transport in the north,"" he said. ""When you have a monopoly, you don't have to provide adequate service. You don't have to provide low fares, you don't have to be on time. Perimeter is notorious for being late. They're notorious for treating our people as second-class citizens, and that needs to stop,"" he said.  Castillo said by email if Shamattawa's leadership ""would like to revisit the agreement, we would be pleased to do so."" Communities like Shamattawa, which is 750 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, rely heavily on the one flight a day in and out of their community. The planes not only transport people, but also food, supplies and the mail when the fly-in community is not accessible by winter ice road. A round trip ticket between Winnipeg and Shamattawa costs close to $900, the airline's website says. The majority of Perimeter's clients are in isolated communities, the company's website says. The airline, operated out of Winnipeg, provides passenger airline service, medevac operations and cargo services to locations in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. The parent company for Perimeter, Exchange Income Corporation, also owns other northern Canadian flight services in Manitoba, Ontario and Nunavut, including Keewatin Air, Calm Air, Bearskin and Custom Helicopters. The company also operates PAL Airlines, which provides services on the East Coast, including remote areas of Newfoundland and Labrador. In November 2017, a 19-seat Perimeter Airlines flight from Gods River to Thompson landed and then careened off the runway after losing pressure, suffering substantial damage. In February 2019, the Manitoba government announced it had signed a five-year contract with Exchange Income Corporation for general air transportation to the tune of $4.2 million a year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/perimeter-aviation-2020-crash-first-nations-1.5434225,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/perimeter-airlines-runway-snowbank-crash-manitoba-1.5432972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/transportation-safety-board-thompson-landing-crash-1.4917722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/general-air-transportation-private-1.5019133,N/A
349,Catherine Cullen,2020-01-23T09:00:00.573Z,Online government survey on medical aid in dying sees record-breaking response,"The federal government has been flooded with messages from Canadians who want to weigh in on medical aid in dying. As of Wednesday evening, 229,281 Canadians had responded to the government's survey, which has been online for just a week and a half. It's an enormous figure — the largest number of responses the Department of Justice has ever seen for any public consultation. Even hot topics like cannabis and prostitution only netted about 30,000 responses each. CBC News asked Justice Canada whether it was aware of any organized campaign that might be pushing the numbers up. ""We will continue to monitor for any potential evidence of abuse, but to date no major issues have been identified,"" said a ministry spokesperson. One factor that could be driving the numbers is experience: more Canadians may now know someone who obtained a legal doctor-assisted death, said Susan Desjardins of the advocacy group Dying with Dignity. ""I believe that people want to have this choice,"" she said. In her own volunteer work with the group, Desjardins said, she's seen an increase in the number of requests for information about assisted dying. Her group is encouraging its members to participate in the online consultations. ""I would say there aren't very many people who want to die, but they want to die well and they want to die as much as possible on their terms,"" said Desjardins. The federal government said more than 6,700 Canadians have obtained medically-assisted deaths — but that figure only covers the period up to November 2018.  CBC News has requested newer numbers. Leaders in the Catholic Church also have been urging their members to weigh in. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops provides a link to the survey on its website. ""We weren't necessarily directing them or telling them how to fill it out,"" said Calgary Bishop William McGrattan. ""But [we're] giving them the proper understanding and context and knowledge so they might express their views with their faith in mind."" Bishop McGrattan said he worries that any expansion of access to medical aid in dying would affect the vulnerable, such as those with dementia or mental illnesses. He said he's also concerned about the tight timeline for public consultations. The survey will close on Jan. 27 at 11:59 PM PST. ""A two-week consultation I don't think gives it the importance that it should,"" he said, adding that a deeper discussion is needed before the law can be changed. The federal government is doing more than just the online survey.  Cabinet ministers have been holding closed-door roundtable meetings across the country on the topic as well. Officials are working quickly to meet a court-imposed timeline. A Quebec judge struck down a portion of the federal law in the fall. The portion of the law requiring that a patient's death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" to qualify for medical assistance will be suspended as of March 11. Justice Minister David Lametti has said he hopes to put forward new legislation next month. In 2016, a poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that 73 per cent of respondents believed it should be easier for Canadians to make their own end-of-life decisions. New data seen by CBC News that will be released by Angus Reid later this week shows that number has risen. It shows a ""hardening"" of opinion on the issue, said the polling firm's executive director Shachi Kurl. ""When you see consensus that is that strong on an issue, you know people are passionately engaged on it. They're paying attention. And in many cases, it's going to be something that has touched their [lives],"" said Kurl. Lametti has said Canadians' views on medically assisted death have evolved since the legislation was passed in 2016. Not everyone agrees. Grace Pastine of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, which advocates for fewer restrictions on medically assisted death, said that Canadian politicians are simply waking up to what the public already believed. ""The federal government has, in some ways, caught up to where the Canadian public is, and really where the courts have been for years now,"" said Pastine. She describes the current laws as providing ""layers and layers of safeguards"" on the procedure. People with diseases such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and Huntington's have a right to a doctor's help to die, she argued, and the new legislation should reflect that. Larry Worthen, executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Association of Canada, staunchly opposes the 2016 legislation. He said he fears some will choose a medically assisted death because they worry about being a burden to their loved ones, or because they feel lonely or isolated. ""We have to as Canadians come to grips with the fact that once we've opened Pandora's box in this way, there are going to be some unintentional repercussions,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medical-assistance-dying-survey-response-1.5434832,[],N/A
350,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-22T19:13:22.384Z,Charlottetown hopes to calm traffic at busy intersections,"The City of Charlottetown is looking at ways to slow drivers down at two important pedestrian crossings. The city is looking downtown, at the intersection of Fitzroy and Great George, and where the Confederation Trail crosses Longworth Avenue. Public works manager Scott Adams said there have been public complaints about the intersection, and police have also expressed safety concerns. ""Some of the issues are some speeds with vehicles, vehicles not yielding for pedestrians to cross and drivers maybe not being able to see the pedestrians waiting to cross the road,"" Adams said. The public works department has recommended to council that changes be made, and wants to hire a consultant for the final design. The design could include medians at both locations, which tend to slow drivers down, and create a visual cue for drivers to pay closer attention. ""We also call it a pedestrian refuge,"" Adams said. ""It just gives them a safer spot. If something does end up happening, it just gives them ... a little bit of a safety net that they can stop and wait there."" Extending the curb more out into the street is also being considered at Fitzroy and Great George. The idea is to make waiting pedestrians more visible, said Adams, as they would be out past the parked cars.

351,Laura Osman ,2020-01-21T21:25:03.830Z,Maintenance company falling down on the job: Transit chair,"The chair of Ottawa's transit commission, Coun. Allan Hubley, is laying blame for the train shortage that's wreaking havoc on morning and afternoon commutes squarely on the maintenance company hired to keep them in working order. Riders endured more unreliable LRT service Monday and Tuesday, when there were as few as eight double trains in circulation. OC Transpo normally deploys 13 trains during rush hour. Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM), an offshoot of Confederation Line builder Rideau Transit Group (RTG), has been tasked with a host of responsibilities necessary to keep the trains — and the rest of the system — running smoothly. But that work isn't getting done, and that's what's causing the problems, Hubley said in an interview with CBC on Tuesday.  ""If they do the maintenance ... we wouldn't be having these issues,"" he said. One of RTM's task is making sure ""wheel flats"" — when train wheels lose their perfect roundness, causing them to grind on the tracks — don't occur. It hasn't been doing that to satisfaction, Hubley said. ""They're always supposed to be looking at [the wheels], grinding them,"" Hubley said. ""They're supposed to be checking it and it looks to us at this point that they haven't been doing that."" OC Transpo employees can't do the maintenance work themselves, Hubley explained, leaving the city to rely on RTM. Ottawa LRT running with only 10 trains Because of the numerous and ongoing maintenance issues, the city has been withholding payments to RTM since September's Confederation Line launch, an amount that fluctuates between about $4 million and $5 million per month.  Ottawa is locked in a contract with the company for the next 30 years. ""I'd rather they do their job,"" Hubley said. ""We'll pay them their money, everybody will be happier on the trains."" Out on the platforms, passengers have just about had it. Claudia Desnoyers said she had high hopes for LRT, but after Tuesday's trip to work, her patience with the system has evaporated.  ""It was very terrible,"" Denoyers said. ""[It] took me 15 minutes to just be able to board the train and it was jam-packed again. I had to let one through because there was no place on it, and the second one wasn't really any better."" David Jeanes of transit advocacy group Transport Action Canada said it seems like a new problem creeps up every day.  ""We need better maintenance, we need those trains in service, we need the trains to be properly cleaned,"" Jeanes said. ""We need to solve these problems with brakes seizing and causing flat wheels."" Hubley said he's fully aware of the frustration boiling over among passengers, and assured them he's feeling it himself. ""I don't know the word but I'm going to have to invent one because there is really no good description of how upset I am about this,"" he said. Hubley added he's cautiously optimistic all the trains will be up and running soon. ""I'm hoping that today, tomorrow at the latest, and things will be better. But I can't promise you that,"" he said. A meeting of the transit commission has been hastily called for Thursday, when representatives from RTM will be expected to provide some answers.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lrt-maintance-hubley-1.5434955,[],N/A
352,Adam Miller,2020-01-18T09:00:00.516Z,Why flu season could make it harder for doctors to diagnose vaping-related illness,"A 20-year-old man shows up in a U.S. emergency room with flu-like symptoms.  He's hospitalized for four days before leaving, against medical advice, only to return to the ER with chest pain, fever and shortness of breath.  By this point he's lost almost 20 pounds. Doctors are stumped. They test him for strep throat, hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases, all of which turn up negative.  It's only when a camera is inserted into his airway and a CT scan is done to examine his lungs that it's confirmed he has vaping-related illness. The case, published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians this week, highlights the challenges in diagnosing vaping-related illness — especially during flu season. Canada is currently facing an early start to flu season, with both influenza A and B strains circulating at the same time.  So far, there have been nearly 12,500 confirmed cases of flu across the country and 10 deaths.  Dr. Tereza Martinu, a lung transplant respirologist with Toronto General Hospital who treated an Ontario teen with vaping-related illness last year, said diagnosing it can be difficult for doctors at this time of year. ""It always looks like something else,"" she said, adding that pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and the flu have similar symptoms. ""I think doctors don't think about it, and therefore often don't diagnose it.""  Martinu said it's important for doctors to be aware of vaping-related illness, particularly during flu season, and to ask patients about their exposure to vaping in order to rule it out. ""I think it's important to increase our awareness of it,"" she said. ""You need to then at least think about it and ask the right questions such as: Does the patient have exposure to vaping?""  Dr. Atul Kapur, an Ottawa-based emergency room doctor and co-chair of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians' public affairs committee, says it adds another layer of difficulty for diagnosis.  ""Having this as another potential cause of lung problems makes things busier and more difficult in the emergency department,"" he said. ""From our point of view, that's a big problem.""  There have been 2,668 reported cases of vaping-related illness in the U.S. and 60 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Canada has had just 16 cases and no deaths in the same time period, a disproportionately low number even with our smaller population. Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s chief medical officer and chair of the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health, said she's surprised by the lower number of cases in Canada.  She says it may have something to do with the differences in the availability of legal and illegal products, or how it's diagnosed.  The CDC reports that 82 per cent of cases in the U.S. reported using any cannabis vapes, while 57 per cent said they used any nicotine e-cigarettes. Of those, 33 per cent reported exclusively using cannabis vapes, while 14 per cent said they had only vaped nicotine.  In Canada, nine of the 16 cases reported vaping nicotine exclusively. Three said they had vaped cannabis and nicotine, and another three reported vaping cannabis only.  An additive called vitamin E acetate has been identified as a ""chemical of concern"" by the CDC in the outbreak of the illness, but has not officially been confirmed as the culprit.   ""I think it's way too early to identify a clear pattern,"" says Dr. Martin Kolb, director of the respirology division at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. ""I think what that clearly shows us is that these products are not harmless in a way that it was shown and continues to be described by the industry."" ""It absolutely is under-reported,"" said Henry. ""We are going to absolutely miss some and it's a challenge — it's a diagnostic challenge for clinicians that we face all the time."" She said the difficulty is that the diagnosis relies on a doctor asking questions specifically about vaping and patients being upfront about their use.  Kapur, with the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, says it can also take time for a team of experts to identify the illness. ""There is going to be a bit of a delay before people are making the link and ruling out other causes,"" he said. ""The problem with this, of course, is that they get worse fairly quickly.""  Kapur said patients will often quit vaping when symptoms persist, adding another challenge, which is what happened in the U.S. case study.  ""Because the symptoms are of breathing, a lot of patients are probably stopping on their own,"" Kapur said. ""And so there may be some milder cases that aren't connected at all. So that would account for some under-reporting in both countries."" That decision to quit vaping during treatment could also lead to a misdiagnosis, Martinu said.  ""If the patient stops using it and improves, then we may have diagnosed some of those problems as something that is much more common,"" she said.  Henry said there may be people with milder, undiagnosed cases in the community that are unknown to health officials who could be at risk of severe influenza or other viral illnesses circulating this time of year.  ""I have no doubt that there are some people hospitalized and it is likely either exacerbated or related to their vaping that we don't know about,"" said Henry.  ""That's why it's so important to get these messages out, particularly for young people about the issues that can come up with vaping and why it's not a good thing to do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illnesses-1.5386125 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-vitamin-e-1.5404858 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-liquid-tests-1.5381363 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/vaping-lung-transplant-1.5359105,N/A
353,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-22T20:24:56.680Z,Former Supreme Court justice says discrimination and grief forged his legal career,"Michel Bastarache says he never aspired to the life he ended up living: a career of achievement that included reaching the pinnacle of the Canadian legal system, the Supreme Court of Canada. What he wanted most, he writes in a memoir launched in Moncton this week, was a rich family life with his wife and a lot of kids — a noisy home full of activity and learning.  But that life eluded him. His two children, Jean-François and Émilie, both died young of a rare congenital disease, ""a pain as deep as an abyss, a pain that is always there, that casts a shadow on everything else,"" he writes. ""Nothing marked me more than the death of my two children. I had the career I had. But there will always be an emptiness that can't be filled.""   Bastarache says he coped with his children's illnesses by throwing himself into his work as a constitutional lawyer, which culminated in his appointment to the nation's top court in 1997. Published in French in December, the book is called: Ce que je voudrais dire à mes enfants — what I would like to say to my children. Co-authored by Radio-Canada journalist Antoine Trépanier, the memoir offers a rare firsthand account of key moments in the history of constitutional and language rights in New Brunswick and Canada. It's a history in which Bastarache was a central and sometimes contentious figure. The retired justice said in an interview he was urged to write his memoirs by minority-francophone communities he'd represented in court, who wanted his work on their behalf recorded for history. But he didn't have time to properly go through archives until his publisher, the University of Ottawa Press, suggested he work with Trépanier as a researcher.  The narrative spans his childhood in Moncton and his work translating New Brunswick statutes into French after the advent of official bilingualism, to his positions as dean of law at the University of Moncton and CEO of Moncton-based insurance company Assumption Life. It also includes two high-profile language episodes from the government of former premier Richard Hatfield: the adoption of Bill 88 and the Poirier-Bastarache commission on official languages. Bill 88 enshrined education duality in provincial law, declaring that both anglophone and francophone communities had the right to their own school systems. Bastarache reveals that he wanted to go much further in the original version of the bill with provisions that would commit governments to spend money to protect rights and to guarantee equitable economic development among regions and language groups. A draft version also would have required a vote by three-quarters of MLAs to change or repeal the law.  But Hatfield's advisers worried the original version would give too much power to the courts to overrule elected politicians. ""Oh my God, Michel, I could never convince my cabinet to adopt that,"" Hatfield told Bastarache, according to the book.  Still, Bastarache says the version adopted was ""an accomplishment, no doubt. … I told myself that there'll be no going backwards and eliminating our school boards."" The provisions were eventually added to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Not long after Bill 88, Bastarache co-chaired a contentious provincial commission on official languages that prompted a fierce backlash among some anglophones. He attributes that reaction to a chapter in his report that described anglophone attitudes hostile toward bilingualism—a chapter he now regrets including. ""Anglophones perceived this section as an attack by francophones who wanted, it seemed, to take away the powers of the majority,"" he writes. The commission pushed for dual English and French services via what he calls ""a major administrative reorganization"" of the provincial government involving decentralized regional work units. It would have ensured the delivery of all services in both languages without doubling all government functions, Bastarache says.  But the nuances were lost in the angry response to the chapter on attitudes, he writes.  ""I think if I had to do it over, knowing the negative reactions from the public, the rejection of the document, the threats and the bad press, I would change my approach,"" he writes. ""Had we done things differently, we might have a had a better Official Language Act and the province might have made some progress."" Bastarche says his drive for linguistic equality was shaped by his childhood in Moncton, during a time when he says there was still overt discrimination against Acadians.  It led him to the law, including constitutional work representing minority-French communities from Alberta to Prince Edward Island to win access to education in their language.  Bastarache was named to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in 1995 and two years later was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, just as the court was preparing for a reference case on whether Quebec had the right to unilaterally separate from Canada.  The court ruled that it did not but also that Canada would be obligated to negotiate if there were a clear referendum vote to separate. The ruling, which Bastarache helped write, was widely seen as a nuanced compromise that clarified a legally ambiguous scenario. ""That's what we created and that did not exist at the beginning of the debate,"" he writes. ""When a country is confronted with a major problem, there are still institutions that can arrive at an imaginative solution."" The book also tells the story of the landmark Beaulac decision from 1999, a ruling written by Bastarache that broadened official language rights. In that decision, the court ruled 7-2 that the Constitution requires governments to do more than merely accommodate the minority language group by offering truly equal access to services in both English and French. ""I wanted to send a clear message to Canada as a whole that minority rights are not secondary rights,"" Bastarache writes. ""I could say mission almost accomplished.""  The Beaulac decision was cited last year when a judge ruled that Ambulance New Brunswick must provide bilingual services in all its ambulances. Bastarache retired from the Supreme Court in 2008 and since then has taken on a number of roles, including as an independent arbitrator on compensation for victims of sexual abuse by priests in the diocese of Bathurst and archdiocese of Moncton. Bastarache met with people claiming to be victims, evaluated the credibility and the seriousness of their accounts, and set an amount for their compensation based on previous court rulings.  In the book he rebuts criticisms that the amounts were not sufficient, saying he consulted more than 200 damage awards to come to his decisions. ""Personally, I didn't think that $250,000 can ever make up for the abuse,"" he says. ""But I didn't have a choice. I had to award an amount equivalent to what a New Brunswick court would accept. The amounts were drawn from cases.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/memoir-michel-bastarache-language-1.5436064,[],N/A
354,Dan Taekema,2019-12-13T22:38:54.610Z,Murder charge withdrawn against 18-year-old in stabbing death of student Devan Selvey,"A first-degree murder charge against the 18-year-old accused in the stabbing death of Hamilton high school student Devan Selvey has been withdrawn, and he's instead facing assault charges. The 18-year-old, who cannot be identified under a court-ordered publication ban, appeared at the John Sopinka Courthouse in Hamilton on Friday morning for a bail hearing. The Crown withdrew the murder count. He's now charged with assault with a weapon, administering a noxious substance and unauthorized possession of a weapon. Outside of court, the 18-year-old embraced more than a dozen family members and supporters, who filled three benches in the courtroom during the hearing. ""He's spending time with his family now,"" defence lawyer Jordana Goldlist said after her client was released from custody. ""He's been improperly in custody for two months, shuffled between three different institutions. He spent a significant amount of time in segregation, so right now he's just looking forward to going home with his family as he should be."" She said the Crown had to withdraw the murder charge, because ""there was no reasonable prospect of conviction."" The 18-year-old was released to two sureties — one of whom will have to pay $20,000 if he doesn't comply with conditions and the other who will have to pay $5,000. His conditions include not being within 100 metres of Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School or the Pat Quinn Arena, observing a curfew between 10 p.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET and not having contact with a list of 63 people or anyone with a criminal record. He also cannot possess any weapons. The 18-year-old and his 14-year-old brother, who can't be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, were initially both charged with murder in the Oct. 7 stabbing of Devan, 14, outside Winston Churchill Secondary School. CBC News previously spoke with witnesses who said that bear spray had been used on a crowd of people standing in front of the arena, causing them to scatter right before the stabbing, which happened behind the school. Police allege the 14-year-old is the person who stabbed Devan, so he's still charged with first-degree murder. Devan died in the arms of his mother, Shari-Anne Selvey. Selvey was briefly spotted outside court Friday but appeared upset and did not speak with reporters. Devan's death kickstarted a community conversation about bullying and led to the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board setting up a panel to examine its anti-bullying practices. Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce also pointed to what happened to Devan as one of the driving factors behind the changes the provincial government introduced last month to tackle bullying.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/slevey-stabbing-charges-downgraded-1.5394357,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/devan-selvey-stabbing-1.5332475 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-violence-marketplace-1.5224865 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/student-violence-data-reporting-1.5331967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-school-violence-sexual-violence-1.5329520 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/bracci-selvey-stabbing-court-accused-1.5328849,N/A
355,Saša Petricic,2020-01-23T17:17:06.191Z,Beijing struggles to keep up with a virus  — and a nation on the move,"At Beijing's central railway station, the crowds stream in, ticket in hand, suitcase in tow, surgical mask in place. This last item has become an integral part of this year's Lunar New Year celebrations. ""I'm very worried about the virus,"" said Zhang Luyao, a twenty-something on her way home to China's north. ""It's spreading really fast, and there are so many people around me."" Indeed, tens of millions of people are on the move this week, travelling across China and abroad.  It's the largest annual human migration on earth. And this year, it may exacerbate a very human vulnerability: infection from the new strain of coronavirus, now potentially being spread by all the travellers.  On Wednesday, the Chinese National Health Commission underlined the ""risk of further spread of the epidemic"" by all the movement of people. The virus would have opportunities to infect many more people, through coughing, sneezing or breathing, said the Deputy Director of the Commission, Li Bin.said the Deputy Director of the Commission, Li Bin. The new coronavirus likely came from wild animals, almost certainly transferring to humans at a wholesale seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. Many of those initially infected had been at the market, and the vast majority of confirmed cases now are still in Wuhan and the province around it, Hubei. In a dramatic move on Thursday, China effectively quarantined Wuhan, cutting air and rail service to the city of 11 million people and closing down public transit within it. A government edict said citizens should not leave Wuhan unless they had ""special conditions.""  The World Health Organization commended China for ""minimizing risks locally and abroad"" with the move. But is it too late? Infections have already been showing up in many parts of the country, from Beijing to Macau, Shanghai to Shenzhen. And abroad in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The first North American case is in Washington State, a man who recently travelled to China. The number of these cases has grown by hundreds this week, and some days, the deaths attributed to the virus has doubled. Unusually for China, the number of cases have all been announced in daily briefings and hourly updates, and carried in state media over the past days. Some people have been left reeling, feeling numb from the speed and scale of the outbreak — and helpless. Pang Zifen sat on a suitcase Wednesday in front of the Beijing railway station with her young son. Both wore masks.  ""We don't normally wear these,"" she said with a sigh, ""and I'm not sure how useful they are. But I want to protect my son and I just don't know what else to do.""  As the easiest form of protection, masks have been selling out at stores across China.  Still, there are those who don't believe they are being told the whole story. ""I don't that trust what I see,"" said He Wen, a 27 year-old traveller at the Shanghai railway station. ""I think the number of the infected could be far more than that reported."" Online, there's been anger as well, though censors have been removing many negative comments on China's controlled internet. One post under the name 'Phoenix' said ""hiding the virulence of the virus or the number of people infected is a cover-up! We must hold them accountable, no matter how high the responsibility goes."" There is reason for suspicion.  In 2002, when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared in China's southern Guangdong province, it took three months for state media to report on it. And even then, the message was to reassure people that it wasn't a serious problem.  Meanwhile, the country was dealing with more than 1,800 confirmed cases and close to 80 deaths. SARS went on to kill almost 800 people worldwide, with experts blaming China's slow response for making the problem worse. SARS is also a coronavirus, closely related to the new strain.  Beijing eventually admitted it was a mistake to try to hide the SARS outbreak, and China's Health Minister and the mayor of Beijing were removed from their positions. There was little news about the current coronavirus in its early days as well, until this week when Chinese state media reported that President Xi Jinping told his officials that ""people's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed."" Information began to flow. But so has China's mass migration. The crowds at the Beijing railway station are as big as ever. So is the demand for masks… and the sense of worry on the faces of those who wear them. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/beijing-struggles-keep-up-with-virus-1.5437234,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/china-chinese-new-year-winnipeg-coronavirus-1.5437059 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,N/A

The movies, made by 13 students in grades 3 to 6, highlighted their immigration stories and were told in their first language, as well as English. ""It's important that they do it in both. First of all, that's who they are, that's part of their identity,"" Jacquelyn Buckland, the English as an additional language (EAL) teacher, told CBC's Mainstreet Halifax in an interview on Tuesday. ""And we wanted to show how these students can still participate when they come here to Canada.

""The confidence the kids have when they get to be themselves and use their language is so important. And they're also teaching us, so not only are they learning English, we can also learn a bit of their language as well."" The students in the EAL program originally come from five different countries: Syria, India, China, Japan and Colombia. The movies show the children sliding drawings they've made across a table and into the view of the camera.

Paper stars with the children's names were taped on the floor to create a Hollywood Boulevard vibe. As the children walked the red carpet at the library, they collected a gold statue. It wasn't an Oscar, but a Grosvenor. After they accepted their award, they gathered at a photo area and posed for a picture surrounded by gold balloons.

357,Alicia Bridges and Victoria Dinh,2019-12-09T11:00:00.517Z,Confessions and controversy: Murder case against husband of Sheree Fertuck latest test of 'Mr. Big' tactic,"There's a big-time crime boss in Canada who treats his loyal followers to expensive dinners, gives them jobs and cleans up their crimes to keep them out of jail.  But the crimes aren't real, nor are the jobs. They're an elaborate ruse set up by the police to gather evidence from people suspected of serious crimes. A Saskatchewan man accused of murdering his estranged wife is the latest Canadian to find himself behind bars at the hands of ""Mr. Big"": the name given to a controversial undercover police tactic that law enforcement agencies across the country have used in efforts to move cold cases forward.  The operations involve police posing as criminals in an attempt to obtain a confession from a suspect. According to police, Greg Fertuck told an undercover officer that he ""got rid of"" his estranged wife, Sheree Fertuck, and threw her in the bush. She has been missing since her semi-truck was found abandoned at a gravel pit near Kenaston, Sask., in December 2015. Although her body has never been found, Greg Fertuck was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in late June 2019. Sheree's disappearance is the focus of a seven-part CBC investigative podcast called The Pit, the culmination of a year-long effort to uncover new information about the case. Now, as he sits behind bars in Saskatoon, charged with first-degree murder, Greg Fertuck is proclaiming his innocence. He said he lied about getting rid of Sheree because he was scared and intimidated by the undercover officers, who he says he believed were criminals. ""I made it up, and we went out supposedly looking for the body. Well, there is no body, so we just drove around to these different places, because it was all BS,"" said Fertuck in an interview with CBC News. ""I didn't kill her and there was no body out there."" Fertuck's claim goes straight to the heart of the controversy over the Mr. Big technique. Critics say it can violate the principles of confession law by creating a culture of fear, and may heighten the risk of false confessions. There have also been accusations it preys on the vulnerabilities of suspects with financial problems or addictions.   But for families of victims whose cases have gone cold, Mr. Big stings can be the only way to see charges laid and justice for their loved ones.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, is happy to see progress on the case.  ""I think because they are controversial I'm really crossing my fingers and hoping that [the RCMP] did it all the right ways, and did it legally … so that it can be admissible in court,"" she said.  ""You get one kick at the cat, right? So I really think that they know what they are doing.""  The playing field for Mr. Big stings is evolving under new guidelines outlined by a Supreme Court decision in 2014.   Still, questions remain about how the courts should balance the rights of the accused with the need for police to have the tools to catch violent criminals. CBC contacted the Saskatchewan RCMP but spokesperson Rob King said the police service will not discuss the technique or address criticisms of the method, because it is still being used.  Mr. Big stings have been carried out hundreds of times in Canada since they were developed by the RCMP in the 1990s, often in elaborate operations — some have cost more than $300,000 to run.  The tactic is not used in the U.S. or Britain, but it has been used to produce charges in Australia. In the stings, officers befriend a suspect while pretending to be members of a fictitious crime organization.  The goal is to build trust with the target and potentially draw out new information to use as evidence. This could include a confession to a crime, a description of how the crime occurred, or the location of the victim's body or the murder weapon.  The method is often used in cold cases, where the police have a suspect but lack the evidence to prosecute.  Saskatoon defence lawyer Brian Pfefferle has represented three people charged with separate serious crimes after a Mr. Big sting.  He said the technique is highly successful in landing convictions.  ""I've never been able to convince a jury that there was a false confession made. And I think my results are consistent with other people's results around the country,"" said Pfefferle.  ""There's a smattering of cases that have led to acquittals or convictions on lower offences but for the most part they're getting convicted of the offence they're facing when they're giving these types of confessions, so it's very significant evidence."" Each of the operations follows a similar script: the undercover agents insert themselves into the target's lives through a ""chance"" meeting, and bring them further into the ""organization"" through a chain of scenarios.  In an interview at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre in July, Fertuck shared details of the operation with CBC.  He said an undercover officer offered him paid jobs transporting vehicles from one town to another. Paid work is regularly offered to Mr. Big suspects during the course of the sting, and Fertuck said he trusted the men. It's common for the suspect to feel a strong kinship with the undercover officers in the stings, says Pfefferle. ""They become real friends,"" he said.  ""I've had situations where the people 'fall in love,' essentially, with the various characters — not in a romantic sense but in a friendship sense, where ... oftentimes the best friends they've ever had in their life are these fictitious friends."" Fertuck also described another hallmark of the Mr. Big method: a scenario known as ""the violent incident.""  He said he met with a man who appeared to have committed a killing — and another man who said he would clean it up. ""This one guy [said he] killed his girlfriend, and I know he had blood all over him, scratches on his face,"" said Fertuck.  ""And this guy from Vancouver ... come in and got rid of everything, sort of the clean-up guy."" Some type of simulated violence is part of most Mr. Big stings. During a 2015 appeal of a first-degree murder conviction, the officer who directed an undercover operation involving murder suspect Jesse West explained the reason for choosing to simulate violence against a woman as part of the sting: ""It was directly to show Mr. West that violence against women was accepted in our organization. The investigation was a homicide on a female and we wanted to show him that women — to conduct violence on women is not a big deal."" In that case, the judge denied the defence claim that the violent incident was an abuse of process, and the appeal of West's conviction was dismissed. In the case of Abiram Subramaniam, who was convicted in 2016 of second-degree murder in Quebec, the ""criminals"" told the suspect they had information that police were coming after him.  The details are part of a written decision by Justice Marc-Andre Blanchard.  ""The Boss was willing to … help him get out of this situation related to the victim,"" Justice Blanchard wrote. ""Without his help, it was made clear that Subramaniam would in all likelihood be going to jail for 25 years."" Pfefferle said he considers confession evidence such as that from Mr. Big stings even more damning for the accused than video evidence. His main concerns about the technique relate to confession law, which states that a confession must be made of free will and without any threats or promises made to the accused.  ""The problem with Mr. Bigs, at their core, is that they are based on exactly those things — not necessarily direct threats, but there is this subtle threat of this organization being pretty bad."" There are also promises, Pfefferle said. ""Oftentimes it's promises for a long-term job with the criminal organization, and many times these particular accused persons will have difficulty with employment."" He said Mr. Big stings are also different from traditional police investigations because most of the interactions are not recorded.  Usually when a person is arrested, all of their interactions with police in the interview room are recorded. In Mr. Big stings, usually only the final interview, or a handful of meetings, are taped. But Pfefferle also sees broader issues with the way the stings operate. Although there is evidence that false confessions have occurred, he said society has a tendency to believe an admission of guilt.  ""If you've confessed to something, especially something that is embarrassing or it's going to get you in trouble, most people believe you did it,"" said Pfefferle.  ""I think that's one of the problems with Mr. Bigs because the evidence at the end of the day is so strong in the minds of the average juror that they're going to say 'he wouldn't have confessed if he didn't do it.'"" People have been cleared of committing crimes they confessed to during a Mr. Big sting.  Kyle Unger spent 14 years in jail for the murder of Brigitte Grenier in Manitoba in 1990.  He was convicted based largely on his confession, testimony from jailhouse informants and a single piece of forensic evidence — a hair found on the victim's clothing.  But DNA testing later proved the hair did not belong to Unger. And although he got key facts wrong about the killing in his confession to undercover officers, it was still used against him.  He later told reporters he'd lied because he was young, naive and desperate for money. Unger was acquitted in 2009.  Al Haslett, a retired RCMP officer and one of the creators of the Mr. Big sting, previously defended the technique in an interview with CBC's The Fifth Estate in 2015. ""[We] seek the truth. We don't go there, we don't wake up in the morning and say 'we're going to get confessions,'"" Haslett said in an interview with Bob McKeown.   ""This is not a bunch of cowboy cops going out and doing this. This is planned, the scenarios are planned, thought out, and we go to seek the truth."" Haslett was not available to be interviewed by CBC for this story. However, ""things can go off the rails and people can, because of fear, say and do things that might not otherwise be true, or that they might not otherwise have done,"" said Neil Boyd, the director of the school of criminology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. But he pointed to the case of Doug Holtam as an example of a case where a Mr. Big sting led to a conviction that was warranted.  Holtam was convicted of the 1997 murder of his wife Leonora and six-year-old daughter with a hammer. He was also found guilty of the attempted murder of his son, who survived the attack. Police had DNA evidence of his children's blood on his shirt and shoe before the Mr. Big sting led to a confession.  ""His conviction was entirely warranted, so I don't take the position that just because the police have engaged in this kind of activity that it's necessarily suspect,"" said Boyd.  It is up to the courts to decide if a case has gone ""off the rails"" or not, he said. That's what the Supreme Court did in 2014, when the case of Nelson Hart in Newfoundland led to stricter rules for Mr. Big stings. The court concluded the conduct of police in that case was ""egregious"" and ""troubling."" Justice Michael Moldaver wrote that the law at that time didn't offer enough protection to people who confessed to crimes during Mr. Bigs.  He said while these types of stings can produce valuable evidence and are not necessarily abusive, they can become abusive and produce unreliable confessions. He ruled police should be allowed to keep using the tactic, but under stricter rules.  Mr. Big confessions are now automatically considered inadmissible unless the Crown can prove their value as evidence outweighs their capacity to prejudice the outcome of trial. Prosecutors have successfully done so in several cases since 2014.  The 2014 Supreme Court decision also offered clearer guidelines for judges deciding if Mr. Big evidence should be admissible, and to help them decide what counts as police misconduct.  The Public Prosecution Service of Canada wrote about the impact of the case against Hart in a 2018 report titled Innocence at Stake: The Need for Continued Vigilance to Prevent Wrongful Convictions in Canada. The report predicted the courts will likely be more restrictive about what types of violent incidents can be simulated in Mr. Big stings in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. It offered recommendations for prosecution services, urging them to make sure they do not exploit the target's vulnerabilities, and to take further care to ensure the violent incident does not directly or indirectly threaten the suspect.  Juries at Mr. Big trials are also now instructed that people have falsely confessed in the past.   Brian Pfefferle said the legitimacy of the confession will likely be at the heart of the Crown's case against Greg Fertuck.  ""The strength of that confession is really going to be the focus for the jury, as it always is,"" said Pfefferle.  ""What can be corroborated through the forensic evidence?""  Another factor in the Fertuck case will be the fact that Sheree's body has not been found. It is unusual for police to lay charges without finding the victim.  Greg Fertuck said he led the undercover officers to a country road outside Saskatoon. In the days after his June arrest, police were seen searching an area not far from the gravel pit where Sheree's truck was found, but they did not find her remains.  RCMP Insp. Diane Cockle says searching for human remains that have been left outside for four years is an incredibly difficult task.  ""What happens to the remains is they get weathered, they change colour, they get bleached by the sun or they get stained by the soil,"" said Cockle, who has a PhD in forensic anthropology and worked as a forensic crime scene investigator for 19 years. She now works in major crimes.  ""The vegetation gets deposited on top of the area over time so they end up being buried. And it becomes less and less visible every year."" Scavengers including domestic dogs, coyotes and birds can move parts of a body up to about 400-500 metres from where the body was dumped, she said. ""But if these guys [in Saskatchewan] were searching in a systematic matter looking for things like small bone fragments and they knew what they were looking for, chances are they would have found what they were looking for."" On June 25, the day after Greg Fertuck's arrest, the search for Sheree Fertuck was still ongoing when RCMP Supt. Derek Williams announced the charges.  ""Although it's unusual, there have been successful prosecutions before without a body being found,"" said Williams.  A preliminary hearing will be held in January to decide if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. The hearing is likely to be subject to a publication ban.  To date, Greg Fertuck has been represented by Saskatoon criminal defence lawyer Morris Bodnar.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, hopes to attend the upcoming court proceedings, although she fears the evidence will be difficult to hear. Regardless, she is relieved to see the progress from a police perspective. ""I was a little bit afraid that, you know, cases do go cold, right. You hear that all the time. And I just thought, 'Oh God … this can't be one of them. Something's gotta come of it.'""  The preliminary hearing begins on Jan. 13.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mr-big-sting-saskatchewan-greg-fertuck-rcmp-police-canada-1.5388277,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/greg-fertuck-denies-killing-sheree-fertuck-1.5212297 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/friend-remembers-sheree-fertuck-at-accused-killer-s-court-appearance-in-saskatoon-1.5220735 https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2014-2015/mrbig https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kyle-unger-lawsuit-settled-1.5115948 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mr-big-ruling-a-game-changer-for-those-convicted-in-sting-operations-1.2724310,N/A
358,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-22T22:00:43.144Z,"Harvey Weinstein trial begins, portraying ex-producer as predator","Harvey Weinstein went on trial Wednesday in a landmark moment for the #MeToo movement, with prosecutors painting him as a sexual predator who used his movie-magnate stature to abuse women for decades, while his lawyers sought to discredit his accusers and portray them as willing participants. Prosecutor Meghan Hast told the jury of seven men and five women that the former studio boss was ""not just a titan in Hollywood — he was a rapist"" who screamed at one victim that she ""owed"" him sex, used injections to induce an erection before an assault and pushed his way into the apartment of another woman and assaulted her. ""It is for his complete lack of empathy that he must be held accountable,"" Hast said. Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis countered by laying out plans to use friendly-sounding emails, calendar entries and other evidence to call the accusers' accounts of being attacked into question. The opening of the rape trial more than two years after a barrage of allegations against Weinstein gave rise to #MeToo was seen by activists as a milestone in the global reckoning over sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's lawyers, though, have portrayed the case as the result of a climate of accusation run amok. Weinstein, 67, said little as he arrived at a Manhattan court Wednesday. Asked whether he believed he would have a fair trial, he said yes: ""I have good lawyers."" Guided by aides and lawyers, he wasn't using the walker he's leaned on lately after a summer car crash and subsequent back surgery. He said he was feeling better. Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. He could get life in prison if convicted. The once-powerful and feared executive brought to the screen such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech, Shakespeare in Love and Chicago, and hobnobbed with the elite in Hollywood and beyond, a point prosecutors made by showing jurors a photo of Weinstein with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. A prosecutor also told the judge that Weinstein had taken calls from Clinton while Weinstein was with one of his accusers. Weinstein's lawyers later cited the photo in asking for a mistrial, accusing prosecutors of improperly trying to influence the jury. Judge James Burke denied the request. The prosecution called former board member of The Weinstein Co., Lance Maerov, as its first witness. Maerov described the ex-producer as ""an extremely influential, powerful person"" who could be charming in public and aggressive in private. ""I would say his public personality was diametrically opposed to who he was in private,"" Maerov said. The movie company went bankrupt after Weinstein's fall. At the end of the day's session, Weinstein left the courthouse with the use of his walker. Asked how the day went, he said, ""Good."" Scores of women have accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them over the years. But the New York charges centre on two allegations: that he forcibly performed oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his apartment in 2006 and raped an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. The rape accuser found a needle in the hotel room bathroom after the alleged assault and realized Weinstein had injected himself to get an erection, Hast said. Another time, after the woman told him she had a new boyfriend, Weinstein dragged her into a bedroom, ""all the while screaming at her that he owed her one more time,"" Hast said. ""He ripped her jeans off so forcefully that it left scratch marks."" The prosecutor said Weinstein later told the woman, ""I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. I just find you so attractive, I couldn't resist you."" In addition to the two women he is charged with attacking, prosecutors plan to call to the stand four other accusers — including actress Annabella Sciorra — in a bid to portray Weinstein as a monster who lured women with offers of career help, then forced himself on them. ""They will each describe their fear, their shame and their humiliation — the struggle each went through to push their trauma down and show a brave face to the world,"" Hast said. Hast detailed allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted Sciorra around 1993 after giving the Sopranos actress a ride home to her Manhattan apartment and forcing his way inside. ""She told him to get out. She told him no. But Harvey Weinstein was undeterred,"" Hast said. Weinstein's lawyers made it clear they plan to go on the offensive. Cheronis said the 2013 rape accuser sent Weinstein a request that year asking for ""time privately"" with him and another message letting him know, ""I got a new number. I just wanted you to have it. Always good to hear your voice."" ""These aren't our words. They're hers. It is not a relationship based on fear, you are going to see that,"" Cherinos said. Weinstein's trial could take more than a month, Burke said. Judging from an arduous two-week jury selection that netted the panel of seven men and five women, it could be a hotbed of protests and intense media coverage. In a failed last-minute push to get the trial moved, Weinstein's lawyers said a flash mob's chanting ""the rapist is you!"" at street level could be heard in the courtroom, 15 floors above. Adding to the drama, actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was in the same courthouse Wednesday morning for a hearing for a case in which several women have accused him of groping. An April 21 trial date was set for the Oscar winner, who has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Once the New York trial is over, Weinstein faces additional rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. Those charges were filed this month as jury selection in his New York trial was getting underway.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-opening-statements-1.5435800,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035,N/A

The New Brunswick branch of the organization opened late last year at 300 Grandview Ave. in Saint John. Karen Walsh, the executive director of Newfoundland's program, received more than $1 million in federal funding from Employment and Social Development Canada to expand the program to New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  ""I think one of the things we have to do is change the conversation,"" said Joanne Gormley, the project co-ordinator for the New Brunswick branch of the organization.  ""Skilled trades are a viable option for women.""  The organization is working on creating a database of employers and women in trades, so it can match a woman looking for an apprenticeship with a business.  ""We're providing information for those women and helping them in finding those positions.""  When the Office to Advance Women in Apprentices began in Newfoundland 10 years ago, women in skilled trades made up six per cent of the workforce there. That number has more than doubled, to around 13 per cent.  Across most of Canada, and including New Brunswick, women in skilled trades make up around four per cent of the workforce, Gormley said. Women looking to go into a trade have a hard time finding employment, and if a woman does secure a job in her field, she's sometimes given a task unrelated to her job, Gormley said. ""They may be given tasks such as going to sweep the floor or doing things like that as opposed to working in the trade that they've been hired to be in.""  Twenty-seven women have expressed interest in attending an event the non-profit is hosting Thursday night at its Saint John office, called Tradeswomen Tabletalk.  This is the group's second event since it started operating in New Brunswick.

360,Ben Mussett,2020-01-22T14:00:00.576Z,"How to say 'Hi' to Harry and Meghan, according to an etiquette expert","If British Columbians happen to spot the much-talked-about Duke and Duchess of Sussex, treat them like cats: let them come to you.  At least, that's according to Vancouver etiquette expert Elizabeth Burnett.  ""I would wait for them to attend to me,"" Burnett told Kathryn Marlow, guest host of CBC's All Point West. ""I wouldn't just go up and tap him on the shoulder and say, 'Oh, hello, Harry, how are you?'"" ""We have to remember that Harry will always be royal,"" she added. ""It's in his blood.""  If presented to the newcomers, Burnett advised people to bow or curtsy. And never, she said, touch a royal. Instead, stand straight forward facing them with your arms at your sides.  However, Burnett also encouraged people to consider the situation before deciding how exactly to interact with the world's currently-most-watched couple. Perhaps such strict formality would be out of place on a Vancouver Island hiking trail.  Kitsilano residents play it cool over rumours they could be getting royal neighbours ""But you certainly wouldn't go up and start putting your hand out because they would offer their hand to you first and then you would shake hands,"" said Burnett, founder and president of Elizabeth Etiquette, an etiquette school. After announcing they would take a step back from their royal roles and work to become financially independent, Buckingham Palace and the Queen said on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of Britain's monarchy, no longer use their ""Royal Highness"" titles and would now pay their own way in life. So, what then should we call them? ""Well, of course they're not His and Her Royal Highnesses anymore,"" noted Burnett. Trudeau says he hasn't spoken to Queen about security costs after Harry arrives in Canada She said they should still be addressed as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, titles they still officially hold, along with the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton and the Baron and Baroness Kilkeel. However, using those titles in Canada might be an issue. The Nickle Resolution of 1919 effectively bans foreign titles of nobility for Canadian citizens and anyone ""domiciled or living in Canada."" It's not clear how the resolution applies to people who already have titles when they come here. And, in the end, the pair may prefer simply Harry and Meghan, anyway.  ""They would like to be treated, I believe, as just one of the locals,"" said Burnett. Prince Harry — yes, he's still a prince — reportedly landed at Victoria International Airport on Monday night before reuniting with Meghan and their young son, Archie. The duchess and her eight-month-old have been staying on B.C.'s West Coast, where the family spent the Christmas holiday, after briefly returning to the United Kingdom earlier this month.  Royal watchers continue to feverishly speculate over where in Canada the Duke and Duchess might plant roots, with Greater Victoria, Vancouver and Toronto as apparent top contenders. ""I think we have to give them time to establish themselves and give them some breathing room, which they haven't had before,"" Burnett told All Points West listeners.  As paparazzi descend on Harry and Meghan, B.C. privacy laws could face first celebrity test On Tuesday, media outlets like the Guardian said the couple had issued ""a stern warning"" against photographers in Canada after""unauthorized pictures of Meghan walking with Archie in a park with the family's two dogs were published in a number of British tabloids.  ""They enjoy their privacy, so they didn't come over here to have swarms of people around them all the time,"" said Burnett.  ""When they start to come out more into the community, they will let us know how they would like us to approach them.""

361,Connie Walker,2019-11-06T13:27:03.669Z,Shooting death of young Indigenous man forces rural community to confront racism,"In many ways, Kristian Ayoungman was seen as an example of reconciliation in action. He lived on the Siksika First Nation, but growing up, he went to school and played hockey in Strathmore, Alta., a small town 20 kilometres north of the reserve.  He was seen as a bridge between the two communities in which he lived — until the night in March when he was shot and killed. A couple of days later, two men from Strathmore were charged with first degree murder in the 24-year-old's death.  ""My son was a very, very good kid, and well loved and liked by everybody,"" said Melodie Ayoungman, Kristian's mother. ""And the reality behind it is, it was an act of racism that took his life. And that's hard for me to comprehend."" Ayoungman said she believes her son's death was the result of racism, because of what happened in the hours before the shooting. Kristian, a champion pow-wow dancer on the reserve, was also a hockey star in town. On March 17, he played in an alumni hockey game in Strathmore. Kristian and his friends Brooker Prettyyoungman, Ryley McMaster and Breanna Crawler went to a local pub after the game. They say at the end of the night an exchange with strangers outside the bar led to a fight that was peppered with racial slurs.  ""He was like just calling me names, and he told me 'to go back to the f--king reserve you f--king dirty Indians … get the f--k out of here,'"" Crawler said.  She added that she didn't know the man who yelled at her, but now believes it was Kody Giffen, one of the men charged with Ayoungman's murder.  ""I was looking at him and I was like, 'Are you serious? Like, don't talk to me like that.' I'm like, that's racist, right?"" Crawler, McMaster and Prettyyoungman say the altercation didn't last long and the two groups separated. They ran into each other again shortly afterwards, but this time, they say the group of men was larger and they had weapons. Crawler said when she and her friends saw a gun, they got into their truck and tried to leave. They said the men got into another vehicle and chased them out of town. Crawler was driving the truck and headed toward Siksika when she heard a gunshot.  ""I looked in the rear-view mirror. And by that time, that white car was behind me ... I seen it stop in like five seconds, it was like really fast. We heard a shot,"" Crawler said. ""I felt something on my back … and I was thinking, like, I was thinking to myself did I get shot? Did I get shot? …. And then Kristian said, 'They got me, bro. They got me.'"" Ayoungman had been shot. His friends got him out of the truck, and he died on the side of the road south of Strathmore. Prettyyoungman and Crawler didn't see where the shot came from or who fired the gun that killed Ayoungman. Two days later on March 19, Kody Giffen, 22, and his brother Brandon, 25, — both from Strathmore — were charged with first degree murder. Brandon Giffen is in custody and Kody Giffen was granted bail in August. Both are scheduled to appear in court in the new year.  CBC News reached out to both for comment, but they declined through their lawyers. Although the trial of the brothers is several months away, some in the community are drawing parallels to the high-profile death of Colten Boushie, a young Indigenous man shot and killed by a white man in rural Saskatchewan in 2016. Unlike Boushie, Ayoungman's death received very little media attention. In the immediate aftermath of his death, avoiding the media was part of a strategy by Ayoungman's family and Siksika leadership to keep racial tensions from escalating.  Buck Breaker, a councillor on the Siksika First Nation, said he worried that if they didn't handle the situation carefully, more violence would follow. ""I'll make reference to the Colton Boushie tragedy — we didn't want to, like I said, cause any more animosity than was already there. A lot of our people were angry, and still are. But you know, we had to be careful on what we say,"" Breaker said.  ""A lot of the tension is on social media, Facebook or whatever, so we didn't want that to escalate to the point where our young people would go into Strathmore and take more action. If that was what would have happened — the jail cells would have been full and the morgue would have been full and the courthouse would have been full."" Melodie Ayoungman was pivotal in helping to keep people calm. She set the tone for how both communities would respond to Ayoungman's death. Instead of turning to anger, she turned to her Blackfoot culture and the teachings from her grandparents and called for peace between the two communities.  ""My son's life was taken in the wrong way, but this isn't the way we're going to deal with it. Not with revenge. We weren't taught like that,"" she said. The situation was so tense, Melodie Ayoungman heard that people from the reserve, including Prettyoungman and Crawler, were worried about going into Strathmore after Kristian's death.  ""They were traumatized,"" Ayoungman said. ""I didn't want our community to be afraid or feel scared. [I wanted] to show them, 'No, you can keep your head up. Be proud of who you are. Be proud of where you come from.  We belong here.'"" Ayoungman organized a candlelight vigil. People from her community travelled from Siksika into Strathmore, where they were met by dozens of people in town to honour her son. Strathmore mayor Pat Fule was among them. He's a longtime resident in Strathmore and a former teacher. Following the vigil, he took an unusual step that he said upset some residents of the predominantly white town. He wrote a letter in the local paper, admitting there was racism in Strathmore and called on people to confront it directly. He wrote: ""Until we can admit that racism is here — and due to the recent murder, our neighbours now worry about coming to Strathmore — we can't improve."" Fule said there was a mixed reaction to his letter, but that it was an important step to building a better relationship between the two communities. ""I was worried about the controversy … but sometimes you have to do the right thing even if the right thing is the most painful or difficult thing to do. And so I decided I would do that."" Since Ayoungman's death last spring, Siksika and Strathmore leadership have been holding regular meetings — something that had never happened before, even though the two communities have been been neighbours for more than 100 years. Outside of school or sports, Mayor Fule said there was very little interaction between the two communities. ""Now, I'm saying hi to a First Nations person I run into at a store where maybe before I would [not]. I would not be rude or anything, but you just get comfortable in not doing things, you just interact silently,"" said Mayor Fule. ""And so I'm reaching out a little more, I'm holding doors, I'm saying hi."" It's too early to say whether the efforts of the community leaders will lead to reconciliation. The steps are small and the progress is slow, but Melodie Ayoungman has big hopes. She wants her son's tragic death to be a wake-up call for her community and others like it.  ""I hope that this can change the future for First Nations, because there's so much injustice towards First Nations and times need to change. Maybe this is one of the cases that can make that change happen.""

362,Kailea Switzer,2020-01-19T13:00:00.987Z,The agony of letting our kids take risks: Opinion,"I am a first-time mother of a one-year-old, and over the past year I've had to temper my fears a million times. From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own — it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away. Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me — they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.  This was also the way my parents parented — they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you — it has to be your own choice.""  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes — it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party — the discomfort has proven worth it.  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people — empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective — are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like — that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business — I would never have believed you.  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in"" my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it. I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

363,Anonymous,2020-01-23T03:59:38.352Z,"Baby, it's cold inside: Seniors centre struggles to heat building, stay open","The Schubert Centre in downtown Vernon, B.C., offers activities for its 900 members that range from singalongs to economical hot meals.  But the popular seniors activity centre might be forced to close its doors because of looming debt and a lack of funds to replace a broken-down furnace. Space heaters are being used to warm some rooms in the building.  ""Our furnace has had the biscuit, I'm afraid. It's 36 years old,"" Diane Weaver, president of the Schubert Centre Society board, said Tuesday. ""Unfortunately we have no contingency plan to replace it."" Weaver said the society can't borrow the $180,000 they have been quoted for a new heating system because the society is already struggling to service $290,000 that has been racked up in debt. To try and raise the money they're holding a ""furnace fundraiser"" on Jan. 24 featuring dinner, live music and a comedian/ventriloquist performance. Weaver, who has been in her role for just a couple of months, said she can't comment on how the organization's debt climbed to its current level. The centre, which opened in 1984, already brings in money as a venue for weddings and other events.  Weaver said the non-profit centre society hopes to boost that revenue by applying for government grants, seeking donations and making small increases to fees for programs and new services. Large increases in prices for the seniors who rely on the place for meals and social events aren't possible because many are living on low incomes, she said.  ""We've got a new manager who has a background in event planning,"" Weaver said. ""She's got lots of ideas."" If they are successful, Weaver said, ""we'll just slowly chip away at that debt.""  If not, she said the organization will have no option but to close its doors.  The loss of the centre that she calls ""a home away from home for seniors"" is an outcome no one wants, Weaver said.  ""This is this is where everybody comes,"" she said.

364,James McCarten,2020-01-22T22:36:02.801Z,"Former soldier, alleged neo-Nazi Patrik Mathews denied bail in U.S.","A former army reservist's right to express his views, however repugnant, doesn't trump the risk he might try to escape justice, a U.S. district court judge declared Wednesday as he ordered accused white supremacist Patrik Mathews of Beausejour, Man., to remain behind bars. Judge Timothy Sullivan said Mathews, 27, is in the country illegally, has no ties to the United States and is facing serious charges that stem from his role in an alleged plot to sow violence, death and racial unrest, including at a massive pro-gun rally earlier this week in Virginia — a plot assistant U.S. attorney Thomas Windom described in court as domestic terrorism. ""You can't get more serious than murder,"" Windom told Sullivan as he argued the government's case to keep Mathews in custody. ""You can't get more serious than inciting civil disobedience. That's exactly what Mr. Mathews was planning to do."" Sullivan — who sounded disinclined throughout Wednesday's brief hearing to free the accused, given that he's in the country illegally as it is — agreed. He ordered Mathews held until a preliminary hearing scheduled for Jan. 30. ""I don't need to go any further than he's a serious risk of flight,"" Sullivan said. ""This is a very dangerous person, he espouses very dangerous beliefs — I don't think I have to say much more."" After court Wednesday, Robert Hur, U.S. attorney for the district of Maryland, spoke to reporters about the type of danger Mathews presents, citing the acquisition of long guns and ammunition, receiving training with other members of The Base — a violent neo-Nazi paramilitary group — and packing food and supplies in a truck ""for the war"" in Virginia.  ""These defendants did more than talk. They took steps to act and act violently on their racist views,"" Hur said. ""Put simply, this domestic terrorism investigation likely saved lives,"" added David Weiss, U.S. attorney for the district of Delaware. FBI special agent in dharge Jennifer Boone said radicals like Mathews are domestic adversaries who hide in plain sight. ""What sets him apart is the desire to do harm to those who do not look like them, or believe as they believe,"" Boone said. ""We must not allow fear or silence to be weaponized by those who seek to commit acts of violence against our communities or against our nation."" Mathews and two other men were arrested last week after the former reservist disappeared from his residence in Manitoba amid allegations he was a recruiter for a white-supremacist group called The Base. At the time, Mathews was a combat engineer with the 38 Canadian Brigade Group in Winnipeg, though the military said then it was investigating those allegations and fast-tracking his request to be released from the military. He is facing one count of transporting a firearm and ammunition with intent to commit a felony and one charge of being an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition — charges that each carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, three years of probation and a $250,000 fine. Prosecutors allege in documents filed in court that Mathews videotaped himself advocating for killing people, poisoning water supplies and derailing trains. They have also alleged that Mathews and two other alleged co-conspirators and Base members, had been planning to violently disrupt Monday's gun-rights rally in Richmond, Va., in hopes of inciting civil war. Defence counsel Joseph Balter acknowledged early in the hearing that his client, if released, would be immediately subject to an immigration warrant. But he argued that the government's motion to keep Mathews in custody was predicated more on the content of ""odious"" and ""repugnant"" sentiments expressed in the video than on the potential danger he potentially posed. The charges he is facing ""would not, by themselves, support a detention order,"" Balter said. ""One man's domestic terrorism can be another man's exercising of his First Amendment rights."" The detention memo filed Tuesday details how investigators used a hidden camera and microphone in a home in Delaware to record Mathews talking about the Virginia rally as a ""boundless"" opportunity. ""All you gotta do is start making things go wrong and if Virginia can spiral out to [expletive] full-blown civil war,"" the documents quote Mathews as saying. Mathews and Brian Mark Lemley Jr., 33, of Elkton, Md., planned violence at the Richmond rally, according to prosecutors. They said Lemley talked about using a thermal imaging scope affixed to his rifle to ambush unsuspecting civilians and police officers. ""I need to claim my first victim,"" Lemley said on Dec. 23, according to the memo. ""We could essentially like be literally hunting people,"" Mathews said, according to prosecutors. ""You could provide overwatch while I get close to do what needs to be done to certain things."" FBI agents arrested Mathews, Lemley and William Garfield Bilbrough IV, 19, of Denton, Md., last Thursday as part of a broader investigation of The Base. Authorities in Georgia and Wisconsin also arrested four other men linked to the group. Mathews, who was ushered into court wearing orange prison garb, with his hands cuffed behind his back, was silent throughout Wednesday's hearing except when Windom made passing reference to the fact that Mathews couldn't provide the address of the farm where he said he lived in Manitoba. ""I just couldn't remember the street address, sir,"" Mathews interjected, a note of frustration in his voice. Sullivan admonished him for speaking out, urging him to relay his messages through Balter and otherwise ""take shelter under your Fifth Amendment right to remain silent."" Megan Squire follows The Base online and said there was a lot of chatter about attending the rally in Virginia that stopped after last week's arrests. ""It got very quiet on Telegram while these guys tried to figure out what was going to happen, if it was serious,"" said Squire, a computer scientist who teaches cybersecurity and online extremism at Elon University in North Carolina. Part of her job is to collect large amounts of data from online sources, to understand the phenomena of online hate, radicalization and extremism. ""They started disavowing the rally. 'Don't go, you know, it's a Fed honey pot' and all this kind of stuff. Really backtracking from that position.… It was very obvious that they knew about the arrests and they were trying to figure out how it affected them and how it impacted them and possibly their attendance at a real-world event,"" Squire said. The group appears to be in some disarray now, she said. ""When they're not in-fighting with each other, they're accusing each other of being federal agents, accusing other groups of being infiltrated,"" she said. ""They read the [court] filings and the motions, some of them, just as closely as we do to try to understand, because they're trying to see where their weak spots are, who they shouldn't have trusted.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/patrik-mathews-denied-bail-1.5436170,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fbi-arrests-the-base-georgia-wisconsin-1.5432006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/patrick-mathews-base-violent-revolution-1.5435323,N/A

In punishing Howard Wu earlier this month, the discipline committee of Ontario's medical regulator noted the doctor had a history of problems that included previous findings of professional misconduct. ""(Dr. Wu) failed to maintain the standard of practice with multiple patients in varying situations,"" the committee found in ordering his licence revoked. ""He has demonstrated serious clinical deficiencies that put his patients at risk."" Wu, 50, who studied medicine at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, practised in Markham, Ont. According to disciplinary records from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, a mother took her feverish newborn to see him in November 2015. Instead of recommending an immediate hospital visit, the doctor sent them home with instructions to give the baby water and vitamin C-rich juice. He gave the same advice two days later when the infant's condition did not improve. The baby died within days. A college investigator stopped short of blaming Wu directly for the death but said he did not give the child the needed care. The committee also reviewed complaints from an insurance company that Wu was prescribing an inordinate number of medical devices such as braces. Evidence was that the supplier next door paid him $100 a year for each patient he referred. Wu had previously denied any financial interest in the sale of devices sold by the supplier. In addition, the committee found that Wu had done hundreds of eye exams despite having little competency. He was unable to describe the basic steps needed for such exams or the equipment used, according to the committee. Records also indicate Wu was convicted of dangerous driving in 2015 and driving while disqualified in January 2017. However, evidence was that he lied to the college on several occasions when he denied having faced any charges. Despite admitting some allegations and pleading no contest to others, Wu argued he should be allowed to return to a period of supervised practice after a 15-month licence suspension. He admitted not having the knowledge to recognize that a baby with fever could be much sicker than appeared. He also said he no longer performed eye examinations. Overall, he promised to do better but the committee was having none of it. In considering appropriate punishment, the panel noted Wu had been suspended for misconduct in 2009 and again in 2013, and had been through several periods of supervision. The committee also found Wu had been less than truthful on multiple occasions. ""These omissions and misrepresentations extend beyond simple poor judgment and reflect a propensity to mislead the college, which causes the committee significant concern with respect to Dr. Wu's governability,"" the committee said. Ultimately, the panel ordered immediate revocation of Wu's licence along with a reprimand. He must also pay $31,110 in costs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doctor-loses-licence-1.5436400,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,N/A
367,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:34:55.844Z,"Italy's Di Maio, who helped upstart Five-Star to power, stepping down as leader","Luigi Di Maio resigned as leader of Italy's co-governing Five-Star movement on Wednesday. Di Maio, who is Italy's foreign minister, told the party's other ministers of his decision at a meeting before announcing it publicly. While his resignation is not expected to bring down the government, it underscores deep divisions within Five-Star and injects further uncertainty into already fractious relations with its coalition partner, the centre-left Democratic Party (PD). ""This is a difficult time for our movement,"" Di Maio said during an hour-long speech in which he pledged to maintain a front-line role and took frequent swipes at alleged disloyalty from some party colleagues. ""The noise of a few has drowned out the work of a great many of us,"" he said in reference to frequent internal infighting. ""In these years we have seen two types of people: Those who put our movement before themselves, and those who put themselves before the movement."" Italian government bond yields rose in early trading on reports of Di Maio's resignation, and the cost of insuring exposure to the country's sovereign debt also jumped. The decision by Di Maio, who is expected to remain as foreign minister, comes days before a regional election in Emilia Romagna in which the right-wing League is threatening to end 75 years of uninterrupted PD rule. That outcome could put the government's survival at risk. ""Di Maio's resignation is very ominous for the future of the ruling coalition,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar. ""The PD has just announced a major rebranding is in the works and these things, leaders quitting and party overhauls, only happen in Italy when the house is on fire."" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier said he would respect any decision that Di Maio made. ""I am sure he would take such an initiative with great responsibility,"" Conte told Italian radio RTL 102.5, declining to comment further. Analyst Massimiliano Panarari, writing Wednesday in La Stampa, said Di Maio was a ""natural scapegoat,"" because he had taken on so many portfolios — deputy premier, labour minister and minister of economic development in the first government, and now foreign minister. The anti-establishment Five-Star won 33 per cent of the vote in a national election in 2018, but since then its popularity has fallen sharply and recent polls put it at around 16 per cent, with a poor result in last year's European parliament elections. After the 2018 national vote yielded no clear winner, Five-Star initially formed a coalition with the League, switching to an alliance with the PD last September after firebrand League leader Matteo Salvini walked out of government. Di Maio, who was just 31 and had little professional work experience when he was elected Five-Star leader in 2017, was skeptical about joining forces with the PD but, with many of the party's lawmakers opposed to fresh elections, he was reluctantly persuaded to sign up by Five-Star's founder Beppe Grillo. As leader of the largest government party, Di Maio was deputy prime minister, industry minister and labour minister in the government with the League, leaving all three posts to take up the foreign ministry portfolio in the cabinet with the PD. Tensions within the party have been fuelled by a perception that Di Maio has failed to share power outside his inner circle of advisers. Since the election, more than 30 lower house and senate lawmakers have left Five-Star's parliamentary grouping, some defecting and some being ejected. That exodus has left the government with only a wafer-thin majority in the upper house Senate. Di Maio said Vito Crimi, head of the internal rules committee, will be the interim leader of the party, with a permanent replacement to be named during a leadership contest over the coming months.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-dimaio-resignation-5-star-1.5435856,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-coalition-government-positions-1.5269779 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/italy-coalition-salvini-dimaio-1.5155820,N/A

The family has asked that we ... and the media respect their privacy,"" Champagne said following a three-day Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. Calling the situation ""dynamic"" and ""fluid,"" Champagne said Iran has so far respected the families' wishes regarding burial. He said that claims the families' wishes hadn't been respected have not been substantiated. ""We are taking these allegations seriously. We are investigating with our team on the ground and with Iranian authorities,"" he said. ""But based on the information that I have from our consular officials which are working with the families ... in touch with the 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents, the latest information I have received is that the wishes of the families have been respected."" Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. It's not known how many of the 57 Canadians killed in the crash also held Iranian citizenship. There also have been reports that Iran is intimidating and harassing family members of the victims. Canada has been demanding that Iran turn over the ""black box"" flight recorders from the aircraft, which contain information critical to the crash investigation. Iran initially indicated it would release the black boxes to Ukraine or France — two countries with the technical expertise to analyze the data — but recent reports suggest the country is now backtracking on that pledge. Champagne said Iran should release the flight recorders in the spirit of transparency and accepting full responsibility for the crash — but suggested global pressure is the best way to persuade Iran to release them. ""The leverage we have I would say is ... the fact that the world is watching Iran. We have made demands which are very specific,"" he said. After initially denying any role in the crash, Iranian leaders conceded that Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 using surface-to-air missiles on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Of those passengers, 138 were destined for Canada. Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada continues to ""pressure"" Iran to turn over the black boxes to a third country. ""It is not simply a question of having the right experts in place to analyze the black boxes. There is the question of significant technological requirements that cannot be done in Iran,"" he said. ""That is why we are calling upon Iran to release the black boxes to a reliable third country that has the technological capacity and personnel to properly analyze those boxes.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ps752-iran-crash-remains-1.5434924,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/iran-dual-nationals-downed-ukrainian-plane-iranians-1.5432918,N/A
370,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-28T16:10:35.194Z,"'Companies knew they had a big problem': Kia, Hyundai owners say they were knowingly sold defective vehicles ","A group of vehicle owners is going after two major automakers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, claiming they were knowingly sold defective vehicles then left to pay for losses and repairs when the engines failed or caught fire.  In a lawsuit filed this week, Hyundai and Kia are accused of intentionally concealing the defect from buyers of vehicles with Theta, Nu, and Gamma engines. ""When complaints came ... [owners] were told 'gosh we haven't heard of that happening. Isn't that weird?' And in fact the companies knew they had a big problem,"" Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who is heading up the lawsuit, told Go Public. The class action was filed in Court of Queen's Bench in Regina on Monday, but has yet to be certified by the court. It names Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and their American counterparts — Hyundai Motors America and Kia Motors America. None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court. A Go Public investigation revealed concerns about Hyundai and Kia engines failing at high speeds or spontaneously bursting into flames — putting some drivers and their passengers into life-threatening situations and leaving others with thousands in repair bills. Consumer and safety advocates have criticized the South Korean automakers for taking too long to issue recalls of too few models with the Theta-family engines. The recalls started in 2015 and are still rolling out. ""Their difficulty is that they can't fix the problem. They don't know what to do about the problem. So a recall where there's no fix is really no recall at all,"" Merchant said. Go Public asked Hyundai if it had a fix for the engine problems, but it didn't respond to that question directly. Merchant says the proposed class-action suit involves 37 Hyundai and Kia owners, and seven different models ranging in years from 2011-16 — but he expects the number of drivers and vehicles involved to grow once word gets out about the lawsuit.  The legal action is also looking for compensation for owners with the problematic engines who haven't had failures or fires, but are facing a loss in vehicle value. ""For the vast majority of people, they're not going to have a safety problem. And many of them are going to be compelled to continue to operate these vehicles because they can't afford the hit of getting rid of them. So they're entitled to financial compensation that flows from having a vehicle that's significantly depreciated,"" Merchant says. Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and Kia Motors America all told Go Public they do not comment on any current or pending litigation. Hyundai Motors USA responded to Go Public's questions about the latest Canadian lawsuit with a general statement.  ""Nothing is more important than the safety and security of Hyundai customers,"" spokesperson Michael Stewart wrote in an email. ""Hyundai actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision engine fires, with all of our vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects … Hyundai quality and safety is among the best in the industry.""  Go Public continues to get complaints from Hyundai and Kia owners, who say they are interested in joining a class-action suit if it means the automakers would have to take responsibility. Marnie and Adam Nelson contacted Go Public after seeing previous engine stories. The couple's 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe caught fire while it was parked in their driveway last March. They bought it six months earlier and paid more than $50,000 for the SUV. They contacted Hyundai's head office by email to report the fire and ask for a refund on the extended warranties they had purchased, but say no one followed up to investigate. Instead, the couple says most of their messages to head office were ignored and the local dealership was only interested in getting them to buy a new vehicle. ""As soon as they [the dealership] found out we weren't going to come back in and buy another car, we were persona non grata, they wanted nothing to do with us. No return calls — nothing,"" Adam said. ""They should be standing behind their products better,"" Marnie told Go Public.  The dealership declined to respond to Go Public's questions about the couple's situation directly, referring us to head office.  Hyundai says its records show the Nelsons went directly to their insurance company to report the fire and only reached out to the company for a refund on an extended warranty they had purchased for the vehicle. The couple says they received a partial refund. The company wrote in an email to Go Public that its policy is to investigate every case of a fire, ""that we are aware of and requested to investigate to determine if the cause is attributed to neglect, abuse, environment or the product itself."" The Nelsons say their fire was never investigated by the company. The company did reach out to the couple after Go Public inquiries.  The engine in Daniel Roukema's 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe didn't burn — it died in 2016 while he was driving on a highway near Toronto. He says he had to pay about $9,000 to replace it. When he asked the company to cover the cost, Roukema says it refused and blamed his lack of upkeep for the engine failure, which he denies.  Two recalls were issued for the vehicle after he paid to replace his engine. ""I think the way they've handled the situation is absolutely abhorrent … we [owners] ought to be compensated,"" he said. Hyundai did not respond to specific questions about Roukema's case, but said ""if a customer previously paid for repairs in advance of a recall being issued, and it is determined that the repairs required were a result of a recall, Hyundai will reimburse the customer for the recall-specific repairs to their vehicle."" Hyundai says it will soon launch what it calls a microsite that aims to answer questions for customers affected by recalls. In Quebec, the Automobile Protection Association and a group of Kia owners are suing Kia for compensation for alleged engine problems with the 2010-15 Kia Forte. Fires are not part of that class-action lawsuit. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September. The transportation authority is asking owners who have had problems to contact the department.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Canadians say they spend almost 11 hours a day in front of them — at their desks, on their laptops and especially on their smartphones. But after a long day at work, our eyes often start to feel dry, tired and strained, and many people are desperate for a solution.  Enter blue light filtering lenses. Optical chains say they protect our eyes from blue light emitted from digital screens, and consumers are buying in.  And it turns out it's not just eye strain they want to warn us about. A hidden camera investigation by CBC's Marketplace found sales associates at some of Canada's largest optical chains making ""misleading"" health claims about blue light from digital screens, but experts say there is no scientific evidence that blue light from computer monitors and screens is harmful. Staff at four leading chains cautioned buyers that digital screens could damage their retinas and could lead to serious eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. Two opticians at Hudson's Bay Optical suggested a link to cancer based on an in-store pamphlet provided by lens manufacturer VisionEase, while Vogue Optical's website suggests blue light may increase the risk of ""certain types of cancers."" Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery later told Marketplace the pamphlet is ""incorrect"" and will be pulled from Hudson's Bay Optical stores.  But experts in the fields of optometry and ophthalmology say there's no evidence that blue light from digital screens is harmful.  Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the idea of blue-light blocking is ""flawed on so many levels."" ""Blue light fear, paranoia, is really out there,"" said Khurana. ""But there's no evidence to show it's truly dangerous and blocking it has not ever [been] shown to [have] any benefits."" Marketplace producers went undercover and visited multiple Hakim Optical, Vogue Optical, Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery and LensCrafters locations in southern Ontario to see how the companies market the lenses to consumers.  Several dispensing opticians and salespeople told the producers that blue light from digital screens can lead to fatigue and headaches. One optician said blue light has ""very sharp rays, penetrating at the back of the eyes,"" while another salesperson said ""it tears the eyes right out of you."" Watch Marketplace go undercover at optional retailers: But more ""serious"" and even ""scary-sounding"" to ophthalmologist and macular specialist Dr. Sunir Garg were claims that blue light from digital devices might lead to retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and possibly cancer.  Buying blue light filtering lenses, it was suggested, might eliminate these risks. ""They're introducing this technology that blocks [the digital blue light] out,"" said one student optician. ""So we are not going to be seeing things like cataracts or macular degeneration, damage to your retina, things like that.""  Many of these claims are also found on Vogue Optical, Hakim, and LensCrafters websites and promotional material. Marketplace asked Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, to review the hidden camera footage.  He was concerned about how salespeople and opticians were ""misleading"" customers with claims about how the light from screens can damage eyes. Retinal damage and macular degeneration are ""serious"" claims, Garg said, ""but the blue lights from your screen is not the cause of that stuff.""  ""I think a lot of this is just to create fear and confusion and when people have fear and are confused, they end up spending money on things they don't need to spend money on,"" said Garg.  Garg's research has led him to conclude that far from benefiting customers, these lenses are mostly benefiting the companies that are selling them. ""Maybe those [blue light filtering lenses] are decisions made in different boardrooms across the country and around the world,"" Garg said, ""but from a science perspective, I don't think people need to worry about this at all.""  He doesn't blame the staff at these chains for spreading these claims, however.  ""I can't fault them [because] I'm sure they're getting a little info sheet that says here's three talking points about blue light-blocking lenses, but it's not based on scientific data,"" Garg said.  ""People will quote that blue light can hurt retinal cells,"" Garg said, ""but what they're not telling you is that it's not been shown in any group of people who are using their screens.""  The science into the harms from blue light is mostly done with retinal cells in a petri dish, he said, ""or taking a poor mouse and and shining a blue light ray intensely into their eyeball for hours on end."" Both Khurana and Garg told Marketplace there's no research that suggests blue light filtering lenses are necessary.  Phillip Yuhas, an assistant professor of optometry at Ohio State University, agrees. He said studies have shown people blink far less during computer use and that blue light filters have not shown any improved ""visual comfort"" for digital eye strain.  Khurana said if the problem people are having is from digital eyestrain, then blue light filters are doing nothing to address the core issue and ""could be doing more harm than good.""  But that hasn't stopped eyeglass retailers from promoting them. One optician told Marketplace  the blue filter lens is like an ""extra shield on top of your eyes to protect your eyes from harmful rays.""  The lenses can be purchased with or without a prescription and range in price from $20 to more than $100.     Global sales of the lenses reached $18 million US in 2019, according to Marketwatch.com, and are projected to exceed $27 million US by 2024.    Staring at screens for a long time can make eyes feel dry, tired and strained, but blue light is not the culprit, said Garg, and purchasing special lenses won't fix the issue. ""What's bothering [people] isn't the blue light. It's the fact that when they're staring at their screen a lot they're not blinking as often. ""That causes the eye to dry out, [and] when your eyes become dry, they become irritated and scratchy and tired.""  To deal with that, he recommends a simple fix. It's called  ""the 20-20-20 rule.""  Look at least 20 feet (six metres) away from your screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.  Blue light does wake us up and make us more alert, so too much late at night can make it hard to get to sleep. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends turning off devices or turning on blue light filters, a couple of hours before going to bed.  In the United Kingdom, claims like the ones heard in Canada by Marketplace producers aren't allowed. Opticians and eyeglass retailers risk being fined if they make unproven claims about blue light from digital devices. In 2015, Boots Opticians were reprimanded and fined 400,000 pounds for making ""misleading"" claims that blue light causes retinal damage.   Dr. John O'Hagan, an optical radiation expert who works for Public Health England's (PHE) centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, conducted a study on blue light from digital devices on behalf of the organization.  He analyzed the amount of blue light coming from various sources including the sky, lightbulbs, mobile phones and computer screens.  ""Blue light in our normal environment is not dangerous at all,"" O'Hagan told Marketplace ""The main source of blue light for us is from the sky and a nice sunny day."" The PHE study found that for smartphones, laptops and digital devices, the amount of blue light emitted was less than one per cent of the safe exposure level, even if stared at all day.  O'Hagan said that the light levels from a smartphone, tablet or laptop are ""considerably below the levels that we experience outside, even in winter."" We get about 30 times more blue light just by being outside, he said.  ""You could stare at your phone all day long, right above the face, and the amount of blue light is not significant,"" O'Hagan said.  ""There is no evidence that blue light from your mobile or other devices is harmful.""  Marketplace reached out to the four eyeglass retailers visited by producers.  Hudson's Bay Optical/Glasses Gallery said Marketplace was given wrong information when it comes to cancer and macular degeneration from digital blue light, and says it will be pulling all Vision Ease pamphlets and marketing materials immediately from all stores. It says all staff will be retrained in the coming weeks and it is ""committed to providing the very best experience for our customers."" Manufacturer Vision-Ease said they ""stand by their marketing materials"" and say the science around blue light is ""conflicting"" and ""ambiguous"" and more studies are needed.  LensCrafters said ""while we train our associates on all products, including blue light and blue IQ lenses, some inconsistencies are possible in how individual associates articulate this topic across our stores. We plan to reinforce our in-store training as the awareness around the potential risks of blue light grows."" Vogue Optical said ""optical science evolves very quickly"" and ""there is a high volume of ongoing studies on blue light, some of which point to damaging effects on the eye."" They also said they are putting considerable effort into educating staff to help educate consumers about what's available on the market and help them make the best choices.   Hakim Optical says there is evidence that blue light is damaging, and they ""will continue to respect and support the licensed optician's obligation to protect and educate the public with all available information and options related to their eye health care."" They also said ""there is no evidence of harm from the blue-light filter upgrade.""  Health Canada says prescription lenses are regulated through the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.   As the Food and Drugs Act ""prohibits false, misleading or deceptive advertising of a medical device, such as the promotion of claims without safety and effectiveness data,"" Health Canada said it will follow up with the optical chains to determine whether medical devices are being advertised or sold in Canada with unsupported health claims. The Ontario Opticians Association told Marketplace ""there is an overwhelming number of clients who have expressed satisfaction with their blue light filters, in that they reduced or eliminated headaches, fatigue, eyestrain and the like."" For people who are concerned about good eye health, Garg has some other suggestions — and they don't include lenses to block blue light.  ""Do things like take a break periodically, start quieting down before nighttime, eat a good diet, exercise and not smoke … all those things will help eyes way more than spending money on these blue blocking lenses.""  Sit about 63 centimetres (arm's length) from the computer screen. Position the screen so you are gazing slightly downward. Reduce screen glare by using a matte screen filter if needed. Take regular breaks using the ""20-20-20"" rule: every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet (six metres) away for at least 20 seconds. When your eyes feel dry, use artificial tears to refresh them. Adjust room lighting and try increasing the screen contrast to reduce eye strain. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing glasses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-blue-light-lenses-hidden-camera-investigation-1.5364678,[],N/A

374,Anonymous,2020-01-23T03:35:00.766Z,Democrats begin laying out their case in Trump Senate impeachment trial,"Democrats accused U.S. President Donald Trump at the start of his impeachment trial on Wednesday of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine to help him get re-elected and warned that America's global prestige will suffer if the U.S. Senate acquits him. Trump, in Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum, sounded a defiant note, telling reporters the Democrats did not have enough evidence to find him guilty and remove him from office. In a two-hour opening argument for the prosecution after days of procedural wrangling, Rep. Adam Schiff said Trump had pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former vice-president Joe Biden and his son on unsubstantiated corruption charges last year. Trump solicited interference from Ukraine to improve his chances in this November's U.S. presidential election, Schiff said, laying out the main Democratic argument for why Trump should be found guilty of abusing his power ""To implement this corrupt scheme President Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two discredited allegations that would benefit President Trump's 2020 presidential campaign,"" Schiff said. Democrats argue that Trump was trying to find dirt on Biden, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, to help the Republican president win a second term. Watch | Schiff lays out some of what Democrats will present during the trial:  Trump was impeached last month by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for his dealings with Ukraine and impeding the inquiry into the matter. A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted Jan. 17-22 and released on Wednesday found a bipartisan majority of Americans wanting to see new witnesses testify in the impeachment trial. It said about 72 per cent agreed that the trial ""should allow witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the impeachment charges to testify,"" including 84 per cent of Democrats and 69 per cent of Republicans. The president denies any wrongdoing and his fellow Republicans in the Senate say his behaviour does not fit the description of ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" outlined in the U.S. Constitution as a reason to oust a U.S. president. Rep. Val Demings, one of the House Democrats' prosecution team of ""managers,"" tweeted that Trump was bragging today to reporters in Davos about how his team was winning, because it has ""all the material."" The second article of impeachment was for obstruction of Congress: covering up witnesses and documents from the American people.<br><br>This morning the President not only confessed to it, he bragged about it:<br> <br>""Honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material."" <a href=""https://t.co/DPAEFHIDjS"">pic.twitter.com/DPAEFHIDjS</a> But a senior administration official, asked to explain what Trump was referring to, said: ""What he's clearly saying is we have all the facts on our side, and those facts prove he's done nothing wrong."" Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled 100-member Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. But the trial's effect on Trump's November re-election bid is unclear. ""We believe without question that the president will be acquitted,"" Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow told reporters at the end of Wednesday's session. Democrats have two more days to make their case. Trump's defence team will have three days after that for rebuttal, and the trial that could potentially conclude next week. The case against him is focused on a July 25 telephone call in which he asked Zelensky to open a corruption investigation into the Bidens as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. ""Nothing could be more dangerous to a democracy than a commander in chief who believed that he could operate with impunity, free from accountability. Nothing, that is, except a Congress that is willing to let it be so,"" said Schiff, who is leading the prosecution team of Democratic ""managers"" from the 435-seat House of Representatives. Watch | Schiff says the Ukrainians knew exactly what Trump wanted: Making references to 18th century U.S. founding father Alexander Hamilton and the late Republican president Ronald Reagan, Schiff said the world was watching. ""For how can any country trust the United States as a model of governance if it's one that sanctions precisely the political corruption and invitation to foreign meddling that we have long sought to eradicate in burgeoning democracies around the world?"" Schiff said senators will ""also undermine our global standing"" if they do not oust Trump three years into his tumultuous presidency. Current and former U.S. officials testified at the impeachment inquiry last year that Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, carried out a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine and that it became clear to them that a White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump and a phone call between the two leaders was contingent on Ukraine carrying out Trump's wishes. Schiff said there was clearly a ""corrupt objective.""  ""The president of Ukraine can't get in the door of the Oval Office. And who are they going to? Are they going to the security council? No. Are they going to the State Department? No. They tried all that. They're going to the president's personal lawyer. Does that sound like official policy to try to fight corruption?""  Watch | Schiff describes Giuliani's role: Democrats have up to three days to make their case. Trump's defence team will have three days after that for rebuttal in a trial that could potentially conclude next week. The Trump administration has not complied with subpoenas for documents and has urged officials like former national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to participate in the impeachment investigation. Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point later in the trial, but they held firm with Trump to block Democratic requests Tuesday for witnesses and evidence. Trump said allowing Bolton to testify at the trial would present national security concerns. ""He knows some of my thoughts, he knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it's not very positive?"" Trump said. Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who was fired by Trump last year, has disdainfully described the Ukraine pressure campaign as a ""drug deal"" and testimony from him could be awkward for the president. Watch | Democratic. Rep. Val Demings makes the case for hearing testimony from John Bolton: During a break from proceedings Wednesday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer ruled out a so-called witness trade in which Republicans call witnesses Democrats want in exchange for Biden's son Hunter Biden testifying. ""I think that's off the table. First of all the Republicans have the right to bring in any witness they want. They haven't wanted to and that trade is not on the table,"" Schumer told reporters. Schumer said earlier that only witnesses with direct knowledge of Trump's actions related to Ukraine should testify. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-trial-trump-1.5436290,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-1.5429169,N/A
375,Anonymous,2020-01-20T20:11:01.659Z,"SpaceX launches, destroys rocket in successful astronaut escape test","SpaceX completed the last big test of its crew capsule before launching astronauts in the next few months, mimicking an emergency escape shortly after liftoff Sunday. No one was aboard for the wild ride in the skies above Cape Canaveral, just two mannequins. The nine-minute flight ended with the Dragon crew capsule parachuting safely into the Atlantic, after separating and speeding away from the exploding rocket. ""I'm super fired up,"" Elon Musk, the company's founder and chief executive, told reporters. ""It's just going to be wonderful to get astronauts back into orbit from American soil after almost a decade of not being able to do so. That's just super exciting."" Crew Dragon separating from Falcon 9 during today’s test, which verified the spacecraft’s ability to carry astronauts to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent <a href=""https://t.co/rxUDPFD0v5"">pic.twitter.com/rxUDPFD0v5</a> NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Musk and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the next Crew Dragon could launch with a pair of NASA astronauts in the second quarter of this year — as early as April. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off as normal, but just over a minute into its supersonic flight, the Dragon crew capsule catapulted off the top 20 kilometres above the Atlantic. Powerful thrusters on the capsule propelled it up and out of harm's way, as the rocket engines deliberately shut down and the booster tumbled out of control and exploded in a giant fireball. The capsule reached an altitude of about 44 kilometres before parachuting into the ocean just offshore to bring the test flight to a close. Everything appeared to go well despite the choppy seas and overcast skies. Within minutes, a recovery ship was alongside the capsule. Recycled from three previous launches, the SpaceX rocket was destroyed as it burst apart in flight and slammed in pieces into the sea. SpaceX normally tries to recover its boosters to drive down launch costs, landing them upright on a floating platform or back at the launch site. NASA's commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the launch abort test was ""our last open milestone"" before allowing SpaceX to launch Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the International Space Station. Their launch date will depend, in part, on whether NASA decides to keep them for months at the orbiting lab, versus just a week or two. A longer mission will require more training before flight. The astronauts monitored Sunday's flight from the firing room. Hurley said it was ""pretty neat to see"" the capsule aboard the recovery ship within two hours. By all early accounts, the test was successful. ""We'll see what the data show and go from there,"" Hurley said. ""But it certainly is a confidence builder from the standpoint if you ever got into that situation, that Dragon can get us away from the booster quickly."" The astronauts also will have access to speed before liftoff. During a launch dress rehearsal Friday, Hurley and Behnken rode in a white Tesla Model X from Kennedy Space Center's crew quarters to the launch pad, their sleek white and black spacesuits matching the electric sports car with wing-like doors. Musk, who also runs Tesla, used the cars to get around the space center Sunday. Delayed a day by bad weather, Sunday's launch from Kennedy brought together hundreds of SpaceX, NASA and Air Force employees on land, at sea and in the air. Tourists and locals alike packed the adjoining visitor complex and nearby beaches to see the dramatic fiery spectacle of an out-of-control rocket. Musk brought along his own family, including his brother. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing a decade ago to transport astronauts to and from the space station for billions of dollars. Both companies struggled with technical problems, adding years of delay and forcing NASA to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars extra for Russian rocket rides. After multiple cargo deliveries for NASA, SpaceX successfully flew an enhanced crew capsule to the space station last March without anyone on board, but it exploded a month later during ground testing. The emergency escape thrusters — the kind used in Sunday's test — had to be retooled. In all, SpaceX has tested these powerful Super Draco thrusters some 700 times. Last month, meanwhile, Boeing's Starliner crew capsule ended up in the wrong orbit on its first test flight and had to skip the space station. The previous month, only two of the Starliner's three parachutes deployed during a launch abort test. Lueders said it's too soon to know whether Boeing will need to send another Starliner to the space station without a crew or go straight to launching astronauts later this year. An investigation team is still looking into why the Starliner's automated timer was off by 11 hours during the December test flight. The importance of launch escape was demonstrated in 2018 when two astronauts, an American and a Russian, were pulled to safety during a failed launch from Kazakhstan. They experienced up to seven times the force of gravity during the abort, but walked away from the accident. The SpaceX in-flight abort system, Musk pointed out, should be gentler for the crew and is good from the launch pad all the way to orbit. Musk said the Dragon's escape system should work — in principle — even if the capsule is still attached when the rocket erupts in a fireball. He said that could look like ""something out of Star Wars"" with the capsule flying right out of a fireball. ""Obviously we want to avoid doing that,"" he quickly added, taking note of all the NASA personnel around him.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-1.5433125,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-girlfriend-spacex-voyage-1.5424094 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boeing-starliner-crew-capsule-1.5403868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-dragon-1.5048241,N/A
376,Graham Thomson,2019-12-30T13:00:00.731Z,OPINION | 'You ain't seen nothing yet': A look at what's ahead in Alberta politics,"Psychics, astrologers and other impeccable internet sources tell us 2020 promises to be an interesting year in which, ""animals tell us what they think,"" the world ""becomes one country,"" and Trump speaks ""only nonsense."" I suppose only two of those are actually predictions while the other one is a sad statement of fact. Making predictions is always a mug's game. And considering how much politics has changed in Alberta the past year, only a fool would attempt to predict what's going to happen in 2020. So, let me try. The year 2020 might look like a new year on paper but in many ways it's going to feel mighty old mighty quick. At least when it comes to Alberta politics. Many of the big issues from the past year will continue to dominate the new. Let's look at a few. Yes, it didn't take a crystal ball to figure this one out. Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives won the election on a promise of a strong economy and more jobs. It didn't work out that way and the NDP has been gleefully rubbing it in Kenney's face every chance they get. And they'll keep it up in 2020 as the UCP government tries to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Economists predict ""modest growth"" in the province's economy for the new year. Kenney will need to do better than that if he hopes to mute the critics — and claim ""promise made, promise kept"" in 2020. If there's one issue that has defined Alberta politics, this is it. Getting a new energy pipeline to tidewater has become an overwrought symbol of Alberta's dreams and frustrations — the dream of another energy boom and the frustration at failing to get a new pipeline built. In fact, a new pipeline will not solve our fiscal problems that are actually caused by a depressed price of oil and a world moving away from fossil fuels. And delays in getting a new pipeline built are not the fault of the federal Liberal government, as Premier Jason Kenney likes to suggest, but the courts. And the courts have delayed projects because of genuine complaints from First Nations. Work has started on twinning the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that work will continue through 2020 (and for two years after that) but the project will still face opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups. This will be a win-win for Kenney. If construction continues on TMX, he can point to it as a ""victory"" for his government; if it doesn't, he can blame the federal Liberals and ""foreign-funded"" environmental organizations for continuing to undermine Alberta's struggling economy. Speaking of blaming others for Alberta's ills, 2020 will see the UCP government maintain its pugilistic approach to issues via its Fight Back Strategy that includes the ""war room"" — officially, the Canadian Energy Centre — the public inquiry into the government's foreign-funded conspiracy theory, and the ""fair deal"" panel that is looking into whether Alberta should have, for example, its own police force and pension plan. Alberta energy 'war room' discovers its logo was lifted from American software company These are all tactics designed to keep Alberta on a war footing and keep Albertans angry, frustrated and easily manipulated by a government that equates legitimate opposition with sedition. The past year ended with some frustrated public sector workers musing about a general strike. That strike never happened and perhaps it never will. But we might see strikes by individual public sector unions in 2020. They are upset by a government that is pressing workers to take wage cuts. The government has made it clear if the unions win wage hikes, they can expect job cuts. Perhaps the government was peering into its own crystal ball this fall when it passed a piece of legislation giving it the right to hire replacement workers in the event of a public sector strike. In 2019, the UCP government commissioned a long list of panels and committees to review everything from the $20-billion Alberta Health Services, to car insurance rates, to safe consumption sites. The granddaddy of them all was the blue ribbon panel that issued a report that formed the basis for the government's cost-cutting budget that rolled out in October. Alberta's 'fair deal' panel begins feedback tour with Edmonton town hall Those panels — with members and mandates carefully chosen by the government — will continue to influence government policy throughout 2020. That includes Budget 2020 coming in late February, which will actually be the first true UCP budget. The 2019 budget, introduced in an election year, was an amalgam of UCP policies and leftovers from the previous NDP budget. There won't be an election in 2020 but you're going to feel like you're trapped in a nasty election campaign anyway. The animosity between the UCP government and NDP opposition isn't just political, it's personal. Kenney has gone to great lengths to dismantle the former NDP government's legacy and the NDP sees Kenney as a right-wing bully. The mutual antagonism will continue as Kenney has already promised even more sweeping legislation in the spring session. Kenney's popularity took a substantial hit late in 2019, according to several public opinion polls, because of a sputtering economy and cuts to government services. But it appears he doesn't plan to stop or change direction. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he told cheering UCP members at their convention a few weeks ago. ""We're just getting started."" In one of the few times NDP leader Rachel Notley agreed with Kenney in 2019, she told a year-end interview she doesn't think Kenney is about to ease up on the gas pedal in 2020: ""There's nothing that makes me believe that they're going to change course and I think they're going to push harder.""

""Look what happened to our caribou ...15 or 10 years ago caribou were thick like mosquitoes."" The Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council is asking the provincial government to put in place a moratorium on the 2020 moose hunt in the réserve faunique La Vérendrye, south of Val-d'Or, saying hunters are seeing steep declines in the population.  Last week, the council issued a press release saying it was disappointed the ministry was refusing to act so far.

It will include a better population count and draw on traditional Cree and non-Indigenous conservation practices, and could include restrictions on Indigenous hunters, according to association president Tomatuk. He also said hunters need to stop over-harvesting, particularly female moose during the spring calving season. ""In Waswanipi last year, nine moose were killed,"" said Tomatuk, adding all were female and pregnant. That one harvest took a total of 27 moose out of the area, he said.

378,Amy Smart,2020-01-22T23:52:17.825Z,B.C. human rights commissioner defends her support of hereditary chiefs who oppose LNG pipeline,"British Columbia's human rights commissioner is defending herself against accusations by Indigenous supporters of the liquefied natural gas industry that she didn't do her research before wading into a pipeline dispute.  Karasi Govender says in a statement that she ""unreservedly'' recognizes that some band councils along the Coastal GasLink pipeline route in northern B.C. have consented to the project.  But she says just as those bands have the right to give their consent, other Indigenous rights holders affected by the project have the right to withhold it.  From a human rights perspective, Govender says it's not a numbers game and each person's rights should be protected even if their position is unpopular. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nations councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline path, but the hereditary clan chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en Nation say the project has no authority without their consent.  The First Nations LNG Alliance issued an open letter this week to Govender saying she never consulted Indigenous groups that support the pipeline when she called for the free, prior and informed consent of all impacted Indigenous groups before any project impacts the land. CEO Karen Ogen-Toews says in the letter that it was disheartening to see that the Indigenous support, achieved through five years of consultation, was ""so easily dismissed.'' ""Human rights do not exist for the majority, they exist for each individual and in the case of free, prior, and informed consent for each Indigenous rights holding group,'' Govender says in her response. ""Indeed, human rights are the hardest to guarantee for those who find themselves in an unpopular minority, but this is when our commitment to human rights principles are truly tested.'' As commissioner, she says she takes no position on whether major natural resource projects should move forward, except in so far as they are required to uphold domestic and international human rights principles.  She calls for a peaceful resolution to the situation unfolding in Wet'suwet'en territories and says reconciliation and human rights must be the first consideration.

379,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-23T12:03:59.876Z,Vitalité presses for online help to fill gap in mental health services,"The province desperately needs online support for troubled people waiting months to see mental health professionals, says the vice-president of mental health at Vitalité Health Network. While someone with a severe mental health issue can be seen by a counsellor or therapist right away, Jacques Duclos said there needs to be better access to help those on the waiting list. ""We need to be able to identify services that fit your needs, depending on the severity. And to broaden the type of access to mental health services,"" said Duclos. He said the province is looking at introducing an online tool aimed at reducing wait times for people looking for mental health services in New Brunswick. Bridge the gApp is an online resource designed to support mental wellness. The program was introduced in 2015 and is funded by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Residents can access important information and resources through technology, such as cell phones, tablets and computers. ""We really need to rethink our access … I think it will be difficult for any service provider to have the capacity to provide the [mental health] services,"" Duclos said. Bruce Macfarlane, a spokesperson for New Brunswick's Department of Health, said it's ""exploring all options"" but wouldn't confirm it's bringing in the app. But Dr. Peter Cornish, an associate professor at Memorial University involved in the development of Newfoundland and Labrador's mental health app, said he's worked on the New Brunswick version. Cornish said New Brunswick could be getting it as early as this year, becoming the second province to use this particular service. ""It expands your options that we wouldn't normally think that will be helpful to your mental health,"" Cornish said. The app connects people to self-help information, tools and local supports through a searchable service directory. Cornish said it also saved one woman's life. ""There's no one-size-fits-all for mental health support,"" Cornish said. According to a report by Stepped Care 2.0, an e-mental health demonstration project, the app attracted 28,000 users in 2018-2019, its fourth year of operation. The report also notes that in 2017-2018 wait times for addictions and mental health services in Newfoundland and Labrador were reduced by 68 per cent due to a combination of factors, one of them being e-mental health services. ""In some places, wait times were completely eliminated,"" Cornish said.  New Brunswick's app will be similar to Bridge the gApp, but it won't be identical. The Newfoundland and Labrador program is offered to both adults and youth and covers issues like depression, anxiety, eating disorders or someone looking for a peer support group. It also provides better access for people living in rural areas. John Abbott, CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association's Newfoundland and Labrador division, said the app isn't for everyone, but it is an advance in mental health services. ""It cannot replace face-to-face counselling and when that is needed,"" said Abbott. ""But it is certainly a very strong direction to support people where they are in their homes when face-to-face services are not readily available."" He said the app is also helpful for teens, who are typically more comfortable using technology.  In the future, there will be an option for people to track their mental health on the app, similar to a Fitbit, which measures a person's physical well-being. ""It will allow people to graph out how their mental wellness is progressing,"" said Cornish.  Depending on the severity of a person's mental health, Duclos said people seeking public mental health services in New Brunswick can wait several months before seeing a mental health professional. But the severity of a mental illness is different for each person.  If a person is suicidal or struggling with their daily routine, Duclos said they would be considered a priority and could be seen by a professional on the same day they reach out. ""For very acute situations, we do have the capacity,"" he said.   But if a person has some kind of ""resiliency,"" they could be a lower priority.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/bridge-the-gap-mental-health-services-1.5436494,[],N/A
380,Leah Hendry,2020-01-23T09:00:00.890Z,Montreal woman alleges negligence at autistic sister's group home,"A Montreal woman said she feels betrayed by health authorities for leaving the recently hired manager of her autistic sister's group home in place despite what she alleges are serious incidents of negligence. The specialized group home, located in Montreal's Saint-Laurent borough, is for people with mental disabilities, autism and complex behavioural issues. Electra Dalamagas's sister has been living there for more than a decade. Last December, a new manager took over the group home and brought in new staff. To help her sister adjust to the change, Dalamagas visited regularly and took her on outings. During those visits, she noticed a growing number of problems.  Dalamagas alleges staff made errors in the administration of medication — both with the timing, frequency and combinations of drugs — as well as with the charting of her sister's other health data, such as bowel movements, nutrition and sleep. When she pointed out the errors to the new staff, she said nothing changed. Her concerns peaked after returning to the home from an outing in late December. Dalamagas said she was helping her sister in the bathroom when she found oven cleaner in an unlocked cabinet. ""You should not have these things lying around because a client could spill it on themselves or decide to drink it,"" said Dalamagas. She questioned the only employee on site, who had been left alone to run the home at that time, but she said the woman appeared to have a cognitive impairment and didn't seem to understand Dalamagas's concern. ""If there's a fire, if somebody bolts — because some of our guys are runners — that woman won't be able to stop them,"" said Dalamagas, an advocate at Autisme Montreal who is also a trained social worker. ""My faith, confidence and trust was completely shattered that night."" The home is part of a network of group homes run by a non-profit agency, Miriam Home and Services. Believing that the health and safety of all the clients at the group home were in jeopardy and u​​​nable to reach a manager at Miriam Home over the Christmas break, Dalamagas went to the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal, the health and social services authority which oversees Miriam. She demanded the contract of the newly hired group home manager be cancelled. ""I'm like, what are you waiting for, a coroner's inquest?"" Dalamagas said she asked the health authority. ""This is folly. Nobody's overseeing anything."" A few days after she lodged her complaint, Dalamagas learned that another group home worker had recorded a cellphone video of her sister, naked on the toilet, and had shown it to other people. With that, Dalamagas had had enough, and she temporarily removed her sister from the home to ensure her safety. ""Why would you film somebody naked — somebody so vulnerable?"" asks a mortified Dalamagas. She said she believes that worker took the video out of spite, because she'd made the complaint. ""It's a breach of trust."" Dalamagas said her sister's group home had been well-run for a decade. The former manager and most of her staff had years of experience working at schools for people with special needs, she said. They all spoke English, which helped them build relationships with the clients, offer structure and diffuse behavioural problems. But last spring that manager gave her notice, leaving Miriam Home and Services seven months to find a replacement for her and her staff. Dalamagas said she helped persuade one of the day staff to stay on for a few months to help ease the transition to a new team. The new manager, James Marcellin, is francophone and speaks English poorly, said Dalamagas. The French-speaking staff he hired to work evenings, nights and weekends also have limited English, she said, making it difficult for them to communicate with the mostly non-verbal clients, who are anglophones. The families were promised the manager would be on site daily, but Dalamagas said he rarely showed up. Occasionally, staff would ask her to pick up items for the home — something that should be the manager's job, she said. Dalamagas said she was worried about the effect all the changes were having on her sister, who is non-verbal but was crying more often and having more frequent staring spells and problems sleeping — and had other ways of signalling her unhappiness. ""My sister was locking her coat and boots in the locker at her day activities and refusing to leave,"" said Dalamagas. ""She did not want to go back to the home."" Dalamagas said she'd expected there would be challenges with the transition to a new group of caregivers, but what she could not tolerate was her sister being left in what she saw as an unsafe environment. After the incident with the oven cleaner, Dalamagas met with the health authority and Miriam staff on Jan. 7. She outlined everything she had witnessed. She blamed Miriam for hiring the manager in the first place and not properly monitoring the transition. Dalamagas suggested to officials the names of two other workers who could take over the group home, who were used to working with a special needs clientele. ""They told me, no, they wanted to continue working with the current manager,"" she said. ""I will never forgive that,"" she said. ""Clients shouldn't be hostages to contracts."" Following her meeting, Dalamagas said she was told Miriam staff did an unannounced spot check. But that happened during the day, on a day that the only worker left from the previous administration was present. Dalamagas said she had been promised her complaint would be kept confidential. But the next time Dalamagas visited her sister's group home, she said the staff member on duty greeted her rudely and spoke to her in an angry, scolding way. She suspected that person knew it was her who had complained. The following day, the same staff member wouldn't let her in the home until she phoned the group home manager. Once she learned about the video that was taken of her sister on Jan. 10, Dalamagas said there was no going back. She alerted the health authority and asked again that the manager's contract be cancelled immediately. She also alerted the provincial Ministry of Health and Social Services. Dalamagas said she was later told by administrators that the employee who took the video had been fired. She said they told her while the incident was ""proof of poor judgment,"" no malice had been intended — that the employee had only wanted to take a picture of the broken toilet. With her sister temporarily under her care, Dalamagas said she didn't hear back from the health authority for a full week. On Jan. 17, she was told there would be a month-long administrative investigation that would either lead to recommendations for improvements at the home or the cancellation of the manager's contract. In the meantime, the manager remains in place. ""The trust is completely broken,"" she said. In a statement, the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal said it followed the rules and regulations when it hired the manager. In an email, CIUSSS spokesperson Barry Morgan said the transition had been quick because the agency wanted a new manager to step in as soon as possible. He said the new manager had only been away for four days during the holiday period and had been covered by a staff member used to working at the group home. Morgan said the reported allegations were taken very seriously and resulted in immediate action. He said there are two separate investigations now underway. He did not provide specific details about what issues are being examined. He said those investigations are expected to be completed by the beginning of February. ""The quality of the services that are provided by CIUSSS West-Central Montreal and the safety and well-being of our users are the focus of our concerns,"" Morgan said. ""Thus, appropriate measures are always implemented to ensure that vulnerable individuals in our facilities receive services of superior quality in a safe and secure environment."" Morgan said no further comments would be made due to confidentiality and to ensure the integrity of the investigations. When CBC called the group home manager, Marcellin, he declined to comment, citing the investigation which is underway. The Quebec Health and Social Services Ministry told CBC in an email it is aware of the situation and is following the investigations closely. ""No situation of mistreatment is tolerated,"" said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a ministry spokesperson. Dalamagas's sister remains in her care. ""I feel betrayed,"" Dalamagas said. ""Instead of protecting clients, the agency is protecting the caregiver.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-woman-alleges-negligence-at-autistic-sister-s-group-home-1.5435203,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/a-cut-to-the-most-vulnerable-day-program-for-disabled-adults-drops-older-clients-1.4407806 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/outcry-over-service-cuts-for-severely-disabled-unreasonable-says-health-authority-senior-manager-1.4418696,N/A
381,Dan Zakreski,2020-01-23T16:49:13.588Z,Cry Wolf: Author questions whether lessons from fatal 2005 wolf attack in north have been forgotten,"Harold Johnson still remembers the early morning in 1986 when he realized he wasn't at the top of the food chain. It involved a northern Saskatchewan mine site and a very large timber wolf. Now, 34 years later, he's written a book warning that we ignore this apex predator at our peril. Johnson says that on that day decades ago he was walking on a bush road to the job site when suddenly the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Some primitive part of his brain began flashing red alerts. He turned to find a timber wolf about eight to 10 feet away, crouched down and ready to pounce. ""If I close my eyes I can see that wolf. I was in the best shape of my life. I weighed 172 pounds. Better shape than when I finished basic training a decade earlier. And that wolf was the same weight as me, maybe more. He had more strength than I had. He was faster, he was quicker,"" he said. ""He was an athlete's dream, aesthetically beautiful, and scared the pants off me. "" Johnson said he survived the encounter by crawling into a manhole on the road. Fast forward two decades and Johnson once again had a wolf encounter. This time it happened in the ballroom of a Prince Albert hotel in 2007. Johnson represented the family of Ontario engineering student Kenton Carnegie at a coroner's inquest. The 22-year-old had been killed at Points North Landing in 2005, a northern mining supply camp where he worked on a break from his classroom studies. Ontario man killed in wolf attack, coroner's jury finds Wolf attack in northern Saskatchewan 3rd in 12 years Carnegie had gone out for a walk around a nearby lake and didn't return. Searchers later found his body, partially eaten and surrounded by animal tracks. The inquest eventually determined that Carnegie had been killed by wolves. It was the first recorded death by wolf attack in North America in more than a century. In the Points North case, the wolves had been drawn to the camp's unfenced dump and become habituated to humans. Today, 15 years after the inquest, wolves are again on Johnson's mind. He's just published Cry Wolf, a book that takes a deep dive into the circumstances around Carnegie's death. The goal, he says, is to remind people of the animal that we're dealing with. The Carnegie inquest provided a graphic reminder that, given the right environment, wolves will kill people. The prospect of more wolf/human encounters is growing as people encroach on their territory. Johnson says the province needs to start tracking wolf populations and movements. ""Where are they? What are they doing? How are they surviving? What are we doing with the massive clear cuts in northern Saskatchewan destroying their habitat?"" The Ministry of Environment confirms that it does not track wolf populations or movement. ""Wolf populations are generally inferred based on reported problems with livestock predation and from anecdotal information mainly from hunters, trappers and outfitters,"" an official said in an e-mail. ""We have a provincial estimate of 3,500 wolves based on habitat and prey-based models, but these are likely on the low end.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/cry-wolf-new-book-harold-johnson-1.5437525,[],N/A
382,Anonymous,2020-01-23T17:19:04.569Z,Quebec tightens rules on adventure tourism as search for snowmobilers resumes,"Quebec announced stricter rules and mandatory training for tourism operators Thursday, as crews continue to search for five missing French nationals who fell through ice while snowmobiling with a guide on Lac Saint-Jean. Guides who lead excursions in off-road vehicles, including snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, will have to complete a mandatory training course before taking tourists out on an excursion. The tourists themselves will also need to complete a training course before being allowed to handle the vehicle. Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said the announcement had been planned for several weeks, but she had never imagined it ""would happen in such a tragic context."" The guide, 42-year-old Benoît Lespérance from Montreal, was pulled out of the water by Alma firefighters. He died Wednesday morning. ""Snowmobile excursions, canoe trips and ocean kayaking are all ways of appreciating Quebec's natural beauty,"" she said. ""But they must be rigorously regulated to ensure the safety of everyone participating, be they from Quebec or abroad."" Nature and adventure tourism operators will also need an accreditation from Aventure Écotourisme Québec if they wish to apply for funding from the Quebec government. Proulx said 135 businesses already have the accreditation, but hundreds of businesses do not. While she said it is impossible to promise that there will ever be ""no risk,"" Proulx said she hopes that accidents such as the one on Lac Saint-Jean ""don't happen again."" Meanwhile, authorities continue to search for the five French tourists who went missing after their snowmobiles fell through the ice of Lac Saint-Jean Tuesday night. Quebec provincial police deployed an additional diving team to the area Thursday, after two of the snowmobiles were found underwater. Rescuers with specialized training to work on ice, a drone and snowmobile units will be joining the 30 officers deployed to the scene. Sûreté du Québec and Canadian Armed Forces helicopters will also be circling the area. The tourists were part of a group of eight French nationals who, accompanied by their guide, attempted to cross a snow-covered channel between the towns of Saint-Henri-de-Taillon and Alma when the ice gave way beneath them.

383,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-25T19:22:58.757Z,'We would have been dead': Father outraged after engine fire puts family at risk,"Chris Dietrich, his wife and three young children were asleep when they woke up to a neighbour pounding on the door to tell them flames were shooting out of their garage and closing in on the house. The engine in the family's 2015 Hyundai Tucson had spontaneously burst into flames while parked in the garage. ""If it weren't for our neighbours, we would have likely been dead,"" Dietrich, from Ayr, Ont., told Go Public. ""If it were 10 to 15 minutes later it would have hit our gas line to our gas barbecue."" The fire broke out in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, after the vehicle had been parked for hours.  The company Dietrich hired to investigate found the fire started in the engine, but couldn't definitively determine why it started.  Dietrich is not the only one with an engine fire horror story. Since Go Public first broke the story about delayed recalls on Hyundai and Kia vehicles for possible engine problems, CBC News has been bombarded with stories of spontaneous vehicle fires and catastrophic engine failures.     George Iny from the Automobile Protection Association credits that CBC News investigation with pressuring the South Korean carmakers into action. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to determine if the carmakers were too slow to fix faulty vehicles. ""We dragged some of [our belongings] out and then we watched it burn until the fire trucks got there,"" Michielsen told Go Public from his home in Coaldale, Alta. ""I got away lucky because we weren't injured.""  Michielsen's vehicle has been subject to two engine recalls for different reasons. The first was in January 2018. He says his local Kia dealer inspected his engine and told him it was fine.  A few months later, the engine stalled and had to be replaced — only to catch fire earlier this month.  When he got home, he found a second recall notice in the mail. The latest recall brings the total number of recalled Hyundai and Kia vehicles to almost three million in North America since 2015.  The recalls have been for different defects that could lead to engine failures and fires, which is a problem, according to Gretchen Freeman Cappio, a U.S. lawyer who is leading one of several lawsuits south of the border over engine fires.  ""There are numerous problems with these vehicles [in which] the companies admit they have a recall but they don't have a fix … which is astounding when you say it out loud,"" Freeman Cappio said from her office in Seattle. Hyundai has the second highest number of engine fire reports among carmakers in the country — 21 over the past three years, according to Transport Canada. The company was seventh in car sales last year, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. Hyundai says it only has five confirmed cases of engine fires resulting from engine failures — saying that is a tiny fraction of the estimated number of its vehicles on the road.  Transport Canada has had three fire reports related to Kia engines, but the automaker wouldn't say how many it has recorded. Following Go Public's investigation into the 2.0L and 2.4L Theta II engines, Hyundai and Kia Canada did more in a couple of weeks than they have done since the recalls started four years ago. Kia added 79,301 vehicles to its recall list and Hyundai added 255,370 — more than double since the recalls started. Hyundai is also extending warranties for those vehicles. Hyundai says it's doing that ""out of an abundance of caution."" The Automobile Protection Association's Iny calls the warranty extensions ""a very big offer"" and says he's pleased with how Hyundai is stepping up action after Go Public's investigation.   ""That's a big development for consumers,"" he said. In a written response to Go Public's investigation, Hyundai Auto Canada says ""nothing is more important to Hyundai than the safety and security of our customers.""  ""Hyundai takes engine fires with the utmost urgency and seriousness. It is Hyundai's policy to investigate each and every engine fire that is brought to its attention,"" the statement reads.  Kia says ""when the result of any engine failure or fire is due to a vehicle manufacturing issue, Kia will conduct a voluntary recall,"" adding it ""continuously evaluates all Kia models … [and] if a safety defect is detected … Kia promptly reports a safety related defect to Transport Canada."" Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a potential safety-related condition with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Owners wanting to check if their vehicles are under a recall can do that on the Hyundai and Kia websites.

384,Erica Johnson,2019-05-27T19:20:39.139Z,Man with severe asthma says new police powers unfair for people unable to do breath test,"LATEST UPDATE | After this story was published, the RCMP sent another statement to Go Public, saying the force's national impaired driving policy is based on the Criminal Code. The available options to screen for impaired drivers are legislated by Parliament, it said, and police are not permitted to use alternatives. If a driver feels they had a lawful excuse for failing to comply with an impairment-screening test, ""they are encouraged to speak with legal counsel and consider bringing their concerns before the courts,"" the statement said. A B.C. man with severe breathing issues who recently had his car impounded and driver's licence suspended — twice — says new rules that allow police across the country to pull over any vehicle and force the driver to take a breath test are causing undue hardship for people who cannot blow into a breathalyzer. Jimmy Forster, 63, suffers from severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and takes daily medications to help him breathe. He lives in the small village of Chase — population 2,300 — in the B.C. Interior. In recent months, Chase RCMP have pulled Forster over twice and charged him with failing to provide a breath sample, after he was unable to blow hard enough into a breathalyzer device to register a reading. ""I'm just totally stressed right now,"" says Forster, who has an audible wheeze when he speaks and slightly slurred speech due to a childhood brain injury that also left him with a limp. He's on a disability pension, but is now on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get his car out of impound and his driver's licence reinstated, and says he has no idea how he will pay. There are almost 200,000 Canadians living with severe asthma and more than two million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the Canadian Lung Association. Thousands of others have disabilities — such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis caused by stroke — that may make them unable to perform a breath test, causing concern for human rights advocates. ""I think it's important that the police consider human rights principles,"" says Dylan Mazur, a lawyer with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, ""including the duty to accommodate people with disabilities who can't provide a roadside test."" A spokesperson with the RCMP's national headquarters, Sgt. Marie Damian, did not respond when Go Public asked whether a specific policy exists to provide an alternative for people with disabilities who can't do a breathalyzer test. In an email she wrote, ""The determination as to whether the subject was 'able and unwilling' or 'legitimately unable' to provide a sample will be up to the investigating officer."" ""The actual volume and force of breath required for a sample is not significant."" Forster says his first police run-in occurred when he was returning from a trip to the post office on the afternoon of Feb. 14, and an RCMP officer pulled him over and accused him of not wearing a seatbelt. Forster says he was belted in. The officer decided to employ the alcohol screening powers that came into effect on Dec. 18, 2018, granting police the right to demand a breath sample from any driver they pull over. In the past, police couldn't require a roadside breath test unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a driver had consumed alcohol. In B.C., any driver who refuses — or, like Forster, fails to provide a breath sample — faces an immediate roadside prohibition (IRP), where their licence is suspended and their vehicle towed, even though there is no evidence of any alcohol consumption. In other provinces, drivers face a potential criminal charge for refusing to blow. Forster says he blew into the breathalyzer device, but couldn't get a reading. He says he explained that he has severe asthma, but the officer didn't believe him. ""He just said, 'Blow harder! Blow harder!'"" says Forster, who says he tried about a dozen times to breathe deeply into the device, and thought he was going to fall over because he was getting dizzy. The RCMP officer issued an IRP, despite a lack of any evidence that Forster was impaired. ""I just couldn't believe it,"" says Forster, whose doctor told Go Public his patient has no history of a drinking problem.   Forster appealed to an adjudicator, submitting his medical records. The adjudicator dismissed the case and Forster got his licence back and his car out of impound, without financial penalty. A few weeks later, on the morning of March 20, police pulled Forster over again, just after he'd gone for a haircut and filled up his car at a gas station. ""He [the officer] didn't ask me any questions,"" says Forster. ""He just brought the breathalyzer and I blew five to six times and had the same thing happen again."" This time, Forster says, he asked the officer if he could take a blood test instead. ""He totally ignored me,"" says Forster. ""Just in one ear, out the other."" Once again, police impounded Forster's car and suspended his licence for 90 days. When he appealed a second time, an adjudicator said he believed police notes that said Forster was ""putting on a show"" to make it look as though he was unable to provide a breath sample. The notes do not claim that Forster appeared to have been drinking, smelled of alcohol, or was driving poorly. ""I was so choked,"" says Forster, who faces about $1,400 in fees to get his car released from impound and his licence back next month. He has already spent $200 each time he appealed the IRPs. Forster lives with his cousin Sandy Johnston, who relies on him to drive her places since having a stroke 10 years ago. ""I'm totally dependent on Jimmy,"" she says. ""After his car got taken the second time, he was just in tears. And then I broke into tears, too. And we were crying together."" A leading researcher on lung disease says assessing whether or not someone's lung function is adequate to obtain a breathalyzer reading is not something that can be easily done in the field. ""The concern I have is that there likely are people that have lung function that's so low that they can't do the tests,"" says Dr. Christopher Carlsten, division head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of the Occupational Lung Disease Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. He says viral infections and other stressors, such as being pulled over by police, can affect the breathing capacity of someone with compromised lungs. Go Public has tracked down other cases in B.C. — as well as in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick — in which people with disabilities say they struggled to provide a breathalyzer test. One of the more prominent cases has prompted a charter challenge against mandatory alcohol screening. Norma McLeod, 76, of Victoria, was pulled over on Feb. 14, and says she was unable to provide a breath sample due to a chronic lung condition and an implant in the roof of her mouth that's a result of cancer. Police towed her car and suspended her licence. ""It's happening more frequently now that the federal government has introduced the provision which permits mandatory alcohol screening based on absolutely no suspicion of alcohol consumption,"" says criminal lawyer Jennifer Teryn, part of the legal team representing McLeod. ""If someone's unable to provide a sample upon demand, it's my position that the police should have to get engaged in some minor investigation to find out for themselves whether there's a legitimate reason for that or not,"" says Teryn. Mazur says he also expects police to ask people whether they have a disability preventing them from complying with a roadside breath test demand. ""I've heard this from people with disabilities who have mobility issues or who have speech issues — that they can be perceived as intoxicated,"" says Mazur. ""What the RCMP has to do is look at their policies, and look at whether there are provisions of reasonable accommodation based on disability."" Go Public asked Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s minister of public safety and solicitor general, about the difficulties some people with disabilities have  providing breath tests.

385,Laura Glowacki,2020-01-21T22:35:04.591Z,"Train shortage causes LRT delays, crowding","For the second day in a row, OC Transpo doesn't have enough working trains to adequately service its four-month-old Confederation Line.  It said Tuesday at 1:15 p.m. it would have 10 working trains through the afternoon rush, meaning trains will run approximately every five or six minutes instead of every three minutes during that peak period. At times this morning, as few as eight were running. OC Transpo is running ""special buses"" alongside its trains to help alleviate expected crowds and delays on the LRT line caused by the train shortage. From 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., OC Transpo will run special buses from Albert Street, just west of O'Connor Street near Parliament station, to both Hurdman and Tunney's Pasture stations to get out of the core. Those buses ran from Hurdman and Tunney's Pasture stations to downtown from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. Buses from Hurdman dropped passengers off at stops on Albert Street, similar to how express buses worked before Oct. 6, 2019 (but without stopping at stations along the way). Buses leaving from Tunney's Pasture let people off on Slater Street. On Monday afternoon, only 10 trains were working down from the 13 at rush hour and 11 during off-peak times required to meet rider demand. ""It's just frustrating,"" said Coun. Riley Brockington on Monday. The River councillor is also a member of Ottawa's transit commission. ""Most reasonable people can understand and accept some issues now and then with the public transit system as a whole, but not with the frequency that we've seen for such a brand new service."" Costs to run the special replacement buses Tuesday will be charged to the LRT's builders Rideau Transit Group, said Manconi. They're now responsible for maintenance on the LRT under the name Rideau Transit Maintenance. The drop in the number of trains Monday and Tuesday was caused by a handful of problems with trains. On Thursday a wire above a train broke and damaged the train as it entered St. Laurent station, one train is out of service with a compressor issue and a few other trains are experiencing wheel flats, said OC Transpo operations director Troy Charter Monday afternoon. Wheel flats mean part of the wheel is dragging on the track instead of turning. That issue is ""a main contributor to the inability to have 13 trains at peak period right now,"" he said. The city owns 17 double-carriage trains for the Confederation Line, but two trains have yet to be sufficiently tested and are not ready for service. The other 15 are used in regular rotation or as backups, said Brockington. As only eight were working Tuesday it stands to reason seven trains were undergoing or have undergone repairs at the same time. Again, the city has not confirmed this. ""Sometimes you have to take trains out of service for regular maintenance that's planned, but the number of issues that we've seen and the technical issues with these trains is not something that we should expect,"" said Brockington. The city councillor plans to raise both the St. Laurent station wire break and the lack of working trains at a special transit commission meeting on Thursday. Both officials with Rideau Transit Maintenance and OC Transpo are attending Thursday's meeting.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-lrt-trains-replacement-buses-1.5434124,[],N/A

""We think there is a possibility people come back with the disease here, in Canada or in Quebec, but we will catch it early and make sure the transmission is not sustained in the community.""

""It's no secret in the last campaign we had some financial pressures,"" NDP National Director Anne McGrath said. ""We didn't have the money that we needed to run the campaign that we wanted to run."" McGrath said the party borrowed $10 million and spent $11 million during the 2019 campaign. The party has a $7 million balance remaining, she said.

Huffington Post reported in January that the NDP national council voted in December to put off its national convention until 2021. McGrath said Wednesday the party didn't want to incur more debt by hosting a costly event; the NDP heavily subsidizes convention attendee registration and travel, unlike other parties. Suspending the convention until 2021 delays a membership vote on Singh's leadership planned for the convention — one Singh said Wednesday he welcomes. ""Why I am confident of where I stand is because we ran a campaign that put people first,"" Singh told reporters. ""And we saw a lot of support from the membership and a lot of support from Canadians."" McGrath said she regrets the delay, saying a convention would be an ""awesome"" way ""to build on the momentum of the campaign.""

388,Ashley Heisler,2019-12-21T09:00:00.675Z,Canada should be going for gold-standard when protecting elite athletes from abuse,"This column is an opinion by Ashley Heisler, a second-year law student at the University of Ottawa and a former NCCA Division I athlete in women's lacrosse. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. The recent New York Times video featuring U.S. long-distance runner Mary Cain shook the track and field community in North America with a heart-wrenching story of physical and emotional abuse, and it has an all too familiar ring for those in sport in Canada. At 17, Cain signed a professional contract with Nike after becoming the youngest American track-and-field athlete to make a world championship team. Filled with potential, Cain says she was the ""fastest girl in America, until I joined Nike."" The seven-minute video provides an unadulterated recount of Cain's tenure training with Alberto Salazar's now dismantled Nike Oregon Project, during which she lost her period for three years, broke five bones and was burdened by suicidal thoughts. In Oregon, Cain says her male coaches insisted that, to be successful, she needed to be ""thinner, and thinner, and thinner,"" to the point where her body screamed for help. In Canada, physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuses have had severe and lasting effects on our nation's elite athletes, as well. In a federally funded, anonymous survey consisting of 1,000 former national team athletes this past year, for example, ""13 per cent of current and 20 per cent of retired athletes reported they had experienced suicidal thoughts,"" with only 15 per cent saying they had reported their experiences officially. Sandra Kirby, a professor at the University of Winnipeg and former Olympian who completed a study similar to the federally funded report, found that throughout Canada's elite sports management and coaching environments there is a general disrespect of the fact that athletes are people. In other words, viewing athletes as a tool or mechanism for profit, medal count, or reputation often takes precedence over their safety and well-being. Some are no longer staying silent. This past June, former Canadian Olympic skier Allison Forsyth launched a class-action lawsuit against Alpine Canada, claiming that the organization failed to protect its female athletes from sexual assault by former coach Bertrand Charest. When Forsyth initially reported the incidents to Alpine Canada, she says she was told to consider her allegations as she could be responsible for a loss of team sponsorship, and adds there was an implication that there could be effects on her own professional career. Others in sports in Canada have also gone public with accusations of inappropriate treatment of athletes by coaching staff or failure to properly protect athletes. Instances of ""abuse, manipulation and inappropriate behaviour"" have been alleged against a former coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer team, the Under-20 Women's National Team and assistant coach to the 2008 Canadian Women's Olympic Team, Bob Birarda. Among its conclusions, a report commissioned by the Whitecaps and submitted Dec. 13 found that the club failed to ensure Birarda was adhering to a code of conduct designed to protect players, and made 34 recommendations to improve player safety and complaint management.   Athletes in hockey, bobsleigh and rowing have also been coming forward with allegations of inappropriate treatment and behaviour. While formal litigation is an option and Canadian courts have established that coaches and their team staff owe a general duty of care to their athletes, the case law is limited. Many lawsuits are settled before they can be determined by a judge, leaving no room for binding precedent. The decisions that are published primarily deal with male professional athletes, and often fail to consider the additional barriers and vulnerabilities female athletes face, such as less funding, lower representation and gendered stereotypes. Further, they generally fail to address the psychological repercussions of abuse, even in cases stemming from physical acts. But outside the courts, while new policy protecting both female and male athletes pursuing professional and amateur sports careers in Canada is in its early stages, recent reforms suggest that measures safeguarding athletes are starting to change — and for the better.   Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science, Sport and Persons With Disabilities prior to the announcement of the new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 20, launched three major developments in order to combat harassment, abuse and discrimination at all levels of sport. First, an Investigation Unit supported by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) provides members of national sports teams with a third-party avenue to resolve disputes independent of an athlete's sports organization. Second, the Canadian Support Helpline was established as a neutral ""listening and referral service"" for athletes experiencing or witnessing harassment and discrimination in their sport. Third, Duncan committed to enforce a safety-valve mechanism, wherein federal funding will be withheld from national sports organizations if they fail to report incidents of discrimination and harassment, or don't utilize the SDRCC-supported Investigation Unit. For female athletes, specifically, Duncan took further steps towards ensuring their safety by appointing a federal Gender Equity Secretariat responsible for, ""developing, implementing and monitoring a gender equity in sport strategy."" This position is charged with facilitating initiatives to attract and maintain a greater female presence in sport, including athletes, coaches and officials, and aims to create a safer environment in which to train and compete. Members of national sport organizations will also be forced to undergo mandatory training in national policies around anti-harassment, abuse and discrimination before April 2020. It remains to be seen how the government will expand on these initiatives, as rookie MP Steven Guilbeault takes over the sport portfolio as part of his responsibilities as the new Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, the implementation of these early policies by his predecessor suggests an evolution in the culture of Canadian sport that is refusing to let competition harm athletes, and is helping to end silence around abuse. While the process of ensuring that athletes may pursue their goals without fear of abuse or harassment will hardly be linear, its current direction points to a promising future. As Olympic medallist Forsyth puts it, ""There is a strong sense of urgency to take action. We are not seeking perfection; we are seeking progress to ensure a safe, healthy sport environment for all athletes in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-sports-abuse-ashley-heisler-1.5363248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/elite-athletes-abuse-1.5125147 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur-sports-coaches-sexual-offences-minors-1.5006609 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-athletes-want-the-lip-service-around-safe-sport-to-stop-1.5117345 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes-renewing-call-independent-body-investigate-abuse-1.5378762 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abuse-sport-summit-1.5126753 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/shoemaker-canadian-olympic-committee-safe-sport-1.5128210,N/A
389,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:38:15.545Z,Quebec's proposed electoral reforms would give regions more power,"The Coalition Avenir Québec government is seeking to overhaul the way Quebecers choose their elected officials with a system of mixed proportional representation that would give rural areas more clout.  Under the proposed reforms, the Outaouais, Mauricie and Centre-du-Québec regions would each get an additional seat in the National Assembly, while the island of Montreal would lose three, going from 27 to 24 seats. There would still be 125 MNAs in the legislature. Of them, 80 would represent ridings, elected by majority vote. The remaining 40 MNAs would be chosen from regional lists. Voters would have to cast two ballots. Hearings into the CAQ's proposed legislation, Bill 39, began Wednesday in Quebec City. Sonia LeBel, the CAQ minister responsible for electoral reform, said the proposal attempts to strike a balance. ""It's to make sure that everybody is well represented,"" she said. ""Ultimately, this is not Montreal against the rest of Quebec. It's to make sure that we have more accurate representations of all the thoughts and philosophies at the [National Assembly]."" Bill 39 also requires voters to approve the plan in a referendum likely to coincide with the next provincial election, set for 2022. Both Québec Solidaire and the Parti Québécois have hinted they will support the bill, but they want to see some changes first. On Wednesday, QS unveiled two proposed amendments that would dramatically strengthen the gender parity provisions in the bill. The party wants the names on regional party lists to alternate between those of male and female candidates, to ensure gender parity. QS also wants parties to lose 10 per cent of their public funding if they fail to meet gender parity quotas and receive a 20 per cent boost if they exceed them. The party's house leader, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, said the electoral reform bill represents a unique opportunity for the province to address the longstanding issue of under-representation of women in politics.  ""We can't let this opportunity slip through our fingers,"" he said.  The CAQ promised in the last election campaign to reform the electoral system and introduce proportional representation. If the proposal goes through, Quebec would become the first province to adopt a system of mixed proportional representation. Other provinces, including British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, have tried to introduce electoral reform. In both cases, voters opted against the proposal in referendums.

391,Anonymous,2020-01-20T23:37:32.284Z,P.E.I. Lung Association targets adults in battle against youth vaping,"The P.E.I. Lung Association has launched a new toolkit to help parents, teachers and coaches talk to young people about vaping. The association, in partnership with the Home and School Federation and Sport P.E.I., has created a toolkit with different modules for teachers, parents and families, and coaches. ""We're trying to work with adult influencers that are in the youths' lives to get this information out to them,"" said Julia Hartley, the association's co-ordinator. Hartley said the P.E.I. organization decided to target adults because Health Canada already has an anti-vaping campaign aimed at youth and because surveys had shown them that many adults have misconceptions about vaping. The toolkit covers what vaping is, why it's popular with youth and how to have a conversation about it with young people. The information was still crafted with children in mind — focus groups this fall in Charlottetown and Stratford with youth ages 12 to 14 showed they wanted to hear personal stories from other youth, which is reflected in the material. ""We were trying to meet the kids where they're at and see the kinds of issues that would resonate with them,"" Hartley said. ""Often children aren't as affected by something that might happen to them in 20 years, but when they see someone else that's their age with an issue ... resulting directly from vaping, then I think that that's something that might connect with them a little better."" Aside from the toolkit, the association is lobbying for P.E.I. to follow in the footsteps of Nova Scotia, which is banning the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and juices as of April 1.  The non-profit group Smoke Free Nova Scotia recently conducted a survey that showed 95 per cent of youth who vape in Nova Scotia said they prefer flavoured juices, and more than 48 per cent said they would quit if flavours were banned. The only types of e-cigarettes and juice that will be available in Nova Scotia after the ban comes into effect are bland and tobacco. Hartley said the association wants the same rules in P.E.I. ""These flavours are created to directly target youth and to get them vaping and ... we completely support a ban on flavouring,"" she said. In November, the P.E.I. Legislature unanimously passed a private member's bill that aims to restrict where vaping products are sold, raises the age limit on e-cigarettes and tobacco from 19 to 21 and restricts the sale of certain flavours. The Canadian Vaping Association has said banning flavoured products may protect youth from purchasing e-cigarettes and other vaping products, but limits options for adults looking to stop smoking cigarettes. The Vaping Industry Trade Association said that vaping is much less harmful than smoking, but also stresses that minors should not have access to vaping products.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/vaping-illness-alberta-first-1.5413065 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5270097/stay-away-from-e-cigarettes-doctor-warns-as-vaping-related-illness-sweeps-the-u-s-1.5270102 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-flavours-youth-campaign-1.5421165 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/juul-canada-flavoured-vaping-pods-1.5426832 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flavoured-e-cigarettes-1.5413871 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tax-hike-makes-it-pricier-to-buy-vape-products-in-b-c-1.5417863 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oleary-fire-dog-saves-owner-1.5433694 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outreach-centre-1.5433735,N/A
392,Charlene Pele and Frances D'Emilio,2020-01-17T20:52:10.829Z,Portrait found in gallery walls verified as missing Klimt masterpiece,"Art experts have confirmed that a painting discovered hidden inside an Italian art gallery's walls last month is Gustav Klimt's Portrait of a Lady, which was stolen from the gallery nearly 23 years ago. The authentication of the painting announced Friday solved one of the art world's enduring mysteries — where did the missing work end up? — but left several questions unanswered, including who had taken it and whether it ever left the museum's property.  A gardener at the Ricci Oddi modern art gallery in the northern Italian city of Piacenza was clearing away ivy last month and noticed a small panel door on a wall outside. He opened it and, inside the space, found a plastic bag containing a painting that appeared to be the missing masterpiece. ""It's with no small emotion that I can tell you the work is authentic,"" Piacenza prosecutor Ornella Chicca told reporters Friday, as two police officers stood on either side of an easel bearing the recovered painting.  Portrait of a Lady, depicts a young woman sensually glancing over her shoulder against a dreamy, moss green background. Klimt finished the painting in 1917, the year before he died. The Ricci Oddi gallery acquired it in 1925 and reported it missing in February 1997.   Since the gardener's discovery on Dec. 10, the canvas had been kept in a vault of a local branch of Italy's central bank while experts used infrared radiation and other non-invasive techniques to determine if it was the original. Experts said the painting was in remarkably good condition. One of the few signs of damage was a scratch near the edge of the canvas that may have resulted ""from a clumsy effort to remove the portrait from its frame,"" said Anna Selleri, an art restorer from the National Gallery in Bologna, Italy.  The experts who did the verification work found persuasive evidence in the work of their peers more than two decades ago.  An Italian high school student, preparing for her graduation exams in 1996, noticed striking similarities between the painting and an earlier Klimt work of a woman with a similar posture and gaze — but wearing a hat and scarf, accessories that the artist didn't include in Portrait of a Lady.  Intrigued by the observations of the student — who went on to become an art researcher herself — experts back then examined the artwork in the Piacenza gallery's collection and found that Klimt had painted it on top of an earlier portrait of a woman. Experts studying the recovered work in recent weeks, with the aid of X-rays, saw the earlier portrait. Selleri said the radiation analysis revealed that while painting the later portrait, Klimt didn't redo much of the face, but used whitish pigment from the earlier version for the skin. Portrait of a Lady was officially listed as missing on Feb. 22, 1997, but might have been snatched from a gallery wall a few days earlier, during the exhibit preparation work. So who stole the painting? Chicca said police were studying some traces of organic material on the recovered canvas in hopes they might provide leads.  Asked if authorities knew if the piece had ever left the gallery's grounds, investigators said that's something else they hope to find out.  As for why and when the painting ended up stashed behind a wall, journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor, the author of a book about the dramatic fortunes of Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, has an educated theory.  Before the 1990s, Klimt was largely ""considered an Austrian painter, but his stature really grew at this point,"" O'Connor said. When Portrait of a Lady was taken, the value of the art nouveau artist's paintings was ""soaring,"" she said.  O'Connor ventured that perhaps whoever took the painting stowed it behind the gallery's walls while waiting for news about the heist to die down but the stolen work proved ""too hot to handle.""  ""It would have been hard to sell it to a private buyer"" on the so-called grey market, O'Connor noted in a phone interview from London.  Some of Klimt's works have experienced stunning turns of fortune. O'Connor's 2012 book The Lady In Gold chronicled the ultimately successful effort by a woman to recover Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer.  That portrait was snatched from the Bloch-Bauer home in Vienna in 1941 by a Nazi officer. The woman, Bloch-Bauer's niece, later sold the painting to cosmetics mogul Ronald Lauder in 2006 for $135 million US. Another famous Klimt piece is a second portrait of the same woman, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II. Oprah Winfrey eventually purchased that painting and reportedly sold it a few years ago for $150 million.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/painting-verified-klimt-1.5430909,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/stolen-klimt-walls-1.5392094 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/climate-strikes-impeach-o-meter-fixing-democracy-spoofing-downton-abbey-nxivm-whistleblower-more-1.5297400/an-art-dealer-disappeared-with-50m-17-years-later-a-documentary-crew-found-him-1.5297422 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nazi-looted-painting-returns-to-vienna-museum-1.972466,N/A
393,Amanda Pfeffer,2020-01-23T10:11:15.898Z,Good boy alerts rescuers to suspected dognapping,"A five-month-old Australian shepherd named Vango may have had a paw in his own rescue when he alerted staff at a Gatineau, Que., pet store to his suspected dognapping. According to Yves Jodoin, a staff member and dog trainer at Au Royaume des Animaux, Vango entered the store Monday with a couple that normally came in to buy cat food. ""The dog was barking, the dog was poking and he really wanted my attention,"" Jodoin said. Jodoin said he immediately became suspicious when the couple didn't seem to know basic information about the dog — his exact age, whether he'd been sterilized, what kind of food he ate and how much they'd paid for him.   ""They were evading the questions,"" Jodoin said. ""I was giving the dog cookies, but the dog was still barking."" Meanwhile, a colleague went to check social media for reports of stolen pets, and quickly pulled up a picture of Vango. The dog had been reported missing from his home in Buckingham, Que., just two and a half hours earlier. That's when Jodoin suddenly realized he already knew the dog — he'd trained Vango as a puppy. ""At that point I said, 'Vango, come!' And the dog was reacting, he was jumping,"" Jodoin said. ""All along he was barking and poking, trying to say, 'Hello, I'm not the dog they say I am.'"" The couple claimed they'd found the dog in the woods. The woman told Jodoin she wanted to keep the dog as a support animal because she had poor health and couldn't afford to buy and train a dog. Surrounded by witnesses in the store, Jodoin convinced the couple to surrender the animal. Then he called Vango's rightful owner, Josée Francoeur. ""I can't talk about it without crying,"" Francoeur said about the moment she received Jodoin's call.  Francoeur said the dog disappeared after she let him out for a pee in her fenced yard around 9 a.m. Monday. When she stuck her head out the door, Vango, who wasn't microchipped was gone. ""Is it possible that someone took him? And I was thinking, 'Who could do that? It's impossible!""     Francoeur immediately posted a notice on the local SPCA site for missing animals, and on other social media pages. In tears, she searched her neighbourhood, asking everyone she met if they'd seen her dog. At one point, a police officer pitched in to help and wrote up an official missing dog report. She was starting to lose hope when her phone rang. ""Imagine, If those people didn't go to that pet store, I would have lost my dog forever,"" Francoeur said. She's now filed a police complaint because she wants the couple to understand the impact of their actions. ""I don't want to cause them problems. We don't know why they did it.

394,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:02:51.507Z,"Province overhauls SEED program again, announces fewer placements","The New Brunswick government is making another round of sweeping changes to its provincial student employment program in hopes of making the process more equitable for employers and employees. The Student Employment Experience Development (SEED) program will provide fewer job placements and limit employers to non-profit groups, First Nations and municipalities, the province announced Tuesday. The Progressive Conservative government is also scrapping the lottery system used to select students and allowing MLAs to recommend employers.  Trevor Holder, the minister of post-secondary education, training and labour, told reporters the program overhaul brings a greater level of fairness to the process while taking politics out of it.  Under the previous model, high school and post-secondary students entered a draw for placement vouchers and employers would then have to find a student with a voucher. Holder said that system meant some unlucky students never received a placement and it also created a disadvantage for rural employers and some non-profits that relied on students to run summer programs because there weren't enough nearby students with vouchers. ""We have heard consistently from communities, from MLAs, from stakeholders in the community that the non-profit sector was not necessarily given the attention that it had previous when, in the past, this had been strictly a non-profit, municipality program,"" Holder said. The new system, which is already in place, has employers applying to his department for SEED funding. Each MLA will be allowed to recommend 22 placements in their riding. The applications are reviewed, approved employers will be notified in March and the jobs will be posted online. Students can then apply directly to the employers. Holder said he trusts MLAs to be engaged in their districts and to understand the local needs, noting it's part of the government's ""strategy to empower MLAs."" He said each employer will be vetted and the department has the final say. ""In my view we have finally taken the politics out of it and treated every region around the province equal regardless of how the people in that area voted,"" Holder said. ""And I think this will go a long way to de-politicizing this process."" But the executive director of the New Brunswick Student Alliance said the changes are doing the exact opposite. ""I think it politicized the process,"" said KJ Conyers-Steede, adding the alliance pushed to remove MLAs from the process a few years ago.  ""We have wonderful civil servants who work within [the department] who are capable of providing insight of the services and the jobs placements."" Conyers-Steede, who said the alliance was not consulted about the changes, said provincial governments continue to tinker with programs like SEED and student financial aid, using them as a ""political football."" He said post-secondary students who are investing in the New Brunswick system ""want some predictability."" The SEED program alone has been changed three times in the last five years. Holder said the budget won't be changed, but there will be about 200 fewer placements available than the 1,400 last year. He said non-profit groups often require more than a 50 per cent subsidy — in some cases 100 per cent — meaning fewer dollars to go around with the new emphasis on non-profit employers. The minister said the subsidies aren't needed in the private sector. ""This gives us a lot more flexibility,"" Holder said. ""It allows us to focus squarely on on the priority of making sure our non-profit sector was supported here.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-changes-student-employment-1.5435534,[],N/A
395,Shaina Luck,2020-01-22T16:11:38.172Z,'Historic' change allows transgender girls to enter Eskasoni pageant,"For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, the Eskasoni First Nation's annual winter carnival pageant is open to transgender women and girls. The Eskasoni Winter Carnival has been running for decades as a fundraiser for the local Holy Family Parish. The pageant is one of the most popular events of the festival in Cape Breton. ""To have this as one of the biggest symbols of gender affirmation for people who are trans is a total success and a very historic moment, not only for Mi'kmaw people, not only for people in Eskasoni, but for transgender women and girls all across this world,"" said Geordy Marshall, who is with Pride Eskasoni. Marshall is also the communications person for the Eskasoni First Nation and sits on the organizing committee for the winter carnival. He said about two dozen participants spend a month working on things like public speaking and confidence for the pageant. They bond as friends to encourage each other and learn from elders. ""It's an opportunity for young women to learn who they are and learn from the finest women in our community to become women. It's almost like a coming-of-age type of event,"" Marshall said. So far, one transgender participant has signed up, Bella Marie Poulette. She and her sponsors decided she should wait until after the pageant to do interviews to make sure the pageant is fair for all participants and to allow her to have the same kind of experience as everyone else. ""She is excited and she's felt overwhelmed by all of this emotionally,"" Marshall said. ""She's just overfilled with joy. This is something she's dreamed of all her life to do."" The winter carnival will take place Feb. 20-23. Maryanne Junta, 19, won the title of queen in the 2016 pageant. She said she loves that transgender girls are now allowed to enter. ""Trans girls are girls and it shouldn't be any other way,"" she said. ""They should be allowed to join pageants, they should be allowed to go in the girls bathroom, because they're girls. They should be able to experience life as a girl, as they want to.""  Marshall said the community's reaction has been mixed.  ""There were people who celebrated and rejoiced on the wonderful day, but there's also a lot of people who expressed their transphobic beliefs and were totally against it,"" he said. Marshall said many transgender teens struggle with poor self-esteem, which is one reason being able to enter the pageant with other young girls is important. ""It's hard to live in a world where it's full of lateral violence and residual effects from residential schools and Indian day schools and colonization. A lot of these young girls deal with a lot of pressure in their lives,"" he said. ""This is one of the great things we get to celebrate as a community. We see all of their hard work paid off and we truly honour them on that day. Whether they're a crowned winner or not, they're all our princesses.""

The province's publicly owned utility paid Florida-based Joi Scientific $13 million, hoping for a cut of potential profits from its mysterious technology. But a pair of large-scale potential investors in Japan, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Softbank's Vision Fund, have told Joi they need to see more results before they ante up, according to Joi's CEO in a conference call with investors. On the same call, CEO Traver Kennedy also poured cold water on an apparent proposal to have Joi work with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems to power the Olympic flame at next summer's 2020 Games in Tokyo. Joi was in talks with Mitsubishi, a major Olympic sponsor, about demonstrating its technology during the event, but ""so far they have not provided us funding or stepped up to make it a reality,"" Kennedy said. The conference call took place when Joi was at what Kennedy called ""an inflection point"" — in the midst of a technological audit of their process, which is supposed to efficiently generate hydrogen energy from seawater. The audit was prompted by the company's realization that it was calculating power incorrectly and that the technology's efficiency was poor. During the call, Kennedy acknowledged results from its new calculations were ""disappointing,"" revealing what he called ""poor system efficiencies."" CBC News obtained a record of the call, which took place between mid-July and the end of August. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas said earlier this year that Joi's secret technology could create hydrogen electricity from seawater — and could actually produce more energy than what it took to power the process. One of the company's patents claimed results as high as 200 per cent.  But a former employee told CBC News that the energy output was only around 20 per cent. Last Friday, Thomas told a committee of MLAs that only one test had been at the 20 per cent level and others had better results, showing ""potential."" But he said confidentiality agreements prevented him from naming those figures. He said the numbers would have to exceed 70 per cent efficiency for the technology to be viable and they're not at that point yet. Thomas told the legislature's Crown corporations committee that several large players in Europe, North America and Asia are working with NB Power to ""scale"" the technology to commercial levels. ""There's a number of players working with us on this now, and some pretty strong players,"" he said, ""so we should be in a position in a few months to determine if we can go forward or not."" He refused to name those players. NB Power paid Joi $13 million for licensing rights to use, market and profit from the technology, hoping it would provide an alternate energy source for its Belledune generating station, which must phase out coal by 2030. So far NB Power has reported no profits from that licensing fee. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, ""told us that once we have a unit built that can demonstrate commercial opportunity, they would be interested in investing,"" Joi CEO Traver Kennedy told investors during the call. ""Until we get there, and we're not there yet, they're not interested in investing. … We need to get the technology to product stage."" Softbank's recent investment of more than $20 billion in WeWork, a shared-workplace company, has been flagged by financial analysts as risky. The company's renewable energy investments have focused on wind and solar power. Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems was still looking at Joi at the time of the conference call and visited the company's Florida offices earlier the same month, but hadn't seen enough to inject much-needed capital into the Florida company. Kennedy told shareholders that Mitsubishi Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with Joi in August 2018 but didn't commit to investing. ""Once they complete their diligence, they then will develop a commercial business plan and will decide whether or not to invest in our company."" Mitsubishi is an enthusiastic promoter of hydrogen energy, though its chief technological officer, Akimasa Muyama, warned last year that hydrogen from renewable sources would be the norm only ""in the long term,"" after technical advances brought costs down. Mitsubishi is also a major sponsor of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and during the summer conference call, Kennedy was asked whether Joi was ""still working towards powering the Olympic flame"" at those games.  ""We remain very interested in this opportunity,"" Kennedy answered. ""Not sure if it's going to be the flame, but MHPS presented the idea of participating in the Tokyo Olympics to do a demonstration along with their partners."" He said Mitsubishi officials ""still have interest in this"" and discussed it when they visited Joi's Florida labs, but did not commit any money to make it happen. Mitsubishi and Softbank have not responded to requests for comment. Kennedy told the conference call that earlier this year, Joi ""decided not to accept new investments"" when it realized there was ""uncertainty"" about its power calculations. The company launched a technical audit over the summer. Preliminary results were discouraging, forcing Joi to return to ""square one,"" a former Joi employee told CBC News. That meant ""just basic research, reading scientific articles and finding out what the best avenue is from there,"" said the former employee, who CBC News is referring to as Alex to protect their identity. According to the conference call, Joi's freeze on investment left the company with only enough cash to operate until the end of August, and the company decided to reopen itself to new investment while acknowledging its lack of a breakthrough. ""We're now seeking new funding based upon our new understanding of the system efficiency, realizing it will have a significant impact on the company's valuation,"" Kennedy said during that call. He said Joi was ""being very open and candid about where we are as a company and where we are in terms of our development of commercial product."" Company officials have refused to grant any interviews with CBC News about the state of the company and its research. Despite other large investors holding off, NB Power continues to spend $20,000 per month operating a laboratory at Joi's Florida headquarters. Thomas called that ""a minimal investment.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-investors-hydrogen-partner-joi-scientific-1.5345389,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-joi-committee-1.5344197 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-technology-update-1.5340245,N/A

The group had started a sit-in in the lobby at 11 a.m. PT at the provincial government building in the 1800-block of Blanshard Avenue on Tuesday.  The youth are supporting Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who oppose the 670-kilometre LNG pipeline project from B.C.'s northeast to Kitimat on the coast. Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands, not unceded territories.  The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against the pipeline's opponents who have set up camps close to a work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. Nigel Henri Robinson, who was at the occupation, says police showed up overnight. ""At one or two in the morning all the media was gone and that's when all the police started to come in,"" Robinson said.  Victoria police say officers worked with representatives from the protest group and the province to find a peaceful solution in the early hours of the occupation, as plainclothes community liaison officers attended and remained on scene.  When negotiations failed around 2 a.m., It says officers were requested to remove the protesters by the building owner.  The arrests took place over a four-hour period, police say, and ""the minimum amount of force was utilized to effect the arrests."" In all, 12 people were taken into custody. No charges have been laid. Sii-am Hamilton of the Nuu Chal Nulth Nation says more than half of the people participating were arrested, including the mother of one of the young protesters. ""She was only there to hold space and share medicine and songs and keep the youth that were locked down safe. She was screaming and afraid,"" Hamilton said.  A group of youth and their supporters — around 50 people in total later rallied in downtown Victoria. The protest ended just after 9 a.m. Wednesday.

Residents were left grappling with the wreckage of days of battering, including collapsed bridges, damaged railway lines and entire beaches wiped away by waves. Five people are still missing. ""I think what's important right now is that we're all united, that we work shoulder-to-shoulder and co-operate, as we are doing,"" Sánchez told reporters on Thursday. The national weather authority said the storm had begun to recede but more than 100 roads remained closed and tens of thousands of students were kept out of school. Sánchez, noting the winter storm had hit just as the area readied itself for the tourist season, said his government had called the emergency meeting on Friday in a bid to help re-establish normality, guarantee security and address short- and medium-term needs. The storm tightened its grip on parts of the peninsula on Sunday, unleashing winds of up to 144 kilometres per hour and waves up to 13.5 metres high that slammed into seafront shops, wiping out beaches and boardwalks. Near Barcelona, frothy sea foam carpeted several streets in the small town of Tossa de Mar. Hundreds of thousands were left without power as the storm covered roads in snow, flooded farmlands and poured saltwater into the Ebro Delta, swallowing thousands of hectares of rice paddies. Rescue services said they continued to search for several people missing in the storm; among two in Ibiza was a Briton, while in Mallorca, a local free diving champion who had gone out canyoning on Monday was still being sought, according to local newspaper Diario de Mallorca. Those killed by the storm ranged from a 69-year-old man pulled into the sea by a wave in Catalonia to another who died as hail pounded the greenhouse in the province of Almeria where he had been working. The prime minister said that while every meteorological phenomenon could not be attributed to climate change, it was evident it was having an impact.

399,Tom Ayers,2020-01-23T10:00:00.421Z,"As CBRM violated in-camera rules, documents show governance was 'pretty sloppy,' says prof","The Nova Scotia government is making changes to its training materials for municipalities after CBC News reported on Cape Breton regional council's in-camera practices. In 2018, Cape Breton Regional Municipality admitted it breached the Municipal Government Act by dealing with its own pay in camera four times over a period of two years. There is no penalty for breaching the Municipal Government Act, but the province now says training materials for councils are being revised to specifically forbid discussing pay behind closed doors. Those training materials are expected to be provided to CBRM as soon as possible and will be rolled out to all councils after the general municipal elections scheduled for this fall. An access-to-information request by CBC for correspondence covering the two years in which council pay was discussed in camera show some senior staff were OK with it, but does not clearly say whether any staff advised against it. ""One takeaway is that the governance of CBRM is not a well-oiled machine,"" said Tom Urbaniak, a political science professor at Cape Breton University. ""It's pretty sloppy."" In 2015, CBRM had to change its practices to start notifying the public about in-camera meetings after it was discovered council had held 31 secret meetings over a span of 22 months. The municipality was not saying ahead of time when it was meeting in camera or what was being discussed, and that is not allowed under the law. In 2018, after CBRM revealed it had been discussing council remuneration in camera, officials said they believed council could do that under rules allowing in-camera discussion on personnel matters. After CBC reported that, the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a ruling saying council members are not staff or personnel. The department said remuneration for elected officials must be discussed in open public meetings. In a recent email, the department said it provided CBRM with a training session on the Municipal Government Act — including a session on in-camera meetings — in April 2018. Departmental documents don't specifically say council pay can't be discussed in camera, but the training materials emphasize that municipal government should be conducted in public as much as possible. Urbaniak said access-to-information documents from CBRM at the time do not show whether staff, the mayor and councillors understood that. ""Even though there are ambiguities in the Municipal Government Act, the expectation is that our elected officials will err on the side of transparency,"" he said. Despite that, the documents show the municipality's chief administrative officer and clerk believed council pay could be discussed in camera. The documents also show the solicitor seemed to disagree, but they also show he deferred to the clerk on that. Urbaniak said that's interesting, but isn't as important as what council members thought. The documents show very little, if any, discussion among councillors on whether they could — or should — discuss their own pay behind closed doors. ""Councils themselves have to take responsibility for their effectiveness as governing bodies,"" Urbaniak said. ""These are elected officials and they have a public trust to uphold."" The issue was discussed briefly at a public council meeting in March 2017, when the mayor decided not to refer a discussion on remuneration to an in-camera session after senior staff disagreed on whether that was allowed. In any event, council pay was discussed in camera three times after that — twice after the April 2018 training session by the province. ""There was that one little experiment with going public and then it went back into confidential session,"" Urbaniak said. ""Unfortunately, the documents don't give us a clear indication about the sequence of events leading from that public meeting to putting this back into confidential session."" Mayor Cecil Clarke said after the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a clear ruling late in 2018 that council pay must be discussed in the open, CBRM changed its practice. ""When the department had made an indication it should be public, it quickly became public and that's the standing practice and will be going forward,"" he said. Clarke said CBRM is more open than it used to be and he said council goes beyond the requirements of the legislation, for instance, by holding public budget consultation sessions. ""Council ... as far as procedures and activities, has evolved and council will evolve because some of the complexities of issues today require to have that level of openness and transparency, and that's a good thing,"" he said.

Singh was in Ottawa Wednesday to begin a two-day planning session with his caucus before the House of Commons resumes sitting next week. He told reporters the Trudeau government won't get an easy pass from his party on the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Singh said Canadians were told in the past that Canada got the best deal possible in the initial agreement negotiated with the U.S. and Mexico, but later saw Democrats in Congress make revisions to labour rights and steel and aluminum provisions. A full debate in the House of Commons and a study at committee will ensure Canadians are getting the best deal possible, Singh said. ""There's still some ongoing concerns about the changes that were made to help protect workers and the environment,"" he said. ""I'm concerned about the enforceability, and I want to make sure we do an exhaustive debate, a study in committee, to make sure this is a good deal for Canadians."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday he wants Canada to move swiftly to formally approve North America's new, long-delayed free trade pact. His government plans to introduce a motion to apply some of its elements Jan. 27 when Parliament resumes, and will table legislation to ratify the deal two days later. Getting the deal passed in Parliament will be a priority, Trudeau said. But NDP MPs are not alone in saying they're in no hurry to ratify. Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, whose party holds third-place status in the House of Commons, said his MPs will also push for a full debate and committee hearings on the new deal. That leaves the ball in the Conservatives' court, as the Liberals need support from least one opposition party to pass any legislation in the current minority Parliament. Singh said the deal was negotiated in a ""behind closed doors, take-it-or-leave-it way"" and that Canadians have a right to fully understand all the implications of the trade pact before it's finalized. He remained on the fence about whether the NDP would ultimately support it. ""If it turns out that this is something that is going to be in the benefit of Canadians, then we'll proceed in the right manner,"" he said Wednesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-ndp-caucus-1.5435772,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-retreat-winnipeg-1.5433886 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/from-fourth-place-singh-says-he-d-rather-push-liberals-than-work-with-tories-1.5396706,N/A

Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a UN ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments. The UN Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. ""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here."" Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, not least in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Yet the convention relating to the status of refugees, signed in 1951, made no provision for climate change as a reason for people to flee their country and seek asylum elsewhere. As climate impacts grow, legal questions become more complicated. UNHCR, whose budget has risen from $1.3 billion Cdn a year in the early 1990s to $11 billion in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people. Turkey is the largest recipient, with more than 4 million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. That has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe. Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up, and he is now calling for the ""resettlement"" of up to 1 million Syrians in the north of their homeland. Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis, which has affected them since 2015, but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation. ""We must recognize that, for the past several years (Turkey)has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is 'let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-refugees-un-1.5435843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/canada-climate-refugees-1.5165029,N/A

He was speaking after the WHO held a day-long meeting of an independent panel of experts in Geneva on Wednesday. WHO defines a global emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a co-ordinated international response.  Didier Houssin, chair of the emergency committee, was asked what gave the panel pause for making a recommendation.  ""It was the question of assessment of severity and transmissibility,"" Houssin said.

Watch | Chinese city at centre of outbreak locked down Dr. Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Oxford University, said there were three criteria for an outbreak to be declared an international emergency: Deaths from China's new coronavirus virus rose to 17 on Wednesday with more than 570 cases confirmed, increasing fears of contagion. The coronavirus strain previously unknown to scientists was thought to have emerged from an animal market in the central city of Wuhan, with a case now detected as far away as the United States. Wuhan is closing its transport networks and advising citizens not to leave the city, state media reported on Thursday. Bus, subway, ferry and long-distance passenger transportation networks will be suspended from 10 a.m. local time on Jan. 23, and the airport and train stations will be closed to outgoing passengers, state TV said. Public health actions do not begin at the declaration of a public health of emergency of international concern. These actions are already well underway - <a href=""https://twitter.com/DrMikeRyan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@DrMikeRyan</a><br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronavirus</a> The official Xinhua News Agency also asked people not to leave the city without specific reasons.  Tedros commended China's decision to close transport in Wuhan, saying it helps the country contain the outbreak not only within China but also minimizes the chance of spread elsewhere.  Most of the cases are in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, but dozens of infections have popped up this week around the country as millions travel for the Lunar New Year holiday, one of the world's largest annual migrations of people.  Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one. The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said in a risk assessment that further global spread of the virus was likely. Officials said it was too early to compare the new virus with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), in terms of how lethal it might be. They attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-who-pheic-meeting-1.5436276,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5436112/anxiety-and-fear-as-china-struggles-to-contain-deadly-coronavirus-1.5436118 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,N/A

Her daughter, June Keenatch, took up the case after her mother's 2015 death and continued the fight all the way to the B.C. Supreme Court where she faced Justice Canada's lawyers.    Federal lawyers argued that her mother did not qualify for compensation because she hadn't been officially admitted at the school at the time of the assault and the federal employee was also not technically connected to a residential school — though he claimed to take children to the institutions. Justice Brenda Brown sided with Ottawa and dismissed the case in a ruling delivered on Jan. 9. ""I don't think that it was fair; there is no justice,"" said June Keenatch. Keenatch said her mother had six children and used a wheelchair for much of her life.   ""I feel like the government is pretty racist toward First Nations people, like our lives don't really matter,"" said Keenatch, who lives in Saskatoon. NDP MP Charlie Angus said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, whose department directs Justice Canada on residential school cases, should settle with the family.  Angus said the case was one of the most glaring examples of the legal tactics federal lawyers used to defeat residential school claims.  ""No one in this government has contested in any way the facts of this terrible case. Yet they denied her justice on the grounds she was raped on the way to a residential school and not on the property itself,"" said Angus, in a news conference Monday.  ""What we have seen, time and time again, is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors."" Therese Keenatch was 15 when she was picked up by a guidance counsellor employed by the department of Indian Affairs while she walked in her home community of Witchekan Lake First Nation in September 1970, according to Brown's ruling. Therese Keenatch ""knew nothing about residential schools . . . and she did not know whose idea it was for her to attend one,"" according to evidence from Keenatch's original testimony described in Brown's ruling. The guidance counsellor then stopped his car near the town of Kilwinning, Sask., and sexually assaulted her before moving on to drop her off at St. Michael's residential school at Duck Lake, about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, according to Keenatch's evidence described in the ruling.  Doug Racine, a Saskatoon lawyer with the Aboriginal Law Group, represented June Keenatch. He said the case was lost on highly technical grounds based on competing interpretations of the wording of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA). ""It is very, very frustrating,"" said Racine, who fought the case for free. ""The courts sometimes are ill-equipped to deal with the trauma and justice in the sense of doing what is right. This was a technical decision."" Therese Keenatch's claim was rejected repeatedly by the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) created by the IRSSA to provide compensation for abuse suffered at the institutions.  The B.C. Supreme Court case hinged on whether the IAP adjudicators erred in their decisions.  Brown said in her ruling that compensation could still be sought from the government through another legal channel. ""This is indeed a troubling case, and a troubling outcome,"" wrote Brown, who is a supervising judge for the IRSSA. ""But as the initial adjudicator noted, the finding that no compensation could be granted under the IAP for this very serious sexual assault in no way precluded pursuing the claim through other means.""  June Keenatch said she is done fighting. ""I just pretty much gave up,"" she said. ""This has been going on for a long time now."" Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett's office said in a statement that what happened to Therese Keenatch was ""horrific and inexcusable."" The statement said the government is committed to resolving all claims, even if they fall outside the negotiated terms of the residential schools settlement agreement. ""Minister Bennett has directed departmental officials to identify other possible means for appropriate resolution as the Government of Canada does not dispute these allegations,"" said the statement. ""Minister Bennett has also directed the department to investigate to ensure appropriate resolution of similar claims."" Angus said the Crown-Indigenous Relations minister should never have fought this case.  ""She needs to come clean with Canadian people. What does reconciliation mean in her government when they take positions like this?"" he said. Angus said the case is just another example of how federal lawyers used technical arguments to defeat residential school cases throughout the settlement process. He said a parliamentary committee needs to review how Ottawa handled the IRSSA. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said. According to the latest statistics available on the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat's website, as of Dec. 31, 2019 a total of 99 per cent of the over 38,000 claims filed have been resolved and close to 90 per cent of IAP claimants have received compensation under the IAP.

407,Anonymous,2020-01-23T17:38:16.874Z,WHO expert panel to decide whether new virus is an international emergency,"A World Health Organization (WHO) panel of experts on the new coronavirus met on Thursday to evaluate whether the outbreak, which has spread from China to several countries, constitutes an international emergency. The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the UN agency's headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday. The new coronavirus that first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan has killed 18 people and infected more than 600, most in China. But cases have been detected as far away as the Thailand. Didier Houssin, an adviser to France's national health security agency, is serving as chair. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country who are due to report back to the panel. WHO defines a global emergency as an ""extraordinary event"" that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. A news conference is expected at 1 p.m ET. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. Early this week, the agency said it expects to see more cases of the coronavirus in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago. In separate developments, three research teams are to start work on developing potential vaccines against the new coronavirus, a global coalition set up to fight diseases said on Thursday. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is co-funding the emergency projects, said the plan was to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June. The research will be conducted by the drug and vaccine developer, Moderna, working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the U.S. firm Inovio Pharma, and a team at the University of Queensland, Australia. Each of the three projects will test a distinct scientific approach to developing a preventative vaccine against the China virus, known as nCoV-2019. ""Our aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks,"" said Richard Hatchett, CEPI's chief executive. ""There are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473,https://www.cbc.ca/news/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5437217 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038,N/A
408,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-23T15:54:30.287Z,Economic ministers miss caucus meetings to attend Davos forum,"As the Liberal caucus meets on Parliament Hill Thursday to plot strategy for the return of the House of Commons, three ministers with economic portfolios are attending events at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, instead. Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains paired up with Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard, Thursday morning to announce a new centre focused on global intelligence and cybersecurity in Vancouver. Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Minister Mary Ng are also attending events in Davos through Friday. Bains' office said the government's collaboration with Mastercard started with a conversation at Davos last year. The federal government's Strategic Innovation Fund, which to date has contributed over $2 billion to companies that line up with government objectives, is contributing $49 million to the Mastercard facility. The new project is expected to support 380 full-time and 100 co-op student jobs and ""raise Canada's stature as a leader in cybersecurity,"" a news release from Bains' department said. The new centre will focus on creating technologies and standards that reduce the risk that personal and financial information could be stolen, the release continued. Mastercard's research will be done in collaboration with universities, businesses and the public sector. On Thursday morning, Morneau joined finance ministers from France and Turkey and academics from the London School of Economics and Harvard's Kennedy School for a panel discussion called ""Shaping the Global Growth Agenda."" His office said that given recent global volatility, it's his responsibility to meet with global business leaders and engage with his counterparts. ""Canada also has a good story to tell,"" his spokesperson Pierre-Olivier Herbert told CBC News. ""Our economy is strong because we've made targeted investments in Canadians while remaining fiscally responsible and we have been able to reduce inequalities that way."" Over 50 heads of state — including U.S. President Donald Trump, who gave a keynote speech Tuesday — business leaders, celebrities, and activists like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg are part of this year's forum in the Swiss resort town, which is inaccessible to the public during the event without an invitation from the WEF. Quebec Premier François Legault is among those in Davos taking meetings this week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last attended in 2018. The theme of this year's forum is ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World."" Organizers are working toward an updated ""Davos Manifesto 2020"", which is meant to serve as a scorecard for governments and corporations to measure their progress balancing ""inclusive economic growth"" and environmental protection.  One of the issues confronting leaders at this year's gathering was the effective collapse of the World Trade Organization's appellate body last month, thanks to the U.S.'s ongoing refusal to agree to the appointment of any more adjudicators to replace those whose terms have now expired and can no longer hear appeals in international trade disputes.  While other work to mediate disagreements and disputes between countries continues at the WTO, it's now without its final arbitration body, leaving many of the most contentious cases in limbo, including Canada's ongoing dispute with the U.S. over softwood lumber duties. Appearing with the WTO's Director General Roberta Azevedo Wednesday, Trump said talks would be held in Washington ""sometime next week or maybe the week after"" on how to address American concerns that the multilateral trading system isn't working properly, particularly when it comes to China's membership in the organization — concerns which in some cases began even before the Trump administration took office. Trump told a news conference that ""we're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" without making clear what he had in mind. The head of the WTO does not typically negotiate bilaterally with specific members, as it's designed for consensus decision making between members, not top-down direction. Even if the U.S. were to suddenly agree to start appointing members again, the appellate body is now without a budget and it could take a long time to re-establish. It would need a half-dozen adjudicators to return to full bench strength, as only one member's term has not expired. (Cases cannot be heard without at least three adjudicators, hence the system's breakdown.)  Ng's itinerary in Davos is focused on WTO reform, including talks with her ministerial counterparts as other countries figure out how to respond and adapt to the U.S.–China trade war. She's hosting a working dinner for the Ottawa Group, a collection of ministers from a dozen other WTO members representing diverse geographic regions, trade blocs and levels of economic development that first convened in Ottawa in 2018 under her predecessor, Jim Carr. Canada and the European Union have established an alternative way of arbitrating trade disputes between them on an interim basis while the appellate body is paralyzed, something Ng said is important for Canadian businesses engaged in international trade. ""I really think that the EU–Canada agreement serves as a model that other countries might be interested in looking at so I will be I will be doing that work while I'm here at Davos,"" she told CBC News on her way to the forum Wednesday, without being specific about which countries might be interested in signing on. Ng's Davos itinerary also includes a meeting of the Cairns Group — WTO members who are major agricultural exporters and find common cause in breaking down barriers to trade in agricultural products.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ministers-thursday-davos-1.5437266,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-poloz-1.5436058 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-caucus-retreat-parliament-1.5437299 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-holds-interest-rates-steady-1.5435927 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-north-america-1.5367819 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-urges-u-s-to-save-wto-from-chaos-1.5369843,N/A

Parasite, the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26-year-history of the SAG awards. Parasite lead actor Song Kang Ho said winning on Sunday made him think that ""maybe we haven't created such a bad movie. ""I am so honoured to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,"" he said through an interpreter. Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which both have A-list stars. The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors  form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in Joker has swept awards season. ""I am standing on the shoulders of my favourite actor — Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor  who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the  comic book villain. Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role  as a charming stunt man in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama Marriage Story. ""It was a difficult part,"" quipped Pitt of his role. ""A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,"" he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob. Sexual harassment drama Bombshell went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed. Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangster movie The Irishman had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on  Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG. Those left out include immersive World War One film 1917,  the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as  well as Joker, Marriage Story, and novel adaptation Little  Women. De Niro, whose lead performance in The Irishman has been  snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech  to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump. In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her  role as a TV anchor in The Morning Show, bringing the second  award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming  service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week. Comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and British royal drama The Crown took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But Mrs Maisel actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should  have gone to quirky British comedy Fleabag. Moments earlier, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a  year of multiple awards for her and the show. ""This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow  and find it's been just that, thank you.

Last year, Canada Goose launched project Atigi with 14 original parkas. The parkas from Atigi 2.0 were shown publicly for the first time at a media launch in New York Thursday.  ""It's unbelievable,"" said Stephanie Pitseolak, one of the designers who lives in Iqaluit. ""I can't believe my parka is there right now.""  New York isn't the only international city her parka will be on display; next week it will be making its way to France where the collection will be on display at the Canada Goose store in Paris. Pitseolak said the experience was exhausting. Canada Goose sends the seamstresses a box of materials to use for their designs. Things like fur, hollow fill insulation, zippers and Canada Goose commanders and patches with the logo. They had a month to make five identical parkas each in a different size.  Even Pitseolak was struggling. She said she couldn't give up and felt like her late grandmother was guiding her while she sewed.  ""I wanted people to know it's possible, even if you're very busy, even if you have kids, even if you're working,"" said Pitseolak.  ""I'm glad I did it and I'm happy for myself.""  The parkas will be on sale at the Canada Goose website for $2,500 each. The proceeds will go to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), a national organization that advocates for the rights and interests of Inuit in Canada.   Canada Goose donated nearly $80,000 to ITK from the sales of last year's Atigi parkas, according to ITK. Inuit land claims organizations for the four Inuit regions — Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Makivik Corporation, and Nunatsiavut Government each received $20,000.   ""We have big plans and a big vision from project Atigi,"" said Gavin Thompson, vice-president of corporate citizenship for Canada Goose. ""We are literally just getting started.""  Thompson said they want to grow the project but wouldn't reveal details of what that looks like.  ""We are just so proud of this collection,"" said Thompson.

411,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-21T19:56:05.924Z,"'If there's a fire, I'm dead': Quadruple amputee battles condo board for access to her own building","Verna Marzo says she'll never forget the embarrassment of being stuck outside her Calgary condo building — in the cold for almost two hours, waiting for someone to let her in — because as a quadruple amputee she can't open the doors on her own, and her condo board has refused to install automatic doors she can use. ""Someone helped me [get] out, but when I wanted to go back in, there was no one to open the door,"" said Marzo, 46.  ""It was cold. I called my sister but my sister was at work … so I waited until my caregiver arrived."" She says none of the other doors in the building is an option. ""That means I get stuck behind the doors. If there's an emergency … if there's a fire, I'm dead, there's no way I can get outside."" According to an advocate for people with disabilities, situations like Marzo's are ""all too common,"" because weak building codes and a lack of provincial accessibility laws are causing a ""chronic and pervasive shortage"" of accessible housing. ""Imagine that you're in a building where you paid good money to live … and you can't get in or out without having someone there,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. ""Imagine you go to sleep at night knowing — God forbid — if there's a fire, you can't let yourself out. No one would want to live that way and people with disabilities shouldn't have to live that way."" Two years ago, after having emergency abdominal surgery, Marzo contracted sepsis — a reaction to a severe blood infection that leads to organs shutting down. Doctors amputated both legs and arms to save her life. Earlier this year, she started shopping for a condo that would allow her to get around with her wheelchair or prosthetics. She says she knew the place she bought wasn't perfect, but it was one of the few she could afford. She hoped to deal with issues as they came up, but never expected to be fighting for a door.  In May, a few months after she was locked outside in the cold, she asked the building manager if automatic doors could be installed. She was told the condo board decided not at this time. Marzo's social worker tried again, contacting the board on her behalf. She was told the board already had a plan for new doors but there would be no automatic push-button system due to security concerns of the doors being open too long. That explanation is ""a total red herring,"" according to Lepofsky. ""You could design doors with optical sensors to protect against that. But even a manual door, with a lock, there's no guarantee that requires it to be held open only long enough for the person with the key to get through."" Meanwhile, Marzo remains homebound and frustrated. ""I don't want to only benefit me. I want people who have lesser mobility to benefit as well. Because it's not easy to just be staying at home and be depressed,"" she said. The property management company declined to answer Go Public's questions, claiming it was a legal matter and referring us to the condo board. Go Public made repeated requests to board members for comment; all went unanswered. Automatic doors would cost between $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the design, according to Sean Crump from Universal Access, a Calgary company that provides advice to businesses on how to make buildings more accessible. Crump says there is public funding available to qualified candidates to help pay for building modifications, though it's not clear if Marzo's building qualifies.  ""There are a few resources. The federal government has an Enabling Access Fund that allows funds to be put into accessible design for spaces and buildings — and it's done a lot of good.""  More than three million people over the age of 15 have at least one physical disability according to the most recent Statistics Canada numbers from 2017. On July 11, the Accessible Canada Act came into force. Lepofsky says it's a well intentioned effort at mandating barrier-free access, but it, too, falls short by covering only sectors within Ottawa's jurisdiction like banking, telecommunications and the federal government. He says that leaves a mish-mash of accessibility laws — or none at all — at the provincial level. Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are the only provinces with that kind of legislation. ""We need the seven provinces in Canada that don't have a provincial accessibility law to enact one — to get with the program,"" Lepofsky said. But even in those provinces, Marzo would have little or no recourse. Manitoba and Nova Scotia's legislation don't address the responsibilities of condo boards. Ontario's does, but since it was implemented in 2005, it's done little to help people with disabilities, according to a review released in January by former lieutenant governor David Onley. ""We are almost 14 years later,"" Onley, who was Canada's first lieutenant governor with a physical disability, wrote, ""and the promised accessible Ontario is nowhere in sight."" ""For most disabled persons, Ontario is not a place of opportunity but one of countless, dispiriting, soul-crushing barriers."" Changing the building codes could also help, according to Lepofsky. But, though national and provincial codes cover new buildings and major renovations, older buildings like Marzo's are under no obligation to renovate. All of this, Lepofsky says, leaves people with disabilities to deal with problems ""one battle at a time"" through human rights complaints. The national and provincial human rights codes say buildings used by the public need to be accessible.  Marzo says everywhere she turned no one could — or would — help. She says her call to the Alberta Human Rights Commission wasn't returned and the City of Calgary told her there is nothing it can do. ""They just keep [telling me] call this person or this person and eventually someone from City of Calgary called me and said they cannot force the condo board to put the door in because it's not the law."" Go Public took Marzo's situation to provincial and federal lawmakers. Watch: Verna Marzo says she's determined not to let any barriers stand in her way Jennifer Dagsvik, spokesperson for Alberta's Ministry of Community and Social Service, says the province is ""monitoring"" the new federal and existing provincial laws.  She says while Alberta lacks an accessibility law, people with disabilities can seek help under the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Ottawa's most recent minister of public services and procurement and accessibility didn't answer Go Public's questions directly. Instead Carla Qualtrough sent a general statement, referring to the Accessible Canada Act and the accessibility review board — the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO) — it created.  ""While CASDO is still in its early stages of development, it has been made evident by Canadians and members of the disability community that standards in new and existing buildings is a priority,"" Qualtrough said.  Marzo says she won't give up, saying it's ""hideous"" she's had to fight this hard to be able to enter and exit the building she lives in.  She's planning to talk to a lawyer for advice on what to do next.

Métis Nation president says national council isn't doing enough for provincial groups,"The national council that represents members of the Métis Nation says a resolution signed by three provincial Métis organizations, which calls for changes to the national body, is ignoring the real issue of Métis citizenship. The presidents of the Métis Nation-Saskatchewan, the Métis Nation of Alberta and the Métis Nation of Ontario met earlier this month to sign a resolution that called for more transparency from the national council. The three groups said they planned to establish a working group to discuss possible reforms to the national council or creation of a new structure. The resolution also asks the federal government to negotiate directly with the provincial bodies on issues of self-government, rather than through the national council. Métis Nation-Saskatchewan President Glen McCallum says the national council isn't doing enough for the provincial groups. ""What has [MNC President Clément Chartier] done to be able to engage with the five provinces?"" McCallum said, referring to the five groups that are supposed to give the national council its mandate: the Métis Nations of Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C, and the Manitoba Metis Federation. ""When was the last time you called a meeting to be able to have five governing bodies sit at the table and give you direction as to what you need to do?"" The national council says the presidents of the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario groups signed the resolution without the support of their members, and that the leaders are improperly attempting to give Métis citizenship to people in Ontario. ""In their release they have completely avoided direct discussion of the real issue of Ontario citizenship,"" the national council said in Jan. 20 press release, which it said it was issuing ""to clarify the issues and defend the descendants of the historic Métis Nation."" ""The Métis Nation is a distinct Indigenous people in Western Canada. We have always determined who our citizens are,"" the council says. In 2002, a policy called the Métis National Definition was adopted by national council members ""to ensure the Métis Nation has objectively verifiable standards and processes to identify our citizens,"" the release says.  ""By not following the Métis National Definition, Ontario is, wrongfully, purporting to grant Métis Nation citizenship to people living in eastern Ontario who are not part of the Métis Nation."" McCallum, though, says the provincial resolution is not about the national definition. ""We passed a national resolution to be able to go with what we feel is right in regards to our citizenship,"" he said. ""And that's what we follow.

Brent Crozier argued in a grievance that his treatment was too harsh when he was dismissed from his job as a senior cellarman at the Mission Hill Winery in December 2018. Crozier was fired after a spill weeks earlier that saw about 6,000 litres of Estate Sauvignon Blanc, worth an estimated $160,000, accidentally pumped down a drain after the cellarman didn't properly connect a hose between tanks. Crozier's responsibilities included moving wine between tanks and he testified the spill happened during a busy production period, but arbitrator Nicholas Glass says Crozier only had a single task that morning and a ""simple check would have revealed wine flowing freely down the drain."" Glass also took into account Crozier's admission to a larger wine loss in 2017 when 11,000 litres splashed down a drain, also because of poorly connected hoses, but Crozier kept his job after profuse apologies to management and a pledge to be more careful in future. In the decision issued late last month, Glass examined the discipline handed to other employees for various mistakes and found that Mission Hill did not single out Crozier for harsh treatment because his ""repeated negligence"" justified the company's response. ""What continues to strike me as the distinguishing factor in (Crozier's) culpable conduct is the lack of any application to his duties to the point where he did not so much make a mistake in carrying out his duties as he simply failed to carry out his duties at all,"" Glass wrote. In dismissing the grievance the arbitrator was not swayed by union arguments that Crozier offered multiple apologies and obvious remorse. ""I do not find this to be a mitigating factor of much substance, given that after the same or similar apologies and expressions of remorse in 2017, [Crozier] repeated the same disastrous error approximately 18 months later,'' said Glass.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-winery-worker-may-cry-over-spilled-wine-but-ruling-won-t-get-his-job-back-1.5436736,[],N/A

The city's new Access to Information and Protection of Personal Privacy Bylaw, passed first reading by a unanimous vote at Tuesday's meeting of council, but concerns remain. ""We need to get a better handle on costs,"" Coun. Brian McFeely told council during discussion before the vote. Adoption of such a bylaw is mandatory under the province's recently updated Municipal Act. Staff from a law firm that handles legal matters for the city gave council members a briefing on how the bylaw will work, and outlined some of the demands that could be put on staff. ""This is a significant shift, I think it's fair to say, in municipal governance in Prince Edward Island,"" said Ian McCarville, a staff member of Key-Murray Law. The complete text of the new bylaw was included in the Tuesday's briefing notes to council. One staff person at Summerside City Hall will handle access to information requests, council was told. Processing a request might require consultation with multiple departments within the city to access all relevant documents. Some names or other personal information might have to be redacted before the documents are provided to the person who requested the information. All city council minutes and financial documents, including all payments made to council members, would be accessible under the bylaw. Records of closed meetings, commercial and real estate negotiations, and matters subject to solicitor-client privilege are among the items that would not be made public. Legal staff told council it is not clear how much staff time might have to be devoted to information requests under the bylaw. The city is entitled to set a schedule of fees for access-to-information requests. Those fees are payable by the person requesting the information, and may not exceed the actual cost of performing the search. The city is also bringing in a Retention of Records Bylaw.  It stipulates how long various types of municipal documents must be retained and remain in storage before they can be destroyed. The Retention of Records Bylaw is also mandatory under the province's Municipal Act. ""It's not only Summerside. It's every municipality on the Island,"" said Mayor Basil Stewart.

415,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:00:00.981Z,"Proposed changes to Whitehorse building incentives would benefit non-profits, say planners","Whitehorse city planners want the city to eliminate building incentives for commercial developers, and focus on increasing the number of multi-unit homes, with new incentives for non-profit organizations.  They say proposed changes to the city's housing incentive program would help make building in the city more affordable for non-profits. The city created the incentive program in 2012 to help fill lots that were either vacant, underused and perhaps containing only a rundown shack, or being used for parking. Kinden Kosick, senior planner for the city, says since then, the program has helped develop 342 units in Whitehorse — from townhouse condos to commercial developments to rental units. ""We see certain types of housing getting built — for example, there's a lot of townhouses getting built in Whistle Bend and not too many apartments,"" Kosick said. ""So this is trying to target different sectors of the housing market that we don't see being built."" Those who qualify for the incentive wouldn't have to pay certain municipal developer fees (which start at $2,185), and depending on the size of the structure, they could also get a 10-year tax grant for up to $500,000.  Non-profit groups like Habitat for Humanity Yukon, which builds houses and makes them affordable for low-income families to own, would have new benefits catered to them. These include a grant for developing costs for up to $20,000, as well as deferred payment for any lot purchased from the City of Whitehorse. ""The fact is that the city owns very little land,"" said Mike Gau, director of development services for the city. ""It's the Yukon government that owns most of the vacant land in town, along with the First Nations, so they may choose to do different pricing on a lot of land. But the city's main tools are financial, zoning and planning.""

416,Kelly Crowe,2020-01-17T09:00:00.025Z,"Canada's Ebola vaccine almost didn't happen, new study reveals","A new study published this week tells a darker story about one of Canada's key scientific discoveries — the development of the world's first approved Ebola vaccine. Dalhousie University law professor Matthew Herder used Canada's Access to Information Act to obtain hundreds of documents to track the development of the vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) from the first experiments at Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory in the early 2000s through to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. The documents reveal Canadian government scientists struggling against federal funding cuts and industry indifference to push the discovery forward.  After spending five years piecing the story together, Herder said Canada's Ebola vaccine experience challenges the dogma that drug companies are the only way to commercialize academic drug discoveries.  Herder's analysis suggests that Canada's scientists did most of the technical development work — even generating hundreds of doses of manufactured vaccine — while the private sector allowed the discovery to languish. In the paper, published in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences, Herder concludes ""the private sector was not only unnecessary to its development, but also likely slowed it down."" ""We have this dogmatic reliance upon the private sector,"" Herder said. ""That is not always warranted. Our case study of this Ebola vaccine shows the public sector can and in fact does do far more in important instances."" The Ebola vaccine research had a serendipitous start in Canada more than two decades ago. German scientist Heinz Feldmann had already been studying hemorrhagic fevers when he joined the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), which had recently opened in Winnipeg. Once settled in the high security lab, he designed an experiment trying to identify the key protein that made Ebola so deadly. He didn't get the answer he expected. What he discovered instead was that the experimental mice were protected against the Ebola virus. It was the first evidence that an Ebola vaccine was possible.  At the time, the world had not yet experienced the full terror of an Ebola epidemic. That changed in 2014, when the virus ravaged West Africa, killing more than 11,000 people. Today, Congo is still struggling to control an outbreak that has killed more than 2,200 people. But in the early 2000s, the Ebola researchers in Canada had difficulty securing the funding they needed as they competed for money with other public health priorities.  Still, they managed to scrounge enough resources to conduct preliminary animal and toxicology studies as they tried to find a drug company interested in taking their promising vaccine research to market. But the documents reveal there was little commercial interest in an Ebola vaccine, especially in the years before the first major outbreak. So the scientists pushed onward, struggling to find funding and doing much of the development work normally done by industry. That included getting more than 1,000 doses of vaccine manufactured for use in human clinical trials. Herder points to that as proof that governments can, under certain circumstances, make life-saving medicines that have little commercial appeal. ""It provides evidence that a lot of that later-stage drug development or vaccine development can happen within the public sector,"" said Herder.  A small biotechnology company in Iowa called BioProtection Systems Inc., which later became NewLink Genetics, eventually stepped forward in 2006 offering to take the discovery to market. Herder said he examined a copy of the agreement between the Public Health Agency of Canada and NewLink and discovered that the company failed to deliver on commitments it made in exchange for the patent.  ""There's very little evidence in the documents that they were doing anything beyond taking part in meetings,"" Herder said. NewLink Genetics did not respond to CBC's request for comment. The documents also reveal that, by 2010, the vaccine project was at risk of being shelved due to lack of funding and the fact the lead researchers had left the NML for positions at other research institutions. ""We have evidence in the records that we obtained that the lab in Winnipeg thought seriously about stopping this work,"" Herder said. But one dedicated researcher managed to keep the project going. Judie Alimonti was a contract scientist at the NML. Despite her precarious position, she volunteered to take over the floundering Ebola vaccine file. Herder said she played a pivotal role. Without Alimonti's perseverance, the vaccine might never have been available for emergency use when Ebola ravaged West Africa in 2014. ""And so by virtue of it being ready, I'm sure she helped save lives in the middle of that epidemic."" Despite her commitment to developing the Ebola vaccine, Alimonti's contract was not renewed and she left the NML in 2015. She died of cancer two years later at age 57. Herder's research suggests that it was only after Ebola began spreading in West Africa and threatening the world that the vaccine project was treated with more urgency. ""Questions began to be raised publicly about the delay in development of a vaccine that had been shown to be 100% effective in animal models as early as 2004,"" Herder writes, citing a 2014 New York Times article with the headline: ""Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf."" Canada donated 800 doses of its experimental vaccine for use during the outbreak. The federal government also continued to provide support for the clinical trials, including a Phase 1 trial at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology in Halifax. Meanwhile, in the midst of the 2014 outbreak, NewLink transferred the Ebola vaccine patent to Merck for $50 million US. At the same time, funding for the research continued to be provided by public sector sources with more than $120 million from the Canadian and U.S. governments and the World Health Organization to support clinical trials during the epidemic, according to the paper.  Herder was unable to access the pharmaceutical industry documents, leaving him with questions about Merck's role. ""What the record does establish is that it was the public sector, not Merck, that provided all of the financing, including for clinical trials, during the West African epidemic, in addition to providing the technical expertise, human resources, and infrastructure that was necessary to carry out the trials,"" Herder writes. Merck spokesperson Elise Giasson told CBC News in an email that after acquiring the licence from NewLink in 2014, the companies ""worked together on moving it into additional Phase 1 trials as well as Phase 2/3 clinical trials."" ""Merck is proud to be part of the unprecedented global collaborations to aid in the fight against Ebola."" The vaccine, now known as Ervebo, was approved for commercial sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency over the past two months. It's a milestone that took too long, Herder suggests in his paper.  ""Instead of celebrating this milestone, our analysis raises the question as to whether [the Ebola vaccine] could have been available earlier if public laboratories had taken a different approach to the vaccine's development.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-national-microbiology-laboratory-pharmaceutical-industry-scientists-1.5429060,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-congo-outbreak-1.5201697 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-20-2019-1.5252290/canadian-made-ebola-vaccine-could-have-saved-more-lives-if-research-was-funded-earlier-microbiologist-says-1.5252292 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-relapse-congo-1.5404082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/glybera-lpld-rare-drug-orphan-disease-nrc-cbc-price-1.5312177,N/A
417,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:44:38.931Z,Trump threatens big tariffs on car imports from EU at Davos if no trade deal struck,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to impose high tariffs on imports of cars from the European Union if the bloc doesn't agree to a trade deal. Trump has previously made threats to place duties on European automobile imports, with the intent of receiving better terms in the U.S.-Europe trade relationship. Trump has delayed imposing the tariffs a number of times. ""I met with the new head of the European Commission, who's terrific. And I had a great talk. But I said, 'look, if we don't get something, I'm going to have to take action' and the action will be very high tariffs on their cars and on other things that come into our country,"" Trump told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. Former German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen succeeded Jean-Claude Juncker at the end of 2019 as the EU's top official, becoming the first woman to hold the post. The U.S. has also threatened duties of up to 100 per cent on French goods, from champagne to handbags, because of a digital services tax that Washington says harms U.S. tech companies. Trump told CNBC that the European Union had to make a deal on trade. ""They have no choice,"" Trump said. In a separate interview in Davos with Fox Business News, Trump said the tariffs on EU cars could amount to 25 per cent. ""Ultimately it will be very easy because if we can't make a deal, we'll have to put 25 per cent tariffs on their cars,"" Trump told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo in an interview. The U.S. struck a Phase 1 trade deal with China in January, soothing some of the worries which have hampered the world economy in recent times. The Phase 1 agreement eases some sanctions on China while Beijing has agreed to step up its purchases of U.S. farm products and other goods. However, many issues remain unresolved and tariffs imposed by Trump over the past couple of years remain in place. Asked if a trade pact with the United Kingdom could come next, Trump told CNBC he was ready to make a deal with Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""Boris and I are friends, and he wants to make a deal, and that's OK with me,"" he said. The U.K. is due to leave the EU at the end of January, and Johnson has stated that one of the main advantages of being outside the bloc would be the ability for the nation to negotiate its own trade deals, including with the U.S. ""We're starting. We've already started negotiating"" with the U.K., Trump said. Trump also said he expects to be able to make a trade deal with Europe, but that negotiating an agreement is in many ways tougher than the trade pact he brokered with China. ""We're going to make a deal I suspect, otherwise we'll have to do something else,"" Trump told a news conference at the WEF. Also on Wednesday, Trump vowed dramatic action with the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying the group's director general would visit Washington as soon as next week, but giving no other details. ""We're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" Trump told reporters. The WTO lost its ability to intervene in trade disputes after the United States effectively paralyzed it when two of three members exited, leaving the trade arbiter unable to issue rulings. WTO director-general Roberto Azevedo, speaking alongside Trump at the news conference, said the WTO needed serious change and that the multilateral system was not functioning properly ""If the WTO is to deliver and perform its role in today's global economy, it has to be updated,"" he said. ""We are committed to effect those changes."" Azevedo said he would discuss what needs to be changed with Trump as soon as possible, as well as with leaders from other WTO member nations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin downplayed talk that trade discussions with China will be wrapped up by this November's U.S. presidential election. Speaking at a panel at the WEF, Mnuchin said there is ""no deadline"" to the so-called Phase 2 discussions. He said there was ""no question"" that tariffs and the threat of tariffs have been a ""big incentive"" in the trade agreements. He hinted that a grand trade agreement with China may not come in one go and that there may be a series of smaller agreements. Meanwhile, Mnuchin and his U.K. counterpart Sajid Javid clashed over taxation on Wednesday in a brewing battle over how Europe taxes the world's biggest technology firms. Javid said the U.K. would press ahead with a digital service tax in April even as Mnuchin, sitting feet away on the same stage, said such a move could generate ""arbitrary"" retaliation. Several European nations are considering taxes on search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces to compensate for lost revenues, drawing the ire of the U.S. which claims that such a tax unfairly targets US firms. ""International tax issues are very complicated and take a long time to look at. If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies,"" Mnuchin told a panel. France, which considered a similar tax, agreed this week to suspend down payments for this year's digital tax after Washington threatened retaliation with tariffs on French wine. Javid said the U.K. would not back down. ""We plan to go ahead with our digital services tax in April,"" Javid said. ""It's a proportionate tax and it's deliberately designed as a temporary tax, so it will fall away once there is an international solution."" Seemingly trying to ease the tension, Mnuchin added that talks over the issue would be done in private, not on live television, and the key discussion is likely to be between Trump and Johnson. Mnuchin also said that the U.S. was ready to strike a new trade agreement with the U.K. after it leaves the European Union. ""We're very much looking forward to a new trade agreement with the U.K. That's a big priority of ours for this year."" Mnuchin jokingly added that he was disappointed that the U.K. would not do a deal with the U.S. ahead of the EU given that it would be an easier negotiating partner.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-davos-investment-impeachment-1.5434306 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/autumn-peltier-thunberg-davos-1.5435091 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/digital-tax-britain-1.4882703 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cra-tax-gap-foreign-holdings-1.4726983,N/A

419,Anonymous,2020-01-17T22:01:05.496Z,"Pay-as-you-go health care: Uninsured people in Canada face sky-high bills, delays in treatment, doctors say","In a Scarborough, Ont., clinic, a woman receives test results with news no one wants to hear: she has stage three breast cancer. But along with the prospect of chemotherapy, radiation and a mastectomy, she's also facing a bill in the thousands, because she doesn't have health insurance. CBC Radio is calling her Grace because she fears she may risk being deported if her identity is revealed. She came to Canada legally in 2001 as part of the live-in caregiver program, but lost her job — and her status — before she could complete it. ""I feel like it's ripping me apart,"" she said. ""I have to put [on] a brave face just like nothing happened."" Grace first detected a lump last August. She paid hundreds of dollars for a mammogram and ultrasound at a walk-in clinic — but without a financial guarantor, couldn't afford a biopsy to get a diagnosis. In the meantime, she was prescribed antibiotics and Tylenol for the pain. The Canadian Centre for Refugee and Immigrant Healthcare (CCIRH) agreed to do the diagnostics at no cost to Grace. The clinic's volunteer oncologist who delivered the news told White Coat, Black Art host Dr. Brian Goldman she's likely looking at treatment at a cost north of $10,000. According to a 2016 report by the Wellesley Institute, an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people live in Canada without health insurance. They could be landed immigrants living in Ontario, Quebec or B.C., which mandate a three-month waiting period before provincial health benefits kick in. They could also be temporary foreign workers who remained in Canada after their contracts ended, refugee claimants or people seeking asylum. Veteran family doctor Dr. Paul Caulford, who works at the CCRIH clinic, calls the 500,000 figure a ""conservative estimate."" ""Health equity is the issue here. As physicians … we try our best to create health equity access, to reduce the health disparities that happen within our population,"" he said. For the last 18 years, Grace has been working under the table at factory and babysitting jobs, keeping herself afloat and sending money to her family back home. She would have been able to apply for permanent residency after working for 24 months over three years in the then live-in caregiver program. But she says she lost her job and status after being ""hunted"" by her abusive husband. ""I came here looking for a greener pasture; that someday I can take my children here,"" she said. A health scare in 2012 landed her in the emergency ward. She came out with a new pacemaker and a bill in the tens of thousands. She's paid most of it out of her own pocket. ""I thought, Oh my God. Will I die of the bill, or will I die of the sickness?"" A 2013 report by the Toronto Board of Health characterized the medical charges billed to uninsured residents as ""inconsistent,"" and noted that they often don't know how much they will be charged before treatment. ""Key informants note that hospitals often bill uninsured residents at rates substantially higher than OHIP rates, resulting in exorbitant charges that they cannot afford,"" the report said. Caulford is calling on Ontario to waive the three-month wait period for OHIP coverage for people applying for immigration status in the province.  ""Ontario has an obligation under international law to ensure that all residents can effectively access essential health care services,"" the province's human rights commissioner wrote in a July 2019 letter to Health Minister Christine Elliott. Caulford also says it should be mandatory for health-care practitioners and agencies to enrol in the Interim Federal Health (IFH) program, which offers limited health coverage like dental and vision services for refugee claimants and asylum seekers. In 2012, the Conservative government made cuts to the program, but the Federal Court ruled those cuts violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Liberal government reversed the cuts in 2016, and in July 2019 announced a $283 million infusion in response to the surge of asylum claims in the last few years. Caulford says the 2012 cuts led to confusion about how IFH actually works, and that many physicians refuse to enrol as a result, even today. ""Right now, we see patients with their IFH … go to a walk-in clinic for an infection, and the walk-in clinic won't see them. They'll charge them $100 or $150 to be seen,"" he said. White Coat, Black Art reached out to Health Minister Patty Hajdu's office for comment.  The request was forwarded to the Ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, which responded in part by noting that ""publicly funded health insurance is a provincial responsibility."" In Vancouver, pediatrician Dr. Anamaria Richardson is worried about four-year-old Renata, who arrived illegally with her mother from Mexico three years ago. They met at Watari, a counselling and support service community for the city's Latin American community. Richardson says Renata is non-verbal, and may have autism spectrum disorder. Because her condition isn't life-threatening, diagnostic tests or treatment aren't available without payment, which the family cannot afford. Renata's mother, who does not speak English, told Richardson she worries that getting even routine medical care puts them at risk of being deported. ""Two years ago she needed to take Renata to a consult with a doctor, and she said it turned into just an immigration questionnaire,"" said Richardson. ""I think it's so unfair."" She says she understands why some Canadians might object to coverage for non-citizens, especially when health-care budgets are strained. But she believes capacity exists for patients like Grace and Renata. ""I understand that it is a very costly venture. However, we live in a country that has so much, and I feel like we need to at least bring light to the issue,"" she said. The CCRIH clinic operates on private donations and a small amount of money from the provincial government. ""It runs out about five months into the year ... we're going on fumes for about seven months,"" Caulford said. Doctors, nurse practitioners and other health-care providers volunteer their time to work there, donating the small government stipend they receive back to the clinic to help keep it afloat. During a visit earlier this month, Caulford says he was alarmed at how dramatically Grace's tumour has grown since the fall. ""As a physician, we see so much. [But] I just stepped backwards when I saw this thickened, inflamed, red … warm, hot mass that was eight centimetres that started out at two to three centimetres in October,"" he said. Promisingly, a CT scan funded by donations revealed that while the cancer spread to her lymph nodes, her bones, lungs and liver are clear. Caulford has reached out to several doctors about Grace's situation, and two breast surgeons have offered to waive their fees to help with treatment. He hopes to start chemotherapy soon with the donations they've gathered already and hopefully raise more — ""on a lot of faith."" But he wishes it didn't need to come to this.

420,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:54:06.649Z,What impact do private jets and celebrity lifestyles have on the fight against climate change?,"Read Story Transcript The CEO of a company that sells private jets to corporations says his clients are concerned about climate change, but ultimately they ""still have to conduct their business.""  ""We are still living in the 21st century and people do have to understand that,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of The Jet Business. ""We're not in the Stone Age, and as much as people want to be able to save the Earth, you still have to survive, you have to live, and you have to produce revenue for your shareholders.""  Despite that, Varsano told The Current's Matt Galloway that the topic of climate change is coming up ""more and more"" in his luxurious showroom in London, U.K. ""People are becoming more conscious of it and they do want to do something about it,"" he said. ""There are some companies and programs that you can easily buy carbon footprint offsets, and it's not that expensive, believe it or not.""  Carbon offsetting works by calculating the emissions generated by a flight you take, for example, then paying someone to plant enough trees to remove that carbon from the atmosphere.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that domestic and international aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of global CO2 emissions produced by people.  Varsano argued that due to the relatively small number of private jets in the world, the carbon emissions involved are quite small. But Stefan Gössling, a professor of tourism, said it could be argued that every individual emission is irrelevant, until they start to add up. ""The question is how does each and every individual in the world contribute to climate change? And that should be the point of measurement,"" said Gössling, who works at Linnaeus University in Sweden. Gössling also questioned the wisdom of carbon offsetting by planting trees, due to widescale wildfires in recent years.  ""Look at Australia, look at California. I think everybody would realize that is not a really safe way of storing carbon,"" he said. Gössling has published research exploring how the lifestyles of the rich and famous affect social attitudes to flight and travel. He tracked the movements of 10 celebrities in 2017, including Bill Gates and Paris Hilton, mining their social media to estimate their travel itineraries and associated carbon emissions. He found their flight-related emissions could be 10,000 times greater than the average person — but he thinks the problem goes further. ""The issue with the celebrities we studied in our paper is that they are obviously famous people who live specific lifestyles that they are admired for,"" he said. Fans and followers may then aspire to, or imitate, their jet-setting lifestyles, he explained. ""That becomes something that is problematic because we need the opposite. ... We need a social norm change towards people being more critical about flying and travel."" Varsano said a pre-owned jet will sell for between $10-$30 million US — depending on size — and is equipped to fly 14 passengers up to 14 hours. A new jet can sell for $100 million US.  One of his famous clients includes motivational speaker Tony Robbins, but he said the worldwide ownership of private jets is split between state-owned planes, and business jets owned by big corporations. While he understands people see private jets as luxury items, Varsano said they're also business tools, describing his product as ""a time machine."" ""You have flexibility in your schedule, you have security, you have confidentiality. So there's a lot of things that you benefit from from being in a corporate jet besides just the pure fact of being in a luxurious atmosphere,"" he said. The time that a frequent-flier executive saves — not lining up at airport security, for example — can be used to grow their business, he said.  ""There's no value you can put that, you know, in a dollar term.""

423,Anonymous,2020-01-21T10:00:00.169Z,Pairing school board vote with other elections 'not an option' for Elections P.E.I.,"The head of Elections P.E.I. says running new trustee elections online could increase turnout and save money compared with running a paper ballot election. Tim Garrity also says Elections P.E.I. doesn't currently have the capacity to run two elections at the same time, putting to rest — at least temporarily — the idea of pairing trustee elections with either a provincial or municipal election to increase turnout. The PCs promised to re-introduce elected trustees to manage P.E.I.'s education system after previous Liberal governments did away with trustee elections, and eventually the last remaining English school board in the province. MLAs on the province's standing committee on education and economic growth were recently briefed by the Public Schools Branch on efforts to re-introduce elected trustees. Education officials told MLAs it was ""not an option"" to piggyback trustee elections with another vote because Elections P.E.I. doesn't have ""the human resource or the system capacity."" Garrity said because Elections P.E.I. has never run a trustee election using its current database system, a new database would have to be created, similar to those that exist for provincial and municipal elections. Complicating the issue, he said, is the fact that trustee elections will likely end up using a different boundary system from the other elections. ""So we're currently working with our vendor on that right now to see what the possibilities and the costs around that are,"" Garrity said. ""But right now it's just not feasible for us to be able to run the two at the same time."" The recommendation to piggyback trustee elections onto either a municipal or provincial vote was put forward by P.E.I.'s Education Governance Commission as a means to increase voter turnout. But there has never been another election for English trustees since the government-commissioned report was delivered in 2012. Garrity has suggested running an online election for trustees could be easier, more cost-effective and lead to increased turnout. Under the old trustee elections, voter turnout maxed out at just under four per cent. ""There are several companies that do the online portion and they have worked with our vendor in other jurisdictions in the past and it's basically a seamless switchover,"" Garrity said.  ""They can kind of turn on an online portal and there's almost a, you know, an off-the-shelf solution that they will customize to our needs."" But P.E.I.'s Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson, one of the MLAs on the education committee who received the briefing on elected trustees, thinks government should continue to work with Elections P.E.I. to see if trustee elections can in fact be held in conjunction with a provincial election. ""I wouldn't want to shut the door on either"" option, said Hudson. But ""P.E.I. has had one of the highest turnouts for general elections of any province across the country,"" he said, suggesting that could present ""the opportunity to increase the number of ballots, the number of votes"" cast in trustee elections. The Department of Education will ultimately decide how trustee elections will be held. Public consultations around the return to elected trustees are to take place this winter, with the next elections to come in May of 2022. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elections-1.5433757,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elected-education-1.5383650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elected-1.4645716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-car-fire-bypass-sunday-1.5433379 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-winter-games-2023-update-1.5433370,N/A

Bulger and Missy were able to escape the house before it became engulfed in flames.  ""The only thing I took out is what I was wearing.""    Firefighters from O'Leary, West Point and Alberton responded to the call, and spent more than six hours working to put out the blaze.  ""It was just flames everywhere,"" Bulger said. When she returned to the house later, she said everything was destroyed. ""Everything is just, it's just a mess,"" Bulger said. ""You have to really see it, the pictures don't do it justice."" Bulger is receiving assistance from the Red Cross, including three nights at a hotel, and some money for food and clothing.  She said she's grateful for the help, but isn't sure where she'll go next.  ""I've been phoning around all morning seeing if anybody has anything to rent, and there doesn't seem anything available around here."" Bulger is thankful she managed to escape the burning house, and said if it weren't for her dog, she may not have made it out.  And as a special thanks, Missy was treated to a slice of bacon with her supper Sunday night.

""I think LGBTQ is a Liberal term. I don't talk about people that way,"" the former staffer told CTV's Power Play Wednesday night. ""Do you think that's a choice or do you think it's biological?"" asked host Evan Solomon.  ""I think it's a choice,"" responded Décarie. ""How people are behaving, it's one thing. I think government has [the] responsibility to encourage the traditional value that we have had for the past years."" I vehemently reject this message.

Giddyup, you're going to have to go through me. <a href=""https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc"">https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc</a> Décarie, who was a deputy chief of staff to former prime minister Stephen Harper from 2003 to 2005, pointed to his record voting against Canada's same-sex marriage legislation back in 2004. ""Marriage is exclusive to a man and a woman,"" he said.  A number of Conservatives who are expected to run for the leadership were quick to distance themselves — and the party — from Décarie's stance. ""Being gay is not a choice and nobody should be running for office on a platform to roll back hard-won rights,"" tweeted former cabinet minister Peter MacKay after a clip of the interview began racking up thousands of views online.  Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre, who is expected to make his bid official in the coming days, said Décarie does not speak for Conservatives.  ""Being gay is not a choice. Being ignorant is,"" he tweeted.  Erin O'Toole, another former cabinet minister who is musing a bid, called Décarie's statement ""ridiculous,"" and Sarnia MP Marilyn Gladu, who like MacKay has publicly signalled a leadership run, said it was ""unacceptable."" The party voted to end its official opposition to gay marriage in 2016, more than a decade after Canada legalized same-sex marriage. It remains to be seen how much sway the social conservative wing will have on picking a leader to replace Andrew Scheer, who had his own socially conservative leanings. Both Décarie and Ontario MP Derek Sloan, who announced his intentions to run on Wednesday, are pitching themselves to the social conservatives in the party. In the 2017 leadership race, with the help of groups like Campaign Life Coalition, former MP Brad Trost came in fourth place in a field of 14 candidates.

Earlier this week, a viewer-created group that calls itself AWAE Fan Projects spent $1,000 on five digital ""Save 'Anne with an E'"" billboards in Toronto's downtown Yonge-Dundas Square. The campaign ran four days and featured fan-created artwork depicting the heroine from Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel Anne of Green Gables, which inspired the series. Now, they're hoping to get similar digital displays in New York's Times Square. ""A lot of us are willing to wait it out and see if anything happens,"" says Lisa Elksnitis, a senior financial administrator in Toronto who is part of the fan group and helped get the billboards. ""We understand it's not something that would happen overnight. Most people are going to keep trying for several months at least."" The third and final season of Anne with an E finished airing on the CBC in late November and hit Netflix on Jan. 3. Irish-Canadian actress Amybeth McNulty starred as the Prince Edward Island orphan, who is taken in by aging siblings, played by R.H. Thomson and Geraldine James. The series was shot in P.E.I. and Ontario and was a co-production between the CBC and Netflix. While the show was inspired by the novel, Walley-Beckett and co-executive producer Miranda de Pencier added new elements, including LGBTQ and Indigenous storylines. A post on Instagram this week showed Walley-Beckett visiting one Toronto billboard, which featured an image of Anne with a tear running down her cheek beside a list of words including ""racism,"" ""feminism"" and ""gender bias."" ""They have injected modern themes and storylines into this show but in a really successful way, and that's what kept me interested in it,"" says Elksnitis. The 37-year-old Elksnitis admits she didn't initially realize the show had such depth and didn't become a huge fan until after it was cancelled. Spurred by the online uproar, she binged it online and was blown away by the production value and acting. ""I just never got into it at the time, which annoys me, because if there are others like me then maybe there would have been more viewers back then,"" Elksnitis says. Elksnitis says the AWAE Fan Projects group has about 12 members who came together on social media and whom she hasn't met in person. They hail from countries including Canada, Germany, France, Portugal and the United States. The group started two GoFundMe campaigns — one to pay for social media advertising and another for billboards. Elksnitis is now working to get digital billboards in Times Square. She says the group also sent fan letters to the producer, Northwood Entertainment, and the CBC. Elksnitis knows of another fan group that plans to send white rags to TV studios — a nod to a season 3 episode in which some Green Gables residents wave white rags at a freedom-of-speech protest. There are also fan petitions calling on Netflix to renew the show. Elksnitis hopes any new Anne incarnation would have the same cast and creative team. ""They did such an incredible job with the show, I would hate to see it fall into the wrong hands.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anne-with-an-e-fan-billboards-campaign-toronto-1.5431624,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/anne-with-an-e-no-revival-1.5388875 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/fans-anne-with-an-e-1.5373484 https://www.cbc.ca/television/anne-with-an-e-wrapping-up-1.5380904 https://www.cbc.ca/television/anne-with-an-e-production-design-1.5392243 https://www.cbc.ca/television/anne-with-an-e/go-behind-the-scenes-of-the-final-season-of-anne-with-an-e-1.5392444 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bell-family-stuck-in-philippines-1.5431468 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-gerard-gallant-vegas-golden-knights-fired-summerside-1.5431026,N/A

431,Anonymous,2020-01-21T21:33:11.500Z,WestJet flight lands safely in Ottawa after tire blowout,"Passengers on a WestJet flight from Toronto to Ottawa on Tuesday morning experienced a scare when one of the tires on their plane burst shortly after taking off. The blowout prompted the crew to initiate emergency protocols and prepare passengers for a bumpy landing, but the plane landed in Ottawa without incident. The flight took off from Toronto's Pearson International Airport at 6:39 a.m. and landed at the Ottawa International Airport at 8:06 a.m., according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Passenger Steve Wynne said he knew there was a problem when he heard a ""bang"" immediately after the plane took off from the runway. ""The plane is in the sky and then, when the wheel well closed up, it looked like a black strap hanging off a couple of feet, flapping in the wind,"" said Wynne, who was returning to Ottawa after participating in a soccer tournament in Orlando, Fla. ""Then the passenger in front of me mentioned almost at the same time, 'What the heck is that?' So I said, 'I think that's the wheel. I think the wheel's popped."" The damaged wheel was located on the left side of the plane beneath the wing, Wynne said, and was one of two attached to the retractable chassis.  WestJet confirmed in a statement to CBC Ottawa that Flight 3446, operated by WestJet Encore, sustained ""tire damage"" but that it landed normally and all 32 passengers disembarked safely. ""Out of an abundance of caution, our pilots requested the presence of emergency vehicles prior to the aircraft arrival in Ottawa,"" spokesperson Morgan Bell said. ""The safety of our guests and crew are of utmost importance."" <a href=""https://twitter.com/WestJet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@WestJet</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/yow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#yow</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoppedTire?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PoppedTire</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/EmergencyLanding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#EmergencyLanding</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GreatCrew?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GreatCrew</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CTVNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CTVNews</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCOttawa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCOttawa</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SafeLanding?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SafeLanding</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WellDeservedLandingClaps?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WellDeservedLandingClaps</a> <a href=""https://t.co/txS4uhb7xg"">pic.twitter.com/txS4uhb7xg</a> Bell said the plane was unable to taxi to the gate so passengers were unloaded and taken by bus to the terminal. The plane, a Bombardier Q-400 turboprop, was able to land safely because the damaged wheel was backed up by a second wheel. ""The Q400 is designed with two tires on each axle for redundancy,"" Bell said. ""This allows for increased reliability and additional safety barriers in an event of a tire failure like we experienced today.""  Wynne, the passenger, said that before the plane landed, the flight crew reviewed the crash routine and emergency procedures with passengers, and required them to bend down and keep their heads and arms down in front of them as the plane approached the runway. ""Everyone had their crash position,"" said Wynne. ""They just kept saying, 'Bend over, head down,' and they repeated that about 20 to 30 times."" Once the plane landed, passengers breathed a sigh of relief, Wynne said. ""The stewardess at the end said, 'Thank God, we're alive,'"" said Wynne. ""We all were thinking that, too.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/westjet-safe-tire-damage-1.5435083,[],N/A

434,Sarah Rieger,2020-01-20T12:30:00.000Z,Supervised consumption site advocates anxiously await results of provincial review,"A government appointed panel has turned in its review of Alberta's supervised consumption sites to the province, and advocates are anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of the program. That review is now being assessed by the government and funding will remain in place until a decision is made but there is no deadline set for that decision, a spokesperson for Associate Minister of Addiction and Mental Health Jason Luan confirmed. Stacey Carmichael is with Red Deer's Turning Point, a temporary harm reduction site run out of a trailer. She said the organization has been running at capacity — and a larger, permanent facility sits empty while they wait for a decision. ""For us it's particularly tricky because we're being, I guess, measured on a temporary solution and we've never had the opportunity to implement the full complement of services that we know that we need and the capacity is not meeting the demand in the community,"" she said. ""So we're leaving a lot of people underserved and that's unfortunate."" Funding for Alberta's supervised consumption sites will end March 31, and Carmichael says long-term planning and staff retention are challenges given the site's uncertain future. Red Deer's site is currently seeing upward of 165 visits each day and December was the busiest month yet, with 5,076 visits. Two other planned sites, one in Medicine Hat and a mobile unit in Calgary, are also on hold. Celeste Hayward, with the Alberta Community Council on HIV (ACCH), said the uncertainty could see some sites shut down and she fears disrupting stability for clients could impede their recovery. ""There's a lot of unknowns which make it likely that the safest way forward is to actually close their doors … while they wait for budgets to be confirmed which means no services, which means risk of life."" Hayward said it's important to remember that consumption sites don't just offer a supervised, clean location to consume illegal substances, but also wraparound services like emergency medical care, education on the harms of drug use, and referrals to other social services. Luan has been criticized for some of his comments about addiction, from saying distributing naloxone kits may enable drug use to deleting a tweet pondering if research supporting supervised consumption sites is funded by big pharma. Carmichael said she remains optimistic in Turning Point's future. ""I'm hopeful that the evidence and the research will maybe trump ideology and we can just proceed.""  The review looked at social and economic impacts of the sites but did not consider health benefits or social issues around drug use, or its efficacy in curbing addiction. The associate minister said at the time the review was announced that the scope was chosen because the evidence is already well established the facilities play a role in harm reduction but the Opposition argued that scope left out a crucial aspect of the review. A report published by ACCH last year found Alberta's supervised consumption sites have a 100 per cent success rate at reversing overdoses, and that there's been a decline in opioid-related deaths, overdoses in emergency rooms and EMS responses, all attributable to the harm-reduction strategies. The report also found savings of $5 for every dollar spent on the sites.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/supervised-consumption-site-review-alberta-1.5432665,[],N/A
435,Heidi Atter,2020-01-22T18:07:03.741Z,'People get quite upset': Sask. photographer hopes award-winning image of trapped sea turtle inspires change,"A Saskatchewan man's photograph of a turtle ensnared in a fishing line has captured international recognition and a prestigious photography prize.  Now he's hoping fellow Canadians will take note.  Shane Gross was born and raised in Regina and now lives in the Bahamas, where he works as a dive instructor.  In 2017, Gross took a photograph of a bleak situation, where a long-dead sea turtle was caught in a fishing line.  The image won first place in the conservation category of the 2019 International Ocean Art Underwater Photo Competition. Photographers from 78 countries entered images and over $85,000 in sponsor prizes have been awarded.  ""It was a beautiful day out on the ocean. We were diving one of our normal spots we call 'sea garden,'"" Gross said.  His girlfriend was leading a dive tour when they came across the turtle. She returned to the boat and was very emotional at the site, he said.  ""There were tears in her eyes,"" he said. ""She started telling me about this poor turtle that was entangled in the fishing line, which was also entangled in the coral, and turtles need to breathe air. So the turtle was so entangled that it couldn't reach the surface to breathe. And essentially the turtle drowned."" Gross decided that since there was nothing they could do for the turtle, they could remove the line and try to raise awareness.  Gross dived to the spot, removed the line to prevent others from getting caught and snapped a photograph. ""This type of thing happens in the ocean every day. We just normally don't get to see it. I mean, nobody wants to see that. But we have to because that's the truth,"" he said.  This was the eighth time Gross has entered the photography competition but it was the first year it had a conservation category.  ""This seemed like a very fitting image,"" he said. ""A category dedicated to images that show humans' impact on the oceans.""  Competition judge Scott Gietler, publisher of Underwater Photographer Guide, said in a news release that the winning images in the conservation category ""produce powerful emotion, and will influence a new generation of ocean conservation."" People who see the image have had emotional reactions, Gross said.  ""People get quite upset when they see it,"" he said. ""Which I think is a good thing because this is our fault."" Part of the image's ""emotional impact"" is it appears that the turtle's eyes have been eaten by a scavenger, Gross said. ""That dead stare right into the camera seems to strike people in a very emotional way."" People don't respond to statistics, they respond to individuals, Gross said.  ""I hope that this turtle becomes kind of a representative for the oceans as a whole,"" he said.  Climate change, plastics, over-fishing and invasive species are all altering ocean life, Gross said. He hopes his image will inspire people to rethink their own consumption habits and make some changes. ""[It's] an individual turtle that is a victim and died in a horrible way because of our negligence. I hope that it can inspire a few people to be better toward the planet,"" he said.  There's plastic everywhere in the ocean, even far from shore, Gross said. Near his home on Harbour Island in the Bahamas there is a beach he walks every day, he said.  ""[There are] flip flops and other plastic items washing up on the beach every single day. And there are people, their whole job is just cleaning that beach,"" he said. ""So tourists don't have to look at it."" ""You go to a beach that isn't being cleaned every day and it's just, you can barely see the sand because there's so much plastic in it,"" he said.  ""I'm still hopeful because there is still a lot of beauty,"" Gross said.  He said he sees live turtles, sharks, stingrays, octopuses and more, but there are fewer animals when compared to eight years ago when Gross first moved there.  Corporations and businesses will need to step up to create change, he said, and individual consumers can hold them accountable for it.  ""There's a lot of problems — but there is still hope,"" he said. ""I have to believe in hope."" See more of Shane Gross's work on Instagram.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-sea-turtle-photographer-award-image-1.5435786,[],N/A

Anne Murray's dreamy love song ""Could I Have This Dance"" won that award at the 1981 Junos, and the members of Regina-based roots-folk band the Dead South (Nate Hilts, vocals; Scott Pringle, guitar/vocals, Danny Kenyon, cello/vocals; Colton Crawford, banjo/vocals) were thrilled to put their own spin on it for their Junos 365 session. ""Growing up, my mom listened to a lot of Anne Murray, and I'm sure these guys' mothers did as well,"" said Hilts. ""And she just kicks so much butt, so we had to do it."" But first, they had to figure out their approach. ""We first started just jamming in the usual way we do, where I've got the mandolin, Nate's got the guitar,"" Pringle explained. ""But we decided this time because it was such a vocal-heavy song, that we would let Nate just focus on the vocals and I would play guitar instead, and it would be like the three of us are accompanying his vocal performance."" ""Which is hard to do with Anne Murray because she's got a beautiful voice,"" Hilts added. The Dead South is not known for taking a languid approach to its songs. The band has a reputation for instrumentation that's fast and agile, as if its members' hearts all beat in triple time, so slowing down and keeping things spare was a unique challenge. ""The idea was to just take the structure, learn it, learn the lyrics and everything and get comfortable with it, and we ended up just really liking the way it was, so [we] thought we'd try something pretty for once,"" Hilts said. ""This time we thought that it would be nice to just have a nice, steady pace all the way,"" Pringle said.

That's when her boyfriend, Newfoundland Growlers captain James Melindy, fired up his snowmobile. ""She's a good person that wanted to help out on her day off,"" he said. ""Newfoundlanders find a way."" The St. John's area was ravaged Friday by a blizzard that brought hurricane-force winds and record snowfall. On Wednesday, the city was entering its sixth day of a state of emergency. Churchill and Melindy managed to make it off their road and she got into a waiting car, which drove her to the hospital, where she works as a registered nurse on the intensive-care unit. Melindy said he knew exactly what to do when Churchill wanted to get to work. He grew up in the Goulds, where his mother was a nurse and his father often used a snowmobile to get her to work during snow storms. This storm, however, was unlike anything they've seen before. ""I'm in the Goulds so to have a Ski-Doo isn't too far out of the norm,"" Melindy said. ""We have a field so we get a lot of drifting as well. Just down the road from me was 10-, 15-foot drifts.

The Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear Victoria's case in a decision Thursday morning. As is customary, the court did not give reasons for the ruling. ""While we are disappointed that the Supreme Court of Canada will not hear the case, there are other avenues for us to achieve our goals of eliminating plastic checkout bags and reducing waste in our community,"" Mayor Lisa Helps wrote in a statement released soon after Thursday. The city's ban came in the form of a bylaw prohibiting grocery stores from offering or selling plastic bags to shoppers. Stores could still offer paper bags or reusable bags for a cost if customers asked. Councillors first approved the bylaw in December 2017. The Canadian Plastic Bag Association filed a challenge in B.C. Supreme Court within a year, claiming the city went beyond its authority to enact the ban. That court rejected the association's argument, but the B.C. Appeal Court later quashed that decision. In handing the association its first victory, the appeal court found the city's ban was based on environmental concerns — which fall under the jurisdiction of the province and the Ministry of Environment. Last September, Helps said she hoped to appeal that ruling with the Supreme Court of Canada.  Appeals to the top court are not automatic. The court only agrees to hear cases involving significant legal issues of national importance.
