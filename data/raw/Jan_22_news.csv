""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks ofÂ uncertainty and hastily calledÂ family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal FamilyÂ and spending more time in North America. In a surprisingÂ Instagram messageÂ posted at the beginning of 2020, the pairÂ called the moveÂ ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement.Â It will remain the couple'sÂ U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy,Â was the subject of scrutiny last year.Â Media reports revealed renovations to the buildingÂ â€” which cost an estimated Â£2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)Â Â â€” were coming from the Sovereign Grant,Â the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A |Â Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, MarkleÂ didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporterÂ Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there areÂ ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabinÂ would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica,Â despite guidelinesÂ that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly.Â  ""Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a non-toxic insecticide ... I thought insecticide doesn't sound non-toxic,"" Khunaysir told Go Public about the family's flight last August. Khunaysir's husband Randy Beharry and their three-year-old daughter are both asthmatic. The couple's son, who was seven months old at the time, was also on the flight. ""I was worried about my kids."" Beharry said.Â ""My asthma triggered probably within minutes. I had a hard time breathing,"" The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strictÂ rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly. ""I don't want to be inhaling this pesticide,""Â Khunaysir said.Â  More than two dozen countries, such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada. The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease. The World Health Organization has said itÂ has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended, but also says non-chemical methods need to be found.Â Â  The long-standing practice is raising concerns among some health experts. ""There is no such thing as a non-toxic pesticide,"" said researcher Chris van Netten, a professor emeritusÂ with the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health. He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides ""not acceptable"" and said airline crew membersÂ and passengers need to be better informed and protected â€”Â especially children, older travellers and those with respiratory problems.Â  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk, Ont., flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed.Â  She said people on her flight in April 2018Â were coughing and wheezing.Â  ""I think the public should have been aware ... that there is a spraying in these countries â€_ and [told] a little bit more about the chemical they're spraying,"" she said. She now takes her own mask when she's travelling to hotter countries.Â  HarleneÂ Hart from Newington, southeast of Ottawa,Â was on her way to Cuba on another SunwingÂ flight in February,Â a birthday present from her boyfriend, when the cabin was sprayedÂ with pesticide about an hour before they landed.Â  ""Insecticide should be sprayed in a well-ventilated area,"" she told Go Public in an email. ""Not a sardine can with partially reused air."" What upsets her most, she said, is that she wasn't clearlyÂ notified beforeÂ sheÂ purchased her ticket. She saidÂ she wouldn't have taken the trip if she had known. Canadian airlinesÂ are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will beÂ sprayed with insecticideÂ â€”Â despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who sayÂ the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks, skin irritations and long-term problems with the nervous system. Transport Canada saidÂ there's nothing it can do, but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose aÂ ""foreseeable hazard.""Â  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek.Â ItÂ is unverified, but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the ""top-of-descent""Â disinsection procedure, which involves spraying while passengers are on board.Â  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009Â where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get ""advice from their own physician ... on whether they should travel to those destinations."" That advisory sets guidelines â€”Â not rules â€” saying airlines should notify passengers: â€¢ Before they purchase their tickets. â€¢ On the flight ticket itself. â€¢ Before boarding the aircraft. None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods.Â  WestJetÂ points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to, and two other airlines that fly to these countries â€” Sunwing and Air Transat â€” say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask. Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airline's ""General Conditions of Carriage."" Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes.Â  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its ""Health Tips"" section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada.Â  However, passengers won't see that linkÂ if they book through third party websitesÂ likeÂ KhunaysirÂ did when she booked her Air Canada flight. Van Netten, who has studiedÂ the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides, saidÂ the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabinsÂ isn't getting through. He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better. ""People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to.""Â  The practice of fumigating an airplane's cabin started decades ago.Â It's mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects â€”Â such as malaria and yellow fever â€”Â before entering certain tropical countries.Â  Twenty-seven countries require Canadian airlines to spray. Two methods are used, according to the Transport Canada website: spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplane's interior surfaces before passengers board. ""Both of them have their problems,"" van Netten said.Â  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on, noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system. ""Tingling in the fingers for instance â€” that's how it would start. And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment ...Â but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage."" The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin, a pesticide that's beenÂ approvedÂ by the World Health Organization for what's called ""disinsection"" on flights.Â  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying.Â  ""We get reports of a sore throat, sore eyes â€_ lots of skin conditions,"" said Troy Winters, senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ""I've got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebody's hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction."" Â  He's concerned about the long-term effects of repeated exposure on airline staff, saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career. ""Recently I've started to see some reports of potential longer-term results and I'm concerned about potential long-term neurological effects.""Â  There are no industry-wide rules on what, if any, protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating.Â  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff. Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use, suggestingÂ a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated.Â  The U.S. has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket.Â  The Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization Act also recommends the U.S. government work with WHO to find a ""safe, effective, and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft."" There are non-spraying methods being developed, like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction, but they are still in the testing stages.Â  WHOÂ says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly, but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018, it said there is a need for new ""nonchemical"" methods. For now, travellers have few options â€”Â such as choosing to travel to countries that don't require spraying, travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying startsÂ and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in. Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues, they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that they'd be sprayed.Â  ""I'm really surprised that they allow this to continue,"" Khunaysir said. ""I would've had no problem saying, 'Let's change our destination, let's go somewhere else, where they don't require that.'""Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment onÂ CBC-TV, radio and the web.

It's the third restriction issued by the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board related to safety aboard the Terra Nova, about 350 kilometres off the coast of Newfoundland,Â in just over a month. The provincial oil and gas regulatory board has also ordered that all confined-space work policies and procedures be reviewed by Suncor and updated for compliance with regulatory requirements. The measures are to ensure worker safety, said a release from the C-NLOPB. On Dec. 19, Suncor was told to stop production due to defective redundant fire-water pumps on the Terra Nova. Less than two weeks later, on Dec. 29, a worker aboard the Terra Nova fell from a ladder inside a tank while conducting gas testing aboard the Terra Nova. The employee was flown to hospital after sustaining what the board called ""non-life-threatening injuries."" As Suncor submitted its review of the incident, the C-NLOPB ordered the companyÂ to implement a fall protection system for all ladders above six metres. The board's most recent order, issued Saturday, comes following the completion of its own reviewÂ of the incident, and the C-NLOPB has started an inquiry. All issued orders will remain in effect until its completion.Â  At that time, the C-NLOPB will also determine if additional enforcement action is warranted. ""Our investigation into the incident is ongoing. Once the investigation is complete, learnings will be evaluated and appropriate actions will be implemented.Â Our first priority is always the safety of our team and we're committed to taking necessary actions to keep them safe,"" a Suncor spokesperson said in an email to CBC on Monday evening.

Tuesday's announcement of the first infection in the U.S. â€”Â a man who returned to the Seattle area last week after travelling to the outbreak's epicentre in Wuhan, central China â€”Â adds to more than 400 people infected with the new coronavirus, which has sickened people in China as well as Thailand, Japan and South Korea. U.S. health officials will expand airport screening from New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles to Chicago and Atlanta. The Public Health Agency of Canada acts as the lead agency for the coronavirusÂ through the Quarantine Act. As part of the federal government's response, CanadaÂ Border Services Agency officials will ask travellers: ""Have you been in Wuhan, China in the past 14 days?"" There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. Additional signs at airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will remind passengers to speak to border officials if they have flu-like symptomsÂ such as fever and cough.  ""We are in the process of putting up signs on the electronic screens warning travellers that if they've been to an affected area to essentially determine if they've been in contact with live animals, sick people,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday on CBC's Power & Politics. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> If so, CBSA agents can alert a federal quarantine officer to do an assessment, which could include a temperature check.  ""The current assessment of the risk to Canada is low,"" Tam said.  Dr. Vanessa Allen, chief of medical microbiology at Public Health Ontario, said three potential cases in the province were investigated and ruled out. ""We were aware of the link,"" Allen said. ""Co-ordinated calls were arranged by the ministry and we discussed the cases and the three individuals more subsequently tested. So they all had, you know, some degree of a link to Wuhan with respiratory symptoms. We did in fact test in an abundance of caution."" Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory as well as provincial government labs in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have a battery of tests to detect respiratory pathogens, including one that's in the works for the new coronavirus, Allen said. Â  So far, Canada is not planning to use thermal imaging to monitor travellers en masse as was tested during the 2002-03 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS that affected nearly 8,100 people and caused 774 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.  Steven Hoffman, a law professor and director of the Global Strategy Lab at Toronto's York University,Â an expert on global health, supports Canada's screening approach so far. ""Not everyone who has a high temperature is going to have this novel coronavirus. In fact, only a very small percentage would,"" said Hoffman. It's also important that health-care systems in Canada prepare. ""There'll likely be a case in Canada at some point. But the key then is once you have cases how much are you able to contain it before it further spreads,"" Hoffman said. The first U.S. patient illustrates one of the weaknesses of airport screening â€”Â the man in his 30s did not have symptoms when he arrived and was in good condition, so he wouldn't be picked up in a check for fever. Rather, when the man started feeling ill, he went to a doctor, with a fever and cough. Lab tests confirmed the infection and he was put into isolation for monitoring. Dr. Kamran Khan,Â an infectious disease physician in Toronto, saidÂ there's a time between when people are infected and when theyÂ develop symptoms â€”Â the incubation period. For coronaviruses in general, such as those that can cause the common cold, the incubation period is typically five or six days. With coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, the incubation period can extend to two weeks. ""You can imagine if an individual is infected and they get on a plane and it could be up to two weeks before they manifest symptoms. In today's world you could literally go around the Earth before you start to develop illness,"" said Khan, founder and CEO of BlueDot, a digital health company that helps predict the spread of infectious diseases globally. ""We need to kind of think about that in the context of how airport screening works. The value of airport screening and engagement with travellers, if you will, is more about giving them the information they need so that if they do become sick after they've left the airportÂ they know what to do."" Tam called the airport measures one layer of protection on top of alerting health systems to be on the lookout for travellers who may be infected. Otherwise, health officials are stressing precautions for travellers to Â prevent the infection while in China, such as staying away from animal markets, washing hands, observing cough hygiene, not contacting sick people and tellingÂ health-care providers about their travel if flu-like symptoms occur.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,[],N/A4,Erica Johnson,2019-04-02T17:51:22.864Z,"Bell customer's 5-month fight is 1 of almost 10,000 recent complaints to telco mediator","Matthew Tomlinson spent five months trying to get Bell to give him a TV package at the price he was promised. The 47-year-old Ottawa computer analyst says a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package last June, whichÂ costÂ him an extra $50 per month. ""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. Frustrated, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the telecom mediator, the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS). His complaint is included in a mid-year report released today by the CCTS, indicating that the number of Canadians unhappy with their telco service providers continues to climb. The CCTS says it accepted 9,831 complaints between August 2018 and January 2019 â€”Â a 44 per cent increase over the same period the previous year. The biggest issues for consumers: billing disputes, misleading contract terms or non-disclosure of information and poor quality of service. ""It's unfortunate that we see the same issues on a regular, recurring basis,"" CCTSÂ commissioner Howard Maker told Go Public. He says by the time consumers have filed a complaint with his organization, they are often at their wits' end. ""It's difficult to see them all have to spend time and resources on things that maybe didn't need to have occurred, if better processes had been in place in the front end."" Ninety-twoÂ per cent of complaints to the mediator were resolved, although the CCTS could not address 6,413 other complaints beyond its mandate,Â including customer service, pricing and operating practices and policies. The country's largest service provider continued to receive a disproportionately high number of consumer complaints - Bell Canada was the subject of 3,034 complaints. Rogers received 915 complaints. For the first time, Cogeco placed third on the list, with 790 complaints, after an upgrade to its computer system led to customers losing service and being unable to contact technical support. Telus received 746 complaints, making it the fourth most-complained-about telecom provider. Freedom Mobile,Â owned by Shaw,Â expanded its service areas last year and placed fifth on the list, with 637 complaints. Customers filed the most complaints about cellphone issues (37.1 per cent), followed by problems with internet (27.8 per cent) and TV services (18.2 per cent). Canadians were only recently able to file complaints about TV services. That process wasÂ introduced into the CCTS mandate in September 2017. Tomlinson's complaint last fall said he paid an extra $50 per month after a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package.""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. ""Every time they told me that something was being fixed, it was never fixed. Every deadline or date they gave meÂ â€_ none of those deadlines were met."" Tomlinson estimates he went back to a Bell retail store more than 10 times, to try to sort out his billing issues. On top of that, he says, he spent countless hours on the phone to Bell. ""I'd go to sales and sales told me, 'No, this is a billing problem, you have to talk to billing.' So there was this really circular logic they were employing to simply keep me from being able to fix my bill."" Finally, Tomlinson complained to Bell's escalation department â€”Â but he still didn't hear back, so he filed a complaint with the CCTS. ""This is the most deplorable customer service I've ever experienced,"" he says. ""And I just didn't want it to go unchecked and unnoticed."" In an email to Go Public, Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson wrote, ""This kind of customer experience is rare, and we apologize to Mr. Tomlinson. We have provided coaching to all team members involved to ensure these kinds of mistakes are not repeated."" Gibson also noted that Bell's share of CCTS complaints ""declined more than any other service provider"" â€”Â by 2.4 per cent. Mike Polera says he filed a complaint last fall with the CCTS, after his experience trying to move his wife's cellphone from another service provider to his Rogers account. In terms of frustration, ""on a scale of oneÂ to 10, this was a 12,"" says Polera, a small business consultant based in Toronto. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Polera first contacted Rogers using a live chat agent, so he was able to save a copy of his chat and have a record of what was promised. When he went to a Rogers retail store to set up his wife's account, store reps couldn't help him and said there were no notes on his file. ""I actually had everything in writing and then found out that none of it was actually applied to my account,"" says Polera. ""It really made me angry. I felt completely taken advantage of."" In frustration, Polera took his cellphone business to another service provider. He says Rogers then charged him for services the company never delivered,Â including a $65 charge for a phone number that wasn't Polera's, and an activation fee. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'This is absolutely ridiculous',"" says Polera. ""Then I got angry."" After he wrote to the CCTS, Rogers issued him a credit for more than $350. Rogers spokesperson Sarah Schmidt told Go Public, ""We strive to deliver solutions for our customers the first time they contact us, and in this case we let Mr. Polera down. We see every customer complaint as an opportunity, and we have taken steps to ensure other customers do not experience the same situation."" A telecom watchdog says problems continue to exist in the telecom industryÂ because companies get away with treating customers poorly. ""Fundamentally, the biggest problem with our system right now is there there aren't any strong penalties in place for the telecoms when they do something wrong,"" says OpenMedia's executive director Laura Tribe. ""Clearly, going through the CCTS and having a complaint filed is not a big enough threat to the telecoms to stop this behaviour."" Recently, the CRTC issued a report calling for more measures to prevent telecom companies from using aggressive and misleading sales practices. The recommendations are the result of an eight-month public inquiry conducted by the telecom regulator,Â prompted in part by months of stories by Go Public about the pressure on telco employees to upsell and mislead customers in order to meet sales targets. Rogers employees say managers turn a blind eye The CRTC report, issued in February, said harmful sales practices ""exist in all sales channels, including in store, online, over the phone, and door to door."" Among other things, the CRTC report recommended creating a mandatory internet code of conduct that could include price protections during a contract, and requiring telcos to allow a cooling-off period after purchasing products and services. Matthew Tomlinson says he still gets angry when he thinks about the hours involved trying to rectify his Bell bill,Â and the time thousands of other Canadians are spending, in similar situations. ""We don't want to be spending all this extra time away from our children, away from work, away from vacation planning, in order to deal with a problem that ultimately, in the end, it only took about 10 minutes to fix.""

NB Power is facing an end-of-year deadline to prove the Florida startup's hydrogen technology works, or the provincial government will pull the plug on the utility's Florida lab, which costs about $20,000 a month to run. The company has claimed it has found an efficient way to generate hydrogen from seawater on demand, something that would be a major innovation. NB Power and the Regional Development Corporation spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. NB Power CEO GaÃ«tan Thomas has maintained the technology has ""potential."" ""We had independent validation and measurements, but there were parts that could not be measured,"" Thomas said at a legislature committee on Nov. 1. ""Some assumptions had been made. We're now back into an area where it's still promising but not to the same levels as we initially thought."" But according to Austin Walker, who worked at Joi Scientific as a lab technician between 2018 and 2019, the technology, or mechanism, as it was often called, is nothing new. ""They always said, 'the mechanism is doing this or that,' but there was never actually a defined mechanism,"" Walker said. ""There was always just vague theories."" The company was always keen to differentiate its technology from electrolysis, an established process that uses electricity to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen, Walker said. Electrolysis is considered wholly inefficient for power generation. But Walker said he proved to company executives that its technology is essentially just electrolysis by another name. That would make the company's claim of 200 per cent efficiency impossible, Walker said, because it would violate a law of thermodynamics that says ""you cannot create energy just kind of out of nowhere."" Walker was only 21 years old when he started at the company, fresh out of school, in the fall of 2018. Yet, he saidÂ that he was able to determine over the course of just a few months that the company's technology was nothing new. He had just finished a bachelor's degree in biology, with a minor in chemistry, at East Central University in Oklahoma when he was hired at Joi Scientific in October 2018. His job ranged from doing ""basic chemistry experiments to just learning more about the technology"" under the direction of the vice-president of science. Before his job interview,Â Walker reviewed Joi Scientific's website and its promotional materials. One marketing video, which claims that ""Joi Scientific has solved the problems that have kept hydrogen from being widely used for energy,"" caught Walker'sÂ eye because the video's claims sounded like ""perpetual motion,"" he said. ""Our patented extraction process takes a tiny amount of energy to start a chemical process, making enough hydrogen to power the process itself and generate plenty more for use in fuel cells and engines and boilers,"" the video says. Walker assumed he was the one who didn't know enough about the subject, especially since the company is based in the Space Life Sciences Center at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. ""I kind of had a healthy dose of skepticism right from the start, but it wasn't until about one or two weeks in that I really kind of was like, 'OK, yeah â€_ something's not right here,'"" Walker said. Walker said the company came up with a slideshow for investors that includes a bullet-point list of reasons why its technology was not electrolysis. CBC News has not seen that list. ""I would look at that list of things and be like, 'None of that really makes sense, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact opposite in my own experimentation,'"" Walker said. A few months into his job at Joi Scientific, Walker began testing the bullet points from the listÂ during his lunch breaks and said he was able to disprove one point in ""20 minutes at most."" In May, about two months after he began doing experiments to test the company's claims, Walker said, the company allowed him 15 minutes to present his findings at a staff meeting.Â  He said he was able to prove all but one point wrong. He also used part of his presentation to explain how electrolysis works. ""A lot of people didn't grasp the full weight of what I had said, so what I did after that is I went to people individually and kind of explained things,"" Walker said. He said these people included Robert Koeneman, the company's president and senior vice-president of technology. ""I went with Rob out to get drinks and kind of explain to him all of my thoughts in detail, to the point where I knew I had done my best to explain to him why everything was wrong,"" Walker said. On a call in midsummer, Joi Scientific told its shareholders that its technology didn't work as previously described, according to a record of the call obtained by CBC News. On that call, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy admitted the company had been calculating power incorrectly. But Kennedy didn't mention Walker's findings in May that Joi Scientific was performing electrolysis and didn't have groundbreaking technology. Walker is the second former Joi Scientific employee to raise concerns about the company's technology. He is also one of at least eight Joi Scientific employees who are no longer with the company. At its height this year, the company had about 20 employees, according to interviews with former employees and a review of LinkedIn profiles.Â  In addition to Walker, the departures included two executives who were in charge of science and engineering. NB Power declined an interview request for this story. Joi Scientific also declined an interview request. In an emailed statement, vice-president of marketing Vicky Harris said the company ""remains as committed as ever to continuing our work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" She said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. Her statement didn'tÂ elaborate on the delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. Even though there were reportedly third-party verifications of Joi Scientific's technology, Walker believes people often ""take it for granted that you know what you're talking about."" ""Those third-party companies couldn't spend a month of testing like I did to check every little thing,"" Walker said. ""They had to take some of the stuff on faith and, yeah, I think that's probably how that happened."" In addition to operating a lab in Florida in the same building as Joi Scientific, NB Power has been sending its own employees, plus some engineers from Stantec, to work with Joi's technology. A spokesperson for Stantec declined an interview request to talk about its work on the Joi Scientific project. ""We are not authorized to speak to this matter, as per our agreement with our client,""Â  StantecÂ spokesperson Ashley Warnock wrote in an email. Expense reports show at least nine NB Power employees, including Thomas, have travelled to Joi's headquarters since 2016.Â  But it's not clear whetherÂ NB Power's own testing ever flagged any of the same issues Walker found during his lunch breaks. According to an Oct. 26, 2016, briefing note from NB Power, Joi Scientific's hydrogen production system is ""consistently repeatable"" and Joi's ""methodology used to evaluate the system's production ratio is reasonable and justifiable."" ""NB Power observed input to output ratio results which exceeded 100%,"" the briefing note says. It goes on to say the test results and data were consistent with claims made by Joi Scientific and ""with previous observations made at Joi Scientific at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [in August 2016]."" It said NB Power's technical representative, an unnamed senior nuclear physicist, ""has spent approximately 24 hours of lab time with the system"" and ""has gained sufficient knowledge to understand the system's operation at a basic level and has confidence that the technology could be readily transferred to NB Power.""Â  Speaking to CBC News in May 2019, Thomas was a believer. ""We have seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,"" Thomas said. Earlier this month, Thomas acknowledged the technology hasn't reached 70 per cent efficiency but maintained it still has ""potential.""Â  Walker became frustrated after attending a meeting with shareholders in May, where he said the company didn't mention any of the problems he said he raised earlier that month. ""It just seemed like they weren't even trying to portray the actuality of the company's situation, and I just felt that was kind of unethical,"" Walker said in an interview. ""Especially when some people were talking about continuing to invest more money into their company.""Â  Thomas, who sits on Joi Scientific's board, also attended that meeting, according to Walker. Walker described the tone as positive and said shareholders heard ""vague empty promises"" that he felt the company should have known wouldn't pan out.Â  ""I thought that there was just a line that crossed for me,"" he said. Walker said he quit his job later that day. He believes NB Power needs to audit things better before putting money in and suggested the utility should have sent electrochemists to assess the Joi Scientific technology. NB Power didn't respond to a question about how many, if any, electrochemists were sent to evaluate Joi's technology before it was licensed. ""I thought that the investors and people have a right to know how much their money is being wasted, especially if it's a government-run power company like it is in New Brunswick,"" Walker said.

The Maple Ridge, B.C., native â€” just two years removed from giving up on a hockey dream â€” barely even knew the rules of baseball back then. ""I had no idea,"" Walker said Tuesday on a conference call shortly after learning he had been elected into the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. ""As I signed that contract and drove down to Florida to go to spring training and play baseball, I never knew the rules of the game or much about the game. ""You know, I [was]Â a hockey player. You grow up in Canada that's what's in your blood and veins and so baseball was something I had to learn along the way. Once I figured it all out and learned how to play and became more successful, then the road became a little bit clearer of what the possibilities were if I was able to be successful."" Walker's successes were plentiful: three batting titles, seven Gold Gloves, five all-star appearances, a National League MVP award. And soon, a plaque in Cooperstown. Walker received 76.6 per cent of the vote by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America in his 10th and final year on the ballot, narrowly surpassing the 75 per cent required for induction by just six votes. WATCH | Walker gets call to Hall: There were times he thought he might not get there, though. The 53-year-old expressed doubts in a tweet earlier in the day. ""That was just how I felt and I shared that with all honesty,"" said Walker, who had received just 54.6 per cent of the votes last year. ""And then the call comes. ... that number popped up on the phone and I think I uttered the words 'oh [expletive],' and maybe an 'oh my God' or whatever it was before I actually answered the phone and said hello. ""And just to hear them ask if they could speak to Larry Walker, and the rest was almost in disbelief to hear them say 'you didn't come up short this year, you passed the 75 per cent threshold and welcome to the Hall of Fame.'

""As the first Canadian Hall of Famer ever inducted, I couldn't be prouder and happier to welcome my friend and fellow Canadian Larry Walker to the Hall!"" Jenkins said. Walker, the 1997 NL MVP, is joined in this year's induction class by New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, who amassed 99.7 per cent of the vote. Jeter fell short of a unanimous ballot by just one vote in his first year of eligibility. The induction ceremony will be held in Cooperstown on July 26. WATCH | Larry Walker speaks toÂ The National after his election: Walker, a career .313 hitter over 17 seasons, including 10 with Colorado, said he watched this year's vote results ""religiously"" unlike in his previous nine years on the ballot. ""This year had a chance, the other years didn't,"" the former outfielder said. ""These last two weeks, three weeks... seeing what was going on and watching peoples' votes come in and just sitting there looking at it, watching the number stay around 85 [per cent]Â past 200 votes, it honestly got me interested because there was a chance. In past years that never existed."" Walker hit an eye-popping .366 with a league-best 49 homers, 46 doubles and a career-high 130 runs batted in during his MVP season. His .452 on-base percentage that year, as well as his .720 slugging, also topped the NL. Walker signed with the Expos as an amateur free agent as a 17-year-old in 1984, five years before Canadians were first eligible for the MLB draft. His shift to baseball came after Walker had been cut from a junior hockey team. WATCH | The case for Larry Walker: ""I think I would probably be missing a few more teeth, there's one thing,"" Walker said when asked how his life would be different had he stuck to hockey. ""And I don't know if the success would have been there in hockey as it turned out in baseball so there's probably a better chance that maybe I would be back home in Maple Ridge doing some kind of a job there and this kind of conversation would never be happening, honestly. ""It was a decision I made pulling into a town in British Columbia and deciding I just didn't want to do it no more... The Montreal Expos signed me and I got that chance and I just kinda rolled with it."" Walker made his MLB debut in 1989 and played six seasons with Montreal before signing a free-agent deal with Colorado.

Monday marks the firstÂ walkout by the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO), but it's actually the third time all elementary schools under theÂ Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) have closed since the job action began. Why were OCDSB elementary schools in Ottawa closed Wednesday? All 143 OCDSB elementary schoolsÂ closed last WednesdayÂ when theÂ Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF), which represents supportÂ workers who play vital roles in the day-to-day operationÂ of elementary schools, staged a walkout. An earlier OSSTF walkout closed elementary schools on Dec. 4. The latest closure is pushing some parents to their limits. Dropping her tearful four-year-old daughter off at one of the special City of Ottawa-run day camps Monday, ReshmaÂ BhimaniÂ said the strikes have disrupted their routine. ""We can't keep her home. We don't have extended families or parents who can take care of her. So, she has to go to daycare. We have to go to work."" Bhimani said she remains supportive of the teachers, but wants a quick resolution. ""We're actually reaching a saturation level now, and I think if [a walkout] does happen every week or every other week, it's going to come to a point where everybody's going to get frustrated,"" she said. ""For parents and for kids, it's important that they get back in school on a regular basis, and not having to go through this turmoil."" Other parents said their support for the teachers is beginning to wane because of the strain it's placing on both their finances and their time. ""I recently started school myself, so trying to find somebody to have my child for the day, and then having to pay that out of my pocket, being low-income, it's pretty ridiculous,"" saidÂ Amber-Lynn CÃ´tÃ©, who also left her son at a camp for the day. ""They're playing in a gym right now, so they're not getting the education that they actually need."" Other parents said as tough as it's been on their families, they're still standing staunchly behind the teachers. Tara Peel dropped her two young children off at day camp after dropping off coffee and doughnuts forÂ teachers on the picket line. ""Of course it's a bit of a challenge, a bit of a change in our routine in the morning, and the kids would much rather be at school learning, but we're grateful for the teachers for standing up and fighting for education,"" she said. ""I think the cuts that are being proposed by the Ford government will be much, much worse in the long run.""

MLAs, auditor general's office reacted to foster parents' horror stories","N.W.T. politicians are responding to criticisms launched at the territory's troubledÂ child welfare system, which foster families say is failing them and the children they care for. ""This is not going to go away,"" said Jackie Jacobson, MLA for Nunakput. On Friday,Â CBC published a letterÂ from the Foster Family Coalition of the N.W.T., which alleged child protection workers had verbally abused and, in some cases, intentionally misled foster parents about children in their care. InÂ subsequent interviews with CBC, foster parents described the department failing to take responsibility for children in their care going missing, or follow up on serious allegations of abuse. ""I know the frustrations that some [foster parents] are going through,"" said Jacobson. ""The whole system has got to be looked at."" Jacobson says he wants support for social workers, parents and families themselves who are navigating a system that is ""short staffed across the board.""Â  Everything comes down to the safety of children, said Jacobson.Â  The CBC contacted every sitting regular MLA to speak for this story.Â Members were in a budget meeting all day Friday. Kam Lake MLA Caitlin Cleveland, reflecting on the accounts from foster families this week, said in an email that it was ""very difficult to hear stories of people hurting, especially children."" Cleveland chairs the territorial government's Committee on Social Development, which will review and respond to the Foster Family Coalition's letter. ""I will continue to prioritize hearing their first-hand accounts to support the improvement of the N.W.T. foster care system,"" she wrote, thanking foster families for their trust and time. ""We need to ensure we are properly supporting social workers, birth families, and foster families to make sure we are supporting the success of our children."" The social development committee was previouslyÂ tasked with reviewing the territorial government's response to the 2018 auditor general's report, authored by Glen Wheeler. Reached for comment on the Foster Family Coalition's letter, Wheeler said if change is going to happen, it might come down to political will. The auditor general doesn't ""have the power under the legislation to force a department to do anything,"" he said. ""It's up to MLAs as the elected representatives of the people and the minister of the department â€_ to make sure the recommendations are fully implemented,"" said Wheeler. CBCÂ reports about the treatment of foster families ""resonate with what we heard [in 2018],"" he said.Â  The last auditor general's report found there were no dedicated staff to manage the delivery of foster care across the territories. The system also didn't have support for caregivers beyond a daily rate provided to families, he said.Â  Asked whether a future report would consult foster families, Wheeler said the auditor general spoke to the Foster Family Coalition in 2014 and in 2018. ""I'm sure individual foster parents had important things to say â€_ but the coalition, as a representative of the parents, was able to provide us with the perspective and information we needed to do our work,"" he said.Â  As of now, the auditor general has no plans for another audit.Â  It follows up on reviews, usually leaving a few years between reports, especially if recommendations need time to fulfil, said Wheeler. ""Given the severity of what we found in 2014 and the fact that when we went back in 2018, the situation in some ways was worse, it certainly is an area that we are going to continue to monitor,"" he said. The Auditor General of Canada has audited child and family services federally, and reviewed Yukon's delivery of child and family services. Asked whether any jurisdictionsÂ it audits are performing well,Â Wheeler said, ""if you look at other audit reports from other jurisdictions, it becomes obvious that most jurisdictions are struggling in this area."" ""It's a similar story unfortunately,""Â he said.Â  Yellowknife North MLA Rylund JohnsonÂ said people who foster children are functionally frontline workers, but ""we don't often treat them as such."" Johnson wants the department to explain which of the coalition'sÂ recommendations it will take, and for the ones it rejects, he wants them to explainÂ ""why we are not taking the suggestions from the people who are on the front lines."" He said MLAs have to support the department, and simultaneously, create policies that enable Indigenous children to stay in their communities.Â  ""At the end of the day, the state is taking Indigenous children from their homes. It's always going to be the most difficult thing we do as a government."" After the 2018 auditor general report, the territorial government increased funding to child and family services.Â  Auditor general reports, said Johnson,Â measure theÂ government on how well it follows its own policies, but not whether they are the ""right policies.""

The government's cabinet and NTI's board witnessed the signing.Â  This isn't the first time NTI and Nunavut's government have recommitted to each other. The organizations have reaffirmed their partnership twice since 1999: first in 2004 and again in 2011,Â with the Clyde River Protocol.Â  Why now? â€” NTI's president Aluki Kotierk quipped: ""It's a new decade.""Â  This time, questions focused on how the two parties are handlingÂ what has appeared to beÂ a fraught conversation on the future of education in the territory.Â  Nunavut's government is in the midst of updating the territory's Education Act and Inuit Languages Protection Act, via Bill 25. NTI had asked to have a larger role in the creation of the bill.Â  ""Certainly we have a difference of opinion, in terms of how we've worked together and whether or not it's been a partnership approach, in terms of Bill 25 specifically,"" Kotierk said.Â Â Â  One of the Katujjiqatigiinniq Protocol priorites is continuing to implement Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement, which provides Inuit the right to have a say in the government's social and cultural policies.Â  ""I think it's very interesting how the public perception might be that there are things that we're not working well on and that's where the interest often lies, but I think we have many examples where we work well together,"" Kotierk said.Â  She gave examples she was proud of, such as the tripartite agreement on health with the federal government, and issues related to poverty reduction. Nunavut's premier Joe Savikataaq added the agreement-in-principle on devolution to that list.Â  ""I think the timing is just right,""Â Savikataaq said.Â ""We have ... a new minority government, which seems to be a lot more willing to work with partners.

As Inuit areÂ the territory'sÂ majority population,Â Kotierk says, it makes sense that the two collaborate on issues.Â  Savikataaq says the two groups will continue to have disagreements, but will work through them with meaningful consultation.Â  ""The land claim spells out our obligations and this is just to reinforce our obligations and our commitments to work together for the betterment of Nunavummiut,"" Savikataaq said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nti-government-nunavut-katujjiqatigiinniq-protocol-1.5435310,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/education-act-consultations-nunavut-1.4928172 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bill-25-nunavut-education-1.5377738 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/look-ahead-north-politics-2020-1.5411682,N/A12,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:10:20.659Z,New job in green construction for former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson,"Former Vancouver mayor Gregor Robertson is lending his expertise to a Canadian company working to expand green building technology around the globe.

Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1 per cent, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft and Facebook, according to Refinitv data. Alphabet joins Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value. ""Google is a stock that won't get you fired,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn't added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. ""Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I'm not sure about that."" Alphabet's shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes. Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28 per cent climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up. Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet's exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation.

Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said. Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later. Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly sevenÂ per cent over the last six months, compared with a 10 per cent gain in the S&P 500 overall.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-trillion-dollar-company-1.5429960,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/google-alphabet-page-brin-pichai-1.5382998 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alphabet-board-investigates-sexual-misconduct-allegations-1.5353205,N/A15,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:00:00.506Z,When a CEO takes a stand: the changing world of corporate activism,"Something rare happened in the world of Canadian business this January â€” aÂ CEO took a political stance publicly. On January 12, the head of Maple Leaf Foods, Michael McCain,Â logged onto his company's corporate Twitter account andÂ criticized the Trump administration for escalating tensions with Iran. McCain tied U.S. actions toÂ the Ukrainian Airlines flight shot down over Tehran.Â  Iâ€™m Michael McCain, CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, and these are personal reflections. I am very angry, and time isnâ€™t making me less angry. A MLF colleague of mine lost his wife and family this week to a needless, irresponsible series of events in Iran... This doesn't often happen.Â Corporate entities in Canada tend to stay away from controversial topics. But it is not unheard of. Heather Reisman is the longtimeÂ CEO of Indigo Books. She spoke with Cost of Living host Paul Haavardsrud aboutÂ the times she has felt obligated to speak out.Â  Just five days after Reisman started an online petition,Â it gathered more than 70,000 names demanding that the womanÂ be set free.Â  The CEO also wrote an open letter to the president of IranÂ urging him to release Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. ""I just thought, I just can't let this one just go by. The notion that a person would be buried up to their neck in sand and stoned to death â€_ that initial impetus is what led to the decision to create a petition,"" said Reisman. Do you think there's a difference between your private self and your responsibilities as a CEO of a company?Â  No. I think your values are your values. Absolutely â€_Â if you're a different person when you're at work than you are when you're at home or when you're on a walk thinking about what you care about, then who are you? What do you think it is that holds a company back? If you take a position on something that is considered controversial,Â there's always the possibility that there could be some falloutÂ that you have to navigate. For me to speak out about the importance of literacy and the fact that we are implicitly or explicitly ignoring that we are holding aÂ whole segment of kids back from attaining rich literacy, it's not very controversial â€_ people may not be aware but that's not a big risk.Â Â You're gonna get a gold star for that and you're not going to risk a lot. It's [riskier] when you make a statement that could â€_ cause some customers to say well, we don't like that position,Â or even some employees. I believe, over time, your employees most value a CEO whose values are clear and strong and who does not depress those values if there is a business issue. In fact, the opposite. I think your employees most respect a CEO whose values are clear, who they align with, and who they can feel confident that all of the decisions of the company will be consistent with those values.

Facial recognition app used by police raises serious concerns, say privacy advocates","Read Story Transcript A secretive facial recognition softwareÂ used by hundreds of police forces is raising concerns after a New York Times investigationÂ said it could ""end privacy as we know it."" Clearview A.I. has extracted more than threeÂ billion photos from public web sites like Facebook, Instagram, employment sites and others, and used them to create a databaseÂ used by more than 600 law enforcement agencies in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere, according toÂ Times reporter Kashmir Hill. ""It is being used to solve many murder cases, identity fraud cases, child exploitation cases,"" Hill told The Current's host Matt Galloway.Â  Police officers who spoke to Hill saidÂ the app was a far more powerful tool for cracking cases than any government database they had used before.Â The company claims their software finds a match in three out of four cases. The software is so effective, Hill said, that even when she covered her face and mouth for a photo, it still pulled up seven images of her. ""I was just shocked at how well this face recognition algorithm works,"" she said. Hill said investors and police officers she interviewed expect this software, or another similar technology, to be available to the public within the next five years. ""If you were in a restaurant having a sensitive conversation about family secrets or work secrets, a stranger next to you could snap your photo and know who you are, and understand that conversation in context,"" she said. ""You can imagine stalkers using this tool â€” just really malicious use cases."" The potential uses for this kind of software isÂ ringing alarm bellsÂ for privacy advocates. ""What you lose, if this technology gets out into the wild, is the possibility of any anonymity in public ever. That's something that we need to think about,"" said Brenda McPhail, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association'sÂ Privacy Technology and Surveillance Project. McPhail said this kind of facial recognition technology could also make it easier for governments to monitor protesters. ""It's a threat to the fundamental freedoms that we value in a democracy,"" she said. When Hill started looking into Clearview, she initially came up against a lot of dead ends. Its website was only accessible to law enforcement, and their listed New York address led her to a building that didn't exist. For a long time, the company declined to speak to her. But they did find her. While interviewing police officers about the app, she would ask them to scan a photo of her, to see how the software worked.Â  ""The police officers would then get a call from the company saying, 'Are you talking to the media?' So they were actually tracking who was talking to me while they weren't talking to me,"" she said.Â  ""So I found that a bit disturbing."" Clearview was founded by Hoan Ton-That, an Australian techie and onetime model, and Richard Schwartz, a former aide to Rudy Giuliani when Giuliani was mayor of New York. It is backed by Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook and Palantir. <a href=""https://t.co/ALE12Z0LkH"">pic.twitter.com/ALE12Z0LkH</a> Hill said that Clearview's secrecy, and their willingness to use their software to track a reporter, raised concerns about police departments' willingness to share sensitive information about suspects and victims with the little-known company. ""Most of the departments had done no vetting of them â€_ and the company has this vast database of everyone that the police department is interested in,"" she said. McPhail said she was also concerned by allegations in Hill's storyÂ that Canadian police forces are using Clearview A.I.'s software.Â  ""The way the data is collected is probably against Canadian law,"" said McPhail. ""We've got law enforcement agencies using it without confirming thatÂ the use of the tool is compliant with Canadian law. That's a big problem."" Hill interviewed Canadian police officers about the app on condition of anonymity, so The Current reached out to several police forces across the country. The Vancouver Police Department said it has never used the software and hasÂ no intention of doing so. The Toronto Police Service says it does use facial recognition, but not through Clearview A.I. Ontario Provincial Police say they have used facial recognition technology, but wouldn't specify which products they use.  ""Generally, the RCMP does not comment on specific investigative tools or techniques,"" an RCMP representative said in a statement. The Current also requested comment from Clearview A.I. but did not receive a response. Michael Arntfield, a Canadian criminologist and former police officer,Â believes concerns about the technology are overblown. ""The upsides far outweigh the downsides and are in the public interest, quite frankly,"" he said. He believes the amount of information Clearview can glean from even billions of images pales in comparison to the ""troves""Â of personal data gathered and sold to advertisers by companies like Google and Facebook.Â  ""We're deluding ourselves if we think that we have any privacy whatsoever,"" he said. ""Now we can actually use this [technology] for a productive purpose, for a public safety purpose â€_ why is the alarm being sounded now?"" Written by Allie Jaynes.

The train shortageÂ led to slight delays and longer waits on crowded platforms for this afternoon's commute. O-Train Line 1: The afternoon peak has ended. We are sorry for the higher than normal crowds and longer wait times earlier due to a shortage of trains. The Confederation Line had 13 workingÂ trains available when it launched Sept. 14. But a CBCÂ source said only 11 double trains went into service Friday and Monday mornings. In a statement sent shortly before 3:30 p.m., OC Transpo'sÂ general manager John ManconiÂ confirmed that 11 trains were in operation during the morning commute. He wrote thatÂ two more were taken out of service this morning due to technical issuesÂ â€” a compressor fault and a wheel issue. Manconi said Rideau Transit MaintenanceÂ advised the city that it would be running 10 trains ""instead of the required 13"" this afternoon and evening. Trains would operateÂ approximately every five minutes during the afternoon peak, leading to wait times a minute longer than usual, Manconi said. This is the first time OC Transpo has blamed delays on a trainÂ shortage. One train was sent to the service garage for repairs on ThursdayÂ afterÂ its overhead power line ""snagged"" as it entered St-Laurent station. On Monday morning, OC TranspoÂ tweeted about a mechanical issue on a train during a morning peak that caused delays, crowdingÂ and the closure of a platform at Tunney's Pasture. Monday's issues are the fifth and sixth announced by OC TranspoÂ on the Confederation LineÂ over the last five days, and eighth and ninth so far this month. Initially, OC Transpo planned to run 15 double trains during morning and afternoon peaks, plus another two kept aside as spares. That number was eventually reduced to 13 trains on the trackÂ at rush hour.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/oc-transpo-train-shortage-delays-1.5432729,[],N/A18,Erica Johnson,2019-04-29T16:46:41.471Z,'I had to crawl': Amputee seeks damages after United Airlines and airport security seize scooter batteries,"Stearn Hodge says he will never forget the humiliation of having to drag his body across a hotel roomÂ floor during what was supposed to be a vacation celebrating hisÂ 43rdÂ wedding anniversary â€” because a security agent at the Calgary International Airport and United Airlines confiscated the batteries he needed to operate a portable scooter. ""Having to crawl across the floor in front of my wife is the most humiliating thing that I can think of,"" said Hodge. ""It unmasks how real my disability is â€_Â I haven't been the same since."" The 68-year-old retired contractor from Kelowna, B.C.,Â lost his left arm and right leg in a 1984 workplace accident.Â He now relies on a portable scooter powered by lithium batteries. But on aÂ trip to Tulsa, Okla., onÂ Feb. 26, 2017, an agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and aÂ United Airlines official toldÂ HodgeÂ to remove the $2,000 battery from his scooter and fly without it, as well as hisÂ spare battery. In making the demand, bothÂ employees cited safety concerns. Stearn Hodge shows how he hadÂ to crawl when he didn't have his mobility scooter: Lithium-ion batteries are a potential fire hazard, but global standards issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA)Â allow people with disabilities to travel with compact lithium batteries for medical devices in carry-on luggage. Hodge said no one from CATSA or United Airlines would listen to himÂ or read IATA documents he had printed out, showing his batteries are permitted on board if an airline gives prior approval.Â Hodge had received that permission. ""They're taking my legsÂ â€”Â and not only that, my dignity,"" saidÂ Hodge.Â  He can only wear a prosthetic leg for a short period due to discomfort and risk of infection, he said. A few months earlier, Hodge almost had his batteries seized on a WestJet flight.Â But ""seconds"" before takeoff â€” and after he suffered a panic attack â€”Â HodgeÂ was granted permission to take them onÂ board. He hasÂ now hired a lawyer and is fighting to have his case heard before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A spokesperson for an Ottawa-based disability rights organization says it's ""frustrating"" that Canada's airline industry seems to ignore hard-won protections for people with disabilities. ""It's been a long fight to make sure that mobility devices â€” or any device used to accommodate a person with a disability â€” can be carried on [a plane],"" said Terrance Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. ""When security can â€” even with regulations in place â€” seize what otherwise should be able to go onto the aircraft, that leaves people with disabilities very vulnerable."" When the CATSA agent seized his batteries in Calgary, theÂ employee suggested it wasn't a big deal, Hodge said. ""I still remember the CATSA agent saying, 'Well, you could get a wheelchair.' How's a one-armed guy going to run a wheelchair?"" asked Hodge. ""How am I going to go down a ramp and brake with one hand? But that shouldn't even have to come up."" Hodge's wife had recently undergone cancer treatment, which affected her spine,Â and she couldn't push a wheelchair for her husband. HodgeÂ said he asked for an agent from United Airlines to come to the security checkpoint, as he had called the airline earlier and wasÂ assured it was OKÂ to bring his battery and a spare on board. But the United Airlines employeeÂ that arrived sided with the security agent. Consequently, a three-week trip that was supposed to be a celebrationÂ with his wife resulted in Hodge spending much of his vacation confined to his bed. To perform basic personal hygiene, he was forced to drag himself across the hotel room floor to the bathroom. ""An anniversary is supposed to be all about remembering how you fell in love â€_ and keeping that magic alive,"" said Hodge. ""And those things were denied. I'm crawling across the floor and it is pathetic."" A United Airlines spokesperson told Go Public that it couldn't comment on Hodge's experience, as he wants his case heard by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In an email sent to Hodge by the airline, complaint resolution official Tatricia Orija wrote that ""it appears we were in violation of federal disability requirements,"" offeringÂ both Hodge and his wife an $800 travel certificate. She also apologized for the ""inconvenience."" ""Inconvenience is when it rains on your holiday,"" said Hodge. ""This was aÂ â€_Â life-changing moment for me and my wife."" Three months before the United incident,Â on Nov. 27, 2016,Â HodgeÂ had also run into battery problems while travelling to Cancun, Mexico. In that case, a WestJet employee initially told him he could take the batteries in a carry-on, but when he got to the security checkpoint, a CATSA agent said the batteries had to be in checked luggage. ""According to federal airline law, that's the worst place you want to put them,"" said Hodge. ""Because if a problem develops with those batteries, they don't know where they are and they're only going to find out about it when it's too late."" Minutes before his departure, a WestJet employee was able to confirm that the batteries could go on the plane. In an email to Hodge, a WestJet customer support agent wrote:Â ""While I cannot change your past experience, I would like to offer you a $350 future travel credit as a goodwill gesture."" WestJetÂ spokesperson Morgan Bell told Go PublicÂ heÂ couldn't comment on the case since it is before the courtsÂ but thatÂ ""WestJet will always err on the side of caution and supports the due diligence of its people evaluating any items they believe may pose a safety concern.""Â  CATSA alsoÂ wouldn't address questions from Go Public, citing Hodge's complaint. The agency did provide Hodge with a transcript of a recorded call with client service agent Justine Drouin, who apologizes to Hodge and says ""all of the screening officers will undergo a briefing."" Hodge and his wife travel at least once or twice a year and say the only place they run into trouble with his scooter batteriesÂ is in Canada. ""I have flown through Europe, the United States and Mexico since 2015 with these batteries and have never been detained or harassed because of them. It is only in Canada that I have been relentlessly detained,"" said Hodge.Â  He estimatesÂ it's happened more than a dozen times in the past two years, sayingÂ it now triggers severe anxiety. ""When I go through the checkpoint, I'm starting to vibrate now. I don't know what I'm going to get. It's like playing Russian roulette."" Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, said while he's pleased there are protections in place for people with disabilities who are travelling,Â those protections need to be enforced. ""This is an assault on a person's dignity,"" said Green, notingÂ his organization has been fighting over transportation issues for four decades. ""In 1979, the government of the day said, 'Yes, we will make our transportation system accessible,'"" he said.Â ""Here we areÂ â€_ 40 years later and the same barriers are there in transportation for Canadians with disabilities."" Green, who is visually impaired, saidÂ he has had security agents question the battery in his laptop, which allows it to ""talk"" when it is turned on. He said he receives ""a lot of emails and telephone calls"" fromÂ people with disabilities who have been hassled at the airport. ""It happens very, very frequently,"" said Green. ""You put in complaints, the first thing that happens is the airlines deny."" Go Public asked the Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulates air, rail and marine travel,Â how often people have filed disability-related complaints over the past three years. A spokesperson said the agency has received 583 accessibility complaints related to air travel during that time â€” with fewer than one per cent related to batteries.Â And thoseÂ numbers have steadily increased since 2016. The majority of complaints related to the transport of mobility aids are from passengers who have hadÂ expensive mobility devices â€” scooters and wheelchairs â€” damaged. Â  Last September, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Hodge's complaint to theÂ Canadian Transportation Agency. However, the agency has no power to award general damages beyond out-of-pocket expenses.Â  On May 9, Hodge's lawyer, John Burns, will ask a Federal Court judge to compel the commission to hear the case. ""It's a failure of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to grant access to the remedy that the statute provides,"" said Burns. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows for up to $20,000 in damages for each count of pain and suffering, and up to another $20,000 if the discrimination is ""willful or reckless."" ""It sends a very clear message to the airlinesÂ and everybody else involved,"" said Burns. ""People with disabilities should be taken seriously. You don't take away somebody's legs and then describe it as an inconvenience. No, this is an injury."" Hodge is optimistic he'll eventually have his day before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It's a pricey endeavour. In order to cover legal costs, he's had to put up for sale a cherished Corvette he has worked on for years.Â But it's a fight he says he has to haveÂ â€”Â not just for himself, but for so many othersÂ with disabilities. ""The thing I would love more than the compensation,"" said Hodge, ""is the [legal] decision that someone can go to and say, 'You did it here, you can do it for me.'""

That banner had one word spray painted on it: Boogerville. It was an homage to the team's up-and-coming right fielder, a Canadian by the name of Larry Walker. HisÂ nickname was Booger. The founding citizens of Boogerville were Pastor John Kehoe, his wife Ellen and their three children, who used to regularly make the 55-minute drive to the Olympic Stadium from Alburgh, Vt., a town just south of the border. They watched the ""home team"" play from the benches in the right-field bleachers, tickets that sold for $1 each â€” or about 75Â cents US. Walker played for six seasons with the Montreal Expos, from 1989 until he left as a free agent before the 1995 season. On Tuesday, he will find out whether he'll be immortalized in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. This is Walker's 10th and final appearance on the ballot. And while becoming a Hall of Famer would be an amazing accomplishment for him, fans like Kehoe who watched him all those years wouldÂ be thrilled, too. It all started one day in 1993, when the family was en route to a game in Montreal. Walker was being interviewed on the radio and mentioned that his former teammate Tim Wallach had bestowed upon him the nickname Booger. ""My wife came up with the idea to bring a sign the next time we go, hang it up and call [the section] Boogerville,"" he said. (Longtime Expos fans will of course, remember Jonesville â€” the left field bleachers at Jarry Park, named after left fielder Mack Jones). The banner made its debut April 20, 1993, when Wallach returned to Montreal for the first time with his new team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. After that, the Kehoe family brought it to every game they attended. ""Everybody noticed it. Some people even thought that the team put it out there,"" he said. Walker himself noticed it, and he would wave to the members of his unofficial fan club from time to time. The banner, KehoeÂ said, has a winning record â€” by his estimate, the team won about 80 per cent of the games they played when the sign hung in the outfield. Kehoe was a fielder in his playing days, which gave him a particular appreciation of Walker'sÂ skills. ""He was just an excellent outfielder. We saw all the catches he made [and] it seemed like almost every time he went to a game with the Boogerville sign, he hit a home run,"" he said. ""Now I know that didn't happen, but I mean, your memory sort of builds it up."" According to a popular Hall-of-Fame tracker, Walker is on pace to garner more than 85 per cent of the vote, based on the ballots of voters who have made their ballots public. He needs 75 per cent to make it in. For years, Walker has been relatively nonchalant about his Hall of Fame chances. He told CBC last year that just being on the ballot brought him joy. Kehoe met Walker on a handful of occasions and can vouch for his down-to-earth demeanour. The banner was retired in 1995, but five years later, Kehoe brought it to a game and Walker,Â by then a star for the Rockies, signed it. These days, it's in a box somewhere. Kehoe said it's clear that Walker neverÂ tookÂ himself too seriously: he was just a regular guy who loved playing baseball. ""It was fun, as a family, to watch him,"" he said. ""He was our right fielder, and he was our Booger.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-expos-fan-larry-walker-1.5433499,[],N/A20,Erica Johnson,2019-05-01T09:00:00.135Z,Bank employees angry regulator's report on sales tactics weakened after banks and government review drafts,"Several bank employees are speaking out, angered by recent revelations that a report on banking sales tactics was weakened after the regulator shared a draft copy with the banks and federal government. They contacted Go Public to reveal why they thinkÂ upsellingÂ wasn't widely detected during a lengthy review of misleading sales tactics by the regulator â€”Â slamming the bank review as inaccurate, inappropriateÂ and a PR exercise. The employees provided internal documents disclosing aggressiveÂ upsellingÂ they said isn't obvious and said they were frustrated by a recentÂ Go Public storyÂ that showed aÂ report released by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada last year had key consumer protections eliminated after early drafts were shared with the federal Finance Department and the big banks. ""When I saw the regulator gave the report to the banks, I couldn't believe it,"" a CIBC call centre employee wrote to Go Public. ""I had to reach out to you."" CBC has confirmed the identity of bank employees in this story, but is not revealing them to protect their employment.  The regulator told Go Public it gave banks a draft report so they could identify factual errors.Â The review was conducted in 2017 and culminated in a report released on March 20, 2018. The FCAC's handling of its bank review is grounds for a public inquiry into the regulator and Canada's financial services, says the Small Investor Protection Association (SIPA), a consumer advocacy organization. ""It's proof that the Department of Finance is complicit with the FCAC and is deceiving the public,"" SIPA president Stan Buell told Go Public. The CIBC call centre employee saysÂ she was one of the people interviewed by the FCACÂ as part of its review.  The regulator interviewed some 200 bank employees at various branches of BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD, Scotia and National Bank as well as 400 more employees â€”Â some of whom, worked at banking call centres. ""That whole interview was an exercise in public relations,"" she says. She says during the interview, she wasn't transparent about the pressure to meet sales targets, because she worried the process wasn't confidential.  Been wronged? Contact Erica and Go Public team ""Did I tell them we were pushing sales hard? No way,"" she says. ""How did I know that wouldn't get back to someone?"" She saysÂ she has sold things to help the bank's bottom line and meet sales targets, but has made it seem as though it is in the best interest of the client. ""At every telephone banking level, we are trying to sell to the client."" She saysÂ she had to vent, after learningÂ the regulator's report was weakened, after early versions were sent to banks and government. ""It just made me really angry, reading what went on behind the scenes,"" she says. In an email to Go Public, CIBC's director of public affairs Trish Tervit says the bank ""supplied complete org charts"" to the FCAC.  ""The bank did not select which employees were interviewed as part of the FCAC's industry-wide review,"" wrote Tervit. ""Putting clients at the centre of all we do is our priority every day. We have a strong, client-focused culture and we continuously review our business to ensure we do what's right for our clients."" A Scotiabank financial adviser saysÂ he thought it was inappropriate for the FCAC to let banks see the draft report.  ""The banks shouldn't have had any say in it, in any way,"" he says. ""That's shocking to me."" He saysÂ his sales targets have sharply increased since last November. He saysÂ employees are upselling customers simply to meet sales targets,Â but that much of that harm would be impossible for the regulator to detect. He provided a screenshotÂ of an internal website, showing that the higher an interest rate an employee quotes a customer on a mortgage, the more sales units they earn towards their target.  ""They [customers] don't know they could've got a lower mortgage rate,"" saysÂ the financial adviser. ""I don't know how upselling would ever be tracked."" Another example of upselling he said the regulator couldn't detect is the way employees are encouraged to move clients away from investing in GICs and steer them into mutual funds, which provide guaranteed annual feesÂ for the bank. To meet sales targets, he says he pushes mutual fundsÂ because he gets double the amount of credit. ""That can be harmful to customers,"" he says, ""because a mutual fund might not make sense."" In an email to Go Public, ScotiabankÂ director of Canadian banking communications Patricia Hsiung wrote, ""Any reports that Scotiabank has set aggressive sales targets are inaccurate and misleading. Scotiabank remains committed to delivering an exceptional, transparent and trustworthy experience for our customers that prioritizes our relationships over products."" She also wrote that the bank considers ""customer feedback from more than one million surveys yearly"" and is making, ""great strides in driving towards industry leadership in overall customer satisfaction."" Another Scotiabank financial adviser working in a different city also contacted Go Public to say he was disturbed to see the regulator's report was weakened after it went to government and the banks, and that the regulator's claim that it did not find that bank customers were widely harmed â€”Â is not accurate. He provided documents showing his sales targets had significantly increased as of last fall. ""The pressure is enormous,"" he says. ""We're lying to our clients. Upselling all the time. You don't want to do it, but if you don't, you'll lose your job."" He says the regulator wouldn't know his manager tells him to gloss over the fees attached to a mutual fund. ""People will back out if they know there's risk involved, or fees,"" he says. He says he also increases credit card limits because he's under pressure to hit sales targets, but the FCAC wouldn't be able to tell that either, by looking at files. ""If they [bank customer] have an existing card with a $5,000 credit limit, I'll say, 'I see you're pre-approved for $10,000, let's attach that to your file,'"" he says. ""I don't ask the client if that's a good thing for them, in case they say no. I need to make points for my sales target."" News that the banking regulator provided draft copies of its review into aggressive sales tactics to government and the banks has prompted renewed calls for a public inquiry into financial services and the FCAC from the Small Investor Protection Association. ""I really think the government needs to listen to the voices of the people, to understand what their needs are and the impact on their lives, due to the lack of investor protection,"" saysÂ Buell. ""The FCAC should be providing that, but is not."" In a statementÂ released earlier this week, Buell said an independent inquiry is necessary because ""Canadians are entrusting their hard-earned money, savings and futures with what should be trusted institutions and individuals."" ""There appears to be a far too cosyÂ relationship between the banking industry, the FCAC and the Finance Department,"" saysÂ Buell. Go Public asked Finance Minister Bill Morneau about claims that the report was weakened after he saw it. ""Obviously, it's always important for us to take a look at how the banking sector is working,"" he says.  ""And I'm confident the FCAC did a good job."" Regardless of whether or not a public inquiry is called, one of the Scotiabank financial advisers who reached out says he has a message for banks, and for bank customers.  ""They [the banks] need to stop being so greedy and ripping people off,"" he says. ""And when people go to the bank, they shouldn't trust what we say. We're under pressure to sell, but we can't tell you that."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment onÂ CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Clinton also weighed in on the dispute between Sanders and 2020 Democratic presidential rival Elizabeth Warren over his alleged comments doubting thatÂ a woman could win the presidency, saying Sanders demonstrated ""a pattern"" in how his campaign attacked women rivals. The criticism, made in a Hulu documentary Hillary, to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday, and an interview promoting it, revealed lingering bitterness toward Sanders after he mounted an unexpected Democratic primary challenge to Clinton in 2016. Clinton backers blame SandersÂ supporters for tarnishing her with vitriolic criticism that helped put Republican Donald Trump in the White House. ""He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it,"" Clinton says in the documentary, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Asked recently by the magazine if that assessment still holds, Clinton said, ""Yes, it does."" Sanders said in a statement that his focus ""is on a monumental moment in American history: the impeachment trial of Donald Trump."" ""Together, we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in American history,"" he said. Clinton did not commit to endorsing and campaigning for Sanders should he win the nomination this year, citing a competitive Democratic field, but she criticized his campaign as having a culture of insult and attack. ""I will say, however, that it's not only him, it's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women,"" Clinton told the Hollywood Reporter. When she was asked about the dispute over whether Sanders told Warren in a private conversation that a woman could not beat Trump, Clinton pointed out that she got three million more votes than Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Sanders has denied Warren'sÂ account. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" he told CNN last week.Â  Clinton called the dispute part of a pattern with Sanders, noting he had attacked her as being unqualified despite her experience, including as secretary of state and a U.S. senator. She encouraged voters ""to elect a president who's going to try to bring us together, and not either turn a blind eye, or actually reward the kind of insulting, attacking, demeaning, degrading behaviour that we've seen from this current administration.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/clinton-sanders-documentary-1.5434789,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iowa-new-hampshire-democratic-primaries-1.5427362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/warren-sanders-disagree-1.5425766 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/bernie-sanders-vote-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-president-1.3650624 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/sanders-clinton-trump-address-revolution-1.3639744,N/A22,Anonymous,2020-01-20T19:32:51.220Z,Waskimo Festival cancelled this year due to damage to bird habitat,"The popular Waskimo Winter Festival which held its last three events on Wascana Lake in Regina will not take place in 2020 due to shore line degradation. The festival had been held on the ice near the Conexus Arts Centre â€” an areaÂ the Saskatchewan government said is near a federally designated migratory bird sanctuary.Â  ""Shoreline degradation caused by the ice surface location directly impacted nesting habitat, food and protection for waterfowl,"" said Jonathan Tremblay, director of communications for the Ministry of Government Relations, in an emailed statement.Â  ""For Waskimo to continue using the ice surface in the Wascana marsh area, they would be required to apply for permits under the Aquatic Habitat Protection Program and the Migratory Bird Convention Act, both of which outline concerns with alterations to habitat."" Tremblay said the Provincial Capital Commission also offered help in the form of an on-land ice surface on the west side of Broad Street at no cost, plus $5,000 for facility rental costs. ""We are sad to see the event cancelled by the organizers, but we certainly look forward to working with them on an environmentally sustainable solution in future years,"" Tremblay's email said. It was decided that the festival would be cancelled after the Waskimo board met with the government multiple times about the shore line concerns, said Jeremy Parnes, chair of the WaskimoÂ Winter Festival committee. ""This is just the reality of having that many people on the ice at that time,"" Parnes said. ""We are truly saddened that we are not able to do it this year."" Parnes said without the ice, there wouldn't be events like theÂ skating competition and outhouse races, which would make the event a shadow of itself, so it was cancelled. It's unclear if the festival can be moved or held in another area, Parnes said, but added the board is considering the options available. ""We're a passionate group. We don't give up easy and we don't take no for an answer,"" Parnes said.Â ""So that bodes really well for our positive possibilities in 2021.""

Flavoured vape juice will be banned in the province. ""We did it with flavoured tobacco, we're going to do it with flavoured vaping as well,"" Aylward told CBC's Island Morning. ""I won't be swayed."" The health minister has made the decision in the face of opposition from Imperial Tobacco and the Atlantic Convenience Stores Association. In a news release, Imperial Tobacco urged governments in Canada to be certain vaping regulations were based on science. ""This is an extremely complex issue for which governments need to talk to scientists and doctors who understand the issue and not get swayed by the dramatized headlines,"" said Eric Gagnon, head of corporate and regulatory affairs at Imperial Tobacco Canada. ""If politicians and regulators allow themselves to be influenced by fear instead of facts, the biggest losers will be the millions of adult smokers across Canada who want an alternative to smoking."" In a release, the Vaping Industry Trade Association said it's callingÂ upon ""all levels of government to formally acknowledge the thousands of Canadian vapers who quit smoking by vaping."" The organization said it wants government to carefully consider how proposed policies negatively affect adultsÂ who rely on vapingÂ products to remain smoke-free. Shamus Kelly, owner ofÂ Eastern Vapes in Charlottetown, said banning flavoured vaping products won't get them out of the hands of Island youth. ""They're pushing everybody to the black market. They are going to get their hands on it, no matter what,"" Kelly said. ""But now it's not going to be professionally-tested, lab-tested stuff. It's going to be black market products that, who know what's in them, right? And they're going to get them that way.""Â  Kelly said up to 80 per cent of his business is selling flavoured vapes so he expects the decision to affect his bottom line.Â  Julia Hartley, with the P.E.I. Lung Association, saidÂ there'sÂ evidence to show that youth between the ages of 18 andÂ 24Â are particularly drawn to flavoured vaping products.Â  ""We have data showing that almost 100 per cent of youth prefer flavoured products and also data showing that half of these kids would quit vaping if, you know, the flavours were taken away. That's all the evidence we need,"" she said.Â  Aylward said he was alarmed by news from P.E.I.'s Public Schools Branch that vaping is starting as early as Grade 4. He believes banning flavoured vapes will discourage young people. ""Trying to protect our population, particularly our youth, that's the number one thing that I think about every day,"" he said. Consultations on regulations will go on about another week, said Aylward, and he expects to have draft regulations by early March, and those could be in force as soon as the end of that month. Aylward said there is still a role for the federal government in regulation when it comes to online sales and limiting the amount of nicotine in products.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-flavoured-vaping-banned-1.5434281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-flavours-canadian-vaping-association-1.5367882 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-vaping-bill-deagle-1.5365964 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-partners-medical-society-doctor-recruitment-2020-1.5433244 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,N/A24,Natalie Valleau,2020-01-20T16:04:24.013Z,"Facial expressions of cats reveal their inner moods, study says","Remember Grumpy Cat? For most cat owners and veterinarians, knowing a cat's mood isn't as easy as the popular meme. However, according to a new study by the University of Calgary and the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al, you can now tell a lot about how a cat is feeling from certain facial expressions. Dr. Daniel Pang, University of Calgary researcher and veterinarian, says he has co-developed, along with Dr. Paulo Steagall, the ""Feline Grimace Scale""Â â€” which was published in Scientific Reports. He says the goal of the scale is for veterinarians to be able to identify if your feline friend is experiencing any pain. ""With cats, when they're undergoing the same procedures or surgeries as dogs, they tend to receive less pain relief because we just struggle to identify when they're painful,"" he told the Calgary Eyeopener on Friday. ""Which, of course, means it's harder to manage their pain as well."" The veterinarian says the study exemplified theÂ key things to look at â€” like the position of their ears, eyes, muzzleÂ and whiskers. ""They just look as though they have kind of a buildup of tension in their face,"" he said. Pang says theÂ scaleÂ will also show theÂ level of pain andÂ how extreme it is.Â  ""It really helps veterinarians decide if they should do something about it or not.â€_ Our focus is really on the pain aspect because that's the thing that we all struggle with as veterinarians,"" he said. The study has created a free training manual forÂ veterinarians so they can use theÂ Feline Grimace ScaleÂ at their practices.Â  ""One of the things we really like about it is it's a scale that seems to be pretty fast to useÂ because we all know everyone's busy at work, and if something takes you more than a minute, you're just not going to do it,"" he said. Â ""Hopefully, we'll see that knock-on effects and better benefiting cats as well."" Don't worry, no cats were harmed in the making of this study. Pang says the cats that were tested were being brought to the hospital because they were sick or in pain. ""What made it really useful was when we gave the cats pain relief, we could see the changing faces, so see their faces becoming much more relaxed and happy looking,"" he said. ""It was really that response to pain medication that helpedÂ confirm to us that we really were identifyingÂ pain."" By identifying this, veterinariansÂ are able to decide how much pain medication to give or whetherÂ it's working well. ""AÂ big part of it is if people are not sure of painÂ presence, they hesitate to decide to do something about it, and a lot of the drugs we use to relieve pain have side-effects,"" said Pang. ""If you're then worrying about the side-effects, it makes you hesitant or shy toÂ start giving out medication without knowing if the animal really needs it or not."" Pang says the followingÂ movementsÂ determine whether a cat is in pain:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/cats-veterinarians-study-pets-university-calgary-1.5431176,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cats-own-name-1.5084054 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/abandoned-cats-sundre-1.5405023,N/A25,Benjamin Shingler,2020-01-21T01:39:31.766Z,"Long lines for private refugee sponsors show need for reform, advocates say","Dozens of people spent the weekend in a Quebec Immigration Ministry office in Montreal, some of them sleeping on the floor or onÂ fold-outÂ chairs, in the hopeÂ of being able to sponsor a refugee. Not all of them were successful. Originally fromÂ Â Afghanistan, SharbanoÂ Rezai's family is living in IranÂ as refugees. RezaiÂ spent three nights in the ministry office, hoping to finally bring themÂ to Canada. She was 49th in line, but she isn't sure if the government will even read her documents because some peopleÂ ahead of her were delivering upwardÂ of 10 applications. ""This is not fair,"" she said. ""This is a not about just staying in line for three nights. This is about people's lives."" The province is only accepting 750 applications for private sponsorshipÂ for the coming year on a first-come, first-served basis.Â  The process, critics say, is inefficient and inhumane. ""It's a bit of a messÂ inside,"" said Sylvain Thibault, a would-be sponsor andÂ longtime refugee advocate. ""It really looks like a refugee camp. There are people who have been here 24 hours a day since ThursdayÂ around noon. So it's been four days."" Last week, advocates had raised a concern that potentialÂ sponsors would be forced to spend the weekend outside in the cold in the hope of securing a spot. The province ended up opening the Immigration Ministry'sÂ doors starting Friday evening, so would-be sponsorsÂ could wait inside.Â It also provided coffee and water, said a ministry spokesperson. The available spots were quickly filled when the government began accepting applications Monday morning.Â  The government required that the applications be dropped off at the ministry office by aÂ courier, not mailed or dropped off by the applicant.Â  Some couriersÂ charge upwards of $500 per application and submitted multiple applications, Radio-Canada reported. There was a long line the last time the province accepted applications, as well, in September 2018. The Quebec program, modelled on the federal one, has been popular from the start, leading to such a backlog of unprocessed applications that in 2017, the program had to be suspended for more than 18 monthsÂ while the government processedÂ thousands of existing applications. In total, more than 9,000 refugees were accepted into the province in 2017 (many are brought in through a federal government-assisted program, not through private sponsorship). However, the Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec government, which was elected in 2018 on a commitment to reduce immigration, says it aims to cut the number of refugees to between 7,200 and 7,500 in 2020, with a maximum of 3,350 sponsored refugees. The government has justified its promise to reduce the number of immigrants overall by saying it wants to focus efforts on better integrating people.Â  Paul Clarke, the headÂ of Action RÃ©fugiÃ©s, said last week the systemÂ isn't working. ""We're ready to welcome more people, and we have the capacity to sponsor them. The numbers that are being permitted are too low.""Â  Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette acknowledged there are problems with the current approach, and he said the process of submitting applications through a courier will be reviewed.Â  ""Many of our immigration programs need to be modernized. This is the case for collective sponsorship, and we will work on it,"" he said in a statement. He also said Quebec ""recognizes the principle of international solidarity"" with respect to refugees and takes in ""more than its fair share, in terms of humanitarian immigration.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-private-refugee-sponsorship-1.5426370,[],N/A26,Erica Johnson,2019-10-21T12:17:54.616Z,Banks deny compensation when hackers steal customers' money,"Sunjit Lidhar was awoken by a phone call from Scotiabank last February, informing him that $3,000 had been transferred out of his savings account and was gone. ""My heart pretty much dropped to my stomach,"" Lidhar told Go Public from his home in Surrey, B.C. ""We just assume our money's safe."" Soon after, the cybercriminals stole another $2,000. But worst of all, Scotiabank refused to reimburse him. ""It is not acceptable to have your money stolen from your account and the bank â€” which you trust so much with your life savings â€”Â tells you they can't do much to help."" Lidhar is the victim of a ""systemic problem"" of criminals breaking into people's online accountsÂ and stealing money, according to Christopher Parsons, a senior public policy researcher at the Citizen Lab at theÂ University of Toronto'sÂ Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Parsons argues that the country's banks, not their customers,Â should be financially liable when thieves raid customer accounts. ""The banks are responsible â€”Â solely responsible â€”Â for building and maintaining the infrastructure,"" he said. ""We need to reverse the liability the banks currently impose upon individuals who are using the very services and tools that banks are providing.""Â  The trouble started for Lidhar on Feb.Â 11, when hackers broke into his account and e-transferred $3,000 in two transactions â€” one for $2,000 and one for $1,000 â€” to an email address he says he doesn't recognize. As soon as he learned about it, Lidhar says he changed his password, got a new debit card, asked Scotiabank to freeze his accounts and stopped banking online. Scotiabank said it would investigate, but when Lidhar didn't hear back after two weeks, he visited his local branch. While speaking to someone in the fraud department, they told him money was again being transferred out of his account. ""I was totally shocked and blown away that this was happening while I was in the branch,"" he said.Â  Been wronged and you're not the only one? Contact our Go Public team His bank was able to stop one e-transfer for $1,000 but not another for $2,000. Lidhar says Scotiabank took a few weeks to investigate, and then said it wouldn't cover his losses.Â  In an email, Scotiabank said his claim was denied because the transaction was authorized from an internetÂ address whereÂ he has ""extensive history."" Security experts tellÂ Go Public that hackers can access a bank account from a victim'sÂ IP address by taking over an infected computer and logging in as if they were that person. Lidhar says Scotiabank wouldn't explain how the fraud happened, adding that only he has access to his account.Â  ""They're trying to blame me,"" he said. ""And they haven't told me anything about who it went to."" In a statement to Go Public, a Scotiabank spokesperson said the bank ""took immediate action and conducted a thorough investigation,"" into Lidhar's case.Â  ""We take the concerns of our customers very seriously,""Â wrote Douglas Johnson. After Go Public contacted Scotiabank, it offered to compensate Lidhar â€” six months after his money was stolen.Â  Go Public has heard similar stories from othersÂ â€” all saying their accounts were hacked, and that the banks often won't reimburse them. In May, Martin Chapman of Peterborough, Ont., lost almost $12,000Â when criminals broke intoÂ his accounts at TD Bank and Royal Bank. Initially, he says, TD refused to fully compensate him, offering just $1,805. ""They have admitted to me they don't know how the scammer broke through their security system,"" said Chapman. Only after he appealed did TD agreeÂ to reimburse all $6,000. RBC refunded the remaining money after a two-week investigation. TD would not respond to questions from Go Public about this case.Â  Curtis Hamilton of Esquimalt, B.C., says heÂ was targeted by hackers last November who installed a key logger on his computer and sent just over $2,000 to themselves. TD's fraud department said Hamilton didn't protect his password and it was his fault. Hamilton had anti-malware software on his computer.Â He's hired a lawyer but has yet to get his money back. ""It's been quite frustrating,"" he said. ""The bank is basically saying â€_ 'We're not responsible for anything.'"" TD would not comment on this case, when asked by Go Public. Patricia Widdis of Breslau, Ont., told Go Public that hackers accessed her RBC account and redirectedÂ her Visa payments, stealing $12,000 in May 2018. The bank was able to get $7,000 returned,Â but she is still out $5,000 and feels betrayed. ""They said, 'You made the payments yourself,'"" said Widdis.Â An RBC spokesperson wrote that potentially unauthorized transactions are analyzed ""on a case-by-case"" basis. Most Canadians are unaware that more criminals are hackingÂ into financial institutions in Canada and around the world, says security expert Limor Kessem.Â  ""These threats are very real and very problematic,"" said Kessem, an adviser based in Tel Aviv with IBM X-Force, an international team of investigators who track global security threats to the financial sector. ""In the beginning,"" she said, ""we would see that a banking trojan [a type of virus] would be targeting banks through their customers,"" such asÂ GozNym, a malware attack she helped uncoverÂ and that was shut down in May, as part of an international law enforcement operation. GozNymÂ targeted two financial institutions based in Canada â€” which Kessem won't name â€” and 22 U.S. banks, credit unions and popular e-commerce platforms, stealing sensitive personal and financial information, including online banking login credentials such as usernames and passwords. It's estimated GozNym stole over $100 million from some 40,000 victims. It's an example of the sort of malware that might be responsible for the hacks against Lidhar, Hamilton and Chapman.Â  ""And then we have a different type of attack,"" said Kessem. ""Cybercrime groups that will invade the banks' actual infrastructure and get into their payment systems and start compromising them internally."" It all points to the need for financial institutions to take responsibility when hackers steal customers' money, says Parsons, the public policy researcher.Â  ""They can't just provide us tools or push liability upon us and then walk away,"" he said. ""One of the ways of correcting this would be to shift the liability structure. So rather than punishing customers â€_ the banks themselves should be liable, so that they're encouraged to build way better security and protect their customers from this sort of fraud."" In the U.K., says Parsons, banking fraud was such a big problem, the government made banks responsible for financial losses to customers.Â  ""And as soon as the banks had to take those losses, all of a sudden â€_ fraud plummeted because the banks invested massively in security,"" said Parsons. He says Canada's next government needs to follow the U.K.'s example.Â  ""If banks themselves won't do it, then it's an area where legislation needs to be seriously considered. We can't rely on customers to know about every kind of security vulnerability, to track every website that has breached passwords,"" he said. ""That's just absolutely absurd and not a feasible solution to the problem."" Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association â€” which representsÂ Canada's largest banks â€” whether its members would consider assuming liability when hackers break into the online banking systems they have created. A spokesperson did not address that question, but wrote, banks ""have no higher priority than the security of their customers' money and conduct comprehensive investigations of all fraud cases, some of which are complex and take time to investigate the specifics of the case."" All the banks involved in these cases have told Go Public that customers are responsible for taking precautions to ensure their devices, accounts and information are protected. Sunjit Lidhar says he's stopped doing online banking and now heads to his bank branch instead â€” a hassle he says is worth it, for peace of mind. He says he wrote to Go Public to let people know that banks could hold them responsible when hackers strike. ""I just want people to know that this is something that's very real,"" says Lidhar. ""It's not safe. And that's something they [the banks] need to work on."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Premier Caroline CochraneÂ should be hosting meetings with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Jason KenneyÂ to make sure the Indigenous communities living within the Mackenzie water system will not be affected by the controversial $20.6 billion Teck Frontier mining project that is proposed for a site 110 kilometres north of Fort McMurray, Alta.Â  A joint federal-provincial review board deemed the Teck Frontier mineÂ in the public interest last July, despite ""significant adverse ... effects"" to the environment, species at risk and the traditional practices of Indigenous peoples. Federal Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson has the final say on whether the project goes forward. He must decide before the end of February.Â  If approved, the Teck Frontier mining project would produce 260,000 bitumen barrels a day and create 7,000 jobs in Alberta. Its lifespan is estimated to be 41 years.Â Â Â  Joslyn Oosenbrug, a communications managerÂ with the N.W.T.'s Environment Department, said in a statement that the territory is the ""ultimate downstream jurisdiction"" of the Mackenzie River basin and that ""N.W.T. waters can be impacted"" by management decisions in Alberta.Â  In 2015, the Northwest Territories and Alberta signed a bilateral water management agreement to preserve the quantity and quality of the territory's water. OosenbrugÂ said Alberta must take action if the water quality deteriorates.Â  The territorial government did not make a submission to the joint federal-provincial review board on the Teck Frontier mining project.Â  Oosenbrug alsoÂ said the territoryÂ monitors the water quality for any effects that could come from upstream oil extraction. The government has had a water monitoring site at Fort Fitzgerald, Alta., since the 1960s, which gives early warnings of any environmental changes in the Slave River.Â  Part of the Smith Landing First Nation's traditional territory runs just south of the border between theÂ Northwest Territories and Alberta, along the Slave River and into the Peace-Athabasca Delta.Â  Smith's Landing First NationÂ was only invited to join the review panel at their last session in October 2018 after pressuring Alberta on at least four separate occasions for the right to consult, saidÂ Becky Kostka, the land and resources manager for the First Nation.Â  In its final submission to the Alberta government, Smith's Landing First Nation argues that it has seen a noticeable decline in water levels, water quality and air pollution â€” all stemming from other resource projects in northern Alberta. Transcripts from members of the Smith's Landing First Nation in that report say the Slave River is ""at a tipping point"" and that another resource project could ""seal the fate"" of the nation. Jess Sinclair, press secretary to Alberta's environment minister Jason Nixon, said in a statement that Smith's Landing First Nation did not identify any specific sites that needed mitigation from the Teck Frontier project.Â  The Aboriginal Consultation Office, an arm of Alberta's provincial government that specializes in Indigenous consultation, found that consultation with the First Nation was adequate.Â  Chief CheezieÂ will be speaking at a press conference in front of the environment minister's Vancouver constituency office Monday. He and other Indigenous advocates will be presenting the minister's office with a joint letter expressing their concerns over the Teck Frontier project.Â  ""We haven't been sitting on our hands here because we see the immense danger to our people,"" he said. ""We're not going anywhere. Forty one years from now ... when the mine shuts down, Teck will leaveÂ but we will still be [here]."" Cheezie said Smith's Landing is also actively lobbying other federal ministers, including DanÂ Vandal, the new minister responsible for northern affairs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/smiths-landing-nwt-teck-frontier-1.5431837,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187,N/A28,Anonymous,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/marketplace,[],N/A29,Robert Jones,2020-01-21T12:29:11.405Z,Smart meter critics change tone on NB Power's new business case,"NB Power's $92-million plan to buy and deploy smart meters in New Brunswick got a late endorsement Monday from a pair of consultants unconnected to the utility who had lobbed early criticisms at the project â€” a change in tone not lost on at least one Energy and Utilities Board member who will soon be deciding its fate. ""Both of you there just gave some compliments to NB Power on their business case. So you think this is a well-prepared business case?"" asked EUB member Michael Costello during the testimony of Philip Diodomenico and Kathleen Kelly, consultants with Daymark Energy Advisors Inc. of Worcester, Mass. Diodomenico and Kelly were hired by public intervener Heather Black to independently review NB Power's smart meter plan and told Costello despite some shortcomings it is a much better proposal than they have dealt with elsewhere. ""Generally, the business case is a good business case,"" said Diodomenico. ""It's made good use of outside consultants and expertise. It's taken a conservative approach in a number of areas, not everywhere,Â but in a number of areas. Yeah, so it's a good business case."" Kelly said although NB Power might be underestimating expenses and overestimating benefits of its smart meter plan by several millions of dollars, it still looks to be a solid investment. ""We've tried to take some of the assumptions and expand them and make them more conservative to make ourselves more comfortable with it,"" said Kelly. ""We've reduced the benefit cost ratio, but we haven't seen it go to one [break even] or lower."" Black recommended against the adoption of NB Power's smart meter plan during the utility's first application in 2018 and, although she has expressed no personal opinion on the matter so far this time, her experts gave the utility's case an important boost at a critical time. The two said they would not recommend against the project moving forward if NB Power expands on a risk assessment of things that could go wrong and how they might be fixed and develops acceptable ways to measure whether the meters are accomplishing predetermined goals. Diodomenico and Kelly were the final two witnesses to be called during the hearing, which has lasted six days and moves to final arguments on Wednesday. NB Power has presented evidence suggesting its acquisition of 360,000 smart meters will provide 16 financial benefits that together will exceed the projected cost of the project by $31.1 million over 15 years. Although Diodomenico and Kelly said that net benefit number is probably too high, it's likely not zero, something a second independent expert was less certain of. Alice Napoleon, a senior associate with Synapse Energy Economics of Cambridge, Mass., also testified Monday.Â  Synapse was hired to independently evaluate the smart meter plan as well, but by the Energy and Utilities Board itself. NapoleonÂ told the board it is unclear from her analysis â€” because of vagueness in NB Power's numbers â€” whether the project will be a financial benefit or liability in the long run. ""We find that NB Power has presented a proposal that, under plausible conditions, would result in benefits to ratepayers,"" said Napoleon in her opening statement. ""Under alternative but still plausible conditions, the proposed AMI (advanced metering infrastructure) plan might not provide net benefits to customers."" Also testifying Monday was McGill University lecturer Paul Heroux, who was called by intervener Roger Richard, a staunch opponent of smart meters. Heroux said his research shows that even low levels of radiation, like from radio frequencies that will be constantly emitted by smart meters, pose a health hazard to humans. ""We have been for a long time influenced by this radiation unknowingly,"" said Heroux. Earlier in the hearing, Dr. Michele Plant, a witness for NB Power, testified there was ""no carcinogenic risk"" from radio waves or frequencies at ""an exposure level thousands of times higher than those measured near a smart meter."" In the hearing two years ago, the EUB ruled it could find no credible evidence that smart meters posed any health risks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meter-eub-hearings-1.5434186,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-rate-meters-1.5430140 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-catch-22-1.5428720,N/A30,Anonymous,2020-01-20T19:08:43.527Z,"Car a total loss after fire, Charlottetown fire inspector says","A car that caught fire on the Charlottetown bypassÂ betweenÂ Brackley Point Road and St. Peters RoadÂ on Sunday afternoon has beenÂ deemed a total loss.

However, the archeological firm that unveiled its find to the public to much fanfareÂ is standing its ground about that discovery. Excavation work at a site on Sainte-Ursule StreetÂ in Old Quebec uncovered a wooden stockade in the fall of 2018. The stockade's location coincided with historical evidence found on aÂ map, dating back to 1700, which shows the Beaucours palisade was built in the same spot. At a November 2018 news conference to present the findings, they were described asÂ ""a major discovery"" by Premier FranÃ§ois Legault. But an analysis of two pieces of wood from the structureÂ done recently at UniversitÃ© LavalÂ has called into question the theory that they're part of the first fortifications, suggestingÂ the structure may not date all the way back to 1693. Geography Prof. Martin Simard did a dendrochronological analysis â€” which dates the wood based on its tree rings â€” and found ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that one sample dated back toÂ 1751Â and the otherÂ toÂ 1775. ""Frankly, our results surprised us. We weren't expecting that at all,"" SimardÂ said. ""Considering the strength of the message that the wall dated back to 1693, we were extra careful. We checked and double-checked to be sure."" Simard's report was included as part of aÂ 326-page document the archeology firmÂ Ruralys submitted to the Quebec Ministry of Culture in early January. The executive director of Ruralys,Â Dominique Lalande, said she was surprised to see thisÂ small sectionÂ of the report spark such debateÂ over the weekend, after it was reported by Radio-Canada. ""Specific analysis isn'tÂ always consistent with other archeological data,"" she said. Lalande said theÂ full report includedÂ historical maps andÂ ground analysis, as wellÂ radiocarbon datingÂ to determine the age of the trees that were chopped down to make the wooden beams. The carbon tests, carried out in a laboratory in Miami, Fla.,Â indicated the trees were cut down during the 17th century, in tune with the conclusion reached by Ruralys. Asked about the discrepancy between the carbon-dating report and his findings, SimardÂ said theÂ dendrochronological analysis is far more precise and was, in fact, used by scientists in the development of carbon-14 datingÂ to calibrate the carbon-dating method and check its accuracy. Lalande said the science of archeologyÂ takes into account a combination of findings and data beforeÂ goingÂ with one theory. In this case, she said, there isn't any doubt in her mind the structure was indeed theÂ Beaucours palisade. JosuÃ© Dubois Berthelot de Beaucours, a French military engineer, drew the plans for the wooden fortifications built inÂ 1693-94,Â designed to protect the colony from heavy artillery and cannon balls. William Moss, who worked for Quebec City as chief archeologist for more than 30 years, pointed out that wall was replaced by stone fortificationsÂ in 1745. Not directly involved in the research, he was nonethelessÂ glad to see a ""very enthusiastic, positive response"" from politicians inÂ 2018, when the announcement was made. But holding a news conference,Â attended by the premier, the mayor and other officials before the final report was ready, was ""hasty,"" he said. ""You have to do your analysis before you start putting information like that out."" Lalande said the timing of the announcementÂ was decided by theÂ Ministry of Culture.Â  The final report submitted to the ministry has been ""reviewed and approved,""Â said ministry spokesperson Ã‰milie Mercier. ""Everything leads us to believe it is indeed the Beaucours palisade,"" MercierÂ told CBC News. The wooden structure is currently in the hands of the ministry's conservation centre in Quebec City, where the wood is undergoing a controlled drying process. Mercier said noÂ decision has been made about what will be done with it. In 2018, Mayor RÃ©gis Labeaume called the discovery ""huge""Â because it ""reinforces our status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,"" but he had little to say Monday about the contradictory evidence.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the screening for direct arrivals at New York City's JFK International Airport is expected later Friday followed by screenings on Saturday atÂ San Francisco International Airport. The third airport isÂ Los Angeles International Airport. The risk from the coronavirus to Americans is deemed to be low, the CDC said. While the U.S. State Department has issued a health alert update about travel to the Wuhan region, the CDC has urged citizens travelling in the region to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions. The CanadaÂ Border Services Agency (CBSA) said on Friday it will not implement extra screening measures, but isÂ ""monitoring the situationÂ closely with our partners on both sides of the border."" The CBSA did say there are plans in progress ""to implement signage"" in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal airports to raise awareness of the virus to travellers. Elsewhere, Thailand has found a second case of a new Chinese coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as they ramped up checks on Chinese visitors, nearly a million of whom are expected for Lunar New Year holidays next week. The latest patient is from China's central city of Wuhan, which has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, with two deaths, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread. The 74-year-old woman, quarantined since arriving in Thailand on Monday, was found to be infected, health officials said. ""We're very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of diseases,"" Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, adding that the situation was under control and there was no outbreak in Thailand. ""We're fully alert."" The two Chinese patients were now safe but needed to go through a few more procedures before Thai authorities could let them return home, he added. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thailand, which is on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, said on Monday it had found a 61-year-old Chinese woman carrying a strain of the coronavirus, the first time it was detected outside China. Japan reported its first case of the infection on Thursday, after a Japanese man returned from visiting Wuhan, known for picturesque lakes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the virus could spread and warned hospitals against it. Thai health officials have stepped up monitoring at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan â€” Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai and Phuket â€”Â and others that receive charter flights from the Chinese city.

And with the land in question now being turned into aÂ conservation zone by the Ktunaxa Nation, the provincial government is formally beginning the process of dissolving the town that has no peopleÂ â€” but does have a mayor, council and senior staff.Â  ""There is no longer a need for a municipality,"" said the Ministry of Municipal Affairs in a statement. ""We will continue to engage with the municipality, the Regional District of East Kootenay and local First Nations to ensure that their interests are included as we go through the disincorporation process."" A municipality in B.C. hasn't been legally dissolved in B.C. in nearly 100 years, since the company town of Phoenix was abandoned following a downturn in copper prices after the First World War.Â  The government said it would be a ""complex process,""Â and Deck said he would be happy to follow their lead.Â  ""I don't know. I've never done one,"" he said, when asked what role he would play in eliminating the municipality he's mayor of. ""So we're going to take our guidance from [the province]. I presume it's mostly administrative activity, just closing up accounts, passing claims back to the province advising insurance companies and things that we no longer require coverage. Really boring nuts and bolts stuff."" That ""nuts and boltsÂ stuff"" involves some moneyÂ â€”Â  Jumbo Glacier has received around a million dollars in provincial grants and federal gas tax funding, and Deck received annualÂ compensation in the mid-four figures as mayor. ButÂ Deck, who was appointed mayor partly dueÂ to his experience as the first mayor of nearby Radium Hot Springs, said the planning work was necessary.Â  ""It's just good design policy to have planning in place before you do things,"" he said. Not everyone agreed: in 2014 the Union of B.C. Municipalities passed a motion called ""Municipalities with No Residents"" opposing Jumbo Glacier's funding, and last year the city of RosslandÂ asked the province to dissolve it. ""Local government is there to serve the population, and in JumboÂ there was no population,"" said Rossland MayorÂ Kathy Moore, who was happy to hear the government take action.Â  East Kootenay Regional Director Gerry Wilkie, whose electoral area borders the Jumbo Glacier lands, was equally dismissive.Â  ""I think they averaged maybe one and a halfÂ people at their meetings,"" he said.Â  ""An area of absolutely huge ecological importance was subject to a ridiculous white elephant development proposal ... for 25 years."" BothÂ WilkieÂ and Moore praised environmental and Indigenous groups that fought against the idea of Jumbo Glacier for many years.

Raines, a former teammate of the Canadian slugger with the Montreal Expos, was in Walker's shoes exactly three years ago. ""It's tough to sleep the night before, it really is,"" Raines said with a chuckle in a phone interview with The Canadian Press. ""Knowing that it's his 10th year [on the ballot], that makes it more nerve-wracking, especially when you feel you should have gotten in a few years ago. And I'm pretty sure he feels that way â€” I feel that way for him, even if he doesn't."" WATCH | Jamie StrashinÂ makes the case for Larry Walker on The National: Raines, now a special assistant to player development for the Toronto Blue Jays, was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 2017. He made it in with 86 per cent of the vote on his 10th and final year on the Baseball Writers' Association of America ballot, one year after missing out on induction by just 23 votes. ""It was a lot of mixed emotions,"" Raines said of his induction announcement day. ""After having such a good ninth year I felt there was no way I shouldn't at least get 23 more votes the next year. ""But you're still not sure until you get that call."" Walker sat around 85 per cent as of Monday afternoon -- well over the 75 per cent threshold needed for induction -- with approximately half of all votes yet to be tabulated. The Maple Ridge, B.C., native had fallen short by 87 votes in 2019, finishing at 54.6 per cent. He received 34.1 per cent the year before. Raines' ascension followed a similar pattern. ""I would say my last three years [on the ballot] made it more enjoyable because each year I gained a bit more,"" he said. ""At the end I got in with over 85 per cent and that made it better because I didn't just barely get in. It wasn't like I got 76 per cent, you know what I mean? ""That was very gratifying."" Walker followed his six-year Expos stint with 10 seasons in Colorado, giving some voters reason to think his career stats were inflated by hitter-friendly Coors Field. But Raines said he saw Walker's power begin to blossom in Montreal, where the Canadian outfielder/first baseman hit 19 homers in 1990, his official rookie season and Raines' final year with the team. ""I had heard he was a hockey player, but his baseball skills were top notch,"" Raines said. ""I mean, I was surprised hearing he was Canadian â€” not that Canadians were bad, I just didn't really know many Canadian players at the time â€” and I felt he definitely had a chance to be a great player. While Raines said he was impressed with every aspect of Walker's game, he marvelled at the big outfielder's unexpected speed, calling him ""probably one of the best base-runners I had ever been around other than myself."" ""Looking at his size and his power and the way he drove runs in, you wouldn't think that stealing bases would be a part of his game,"" said Raines, who swiped 808 career bags himself, good for fifth place all-time in MLB history. ""You don't see guys put up the numbers that he did â€” other than Hall of Famers â€” and also have success in stealing bases. ... That guy did it all, really."" Raines wasn't the only former teammate to be impacted by Walker in such a short period of time. Blue Jays manager Charlie Montoyo, who spent just one month in the big leagues in Montreal in 1993, appearing in four games, called Walker ""one of the best players"" he'd ever seen. ""I wasn't around long but I had enough time to see that,"" Montoyo said. ""God, he was fun to watch. Great arm, he could steal bases, good outfielder, good hitter, he was fun to watch. That's the best way to describe it. ""He knew how to play the game. He knew when to steal a base; he knew which base to throw to. I appreciate guys like that."" Walker was batting .322 and leading the league with 44 doubles for the first-place Expos in 1994 before a strike cancelled the rest of that season. Montoyo said a lengthy post-season run that year could have helped strengthen Walker's Hall of Fame case. ""They could have won the whole thing in '94 if it wasn't for the strike, you know?"" Montoyo said. ""That would have been something else to give Larry a push."" Raines and Montoyo both said they'll be watching Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET when the vote is revealed. Raines, who described feeling ""pure elation"" following his own January phone call from the Hall three years ago, wants Walker to finally experience that same joy. ""Most definitely I'll be watching,"" Raines said.

But last week, Maltais received another letter in his mailbox, this time from the city's bylaw department.Â  According to the notice of violation, dated Jan.13, Maltais is breaking the city's parking rules by renting the spots out to non-tenants or residents, and must stop by Jan. 31. ""Failure to comply with notice will result in further legal action,"" the notice states, adding that could happen ""without further notice."" In a statement, the city said it has issued four notices of violation to property owners in Beacon Hill-Cardinal Heights since Jan 1, 2019, for renting out parking spaces on their properties. ""Allowing a driveway or legal parking space for a residential use to in effect be used as a commercial parking lot would no longer be a secondary use of the land, and may lead to additional traffic and nuisance concerns in conflict with the intent of a residential area,"" said the city in a statement attributed to David Wise, program manager for zoning andÂ intensification. Maltais said he knows at least half a dozen other people who are also renting out driveway space, but who are now feeling scaredÂ after Maltais received a notice from the cityÂ warning him he's violating a zoning bylaw. ""We were pretty surprised and disappointed to see that it's actuallyÂ legal action against us,"" said Maltais. Maltais said he doesn't see any downsidesÂ to renting out his own driveway, and hopes the city wouldÂ consider a pilot projectÂ to allow residents to continue renting parking spots. ""We're pretty disappointed this is the city's stance on it currently, when reallyÂ we've just as citizens tried to help the situation by getting the cars off the street,"" he said. The area's city councillor said he understands the frustration, but said the rules onÂ renting out driveways are clear.

Brent McLellanÂ took his own life by jumping off Saint John's Reversing Falls Bridge on July 11, 2019. He was 43. But Marjorie and Allan McLellan had to wait six months to be able to bring Brent home.Â  They knew Brent died because a tourist visiting the Reversing Falls took a photo of him in the water, according to his mother. ""Otherwise, we would have been sitting here all this time saying, 'Where's Brent?'"" MarjorieÂ McLellan said. ""As bad as that sounds, we at least knew what had happened."" Brent's remains were discovered in September in Sandy Cove Beach in Digby County, Nova Scotia. For months, police tried to piece together the mystery man's identity. The Nova Scotia RCMP pleaded for information from the public, offering details on the Urban Heritage jeans he was believed to be wearing and his Terra work boots. A forensic artist from the New York Academy of Art also developed a facial reconstruction to try to give people an idea of what he looked like. But the boots were a crucial clue. A family friend was with Brent on the day he bought the boots for a new job and she called the RCMP, McLellan said. A couple of weeks ago, the family got the news they'd been waiting to hear. Growing up on Saint John's west side, Brent loved being outside and playing with other neighbourhood children. He was also close with his two sisters. ""They just loved their brother and he loved them,"" McLellan said. Brent was a star athlete in hockey and baseball, even playing for the Saint John Alpines senior baseball team in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He was one of several players who grew up together playing baseball in Lancaster and who made the jump to senior baseball at the same time, according to Terre Hunter, general manager of the Saint John Alpines. Hunter remembered Brent for his competitive drive, but also for his distinctive laugh. ""Brent was a really friendly, outgoing guy,"" Hunter said. ""Just one of those guys that people sort of migrate to."" Brent moved to western Canada to work as an insulator, but struggled to find work when he returned to New Brunswick, Hunter said. ""We certainly knew that he was having a tough time,"" he said.Â  ""That was no secret."" McLellan said her son was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. While he was receiving mental health services, McLellan didn't see her son getting better.Â  She said Brent had attempted suicide in the past. ""I really felt that's how he would die, by suicide,"" she said. ""You don't have children to bury them, that's for sure. You should not outlive your children."" As his family waited to find his body, they held Brent's funeral at Our Lady of the Assumption Church on July 24.Â  More than 800 people packed the church to remember him. They sang, ""Take me out to the ball game"" as the funeral procession left the church, so loud that McLellan thought the rafters were going to collapse. ""I think it surprised the family because I don't think they had any idea how many lives he had touched,"" Hunter said. He organized an honour guard of former Alpines players, who came to remember the player who once wore #7. While McLellan is happy to finally know where her son is, she's not sure she will ever have closure. ""People talk about closure, but our son is still gone,"" she said. Still, she is hoping something good can come out of her family's tragedy. McLellan would like to see more resources for people struggling with mental health issues and addictions. Most of all, she wants people to know it's OK to talk about mental health and addiction andÂ that they shouldn't be ashamed if they are sick. She was happy to see hundreds of people line the Reversing Falls Bridge last September to honour those who have died by suicide, including her son. ""It has to come to light more, be out in the public more,"" she said. ""People have to take advantage of what's out there and not be embarrassed by it."" After Brent died, McLellan went back into her messages to look at her final words to her son. ""Have a happy, happy day Brent,"" she wrote to her sonÂ on the morning before he died. ""He was so loved and I'm so glad he knew that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brent-mclellan-saint-john-1.5435279,[],N/A38,Anonymous,2020-01-20T16:44:26.337Z,Man arrested after armed robbery at Charlottetown bakery,"A 36-year-old Charlottetown man has been charged with armed robberyÂ and is in custody.

Wenaus, 27, penned and produced the song Dear Me â€”Â recorded by South Korean artistÂ Taeyeon for the re-release of her album Purpose â€” andÂ the balladÂ climbed to theÂ number one spot in 24 countries on iTunesÂ as more ears tuned in. Taeyeon was a member of South Korean group, Girls' Generation, for eight years before going solo.Â Wenaus said he thought TaeyeonÂ would be the ideal artist while writing the song. ""[Dear Me]Â gave me a bit of a platform to express feelings and ideas that I couldn't get through rock music,"" said Wenaus. It was a Girls' Generation song,Â Mister Mister,Â thatÂ first introduced the composer to K-pop in 2014.Â WenausÂ soon found himself writing more ballads andÂ K-pop seemed like a good fit due toÂ the sensitivity of the lyrics, he said. ""There's justÂ really, reallyÂ beautiful emotive stuff,"" he said about K-pop. ""I had things that I wanted to say and that was the medium through which I had to say those things."" Wenaus wrote and recorded the song in Regina with local musicians hired for instrumentation and vocals while he played piano. He shopped the composition around before it eventually found its way to the K-pop star. Taeyeon liked it. Her album,Â Purpose, was originally released in OctoberÂ and re-released last week with the addition of new songs, including Dear Me. Wenaus calls the song's success ""surreal,"" althoughÂ he had a feeling the songÂ would succeed because ofÂ Taeyeon.Â  Most of the song was translated from English to Korean, but Wenaus said Taeyeon's version captures the essence of the original â€”Â and a key part of the song was recorded in English. ""The hook in the chorus where it says 'I love myself. I trust myself,' that's from the original,"" Wenaus said. ""It's pretty cool because that's kind of become a global anthem.Â  ""That's pretty special and it seems to mean a lot to a lot of people which is also really, really fantastic."" Wenaus said his belief in himself, the inspiration for the song, is what got him to the point of pitching the song itself.Â  ""That idea of really trusting yourself and the direction that you're on ... that's how I did this."" ""That message is what got me there and that's pretty special."" The video currently hasÂ more than 11,500Â comments onÂ YouTube, which has more than 2.5 million views since it was released Jan. 15. ""I see pop music as at its best a form of care,"" said Wenaus.Â  ""You're reaching out to millions of people, andÂ even if it's three-and-a-half minutes out of a person's day,Â to pull them out of the hustle and bustle and craziness that we live in ... and to bring them joy is a special thing."" Since the song's release, Wenaus has received lots of support from family, friends and people in Saskatchewan who don't even know him but are proud of his success.Â  WenausÂ hopes to write from more K-pop acts and one day compose for films.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-musician-k-pop-song-success-1.5435446,[],N/A40,Anonymous,2020-01-17T21:42:54.203Z,N/A,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks,[],N/A41,Anonymous,2020-01-22T00:20:33.998Z,"New cabinet announced in crisis-hit Lebanon, but protests continue","A new cabinet was announced in crisis-hit Lebanon late Tuesday, breaking a months-long impasse amid mass protests against the country's ruling elite and a crippling financial crisis, but demonstrations and violence continued. Hassan Diab, a 60-year-old former professor at the American University of Beirut, announced a cabinet of 20 members â€” mostly specialists supported by the ShiaÂ group Hezbollah and allied political parties. The new government, which comes three months after former Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned, was rejected by protesters who have been calling for sweeping reforms and a government made up of independent technocrats that can deal with the country's economic and financial crisis, the worst since the 1975-90 civil war. Even before the cabinet was announced, thousands of people poured into the streets, closing major roads in the capital of Beirut and other parts of the country in protest. The protesters complained that political groups still were involved in the naming of the new ministers, even if they are specialists and academics. Later, a group of protesters near Parliament threw stones, firecrackers and sticks at security forces, who responded with tear gas and pepper spray. ""We want a government of experts ... who are they kidding?"" said one protester, Fadi Zakour. ""We have been protesting for 90 days and we are not happy to close roads,"" he added. Diab saluted the protesters in the street and vowed to ""work to fulfil your demands."" In a speech addressing the country following the government announcement, he added that his cabinet is the first government in the history of Lebanon to be made up entirely of technocrats. He insisted the 20 ministers are specialists who have no political loyalties and are not partisan. Diab appealed to citizens to help the government implement a ""rescue program"" and said this cabinet has the ""capability and qualifications, will and commitment"" to carry it through. ""It's time to get to work,"" Diab said. For three months, the leaderless protests have been calling for a government made up of specialists that can work on dealing with the economic crisis. The protests have recently turned violent, with around 500 people injured in confrontations between protesters and security forces over the weekend. Although the government announced Tuesday is technically made up of specialists, the ministers were named by political parties in a process involving horse trading and bickering with little regard for the demands of protesters for a transparent process and independent candidates. Still, among the ministers named were accomplished academics and six women, including the minister of defence and deputy prime minister. The number is a record for Lebanon, with women now holding more than quarter of the Cabinet posts, including those of defence, justice, labour, youth and sports and the displaced. ""The independence of justice will be among our top priorities and I will put all my efforts to move in this direction,"" Justice Minister Marie-Claude Najm told local LBC TV. Analysts said the new government, being politically aligned with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group, would likely have difficulty drumming up international and regional support needed to avoid economic collapse. ""The cabinet includes a fair number of capable technocrats, but it does not have any political independence to speak of,"" wrote Paul Salem, president of the Middle East Institute. ""This government is likely to be short lived, to preside over a steep decline in the economy, a dangerous swerve in the state's security relationships, and growing social and political unrest in the country,"" he predicted. The heads of the main ministries include career diplomat Naseef Hitti for the Foreign Ministry. Economist Ghazi Wazni was named finance minister and former army Gen. Mohammed Fahmi was named minister of the interior. Zeina Akar was named minister of defence and deputy prime minister. Lebanon has been without a government since Hariri resigned Oct. 29, two weeks into the unprecedented nationwide protest movement. Diab dismissed accusations that his was a government made up of one political camp consisting of Hezbollah and its allies, insisting it was the government of all of Lebanon. He also said it was natural to consult with political parties on the names of ministers, because in the end they are the ones that will decide the vote of confidence in Parliament needed for the cabinet. Diab said his first visit as prime minister will be to the Arab region, particularly to the Gulf Arab countries â€” a nod to Saudi Arabia, which was the main backer of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri. Backing from oil-rich Gulf countries is badly needed in Lebanon that has one of the highest debt ratios in the world. He said the government would get to work immediately and hold its first meeting Wednesday. Panic and anger have gripped the public as the Lebanese pound, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummeted in value. It fell more than 60 per centÂ in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and flows of foreign currency dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most basic goods. Shortly before the cabinet was announced Tuesday night, the Syndicate of Money Changers in Lebanon issued a statement saying it had agreed to set the exchange rate at a maximum of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, after it reached 2,500 pounds to the dollar last week. The official price still stands at 1,507 to the dollar.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-lebanon-cabinet-1.5435450,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/beirut-rocked-lebanon-clashes-1.5432673 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-protests-1.5431739 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/lebanon-beirut-economy-protests-margaret-evans-1.5421371,N/A42,Anonymous,2020-01-04T17:00:00.459Z,Your North: Best reader photos for the week of December 30,"Ring in the new year with some incredible shots from across the territories, as we bring you the best reader-submitted photos from the past week.

Both say they are encouraging the two sides to come together at the bargaining table. ""This ongoing and escalating conflict is causing problems for the workers, for that business, for the economy in Regina and the province,"" Meili told reporters in Saskatoon. ""It's causing folks to have concerns about safety when we're talking about such an important and and high-level facility,"" Meili said.Â  In his reply to Meili, Moe agreed the dispute, which entered its 48th day on Tuesday, should be resolved at the bargaining table. An Occupational Health and Safety inspection was completed at the Refinery earlier this month, he said, and no contraventions were issued. Minister of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Don Morgan said in a statement that the ministry encouraged both sides to resume bargaining. Tensions escalated Monday evening when dozens of Regina Police Service members were dispatched to the scene and arrested union members for mischief. ""I also reinforced the government's expectation that any action taken during the ongoing labour dispute be lawful and peaceful,"" Morgan's statement said. ""While our government is concerned with the increasingly aggressive tactics being used in this labour dispute, we are encouraged by the Regina Police Service's diligence in upholding the law and keeping the peace."" Fourteen people â€” including Unifor national president Jerry DiasÂ â€” are facing charges after the latest escalationsÂ in the dispute. UniforÂ 594, which represents about 800 workers at the refinery, issued a 48-hour strike notice in early December. Workers were locked out on Dec. 5, 2019. In December, afterÂ picketers blocked trucks from entering the refinery, aÂ Regina judge issuedÂ an injunction stating picketers could block trucks for a maximum of 10 minutes.Â  Unifor saysÂ the injunction only applies to Unifor 594 members and does not apply to the national body. This week workersÂ set up barricades at entrances to block people and trucks from entering the refinery. Dias said it was done by workers from other locals. The refineryÂ said on Monday that the blockades were illegal and a ""bullying tactic."" Police went to the barricades Monday and read an order calling for the picketersÂ to remove the barriers or face legal consequences. Over the course of Monday afternoon and eveningÂ 14 people were arrested, charged with mischief and later released. Eight were from Ontario, four from B.C. and two from Regina.Â Unifor national president Jerome Dias â€” known as Jerry â€” was one of them. Dias said Tuesday that police had been aggressive and that he had neverÂ seen a police department behave how they did.Â  ""There's one common role amongst the police. It's to ensure that situations do not escalate. This is not what happened last night,"" Dias said. ""It was clear that the sole purpose that they were there was to escalate the situation."" Regina Police Chief Evan Bray said at a news conference Tuesday thatÂ Unifor has the right to protest and the Refinery has the right to operate their business. ""The reality is that we have two sides in a labour dispute that each have rights and are very vigilant to protect their rights,"" Regina Police Chief Evan Bray said.Â  He said police need to step in when one sideÂ crosses the line and affects the rights of the other.Â  BrayÂ said the mischief charges were not related to the court injunction. HeÂ saidÂ what happened Monday was, ""a complete disregard for the law.""Â  ""I'm so proud of the officers that were on scene for the professionalism, the respect, the patience and the integrity that they held at the scene,"" he said. ""They took a lot and gave very little back."" A video has been circulating of Dias' arrest. Bray said the arresting officer didn't know who Dias was at the time and treated him with respect.Â  ""I don't know what he wanted. I don't know that gentleman at all. I know that sometimes if you give a person a fur coat they think they're King Kong. And at the end of the day nobody's above the law,"" Bray said. Dias said he was arrested by ""an incredibly aggressive policeman"" and has been ordered not to go within 500 metresÂ of the Refinery.Â  ""My father has an old saying you give somebody a fur coat and they'll think they're King Kong,""Â  Dias said, using the same language Bray had in the earlier news conference.Â ""[The officer] was determined he was going to get in my face."" Dias said he spent seven hours in a cell at the police station. He said the police kept him for longer than other people arrested at the picket because of who he was. ""This is a situation where the mayor and others need to get directly involved because you can't have the police acting as thugs,"" Dias said.Â  Mayor Michael Fougere saidÂ there's a lot of anger and emotion in the dispute.Â  ""I'm appealing to the members of Unifor to understand the issue of public safety is actually critical as they go about their business,"" Fougere said.Â  Bray said more arrests could happen as police gather video and other evidence.Â  Dias said Unifor will pay the legal fees of anyone arrested. The 14 people charged Monday are all scheduled to appear in court on Feb.Â 26.Â  Dias said more Unifor members are flying in from around the country to support the Regina members as a result of the arrests. Bray said policeÂ are going to maintain the law.Â  ""Let's not ignore the fact that when we fly people in from other provinces â€” they have no vested interest in our community or community safety,"" Bray said. ""Their role is to come here and to cause challenges that are going to hopefully force them to get back to the bargaining table."" On Tuesday morning, Unifor members put up fences and placed cars as barriers to block the entrance to the refinery. Some of the carsÂ had their tires slashed to make them harder to tow away. Other vehicles have no tires and are on jacks.Â  Unifor said they had to put up the fences to protect their members. CBC has reached out to the Co-op Refinery Complex for comment.Â  Bray said police are assessing their response at every turn and putting together a game plan. He said he hopes the two sides can come together at the bargaining table and find a solution. ""Right now both sides are essentially holding our city hostage,"" Bray said. ""I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers of our city."" The dispute mainly comes down to pensions. A previous deal included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan.Â  The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-fences-barricades-tuesday-1.5434389,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/windsor-unifor-leader-charged-regina-protests-1.5435184 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-president-jerry-dias-custody-1.5433520 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/meet-the-scabs-union-labour-dispute-1.5421854,N/A44,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-22T12:02:58.557Z,"Increasing electric vehicle sales not complicated, says Norway's deputy environment minister","More than 40 per cent of new vehicles sold in Norway are powered by electricity, not gas, and the country's deputy environment minister believes P.E.I. could hit that same target. Sveinung Rotevatn said the country has done it simply by making electric vehicles a good deal. ""The most important incentive would be that the vehicle would be exempt from all taxes,"" said Rotevatn. ""In Norway we tax regular cars quite heavily and have been for many years. So if you want to buy a great vehicle at a cheap price, the electric vehicle would be your option."" The incentives don't stop when you've purchased your car. Norway provides special commuter lanes and free parking, and exemptions from road and ferry tolls. Rotevatn said it was important for Norway to look at vehicles if it was going to reduce its carbon footprint. While other countries have been able to cut back on a carbon-fueled power grid, Norway was already running on abundant hydroelectricity. It is a situation similar to P.E.I.'s, where transportation is the source of 48 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Norway also faced similar climate and geographic challenges. ""Norway with its cold winter climate, vast distances, sparse populations, is probably, in theory, the worst country in the world to try to launch an electric mobility revolution,"" said Rotevatn. ""If you can do it here you can do it anywhere. And that means you can also obviously do it in P.E.I. and then in Canada."" There are two basic options for encouraging electric vehicle purchase, he said. Make the vehicles cheaper, or make gas more expensive. Norway opted for cheaper vehicles, he said, because more expensive gas can have a disproportionate effect on lower-income people, who may not be able to afford to buy a new vehicle. Rotevatn believes one way or another, running an electric vehicle needs to be the cheaper option for people. ""The environmentally-best option also needs to be the cheapest option for people,"" he said. ""I don't think there is enough idealism in the world that people are going to be willingly spending more on a car than they have to to save the environment."" Rotevatn said the only thing keeping electric vehicle sales from being even higher in Norway is a lack of models that are appropriate for large families or work purposes.

""It's outrageous. It's patently wrong. It's deceptive,"" Marco, 65, told Go Public from his home in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. In October, he filed a complaint with the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) â€” and he's got company.Â According to the industry mediator's annual report, consumers filed aÂ record-breaking number of complaints against Canada's telecom companies in 2018-19 â€” nearly 19,300.Â  The CCTSÂ says that figure isÂ a 35 per cent increase over 2017-18 and an all-time high in the organization's 12-year history.Â  ""It's disappointing to see â€_ issues that customers shouldn't have to deal with,"" saidÂ CCTSÂ Commissioner Howard Maker. ""It tells us that there's still room for improvement."" The report, released Thursday, tracks complaints received between Aug.Â 1, 2018 andÂ July 31, 2019, of which the greatest share (over 40 per cent) were billing errors, followed by contract disputes (over 30 per cent) and dissatisfaction with service delivery (over 20 per cent).Â  CCTS says it ""successfully resolved"" 91 per cent of all concluded complaints. Bell Canada, the country's largest telecom, with 22 million subscriptions, received the most complaints â€” almost 5,900. (A customer with multiple services from the same providerÂ can be associated with several subscriptions.) Complaints against Bell about incorrect charges and ""disclosure of important information"" were ""disproportionately high,""Â according to the report.Â  A Bell spokesperson notes the company's share of total complaints declined slightly over the previous year, and that it is reviewing the report to ""ensure that they continue to provide customers with the best experience.""Â  Rogers, which has about 16 million subscriptions, received just over 1,800 complaints.Â Its share of complaints also slightly decreased over the previous year.Â  Rogers had a ""disproportionately high percentage""Â of complaints about incorrect charges on wireless accounts, butÂ received a slightly lower proportion of complaints about credits and refunds that weren't received on internet services.Â  A RogersÂ spokesperson said the company had the fewest complaints per subscriber among the national carriers and has ""started to see progress"" in improving its customer service. Telus, with 14.5 million subscribers, received just over 1,600 complaints â€”Â up 71 per cent.Â  Most of those were about either changes to wireless contracts (28 per cent) or wireless price increases (30 per cent), according to the report.Â It received a lower proportion of complaints about incorrect wireless charges and contract disputes. ""Shame on us that we had language that was confusing and not transparent,"" Tony Geheren, executive VP at Telus, told Go Public. He says the increase in complaints was a result of a ""poorly executed rate change"" for wireless customers and that Telus has since simplified its contracts.Â  The report notes 158 violations of the Wireless Code â€”Â a 42 per cent increase. Most involved a failure of companies to provide customers with key documents, and not giving proper notice before disconnecting a customer's service. Bell accounted for 29 per cent of all Wireless Code breaches, while Rogers and Telus each accounted for 20 per cent.Â  Marco'sÂ frustration began last March, when he says a Bell sales representativeÂ promised him internet, TV and home phone service for $119.90 a month for two years. But in September,Â the price for his TV service went up by $3.50. When he called Bell, he recorded the conversation, and a second rep told him to look at the contract the company emailed him after he verbally agreed to sign up â€” it mentions that prices are ""subject to change."" Marco says he didn't scrutinize the contract, because he was going with what the first rep offered him on the phone.Â He requested a transcript of that conversation but was toldÂ that wasn't possible.Â  ""There will be no way for us, sir, to send you a copy of the transcript,"" the rep said. Marco says that's nonsense. ""The contract was the phone call. They're denying that they have the contract,"" he said.Â  He says a storyÂ reported by Go Public last yearÂ supports his argument â€” a case that went to small claims court determined that a verbal agreement between a customer and Bell trumps any written contract that the telecom giant emails after the fact. CCTS investigated but said it couldn't help, because according to Bell the transcript no longer existed. The company only holds them for six months which, according to a Bell spokesperson, is ""standard practice"" in the industry. ""I think that's problematic,"" said Maker, the head of the CCTS.Â  ""We've spent a lot of time asking the CRTC â€_ to ensure that service providers are retaining records so that an independent investigation can be obtained and the actual facts can be determined."" ""The ability to â€_ investigate what happened is limited in the absence of that phone call."" Consumer advocateÂ John LawfordÂ says what's really needed is a ban on price increases for internet and TV during the life of a contract â€” the same way companies aren't permitted to jack up prices during a cellphone contract. ""The Wireless Code doesn't let you change your wireless pricing for two years,"" Lawford, executive director of theÂ Public Interest Advocacy Centre, told Go Public. ""It kind of sets the trap for consumers who are expecting the same protections on internet and TV as they have on their wireless phone."" He says the CRTC missed a ""golden opportunity"" when it created similar rules for internet service, which comeÂ into effect on Jan.Â 31.Â  ""They allowed the Internet Code to go into effect without the rule that you have to keep the price the same,"" says Lawford. ""It is a very big missed opportunity."" Lawford doesn't think the telco giants will lock in prices for internet and TV contracts unless the regulator demands it. He says people fed up with ""unfair"" contracts should complain to the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and their MP.Â  ""Put pressure on those powers that be â€” to make the rules for internet and TV the same as they are for as they are for wireless,"" says Lawford.Â  Meantime, Marco says heÂ will find another provider when his two-year contract is over. For now, he has advice for anyone calling a telecom.Â  ""Record the conversation. Record anything â€” incoming and outgoing,"" he says. ""Because it's the only protection that they'll get.""

Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed â€”Â $3,000 â€”Â to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.Â  The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime. ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Ã_le-des-ChÃªnes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account."" Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud â€” all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudstersÂ strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements. Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit saysÂ because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves. ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should â€_ be more proactive."" As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone. That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back. ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious."" He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank â€”Â which TD wouldn't name â€”Â and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate. TD said theÂ fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""Â  Because it wasn't hard for the fraudsterÂ to figure out the answer â€”Â the contractor named his wife on his Facebook pageÂ â€”Â TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank'sÂ electronic financial terms and conditions. The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.Â  Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketingÂ claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,""Â so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer. ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.Â  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.Â  They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.Â  In smaller print â€”Â or, buried in online agreements â€”Â banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.Â  ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service â€”Â which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating."" All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.Â  Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases: Watch:Â Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?Â  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bankÂ reached out to him again.Â  Trudeau says theyÂ have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement. TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it tookÂ seven months to resolve the problem.Â  In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote:Â ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""Â  In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen. ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?"" She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard â€”Â as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted."" CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January. Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.Â  CBA spokesperson Mathieu LabrÃ¨che declined to be interviewed but said in a statementÂ that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg."" He saidÂ financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm."" ""If customers start leaving â€_ that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police."" Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police. ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner."" Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustratingÂ and has changed his online banking habits. He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money â€”Â $20 is now his limit. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

""We had a financial crisis because people didn't understand what would happen if their mortgage rates went up slightly,"" he told The Current's host Matt Galloway. ""And we have an environmental crisis because people can't add up the consequences of their actions because we're so afraid of math or numbers."" Mighton recently published a book on the subject: All Things Being Equal: Why Math is the Key to a Better World.Â  Math teaches you ""to create arguments, to look for hidden presuppositions, to see patterns, make inferences,"" he says. ""We'd have a much healthier society if people didn't immediately seize on the first explanation of an event. If they were trained in probability, they'd learn to consider all the possibilities,"" he said. ""And more deeply, if people were confident in their problem-solving abilities, they would actually think deeply about the problems before they arrived at an opinion."" Mighton, who is also the founder of JUMP MathÂ â€” a Toronto-based charitable organization promoting numeracy â€” wasn't always a numbers evangelist.Â  In fact, until he was 30 years old, he didn't even think he was very good at it. But as a young, struggling playwright, he decided to pick up a side gig as an elementary school math tutor. He ended up discovering he loved the subject. ""It was a revelation to me that by explaining the math and working at it over and over at my own pace, things that were mysterious to me became easier and easier,"" he said. Mighton realized that for yearsÂ he had bought into what he says is a far too common misconception: that math is difficult and most people don't get it. ""We have to drop that myth because at all levels, from early childhood development right up to brain scans of mathematicians, the research is suggesting that math is accessible to any brain,"" he said. The issue, Mighton says, is that math tends to be taught in ways ""that aren't really well supported by evidence in the science of learning."" For example, teachers and parents often try to teach problem-solving skills by starting out with complex, multi-step math problems, he says. But math, he explains, is more like a ladder than other subjects: ""If you miss something, it's very hard to go on."" If those initial steps are missed, not only does it become difficult to learn those more complex concepts, but even young children will quickly decide they're not so-called math people, he says. ""There's research that suggests as early as Grade 1, kids know where they are in the hierarchy. They know if they're in the inferior group,"" he said. ""Once you decide you're in the inferior group, you stop engaging, working, you stop remembering things. Eventually you develop anxieties by Grade 3 or Grade 4, and it makes it very hard for your brain to work."" Instead, he says educators should introduce math concepts in bite-sized chunks, or what he calls ""more scaffolded problems,"" and then gradually work their way up to tougher problems. ""The key is keeping the student in a zone that they can be confident and think,"" he said. Mighton says he's been astounded by the potential of children when they're taught in this way. He recalled teaching a class full of students with violent behavioural issues, ""who were thought to be unteachable."" Mighton taught them how to read binary code, and how to use it to do a magic trick.Â  ""They went nuts. They thought they were little code breakers,"" he said.Â  On their third lesson, the children actually cheered when Mighton and his team came in. ""It tells me there's just this inestimable potential in children, not only for learning, but for a sense of wonder and curiosity."" ""Kids enjoy doing math as much as playing sports or creating art if they're allowed to succeed."" Written by Allie Jaynes.

The request for expressions of interest, issued Monday, comes as the city reviews its assets and operations to alleviate the financial burden on the municipal government. The 16-page document states it's not a call for tenders but instead an opportunity ""to identify possible partners who are interested in either leasing and operating or purchasing and operating TD Station as a major events facility through a mode that is economically sustainable and benefits the Greater Saint John Region."" It states the city will consider ""all types of possible partnerships."" ""There are a number of potential types of partnerships whereby the importance of the facility to the Region could be protected but perhaps with reduced overall costs,"" Saint John Mayor Don Darling said in a release Monday, ""At this point, we are in the early exploratory stages to find out what they might be. Deliberations and a decision to proceed with any interested party will only be made once options are explored and City staff report to Common Council with a business case."" Proponents will be evaluated on the ability to operate a major events facility and develop a business plan demonstrating long-term sustainability. The city said any interested parties must keep the 6,600-seat, city-owned facility as a sports and entertainment venue. The deadline for submissions is Feb. 14.Â  ""Selling it, leasing it, I'm prepared to look at everything,"" Coun. Donna Reardon told CBC News on Monday evening. ""I think it's a reasonable thing for the city to do, to at least look at those options."" Facing anticipated $10-million deficits in 2021 and 2022, the city embarked on a restructuring campaign to overhaul its finances. One part of the plan is to reduce its commitments to five city-owned regional facilities, including TD Station. For more than 20 years, the cost of operating the facilities has been shared with Quispamsis, Rothesay and Grand Bay-Westfield, with Saint John picking up two-thirds of the tab and all capital costs.Â  ""I guess we're at crossroads where we say, 'That really isn't a model that's working for us, so how do we either change the model or where do we go from here,'"" Reardon said. In November, the province introduced legislative amendments that would see 12 other surrounding communities chip in up to $470,000 toward operating costs, starting this year, with capital costs being added on in 2021. Reardon said it's unclear just yet how those amendments could be affected by handing TD Station to a private operator. Asked if the restructuring plan could result in more requests for expressions of interest on other city assets, Reardon said it's a possibility. ""Everything is going to be looked at; every rock is going to be overturned,"" she said. ""It's time, for one thing. If we're going to spend wisely, you can't ignore that."" Reardon said the city has to consider if it's the best operator of such a venue â€” a sentiment shared by the mayor. ""The private sector has a proven track record of handling large-scale facilities like TD Station very successfully in communities across Canada,"" Darling said. ""For the benefit of Saint John, we want to know if the same type of partnership could work here."" TD Station, formerly known as Harbour Station, opened in 1993 and has hosted a number of major events, including the World Curling Championships, the East Coast Music Awards, and often hosts renowned musicians and comedians.Â  It's also home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and previously hosted the Saint John Riptide before the National Basketball League of Canada franchise announced last summer it was taking a sabbatical to restructure its finances.

He has been studying the issue of privatization in Canada, is theÂ author of a chapter on Canadian health care in the book 'Is Two-Tier Health Care the Future?,' and has collaborated with the University of Toronto and University of Ottawa.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. Be careful what you wish for, Canada. One way or the other, Canadian courts are about to make some key decisions about the role of private financing and practice in the health care system; the Cambie case in British Columbia is just the latest attempt to overturn fundamental components of publicly funded medicare.Â  Closing arguments were made last week and the decision in this legal case, which is expected to be appealed to the Supreme Court, will have ramifications for decades and for millions of people. So, what can international experience teach us? One particularly illuminating case is Ireland. It is striking that as Canada seems on the cusp of embracing two-tier health care, Ireland is struggling to limit it. In 1957, the Irish Republic decided to set up a voluntary health insurer owned by the state to take the pressure off the public system, allowing health care to be bought by those who had the means. It sounded reasonable, and 60 years later, private health insurance has taken off with almost half the population covered and plans offered by private companies. This allows faster access to public care subsidized by the state, and queue-jumping of the very long waiting lists by those who are better off financially. Despite only accounting for 12 per cent of total health funds, however, private insurance in Ireland now drives access to hospital care â€“ the tail that wags the dog. Private health insurance occupies a unique role in the Irish setting, providing faster access to care in both public- and private-provider settings. However, it does not always cover hospital expenses and often covers a fraction or nothing at all for non-hospital care, such as outpatient appointments with a specialist, GP visits, and care from allied health professionals. It also does not cover drug costs (there is a government reimbursement threshold for households spending more than a fixed amount in a month). Moreover, the benefits of queue jumping only accrue to those who are able to afford private health insurance premiumsÂ â€”Â and there are concerns about that affordability. The cost of insurance varies hugely by product and there are more than 300 hospital plans, but for an adult with public and private hospital coverage, the cheapest is around $1,900 per year. A recent study showed that roughly 19 per cent of households experience unaffordable private health expenditures, which includes both private health insurance and co-payments. The latest household survey suggests that people are going without some GP services and dental care in order to afford health insurance plans. Ireland has historically been way off the pace when it comes to delivering universal health care. It is an outlier in Europe, with one of the highest proportions of national income spent on voluntary health insurers â€”Â 13 per cent in 2017, compared to an EU average of 2 per cent. The result is two-tier access to acute care, and only very average results in terms of health outcomes. (The other two countries with large voluntary health insurance sectors are France and Slovenia, but their insurers cover co-payments and they do not allow faster access). Rather than helping the public sector out, private insurance may have contributed to its problems in Ireland. It erodes solidarity, giving the well-off a way out of engaging with the public sector, and potentially aggravating under-funding by making the better-off less willing to be taxed more for health. It also means that dual-practice providers â€“ those who work in both the public and private sectors â€”Â have an incentive to keep their public waiting lists long to boost their private practices. Private insurance also costs every taxpayer regardless of their insurance status, because the government subsidizes those who take out private insurance by offering tax breaks. As a potential way out of this two-tier system, the Fine Gael Labour government of 2011 proposed Irish private insurers become the basis of a universal health insurance system, modelled on the Dutch managed competition system. However, this policy cul-de-sac proved too expensive and too complex, and it has now been abandoned for a more typical re-energizing of the public system in the guise of the ""SlÃ¡intecare"" policy. The core aims of SlÃ¡intecare are to establish a universal, single-tier health service where patients are treated solely on the basis of health need and funded through general taxation. This means a removal of private insurance funding from public hospitals over a period of six years, with waiting-time guarantees backed up by increased accountability and information. In other words, a return to publicly funded health care. Nevertheless, the disentangling of the public and private systems is complicated; it will take careful planning, coalition-building, and changing the public narrative about the nature of the health system. The introduction of private health insurance in Ireland allowed a two-tier system to develop with long waiting lists in the public system and limited financial protection for households. It has impeded a fair, efficient and integrated system, and there has been profiteering by some insurers since the liberalization. It has taken decades to develop a plan that will disentangle public and private health careÂ financing in Ireland. Implementation will take another 10 years at least. While Canada might be considering an expanded role for private health services and insurance, such a decision needs to be taken with sober judgment. It cannot be easily unwound.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-two-tier-health-care-canada-ireland-1.5383995,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cambie-surgery-centre-trial-1.5363013 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/closing-arguments-begin-in-legal-case-over-private-health-care-in-b-c-1.5364329 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/surgery-wait-times-alberta-shandro-reduce-1.5390893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/extremely-concerned-protesters-decry-ontario-health-care-cuts-changes-1.5354513 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lawrencetown-cooperative-doctor-recruitment-telehealth-maple-out-of-pocket-1.5138483,N/A52,Wallis Snowdon,2020-01-20T14:45:00.465Z,'Real life on fake Mars': Edmonton doctor on out-of-this-world mission in Utah,"Shawna Pandya doesn't need a rocket flight to experience life on Mars.

She took only a few days off work after theÂ city of Victoria was hit with a snowstorm last week that forced schools and businesses to close. TheÂ lawyer, who turned 100 on Sunday and was feted by family and friends,Â doesn't feel her age, saying 100 doesn't seem much different than 70, 80 or 90. She credits her intrigue with the law for her longevity. ""So that keeps you interested, and of course, going to work keeps your body active and mind active, which is a good thing at any age,"" Isherwood told As It Happens host Carol Off. A graduate of the University of British Columbia in 1951 and one of only eight women in her law class of 200, Isherwood practises general civil law, which she saidÂ ""means a bit of everything,"" including real estate, family law and corporate law.Â  ""I never went in for criminal law much,"" she said, about runningÂ the Holmes & Isherwood law practice with her late husband. ""I left that for the boys to do, and I did a bit of everything else."" Isherwood said she was fortunate because she didn't face the same difficulties of breaking into a male-dominatedÂ professionÂ that other women encountered in the 1950s. She had been a legal secretary and worked for a lawyer before attending law school, and returned to the same firm when she graduated top of her class.Â  ""So, I do feel that I was lucky in that respect,"" she said. However, she said many women back then found it difficultÂ even to complete their articlingÂ after graduation and to beÂ placed in a lawÂ firm. But times haveÂ changed. She advises those just getting into law to be approachable. ""Let people feel they can come and talk things over with you without being entirely intimidated or worried. That helps them, and actually, it's quite rewarding for the lawyer,"" she said. To stay vital and young, she advises people to take care of themselves and to keep workingÂ â€”Â and toÂ smile andÂ be optimistic. ""The person who wrote, When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You),Â heÂ knew what he was talking about."" Many people still keep asking her when she'll retire, and her line hasÂ always been: ""Maybe next year."" ""But now that I'm 100,Â I don't know whether that answer is quite suitable, and how many next years there are,"" she said.

Home and School Federation, Opposition criticize for-profit involvement in school lunch plan","Both the P.E.I. Home and School Federation and the Official Opposition say the provincial government should steer clear of private, for-profit food companies in developing a new school lunch program. Two weeks ago the province's Department of Education laid out the parameters for a pilot of the new program with two tracks â€” one involving private companies providing healthy meals for students, the other using Public Schools Branch staff to prepare meals at Kinkora Regional High School, distributing those to nearby schools. ""School food and profit don't really go well together,"" said Karla Bernard, education critic for the Green Party and chair of the province's standing committee on education and economic growth.Â  ""You know this isn't about making money, this is about feeding kids."" The overall plan is for government to roll out a healthy lunch program at all Island schools in the fall of 2020, based on the results of the two competing pilots involving six schools.Â  At a meeting on Jan. 7, MLAs on the education committee were told the model used could vary from school-to-school, some using the not-for-profit model, some using private companies â€”Â Chartwells at Montague High used as one example â€” who already provide services in the schools. Following a discussion at its board meeting Monday night, the P.E.I. Home and School Federation said it's hoping to see a non-profit lunch program emerge. What will be served in the school food program? Here is a draft menu for the pilot at Kinkora Regional High School. <a href=""https://twitter.com/PSBPEI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@PSBPEI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/EducationPEI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@EducationPEI</a> <a href=""https://t.co/DJa5J6VkVr"">pic.twitter.com/DJa5J6VkVr</a> ""When you're talking not-for-profit that means you can support local, that the well-being of children is the number one priority of such a program, not profit,"" said federation president Cory Thomas. The federation has been advocating for a universal lunch program since 2015, Thomas noted.Â  He said a non-profit model would receive support from donors in the community, and be more likely to incorporate local ingredients into meal plans. ""At the end of the day, our role is to advocate for children and a non-profit model would assist with poverty reduction in communities buying local,"" he said. Government is setting a maximum price point of $5 for lunches, but offering financial support so families that can't afford meals can still take part. ""I think we all agree that it's going to have potential for such a great impact long-term on P.E.I., the health of our population and an immediate impact on students' ability to learn,"" said Education Minister Brad Trivers. Trivers said some government funding during the pilot might end up going to the private companies involved to allow them to provide meals at the $5 price point. He said regardless of whether schools end up preparing their own meals in-house or with a private company, the service will be the same. ""It is not about making a profit,"" said Trivers. ""We're going to use private contractors in areas where it makes sense. Where they can deliver service at a value that we can't match in-house."" Trivers said ultimately all school lunch programs, whether non-profit or privately run, will come under the administration of a new charitable organization, which government has suggested will be supported by donations from the public and corporations. When asked if the public might be less willing to donate to an organization paying private corporations to provide school meals, Trivers said ""That's definitely a valid concern. But that's why we're doing the pilot. That's why we're giving everyone a chance to see what it looks like.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-school-federation-oppose-private-food-companies-1.5435050,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-lunches-free-motion-passes-1.5427677 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-lunch-program-1.5418313 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-copper-bottom-expansion-1.5434775 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oleary-fire-dog-saves-owner-1.5433694,N/A55,Anonymous,2020-01-22T12:00:24.138Z,"U.S. Senate approves Trump impeachment trial plan, rejects Democrats on documents, witnesses","The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted early on Wednesday on party lines to approve the rules for President Donald Trump'sÂ impeachmentÂ trial, rejecting Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and ensure witnesses are heard. As the third presidentialÂ impeachmentÂ trial in U.S. history began in earnest, Trump's chief legal defender argued the Democratic case was a baseless effort to overturn the 2016 election, but a top Democratic lawmaker said there was ""overwhelming"" evidence of wrongdoing. Trump was impeached last month by the House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and impeding the inquiry into the matter. The president denies any wrongdoing. After U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts convened the proceedings, the two sides began more than 12 hours of squabbling that lasted into Wednesday morning over Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposed rules for the trial. Senators voted along party lines, 53-47, to block four separate motions from Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to subpoena records and documents from the White House, the State Department, the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine. By the same tally, senators also rejected requests for subpoenas seeking the testimony of acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton, White House aide Robert Blair and White House budget official Michael Duffey. Under McConnell's hastily revised set of procedures for the trial, there will be 48 hours of opening arguments â€”Â 24 hours for each side â€”Â over six days, easing off an earlier plan to keep them to two days each. It also allows the House's record of the probe to be admitted as evidence. The arguments will begin when the trial resumes at 1 p.m. ETÂ on Wednesday. WATCH | How the impeachment trial may play out: Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point after opening arguments and 16 hours of senators' questions, but they held firm with Trump's lawyers to block Tuesday's Democratic requests for witnesses and evidence,Â a potentially good sign for the White House. White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is leading Trump's defence, attacked the foundation of the Democrats' charges against the Republican president and said they had not come close to meeting the U.S. Constitution's standard for impeachment. ""The only conclusion will be that the president has done absolutely nothing wrong,"" Cipollone said as he argued in favour of McConnell's proposal to decide on whether to allow further witnesses or documents later in the trial. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. After a particularly heated exchange over whether Bolton should testify, Roberts admonished both parties to remember they were addressing the world's greatest deliberative body. ""I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,"" he said. WATCH |Â CipolloneÂ calls the trial 'a partisan impeachment' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who helped spearhead the House impeachment inquiry, summarized the charges against Trump and said the Republican president had committed a ""trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment."" Schiff said that although the evidence against Trump was ""already overwhelming,"" further witness testimony was necessary to show the full scope of the misconduct of the president and those around him. Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further testimony and evidence at some point after opening arguments and senators' questions. But Democrats said they forced repeated votes on evidence and witnesses, which extended late into the night, to get Republicans on the record immediately. Democrats want a number of current and former Trump administration officials, including Bolton, to testify. ""For all of the name-calling and finger-pointing from the president's counsel, we did not hear a single argument on the merits about why there should not be the documents and witnesses we requested in this trial,""Â Schumer said. WATCH |Â Rep. SchiffÂ makes his argument against the proposed rules: Under McConnell's plan, lawyers for Trump could move early in the proceedings to ask senators to dismiss all charges, according to a senior Republican leadership aide, a motion that would likely fall short of the support needed to succeed. Even if such a motion fails, Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the 100-member chamber, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. McConnell has repeatedly said the rules for the trial would mirror those the Senate used in the 1999 impeachment of President Bill Clinton, and Republican senators have not ruled out the possibility of further witness testimony and evidence. SchumerÂ took great exception to the comparison during a morning news conference. ""The McConnell Rules are not even close to the Clinton Rules,"" said Schumer, pointing to theÂ compressed timeline for presenting the case and the allowance of a dismissal motion at any point during the trial. ""McConnell wants a trial with no existing or new evidence,"" he said. Democrats accuse Trump of pressuring a vulnerable ally to interfere in U.S. elections at the expense of American national security and say he needs to be removed from office because he is a danger to American democracy and national security. Trump and his legal team say there was no pressure and that the Democrats' case is based on hearsay. Cipollone has described the Ukraine investigation as an illegal attempt to remove a democratically elected president and avert his re-election. ""They're not here to steal one election, they're here to steal two elections,""Â Cipollone said on Tuesday. Cipollone also repeated a trope that Republicans were excluded from the secure facility where the initial depositions for the House impeachment hearings took place. In fact, Republican members of the House intelligence committee were not only present but questioned witnesses. At the heart of the impeachment trial is Trump's request to Ukraine in July to investigate Joe Biden, a top Democratic contender to face Trump in the 2020 election, and his son Hunter. The younger Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for a period that included over two years while his father was U.S. vice-president. Trump also sought the announcement of a probe based on a discredited theory involving the hacking of Democratic computers ahead of the 2016 election, which have been attributed by the U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate as being the work of Kremlin-connected Russian actors. Democrats charge that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine that had been approved by the Pentagon and Congress, with the money only released as it became public knowledge that a whistleblower had lodged a complaint after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. Last week,Â a congressional watchdog foundÂ the White House broke the law by withholding the security aid.Â The assessment from the non-partisan Government Accountability Office was seen as a setback for Trump, but it remains unclearÂ whether it will figure in his trialÂ given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered. The obstruction of Congress charge relates to Trump directing administration officials and agencies not to comply with House subpoenas for testimony and documents related to impeachment. Trump has sought to rally his base with the impeachment issue, fundraising off it and at raucous election rallies painting himself as the victim of a witch hunt. Trump is attending the annual gathering of world business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday to project an air of business as usual and tout the strength of the U.S. economy. Asked whether Trump was planning to watch theÂ trial, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, ""He has a full day here in Davos, but will be briefed by staff periodically."" This is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history. No president has ever been removed through impeachment, a mechanism the nation's founders â€” worried about a monarch on American soil â€” devised to oust a president for ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" Bill Clinton, like Andrew Johnson in the 19th century, was acquitted in the Senate, while Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before a full House vote on articles of impeachment could occur. With a two-thirds majority needed in the 100-member Senate to remove Trump from office, he is almost certain to be acquitted by fellow Republicans in the chamber. But the impact of the trial on his re-election bid is far from clear. Trump, 73, has gone through a succession of controversies since taking office in January 2017. House Leader Nancy Pelosi had previously resisted pressure from her party's left flank to take the step after special counsel Robert Mueller spelled out instances in which Trump sought to impede the federal inquiry that documented 2016 Russian election interference to boost Trump's candidacy.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-house-vote-analysis-1.5401650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-1.5429169 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/what-will-history-say-about-the-trump-impeachment-1.5400734,N/A56,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-20T16:47:38.080Z,Police say missing Truro man was killed,"RCMP say a man who went missing in Truro, N.S., in August was the victim of a homicide, even though his body has not been found.

The future for Canada's soon-to-retire demographic","With more than five million Canadians set to turn 65 this decade, the 2020s will be the decade where many of the so-called ""baby boomer"" generation head to retirement. As the generation that has, arguably, been shaping many aspects of our society throughout their lives, this will be a big shift for Canada's economyÂ â€” both for life in and outside of the workplace, and for many industries across the country. Almost all boomers willÂ turn 65 or olderÂ and become senior citizens in this decade,Â except for those born in 1965. The generation is defined as including those born from 1946 to 1965 in Canada, with more than eightÂ million babies born in this country. Making sure retiring baby boomers have enough money as they leave the workforce could be a major challenge, and where experts say we could see changes in policy. Lower interest rates are part of the concern, according to the RBC report, which pointed out that the lower rates of the past decade have increased household wealth by helping increase real estate values, for example. ""If you look at where interest rates are right now â€_ threeÂ per cent, four per cent, fiveÂ per cent would be a great return [from] six million dollars. That would give you $50,000Â a year,"" estimated economist Linda Nazareth, who works in demographics. ""That used to be enough for a lot of people, or a reasonable pension even if they didn't have the highest paying job. So if you take away that pension, you're asking people to save oneÂ million or twoÂ million or even half a million [dollars]. A lot of people have not done that."" Essentially, low interest rates are great if you are trying to buy a house. They might not beÂ great if you'd like to save money for the future. TheyÂ may want to take advantage of flexible working arrangements, something federally-regulated workers in industries such as telecommunications or transportation now have the right to ask for. One industry that could see a boost as baby boomers retire is cruising. As an example, Viking Cruises founder and chairman TorsteinÂ HagenÂ said part of why his company is expanding â€” and why the Canada Pension Plan is investing in it â€” is because it expects aging baby boomers to cruise more. And you can very much see it reflected in the expansion plans of the industry. Viking Cruises specifically targetsÂ older people. ""We have been very deliberate as to defining what our product is, soÂ we are don't have casinos. We don't allow children under 18 on board and we don't like screaming noises of any type,"" said Hagen. As the company expands, Thunder Bay, Ont., will become a port of call for Viking Cruises. In part, the launch of an eight-day cruise trip from Milwaukee to Thunder Bay is a sign of the demographic shift toward baby boomers â€” an expansion of a product specifically targeting that age group.

Rod McLeod, 75, was a longtime customer with Cidel Bank â€”Â one of dozens of private banks in Canada that handle wealth management for people with high incomes or sizeable assets.Â  ""It has turned my life upside down,"" says McLeod, a retired lawyer. ""I expected them to protect me."" McLeod is suing, alleging ""negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"" by Cidel in a statement of claim filed last week. It's one more case of what's become a multibillion-dollar problem in Canada and the U.S., according to authorities.Â  Wire fraud is a ""huge problem"" and ""so rampant,"" investigator and former FBI agent Don Vilfer told Go Public, that better laws are needed in Canada and the U.S. to protect bank customers.Â  ""Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. is behind in terms of requiring financial institutions to take certain steps â€_ [to prevent] this kind of thing,""Â Vilfer said.Â  In September 2018, McLeodÂ was excited to make an offer on a condo in Rancho Mirage, Calif. â€”Â just north of Palm Desert. He had Cidel wire a deposit to a California bank account and waited for instructions on the outstanding balance of $619,000 US ($820,000 Cdn). A few weeks later, an email supposedly from the realtor handling the sale, said the balance should go to a different bank â€”Â Chase Bank in Denver, Colo. Even though his escrow agent had cautioned him, two months earlier, against any sudden changes, McLeod says the warning was forgottenÂ in the push to seal the deal.Â  The seller, he'd been told, was a billionaire.Â ""So it made sense that he banked in several places."" McLeod sent the new instructions to his contact at Cidel. But the email wasn't from his realtor,Â Brady Sandahl. It was from a new email address, created byÂ fraudstersÂ who hadÂ transposed the last two letters of Sandahl's nameÂ so that, at first glance, it appeared legit. When that email arrived at Cidel, it appears the bank's mail server flagged it, tacking ""SUSPICIOUS MESSAGE"" onto the subject line.Â  Despite that warning,Â a bank employee emailed the fraudster, asking for the address of the bank account owner â€”Â adding a senior Cidel employee and McLeod to the email thread. McLeod says his excitement about the condo got the better of him. He didn't notice the email had been flagged, and, he says,Â had no prior experience wiring money to another country. ""I don't do this every day. This is something that's totally new to me,"" he said.Â  ""My wife said, 'You wanted it too much, you ignored the red flags.'""Â  McLeod and his wife authorizedÂ the wire transfer. The money went to Denver, where fraudsters quickly transferred most of it to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. Days later, when McLeod made inquiries about next steps, it became apparent he was the victim of fraud. ""I thought, this can't be happening,"" he says. ""It just can't be happening."" Chase BankÂ was able to keep $26,000 US from being transferred, and that money was returned to McLeod. McLeod hired Vilfer to investigate. Since leaving the FBI over a decade ago, Vilfer has testified in over 100Â cases, often providing expert testimony on digital forensics in cases involving wire fraud. ""It's very profitable for the fraudsters when they can pull it off,"" he says.Â ""We had one client that lost $14 million â€” and they're [fraudsters] doing this all day long."" In his report to McLeod, Vilfer says the realtor's email account may have been compromised and recommended further analysis of the realtor's devices and accounts.Â  ""With email hijacking scams of this type, in my experience, it is the realtor or mortgage broker who is targeted,"" he wrote. SandahlÂ did not respond to calls for comment from Go Public.Â  The case is an example of what investigators call ""business email compromise"" â€” a type of wire fraud that targets businesses and their customers. Typically, the fraudster hacks into a business's email accountÂ and impersonates the sender, instructing the customer to redirect the money.Â  Go Public recently investigated this type of scam,Â and spoke to a Toronto-area businessman who lost almost $3,000.Â  Compromised business emailsÂ â€” particularly in the real estate sector â€” led to an estimated loss of $12 billion US over the past five years, according to the FBI.Â Such scams were reported in 150 countries, and all 50 U.S. states. Vilfer says McLeod's bank â€”Â Cidel â€”Â should have stopped the scam in its tracks. ""You have the flag on the email that it's a suspicious message,"" says Vilfer. ""And with this kind of fraud that's so prevalent â€_ that should certainly cause some sort of alarm,Â to take an extra look at this and seeÂ why is this being flagged?"" ""Good technology ... apparently was ignored,"" he said.Â  In the statement of claim against Cidel, McLeod's lawyer, Brett Code, alleges the bank's actions ""represent a marked departure from the required standard of care, and constitute gross negligence."" It seeksÂ full compensation for McLeod's loss.Â  None of the allegations has been proven in court andÂ Cidel has not yetÂ responded to the statement of claim.Â  In one of two emails to McLeod,Â Cidel CEO Craig Rimer wrote:Â ""We are very sorry that you've had to go through this terrible experience and for the financial loss you endured."" However, he wrote, Cidel has no obligation to reimburse McLeod.Â  In a second, one-line email, Rimer blamedÂ McLeod for the wire fraud, writing, ""The introduction to the email address came from you and you authorized the transaction after much back and forth between them [fraudsters] and you."" Rimer declined to be interviewed but sent Go Public a statement saying, ""We acted in accordance with the express written and signed wire instructions that were delivered to us by our client.""Â  He would not outline what policies exist at the bank when it comes to conducting wire transfers, but wrote that Cidel acted in full compliance with all industry standards and that the bank will continue to assist its client in recovering the funds from ""an unscrupulous third party."" There is no legislation in Canada or the U.S. that requires a financial institution to confirm the identity of a bank account holder who is receiving a wire transferÂ to prevent fraud and protect customers. Â  It's considered a best practiceÂ for banks to confirm they are sending a client's money to an appropriate destination, but Vilfer â€”Â the former FBI agent â€”Â thinks that needs to become law.Â  ""We're just relying on the banks doing the right thing,"" he says. ""It would be a good idea for both the United States and Canada to stiffen up the statutory requirements; require policies for protecting against this sort of fraud."" The largest insurer ofÂ U.S. banks, ABA Insurance Services, said recently it's ""critical"" that banks start making phone calls toÂ authenticate wire transfers, among other procedures.Â  McLeod knows his lawsuit against Cidel could drag on for years. ""If I don't win this, I'm throwing good money after bad,"" he says. ""And they can outlast me. I'm 75 years old."" He's also moved his remaining assets to another management company.

AnÂ exclusive analysis of the data by CBC News shows that hospital gridlock â€” a phenomenon that used to be restricted to surges in patients during fluÂ season â€”Â is the new normal.Â  Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals were filled beyond 100 per cent occupancy nearlyÂ every day in the first half of last year.Â  Five hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as the main hospitalÂ in Hamilton, Sudbury, PeterboroughÂ and Niagara Falls all spent more than 160 days over their funded capacity during the 181-day period from January through June 2019. CBCÂ News analyzed data for all 169Â acute care hospital sites in the province during this six-month time frame. Some of the key findings:Â  An expert on hospital administration calls the figures ""astonishing"" and says they demonstrate that overcrowding is now a widespread phenomenon around Ontario. ""These are really big numbers,"" said Donald Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at University of Toronto. He said the data show the hallway medicine problem isÂ neither occasional nor restricted to a few hospitals. Redelmeier said such chronic overcapacity makes the hospital experience extremely dissatisfying for patients, it means non-emergency surgeries getÂ postponed, and it means when there's a surge of new patients, there's nowhere to relieve the congestion.Â  ""You ought not to be striving for 100 per cent capacity because it doesn't leave you any reserve for when things get tough,"" saidÂ Redelmeier, who is also an internal medicine specialist at Sunnybrook Hospital.Â Â  ""We've got warning signs going off all over the province and the situation just isn't viable,"" said Anthony Dale, chief executive of the Ontario Hospital Association.Â  ""All across the province you have hospitals at extremely high levels of occupancy,"" said Dale in an interview with CBC News. ""What we're seeing is that it's no longer just during the flu season but it's all year round."" TheÂ chronic nature of the overcrowding ""is simply not sustainable, not for patients, not for people who work in hospitals,"" Dale saidÂ  The acute care hospital site that was the most frequently filled beyond capacity was Mackenzie Health's 333-bed Richmond Hill Hospital. Its acute care wards were overcapacity on all but two days in this six-month period.Â Â Â  A tour of its emergency room in the early afternoon of a recent weekday â€”Â typically a time of lower ER volumes as compared to evenings and weekends â€” revealed around a dozen patients on stretchers in the corridors or placedÂ alongside the nursing station desk. The situation has become so entrenched that signs are posted assigning hallway spots an official bed number. ""For our staff who work in this environment, they would describe it as constantly working under crisis,"" saidÂ Mary-Agnes Wilson, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Mackenzie Health, which runs Richmond Hill Hospital.Â  Richmond Hill provides an example of how the ripple effect of overcapacity in acute care wards is felt in the emergency department. Even after being admitted, aÂ patient typically spends hoursÂ stuck in the ER waiting for a ward bed to open up.Â Over the past year, the average patient admitted to an Ontario hospital spent more than 16 hours in the ER before getting a ward bed, according to provincial data.Â Â  At the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, the average admitted patientÂ waited 46 hours in the ER before getting a bed on a ward in November, the most recent month for which statistics are available. Although the occupancy data analyzed by CBC News comes from the first half of 2019, there's little if any indication the situation has improved since then. Niagara Health says the overcapacity problem across its three acute care hospital sites did not improve in the second half of 2019, averagingÂ 104 per cent during both six-month periods last year.Â  At Southlake Regional Health Centre,Â a 500-bed facility in Newmarket, occupancy averaged 110 per cent in the first six months of 2019, according to the data. In the second half of the year, occupancy averaged 113 per cent, says the hospital's CEO, Arden Krystal.Â  Hospitals' chief method of coping with the demand is to placeÂ beds in makeshift locations, now officially enshrined as ""unconventional spaces"" in the Ontario health care bureaucracy.Â At Richmond Hill, a former meeting room now houses 10 patients separated by cubicle dividers.Â At Southlake Regional Health Centre,Â overflow spaces include former exercise rooms and a kitchenette.Â  ""We try to fill every nook and cranny because the risk of having 40 or 50 admitted patients standing in our emergency department is even greater than filling those spaces,"" said Krystal. ""When emergency gets backed up, they start to get worried that they can't assess people quickly enough to make sure that they can stay safe.""Â  Figures provided by the Ministry of Health suggest aÂ five to six per cent drop in the use of unconventional spaces province-wide over the past year.Â Â  ""It was increasing steadily year over year but we have managed to halt that,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott.Â  That still means nearly 1,000 Ontario patients are being housed in hallways, lunch rooms and auditoriums every day. Elliott admitted it will take ""several years"" to achieve Ford's promise of ending hallway health care.Â Â  ""This isn't a problem that grew up overnight, it has been building up over a number of years,"" Elliott said in an interview Tuesday. ""There's no simple solution to change it, there's a lot of action that needs to be taken and we are doing that.""Â  The number of acute care hospital beds in Ontario has stayed effectively the same for 20 years, at around 20,000 while the province's population has grown by threeÂ million people.Â Ontario now has fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than any other province:Â 1.4 beds for every 1,000 people. That's on par with Mexico, and half the number in the U.S. But shortages of care available outside the hospital system are also crucial factors in the overcrowding. On anyÂ day, one out of six hospital beds is occupied by a patient who doesn't need to be in hospital, but cannot be safely dischargedÂ home. This is a long-running phenomenon in health systems across Canada known as ""alternate level of care"" (ALC). Lengthy waits for long-term care spaces are the chief cause, but a lack of available home care and other forms of continuing care also contributes.Â  While the number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals hovered between 3,500 and 4,000 for the first half of the 2010s, it grew over the past five years, exceeding 5,300 in September 2019, according to figures from the Ontario Hospital Association.Â  This means creating new hospital beds is not necessarily a better solution than freeing up the beds occupied by patients who ought to be elsewhere.Â  FordÂ became premier in June 2018, and his Progressive Conservative government by no means created the hallway medicine trend. The previous Liberal government froze hospitals'Â annual base funding for four years running.Â  Nor is hospital overcrowding restricted to Ontario. Recent reports of overflowing patients come fromÂ Montreal,Â Saskatoon,Â Â Moncton, N.B.Â andÂ Kentville, N.S. Some of the most obvious solutions to the problem won't happen quickly or without a major outlay of public money. OneÂ  top priority is expanding the number of long-term care facilities to meet the demands of a senior population that is growing in number and in the complexity of its needs. The Ford government is embarking on a long-term reform of the health system that includes reorganizing how funding is provided. The aim is to shiftÂ those hospital patients who don't need to be there into care elsewhere.Â  The reform is centred on teamsÂ that bring together hospitals, home-care agencies and long-term care facilities in geographic areas. Each team will receive a combined pot of fundingÂ to provide the range of health services its population needs.Â Â  Hospitals are taking their own steps to try to reduce patient demand. For people with chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, Niagara Health has focused on developing programs to support the patients at home after discharge. ""This has already shown great reductions in emergency department visits, hospital readmissions and days spent in hospital,"" said Derek McNally, Niagara Health's executive vice-president of clinical servicesÂ and chief nursing executive. ""We know that there's a lot more work that we need to do,"" said Elliott. ""It's like taking an ocean liner and turning it around. it doesn't happen on a dime.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-hallway-medicine-healthcare-over-capacity-1.5434572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/hallway-medicine-unfortunate-reality-for-guelph-general-hospital-1.5435015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/across-sw-ontario-small-hospitals-struggle-with-overcapacity-1.5434670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-civic-etobicoke-general-hallway-health-care-1.5339511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hospital-health-sciences-north-overcrowding-1.5139909 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ontario-health-care-1.4912674 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-doug-ford-health-care-rueben-devlin-1.4997601,N/A60,"Virginia Smart, Lisa Ellenwood",2019-11-24T09:00:00.590Z,"Pain, agony and 'years of duress': How hockey wives are fighting back over players' chronic brain injuries","Jennifer BelakÂ Liang remembers her car phone ringing as she was picking up her daughters Alex and Andie from school one day in August 2011. It was the agent for her husband, hockey player Wade Belak. On speaker phone, the agent asked her if she had spoken to her husband that day.Â  She hadn't. It was the second phone call she received asking that question and it filled her with dread.Â  ""Wade is really hurt,"" the agent said. ""It was awful. I was called by multiple friends â€_ they knew before I knew.Â But they didn't know what to say,"" BelakÂ Liang said of the day she lost her husband to suicide. Belak's suicide was the third death in a cluster of tragic and sudden deaths of NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard, 28, and Rick Rypien, 27. All had been tasked with fighting on ice and all suffered multiple hits to the head.Â There have been other deaths of players since, including Steve Montador and Todd Ewen. Now, the wives of some of the retired hockey enforcers are in their own fight, taking on the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman. They want the league to acknowledge there's a link between fights and head injuries on the ice and long-term effects like degenerative brain disease. They also want more support for families struggling with symptoms of traumatic brain injury.Â  ""My husband had CTE. He was showing signs of CTE. He took his own life,"" said Belak Liang. ""It's going to be many more...Â  It's [an] injustice to everyone else out there, I think, for them not to admit that this can happen.""Â  Wade Belak had recently retired from his 14-year career with the National Hockey League and was in Toronto in the summer of 2011 rehearsing for the show Battle of the Blades â€” the CBC reality show that pairs hockey players with figure skaters.Â At approximately 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, he ended his life. After the loss of her husband, Jennifer BelakÂ Liang struggled with feelings of isolation and guilt.Â  ""I was drowning, blaming myself,"" she said in an interview with The Fifth Estate. At the time, she knew little of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease. Her husband had asked that in the event of his death, his brain be tested for the disease. She fulfilled his wish, and he was diagnosed with CTE. Since the loss of her husband, BelakÂ Liang, who has since remarried, tries to offer support to others facing tragic loss of loved ones. As an NHL enforcer who played 14 seasons in the NHL, Belak ""knew his role,"" said BelakÂ Liang. ""He didn't love it, but he was fine with it [because] he wanted to stay within the NHL and have his career.Â  ""He told me: 'I can't stay here unless I fight.' "" Watch Jennifer Belak LiangÂ remember her husband: While many hockey players can make millions during their career, brain trauma and concussions can take a toll, especially for those who played the role of an enforcer â€” a role now being phased out. ItÂ  was during her husband's last years with the Nashville Predators that BelakÂ Liang noticed a shift in his behaviour.Â Â  ""It started about five years before he passed. He just got really introverted, really quiet at home.Â When the kids were screeching or making noises, I could see him not able to handle it, which was not like him."" About eight months before he died, Belak noticed a decline in her husband's memory. He'd use his phone to help remember daily tasks, including taking pictures of groceries he had to buy.Â Â  Many experts say concussions can often lead to a cycle of substance abuse, depression, memory loss, even suicide.Â  Daniel Carcillo, 35, from King City, Ont., has won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Blackhawks, and was known as Car BombÂ for his reckless fighting style on ice.Â He now battles depression and suicidal thoughts.Â  Carcillo said his wife, Ela Bulawa, has been burdened.Â ""But I think that's what marriage and loving somebody is all about, right? Through sickness and in health.""Â  While he was in his final NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015, Carcillo suffered great personal loss: the passing of his grandfather, as well as his best friend and teammate, Steve Montador, who was found to have CTE. Carcillo, who had seven concussions during his NHL career,Â wonders if he could become another statistic. ""Wade had CTE. Are these reaffirmations that I'm going to have CTE?...Â ""There's a pretty good chance."" Once retired, players can often feel abandoned and without support. Carcillo said he has felt that way. But he's taken steps to heal: functional neurology therapy, acupuncture, proper nutrition and diet. He speaks publicly, often on social media, about traumatic brain injury and the impact it can have.Â Â  ""I'm very, very proud of Daniel, from where he has been, and where he is now,"" Bulawa said. They have started a foundation called Chapter 5, which aims to provide support to retired players and their families, especially players who are suffering post-concussion syndrome, anxiety and depression. ""They put their whole lives into playing hockey and being the best of the best. And once it's over, then what?""Â said Bulawa. ""It shouldn't just be,'Oh, that's it, sorry guys. See ya later.' ""Â Â  Carcillo and Bulawa have learned to recognize signs of his depression returning, for exampleÂ sleeping in, impulse control issues, loss of appetite and withdrawal from friends and family. Todd Ewen played hockey in the era when even after getting rocked on the ice, players were sent back out again. Both he and his wife, Kelli,Â believed he experienced head trauma because he had symptoms: blurry vision, headaches and sleeplessness. After playing 11 seasons in the NHL, Todd Ewen retired in 1997. He became a real estate agent, was a musician, patented several inventions and coached the St. Louis University Billikens. But Ewen was struggling. He became aggressive with Kelli.Â Depression, memory loss and confusion plagued him. By 2013, he gave up coaching because he couldn't remember plays and was missing practices.Â Â  ""We didn't know who we had. One day we had the sad Todd, the mad Todd, the angry Todd. We had no idea what was going on. This man suffered for years like this, our family suffered for years like this,"" his wife said. They wondered if he could have Alzeimher's or Parkinson's disease, but with the loss of Rypien, Boogaard and Belak in 2011, Ewen began to wonder if he could have CTE.Â  He told KelliÂ one day that he didn't want to be a burden. At the time, she did not realize the weight of his words. On Sept. 19, 2015, Kelli Ewen found her husband in the basement of their home near St. Louis. He was 49 when he killed himself. The Ewen family was contacted by the Canadian Concussion Centre in Toronto asking to study Todd's brain.Â  Â ""I knew something was wrong. And I thought maybe this is the answer. I read the articles about [CTE]. I could just check off the boxes, just one after another. And I thought this has to be it.""Â  But neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati at the centre told Kelli her husband did not have CTE. She was devastated and desperate for an explanation andÂ said she asked the doctor to retest his brain, but Hazrati declined.Â  In 2018, a class action lawsuit between more than 300 retired players and the NHL was settled. Players had accused the league of failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. Ewen's negative CTE results were used as an example in the lawsuit of how media hype could lead a person to kill themselves because of fear of having CTE. Bettman wrote: ""This, sadly, is precisely the type of tragedy that can result when plaintiffs' lawyers and their media consultants jump ahead of the medical community and assert, without reliable scientific support, that there is a causal link between concussions and CTE.""Â  Kelli Ewen said she was was extremely hurt, and believed they were using her husband for the benefit of the lawsuit.Â Â  The NHL announced an $18.9-million US settlement â€” $22,000 US per player and medical expense coverage up to $75,000 per person. However, there was no acknowledgement of liability for the players' assertions.Â  Carcillo refused to participate in the settlement.Â  Kelli Ewen couldn't live with the results from the Canadian Concussion Centre.Â She arranged to have samples of her husband's brain sent to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist and director of Boston University's CTE Center. Her research, much of which has involvedÂ professional athletes, focuses on the long-term effects of all kinds of brain injury, which can include CTE.Â Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy.Â  While there is no known treatment, the hope is research from Boston University's brain bank will one day allow the detection of the disease in life, ""while there's still a chance to do something about it,"" McKee said. In late 2018, McKee revealed her own conclusions to Kelli Ewen, stating her instincts were correct: her husband did, in fact, have CTE.Â  ""[Gary Bettman] still stands by the [original] findings, which I find mind-boggling,"" Kelli Ewen said. Kelli Ewen filed a lawsuit against the NHL on April 30, 2019, challenging the league's dismissal ofÂ  a link between hits to the head during hockey games and CTE . She wants to bring awareness to concussions and CTE and the suffering families go through when they don't understand the symptoms they're seeing with their husbands.Â Â  ""It's not about money, you know? It's about the pain, the agony, the years of duress,"" she said.Â Â  ""I feel like it's the NHL's responsibility to stand up and take care of these players that this great game of hockey was built on;Â these fighters that gave, essentially, their lives for the NHL.Â And it's time for them to step up and admit and help them get the help they need."" Watch Kelli Ewen talk about her lawsuit: The day after KelliÂ Ewen's lawsuit was filed, Bettman appeared before a CommonsÂ subcommittee in Ottawa regarding sports-related concussions and safety.Â Â  Bettman questioned any direct link between multiple hockey concussions and CTE, saying ""in short, I don't believe based on everything I've been told â€” and if anybody has information to the contrary, we'd be happy to hear it â€” other than some anecdotal evidence, there has not been that conclusive link."" ""Our players like the way the NHL game is played and understand the implications of playing a physical contact sport at the highest professional level in the world,"" he said.Â  ""At the end of the day we view ourselves as a family, and our resources are available to the members of our family."" Jennifer BelakÂ Liang, Kelli Ewen and the Carcillo family would disagree.Â  ""It's crazy to me that they won't admit anything.Â It's sad,"" BelakÂ Liang said.Â  Â ""At least admit it's real,"" said Ewen. ""That would go a long way with a lot of the families."" The Fifth Estate requested an interview with Bettman to address the wives' concerns, but the only response was: ""Thank you for your inquiry. We will not be participating."" Â  At a sports conference in Toronto last week, The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeownÂ approached Bettman. All he would say was:Â ""How are you? Nice to see you.Â I gotta go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hockey-players-enforcers-brain-injuries-1.5370444,[],N/A61,Adam Miller,2020-01-22T10:50:27.511Z,Key things to watch for in the coronavirus outbreak,"As the China coronavirus outbreak continues, key questions remain about the nature of the virus and how quickly and easily it canÂ spread between people.Â  Here's a look at some of the potentially serious turns the outbreak could take. Human-to-human transmission is the spread of an illness from an infected patient to a non-infected person. There are two types of this transmission:Â limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission infection occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.Â Â  SustainedÂ transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission. Infections among health-care workers strengthen the evidence for this,"" the WHO in China said in a statement Monday.Â  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" WHO officials will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concernÂ and to discuss what recommendations should be made to manage it. ""The key issues here are what is the extent of human-to-human transmission and how easy is human-to-human transmission?"" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.Â  ""That's going to be a factor into how widespread this ultimately gets.""Â Â  Health officials will also be watching closely to see if the virus changes as the outbreak continues, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.Â  ""Viruses evolve and mutate, and they may start to take on new attributes and characteristics that either make them more easily transmissible or make them more deadly,"" he said.Â  ""The reality is that the longer that it's out there, the more it will evolve.""Â  Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said if the coronavirus mutates into something more contagious, that would be a ""significant concern"" similar to the way in which SARS evolved. McGeer said the initial clusters of patients infected with SARS in early 2003 were associated with open-air markets in China, much like in the current coronavirus outbreak, with limited transmission from person to person.Â  ""Then over the next couple of months, the virus evolved into a virus that was more transmissible person to person, but more transmissible person to person when people were seriously ill,"" she said.Â  ""If that process is repeating itself, and the virus is changing, then we may be moving from one problem to a completely different problem. So far that's not what it's looked like, but I don't think you can be sure about it."" McGeer addedÂ there haven't been many reports of transmission to health-care workers, aside from the reported 15 cases of medical staff in Wuhan, which she said concerns her about the potential for the virus to change.Â  ""They must have followed up with health-care workers after the initial cases in December, they didn't see transmission and now they've found transmission,"" she said.Â  ""It does raise the concern that this is a virus that is changing and if it's a virus that's changing then that's a whole new set of issues. There's nothing we can do except wait to know what's going to happen."" Another concern is the possibility of a ""super-spreader,"" a highly infectious patient who can spread the illness to many people at a disproportionate rate to other carriers.Â  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said super-spreader events were ""pivotal"" in the spread of SARS worldwide in 2003.They defined super-spreading as transmission to at least eight people.Â  One super-spreading event was identified early in the epidemic in Beijing, where a patient with an onset of SARS two months after hospital admission was the source of transmission to 76 patients, including 12 health-care workers and several hospital visitors.Â  Prof. Gabriel M. Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said Tuesday the ""critical issue"" in controlling a coronavirus epidemic is to make sure that super-spreading eventsÂ are controlled quickly.Â  ""It is absolutely critical that public health authorities recognize a super-spreading event in the very earliest stages,"" he said during a media availability. ""Before it goes absolutely explosive.""Â  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said the possibility of a super-spreader is top of mind for health officials worldwide.Â  ""There is also the possibility of super-spreading events. The global community is very familiar [with] what has happened with SARS in the past and this is something that is on our radar,"" she said during a press conference Tuesday. ""That is possible, and what we need to prepare ourselves for."" Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot that uses data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world, said outbreaks are like fires, and infected individuals are like embers.Â  ""They may land in one location where they happen to just trigger a big outbreak, and it may have to do with a super-spreading event,"" he said.Â  ""A super-spreading event does not mean that it is limited to the epicentre in Wuhan;Â it could catalyze multiple new epicentres.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A62,Catharine Tunney,2020-01-17T20:58:44.506Z,Canada offers $25K to families of Canadian victims on Flight PS752,"Canada will give the families of individuals killed in the downing of UIA Flight PS752 thousands of dollars to help with their immediate needs, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said todayÂ â€”Â stressing it's only a first step toward getting Iran to compensate those grieving families. ""I want to be clear, we expect Iran to compensate these families,"" Trudeau said during a news conference in Ottawa Friday morning. ""But I have met them. They can't wait weeks. They need support now."" Of the 176 passengers and crewÂ killed, 57 were Canadian citizens and 29 were permanent residents, said the prime minister.Â  He said the government will give thoseÂ familiesÂ $25,000Â per victimÂ to help cover the cost of immediate needs such as funeral arrangements and travel.Â If all the victims' families seek financial help, the government could pay out about $2 million. ForÂ Masoud Pourjam, today's announcement was a small piece of good news in the midst of hisÂ struggles to resolveÂ his brother's affairs.Â Mansour Pourjam, a dual Iranian-Canadian citizen, was one of theÂ 176Â people killed aboard Flight PS572. Masoud drives a taxi in Ottawa. He saidÂ it has been difficult for him to return to work, or to doÂ simple things likeÂ going to the bank. ""I cannot work more than half-shift, even less, I have to go home. I try not to be alone by myself. It is embarrassing when a customer is in the car and I start crying,"" he said. ""For a few weeks, I can breathe a sigh of relief."" Trudeau said any compensation from Iran would go straight to families and would not be used to reimburseÂ the federal government. Earlier this week, the government announced it also would waive fees and speed up visa processing times for those affected by the tragedy. About 20 families have asked for their loved ones' remains to be returned to Canada, with others have said they want their family members buried in Iran, said Trudeau. No bodies have been returned yet, added the prime minister, but he said the first remains will begin their trip home in the coming days. Trudeau's latest update comes as Foreign Affairs Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne is in Oman for a rare face-to-face meeting with Iranian Foreign MinisterÂ Mohammad Javad Zarif following last week's disaster near Tehran. Canada cut diplomatic ties with the countryÂ in 2012. ""Minister Zarif conveyed his profound regret for this terrible tragedy and Minister Champagne noted that he had met with families of victims this week who are deeply hurt and angry,"" says a readout of the meeting from Champagne's office. According to his office, Champagne pushed forÂ concrete action after CanadaÂ â€” along with four other nations that lost citizens in the crashÂ â€” gathered earlier this week to discuss Iran's role in shooting down the flight. After the meeting,Â Zarif tweeted that the two countries agreed ""on continued exchanges between respective experts."" ""Politicization of this tragedy must be rejected,"" he added.Â  In Oman today, met with Canadian FM <a href=""https://twitter.com/FP_Champagne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@FP_Champagne</a> to discuss consular, technical &amp; legal cooperation among nations impacted by <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS752?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#PS752</a> tragedy. <br><br>Agreed on continued exchanges between respective experts.<br><br>Politicization of this tragedy must be rejected.

That is what the international community is pushing on,"" said Trudeau. ""So far, the people we've engaged with in Iran have been aligned with that wish, for now."" Ministers from five nations affected by the crash â€” Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom â€” listed their demands of Iran during a meeting in London on Thursday.

They're called fast radio bursts, and thanks to a team of Canadian scientists, a new signal has been precisely located in a nearby galaxy. It's aÂ major step to figuring out where these enigmas come from in our universe.Â  The findings are in part due to the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Fast Radio Burst collaboration, a team made up of more than 50 scientists across North America. The team collects data from a radio telescope stationed at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory south of Penticton, B.C.Â Â  FRBs are bright bursts of radio waves that come from far beyond Earth's galaxy. Lasting less than a second, the phenomenon was first reported in 2007. Many have been spotted since, but only around a dozen have been shown to repeat â€” a quality crucial to spotting them again so researchers can find out more. There are many theories of what they could be, but with such a small sample size, astronomers can't rule much out just yet. They've only traced the origins of two repeating signals so far. ""They're telling us something about an energetic arena we've had very little insight of to date,"" said Paul Delaney, a professor in the physics and astronomy department atÂ York University who was not involved in the study.Â  ""It's going to give us a window into new astrophysics, and that gives us a better understanding of the universe as a whole,"" he said. The team, co-ledÂ  by the universities of British Columbia, Toronto and McGill, along with the National Research Council of Canada, has been working toward that goal since 2017.Â  Extragalactic signal discovery!

It lets the sky move,"" he said.Â  After co-ordination with CHIME, the latest burst to be tracked, known as FRB 180916.j0158+65, was spotted and tracked by the European VLBI Network, eight telescopes spanning the globe. The eight-metre Gemini North telescope in Hawaii was the crucial last piece to trace the FRB to a spiral galaxy 500 million light years away, according to results published in the Jan. 9 edition of Nature.Â  Since the discovery, scientists have found nine more repeating signals from space, according to aÂ report releasedÂ earlier this week. That means they could be localized, too, identifying the environments in space they come from, what causes them â€” and eventually, what these massive energy bursts are.Â Â  But CHIME can't localize FRBs on its own. After seeing the signals repeat, it can narrow down the origins to certain parts of the sky. CHIME can then team up with more precise telescopes to match it with a galaxy. It's set to get an extension in a few years that will enable it to localize data points on its own. Right now, theÂ telescope is predicted to detect between twoÂ and 50 FRBs per day, an event rate scientists consider very high. That's puttingÂ CHIME, a Canadian led and funded project, at the forefront of FRB research.Â  CHIME was also behind the first repeater ever spotted, FRB 121102. ItÂ  was traced to a different environment, a dwarf galaxy in 2017. Both repeaters tracked so far have been found to originate from star-forming galaxies, an attribute that might be important for further research, said Deborah Good, a post-doctoral student at UBC and CHIME researcher.Â  ""It's hard to say. We always have to be really careful about generalizing from a really small number like this,"" she said. ""But it also means that every data point we get is super important.""

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public healthÂ officer, told reporters on Monday thatÂ travellers will be asked aÂ screening question at electronic immigration kiosks if they have travelled to areas affected by the coronavirus in the last 14 days and they will be reminded to report flu-like symptoms to border services agents. There will also be messaging on arrival screens about the coronavirus, Tam said. ""The Chinese lunar year is coming so out of an abundance of precaution that's why we are putting out additional information for travellers,"" Tam said.Â  Federal public health officers will also post signs about the coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV,Â at Vancouver International Airport and MontrÃ©al-Trudeau International Airport. According to the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency on Monday,Â 224 cases of pneumonia caused by theÂ new coronavirus infection have been reported in China. Of that number, 217 have been confirmed. China has reported four deaths. China has confirmed human-to-human transmissionÂ in the outbreak, which began at a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in central China. Cases have since been reported inÂ Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that started in Guangdong, China. In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. Symptoms of 2019-nCoVÂ are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.Â  According to the World Health Organization, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death.Â The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. Canada has has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the number of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low. The overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low, the Public Health Agency of Canada has said in a statement on the weekend. An expert in Toronto, however, says the spread of the coronavirus needs to be closely watched. Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician, andÂ founder and CEO of the digital health company BlueDot, said officials do not yet know fullyÂ how theÂ coronavirus is spread and no vaccines are available. He said BlueDot, founded six years ago, is working on better ways to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. Khan said airport screening is ""not the most efficient strategy."" Travellers are far more likely to get sick after they leave the airport, he said. The ""real front-lines"" areÂ emergency departments, but education for travellers is still important, he added. ""We're in a world today where people can easily jump on a plane and go halfway around the world in a matter of hours,"" Khan said on Monday.Â  ""And we are also just at the precipice of the Lunar New Year, when we're anticipating there will be a mass migration of people and gatherings and congregations where this disease could potentially propagate,"" His organization is tracking the spread of the coronavirusÂ to other countries and monitoring the outbreak of pneumonia in China. He said it is no longer about animal-to-human transmission, but instead human-to-human transmission. ""SARS had a mortality rate somewhere around 10 percent,"" he said.Â ""I think it still remains to be seen: Is thisÂ as deadly as SARS, or if this going to be is a milder illness?"" Khan said the coronavirus has the hallmarks of SARS, including the fact that it spread from markets to people, it has human-to-human transmission, it has infected health workers and there hasÂ possibly been what he called a ""super spreading event."" But officials don't yet know how severe it is, he added. ""SARS had an important impact here in Toronto,"" he said. ""That was no small event."" According to Tam, Canada has hadÂ no confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. ThreeÂ people in Canada who travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but the results came backÂ negative.Â  The World Health Organization (WHO) will holdÂ an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus identified in China constitutes an international health emergency.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/coronavirus-pearson-airport-toronto-screening-measures-1.5434040,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477,N/A66,Anonymous,2019-09-10T18:08:42.556Z,N/A,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/news/editorsblog,[],N/A67,Anonymous,2020-01-20T02:26:20.853Z,N/A,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/news/gopublic,[],N/A68,Anonymous,2020-01-21T23:53:32.293Z,Trump impeachment: Who will be making the case for and against the U.S. president in the Senate trial,"As the Senate impeachment trial of U.S.Â President Donald Trump begins in earnest this week, those arguing for and against his removalÂ from officeÂ are gearing up for a contentious battle. Trump is accused of abusing his presidential power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid approved by Congress as leverage. Trump is also charged with obstructing Congress in the ensuing probe. Seven House impeachment managers will makeÂ their case as to why theÂ president should be ousted. Trump, meanwhile, will be defended by severalÂ high-profile lawyers. Republican and Democratic senators will sit and listen to each side, acting as jurors. The presidential impeachment trial â€” only the third in U.S.Â history â€” willÂ be overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who has little actual power over the proceedings. Impeachment trial begins with clashes over rules and evidence Here are the key figures whose actions will helpÂ determineÂ whether the 45th president of the United StatesÂ will be removed from office: These seven Democratic members of the House of Representatives were chosen by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to make the case against Trump,Â making themÂ de factoÂ prosecutors: A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is chair of the House intelligence committee andÂ the leadÂ  impeachmentÂ manager. For many, he has become a familiarÂ face of the proceedings, leading the investigation into the allegations against the president. He presided over the House impeachment hearings in the lead-up to the Senate trial, earning the scorn of TrumpÂ â€”Â and a nickname:Â ""Shifty Schiff."" Nadler is chair of the House judiciary committee, whichÂ drafted the two articles of impeachment against Trump.Â Nadler was also a member of the judiciary committee during president Bill Clinton's impeachment in 1998.Â Nadler was an earlier supporter of a TrumpÂ impeachment, declaring lastÂ August that his panel would hold impeachment hearings related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. AÂ member of the House judiciary committee, Jeffries is alsoÂ House Democratic caucus chairman. The former litigator is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, and is seen as someone who could eventually replace Nancy Pelosi AÂ former U.S. Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan who also worked as a lawyer,Â Crow is a freshman member of Congress. HeÂ is the only manager who is not a member of either the judiciary or intelligence committees, but, as the New York Times noted, is consideredÂ a leading voice on national security. AÂ former Houston judge andÂ newly elected congresswoman, Garcia became one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in U.S. Congress. She has also worked as a social worker, legal aid lawyer and as a city controller for Houston. She serves onÂ the House judiciary committee. AÂ judiciary committee member, Lofgren,Â who has been in Congress for almost 25 years, isÂ the only manager who was involved in the two other presidential impeachment proceedings, against Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Specifically, she worked on the congressional staff investigation ofÂ Nixon's impeachment.Â (Nixon resigned before he was impeached). Demings is a member of both the judiciary and intelligence committees, but is the only manager without a law degree. However, she does have law enforcement experience. She worked for the Orlando Police Department for 27 years, becoming the force's first female police chief in 2007. Trump's lawyers will present their case for the presidentÂ and will be allowed to cross-examine the impeachment managers, along with any witnesses. Cipollone is the current White House counsel,Â who advises the president on all legal matters. He leads Trump's defence team butÂ has spent most of his career in commercial litigation and doesn't have extensive experience with trials. But he hasÂ worked on numerous high-profile cases, including the lawsuit against credit-reporting company Equifax after aÂ massive data breach. TheÂ personal lawyer to Trump, SekulowÂ also represented the presidentÂ during the Mueller investigation. Sekulow hosts a radio talk show and is chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, a non-profit that advocates for religious freedoms. A former prosecutor and independent counsel, Starr'sÂ 445-page report formed the basis for the House impeachment of Clinton in late 1998. The former appeals court judge had beenÂ appointed toÂ investigate the Clintons in relation toÂ a real estate deal known as the Whitewater controversy,Â among other matters, but his probe widened to include Bill Clinton's sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. TheÂ Harvard law professorÂ has been part of the legal team for a number of high-profile defendants, includingÂ O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bulow,Â Jeffrey Epstein and Mike Tyson. A self-described Democrat, Dershowitz nevertheless says he doesn't believeÂ the actions of theÂ president necessitate his removalÂ from office. TheÂ former federal prosecutor succeeded Starr as independent counsel during the investigation of Clinton. But Ray declined toÂ prosecute Clinton in connection with perjury and obstruction charges. The former attorney general of Florida and a longtime Trump supporter, Bondi joined the White House communications team late last year on a temporary basis to help shape the administration's defence strategy around the House impeachment investigation.Â  Jane Raskin: The former federal attorney has handled organized crime and racketeering cases, includingÂ the nine-month trial and conviction of the underboss of the New England Mafia. Raskin and her husband, Martin, were both part of Trump's legal team during the Mueller investigation. Eric D. Herschmann:Â Herschmann is a partner at Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP, a law firm that has represented Trump in numerous cases over the last 15 years. He's also a formerÂ assistant district attorney in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. The U.S. Constitution mandates that a Senate presidential impeachment trial be presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme Court,Â a position currently held by Roberts. Appointed to the high court by George W. Bush in 2005,Â Roberts's role in the Senate trial is mostly ceremonial, as he has limited powers over the proceedings.Â He won't be ruling on objections, but he does haveÂ authority to hold someone in contempt, if, for example, a witness refuses to testify.

The cityÂ hired an external consultant to review the situation in JulyÂ 2019.Â  The resulting report is set to be considered by Regina'sÂ priorities and planning committee Wednesday. ""The Building Permits process has, for many years, received numerous complaints,"" says the introduction to the report in the committee agenda. The report compares the time to obtain permits in Regina to some other major prairie cities.Â  Regina averages 43 days to approve a residential permit. Saskatoon averages five days to approve a similar permits, while Winnipeg averages 11 days and Calgary averages 21. Commercial permits take an average of 65 days to get approved in Regina. This compares to averages ofÂ 25 to 50 days In Saskatoon, one to 29 days in Winnipeg and 49 to 56 days in Calgary. The report said the city's permit and inspection service has public safety, public confidence and economic competitiveness as objectives. ""If the City fails to diligently conduct plan review, permit issuance and construction inspections, the City may face legal liability for resulting financial losses, personal injuries or death,"" the report says. It says theÂ service should focus on clarity, consistency, efficiency and predictability. The report points to issuesÂ including staffing levels, cost recovery and the amount of days it takes to process permits as current issues. Regina's permit service has about eight employees. By contrast, Saskatoon has 17 and Calgary has 36. The report recommends a workforce development plan to bring in qualified building officials and keep them for years.Â  The service was originally supposed to recover all costs through permit fees. Instead, a 2018 study found this isn't the case. To be able to recover all costs, a 14 per cent fee increase would have to be put in place immediately.Â  The report says the city should not increase fees right now and should focus on building confidence in the industry first.Â  The report also recommends:Â  The city conducted a survey as part of the review. The majority of participants said they worked in the industry.Â  Eighty-seven per cent said said the building permits and inspection process is not efficient.

It wasn't that I even wanted to die. I didn't. I was just so exhausted from feeling the way I was feeling.Â  And while those moments â€” whenÂ dying feels like your only option â€”Â are scary, you feel so frustratedÂ that it makes it so tempting.Â  But here's what I need you to know! When you hear someone has died by suicide, it's heart-wrenching, it makes you feel sick to your stomach, it brings on a sudden intense feeling of ache in your soul â€” and always leaves you asking ""Why?""Â  Too many of us know the sting that suicide brings. Too many of us are scared to talk about suicide, and too many of us perpetuate stigma around suicide.Â  I don't have every answer.Â Nor can I speak to every case.Â  But three things, in my experience, I know areÂ certain. John Peters offers a personal message to anyone in crisis: I've often seen individuals who have been hesitant to talk about suicide, because they believe talking about it causes it to happen more frequently.Â  But I believe that if you're in pain, then you must talk about it. We need to have more conversations about suicide and life promotion with our families, children and friends, in our workspaces and communities. Through storytelling and education, we can abolish the stigma around suicide and be more compassionate. There is power, growth and a healing impact when we speak the truth.Â  Ignorance causes us to belittle, gaslight and silence those who are battling this enormous fight.Â  There is a persistent behaviour of calling people ""too sensitive"" â€” which is a way to avoid being held accountableÂ and to continue with abusive behaviour.Â  It can be seen everywhere, when you hear ""it's just a joke"" or ""don't take it so seriously.""Â  We must remember â€”Â we don't know what an individual is experiencing and what a person's thresholds are. Humour that involves someone's identity, religion, sexual orientation, mental health or appearanceÂ could be detrimental.Â  We as a community need to acknowledge the truth: there are many of us who fight silent battles and we urgently need to cultivate safe, shame-free spaces and communities, where an individual feels safe enough to reach out when in crisis.Â  We as community members are all accountable to our neighbours. Every human being's life is precious.Â  Today, there is no excuse for saying ""I don't know."" With the amount of information on the internet, public health,Â and local mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, we can take steps every day to ensure that we are informed and equipped with the right information and tools.Â  Which brings us toÂ â€_ It is a privilege to have access to resources and efficient care.Â  Sadly, here in Canada, prejudice and neglect are two major barriers in the system.Â  Due to the genocidal foundation of our country, colonial systems and policies, a large number of Canadians do not have access to care.Â  I speak to this as a front-line worker. In my area, for example, we have fewer than 1,500 people, and the number of people who have to tirelessly fight to access care is appalling.Â  Now, think about that in a lens looking at the entire country.Â  If any CanadianÂ suffers, if any CanadianÂ dies by suicide, we fail, Canada fails â€” and continues to fail. Commission your community's leadership and local governments to bring in resources, and do not be gentle or quiet about it. BE LOUD AND ADAMANT! Community is incredible and when we are connected, we can move the earth. Conduct workshops facilitated by health professionals about suicide prevention, so the community can gain knowledge. Provide mental health therapists and programsÂ to respond to our community members who reach out when they are in crisis. This will help us support and care for them in a good way.Â  Provide spaces where people can pray together, and provide creative outlets for people to nourish their gifts and talents. Each individual has a unique expression form and when it's nourished, it is powerful and healing.Â  You can also start prevention and life promotionÂ initiatives in your own community to raise awareness. Really, the list could go on and on, because everyone is responsible for actively contributing to the prevention of suicide. There are lives at stake!Â  Many people, such as your friends, family, even you, may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.Â  I need you to know, if that's you right now, wherever you are â€” listen to me: You are loved, you are not a badÂ person, you are not a bad parent, you are not a bad kid, you are not a screw-up, and you are not worthless.

I'd spent a particularly stressful season buying, wrappingÂ and bookkeeping. I realized that I'd lost touch with the holiday I loved so much.Â  There was a time when IÂ eagerly bounded out of bed on Nov. 1Â to see if the stores had put up decorations yet. I belted out Christmas music all season. Now the sight of a twinkling tree just made me feel tired.Â  I realized my kids were still of that tender age where I hadn't yet defined how Christmas ""should"" be. I had a unique opportunity. I explained, a la Whoville, that Christmas doesn't come from a store. I quickly learned that ""handmade Christmas"" could be even more exhausting than ""bought Christmas."" After the first year I learned to streamline. Each person picked a type of giftÂ  and made a ton of them. You get what you get.Â  I learned to have a strong idea of the season I loved and wanted â€” beautiful decorations, nice smells in the kitchen, tons of time with my family â€” and to keep adjusting until I got there. My kids bought into the idea with remarkable enthusiasm.Â The toddler declared excitedly ""I get to BE Santa"" (in our household, we treat Santa as a metaphor more than a literal truth).Â Both boys spent all of November and December rescuing egg cartons from the trash, colouring them with markersÂ and wrapping them to go under the tree. On Dec. 24, we went around to friends and neighbours who were delighted to receive partially wrapped bits of trash from exuberant three- and five-year-olds wearing Santa hats. It was all the cuteness of regular Christmas, with far less guilt for getting rid of everything the minute the season has passed. A couple of years in, I found a five-year-old sitting beside the tree surrounded by piles of gifts. He declared, ""Mom, I have more presents than ANYBODY,""Â  Looking at the piles he'd sorted, I saw that he meant he'd made more presents than anybody.Â  I was sold. I figured it would end when they went to school, but it didn't.Â They'd return each January to join in the chorus of ""what'd you get?"" with their heartfelt speeches about creating the Christmas that matters to you.Â I thought this would get them ostracized for sure, but it gave them a kind of celebrity. The boys' sense of fairness was helped by the fact that we do presents at other times of the year. I'd see something perfect for them in a store in May and bring it home as a spontaneous gift, especially when travel was imminent. I once overheard one of the boys saying ""we don't do bought Christmas, we do airplane Presents."" Last year, it changed.Â My 13-year-old asked if we could have a bought Christmas, so that he could find out what ""normal Christmas"" was like.Â His dad and I had a decision to make. Was handmade ChristmasÂ really about no-buying, or was it about intentionality?Â Â  We agreed to give bought Christmas a try. By mid-morning on Dec. 25, it appeared we'd never go back.Â The 13-year-old stood in piles of crumpled paper and declared, ""What have I been missing?"" To my surprise, this year he asked if we could go ""50-50"" between the two.Â  He told me that bought Christmas was ""fun, but obviously not for every year,"" and that it ""lacked a personal touch.""Â  His older brother would have skipped bought Christmas completely, because he thought it was ""exhausting"" and that ""making a gift means you're giving someone a part of you."" I have no idea what Christmas will look like for my boys when they're adults.Â  Or even next year. What I hope is that it will be a conscious choice.Â I also hope that if â€” or when â€” they feel like they've lost the season they love, they'll have the tools they need to find it again.

Jill Knapp's run-in with CBSA agents took placeÂ on Jan.Â 9, 2016, on her way home to Calgary, after visiting her husband in Mexico City. The 39-year-old says she is only now speaking out about her experience because she was diagnosed with anxiety after her airport ordeal. ""It was traumatizing,"" Knapp told Go Public, explaining that no one told her why she was red-flagged as she attempted to make her connecting flightÂ in Vancouver. She said she hasÂ no criminal record and had nothing in her luggage that would promptÂ a closer look. ""Within two minutes he called me a drug smuggler, mentioned a strip search, and even said that he was going to send me to the hospital for an X-ray [to look for drugs],"" says Knapp. ""And that was before he even asked me any questions."" A request under the Access to Information Act by the CBC revealsÂ other airline travellers haveÂ officiallyÂ complainedÂ about mistreatment byÂ border agentsÂ includingÂ screaming, using foul language, belittling them, using racial profiling and physical force. A civil liberties advocate says the complaintsÂ pointÂ to the need for independent oversight of the CBSA, the only major law enforcement agency in Canada that doesn't have external review of employee conduct. ""When border agents operate â€”Â either at land crossings, at airports â€”Â there is very little oversight,"" says Tim McSorley, national co-ordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, based in Ottawa. Knapp says she had collected her luggage when she wasÂ pulled aside and directed to ""secondary inspection,"" where she says a border guard became instantlyÂ aggressive. ""Out of nowhere, he actually raised his voice at me and said, 'I think you're a drug smuggler,'"" says Knapp. ""He said, 'I deal with people like you every day.'"" Knapp says she told him she had been visiting her husband in Mexico and that she had applied for him to live in Canada, but says the agent didn't believe her. She says the agent also didn't believe her when he asked what her job was and Knapp told him she worked with law firms as a software instructor. ""He actually scoffed at me and said, 'You don't do that type of work.' How would he know what kind of work I did? He was getting angrier and angrier."" The agent confiscated her phone and demanded her password. Finding nothing incriminating on her phone or in her luggage, the agent called in a drug-sniffing dog, which also didn't detect anything. Knapp saysÂ she was eventually placed in detention, but says she wasn't told why. She requested to speak with a lawyer and was told staff placed a call on her behalf, but she never heard from anyone. She hadn't eaten for 14 hours, but was only offered half a glass of water and no food. She says CBSA staff denied her requests to use the bathroom. Knapp was growing increasingly concerned about her parents, who were picking her up in Calgary. Her father is a heart attack survivor, and she worried about causing him stress. In desperation, she says, she offered to have theÂ strip search the agent had mentioned hours earlier. ""At that point, I was so scared of what they would do if I stayed, it was like â€_ if this is what it takes for me to leave, I'm going to do it.'"" Knapp saysÂ two female officers entered the room and told her to strip from the waist up. She told them she was a Sunday School teacher before complying. Finding nothing, they ordered her to remove her clothing from the waist down. ""They actually made me turn around, open up my butt cheeks and squat,"" says Knapp. ""I was just in shock. I didn't quite understand what it involved."" Knapp was finally released, and her phone returned. She foundÂ half a dozen texts from her anxious husbandÂ wondering where she was. CBC requested an interview with the CBSA, but the agency declined. In a statement, it said it couldn't discuss Knapp's caseÂ due to privacy concerns. After Knapp filed a complaint, she obtained internal documents through the Privacy Act, in which CBSA spokesperson Isabel McCusker wrote:Â ""The review of Ms. Knapp's clearance established that the [border services officers] involved in her examination followed standard procedures and guidelines."" CBCÂ receivedÂ over 1,700 pages of documents, most of the material heavily censored, after submitting a request under the Access to Information ActÂ to find out how many other travellers have filed complaints about their treatment at the hands of the CBSA. We asked for complaints the agency classified under ""Officer/employee conduct,""Â ""Questioning"" and other categories, for Vancouver International Airport, Toronto's Pearson International Airport and Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. The documents contain more than 800Â allegations investigated by the CBSA about border agents and inappropriate behaviour, including the following: ""Officer commented, 'People like you who can't afford to travel always traffic drugs.'"" ""Threw me on the ground, yelling 'Don't resist'... [other]Â agents loved this and were laughing."" ""Hauled into the airport jail and treated like trash."" ""He called me moronÂ more than once ... mocked my ... accent."" ""I was roughly frisked ... detained/held for questioningÂ for sevenÂ hours."" ""He attacked me in the baggage claim area ... made anti-Semitic remarks."" ""He was pushing me with his hands ... started using foul language."" ""They broke my iPad."" ""Pulled out a knife in a threatening manner ... stared at me and then thrust the knife into the cardboard box."" TheÂ CBSA has a code of conduct, which says officers will act with ""professionalism, integrity and respect."" ""It's completely unacceptable and â€_ kind of repulsive that people go through this when they're simply trying to travel to their destination,"" says McSorley, who reviewed the complaints. ""It's ... just common courtesy and decency that you wouldn't swear, use racist terms, use anti-Semitic terms, use physical force against someone who hasn't broken a law."" A CBSA spokesperson said during the calendar years 2016 to 2018, it investigated 821 allegations of misconduct by agentsÂ at all border crossings, of whichÂ 615 led to disciplinary action â€” including termination. McSorley's organization has been pushing for years for external oversight of the CBSA. ""There are millions of people crossing our border, flying into the country,"" says McSorley. ""The public deserves transparency from [the CBSA]."" For three years, the federal government has been promising to bring in oversight, and a bill is currently before the House of Commons. However, it has not yet received royal assent, and time is running out before the House breaks for the Oct. 21 federal election. Harassment, sexual assault among alleged misconduct by border agents investigated by CBSA In another internal CBSA memo Knapp obtained through the Privacy Act, as part of an internal investigation into the complaint she filed, an officer wroteÂ that she was detained because her eyes appeared to be bloodshot â€”Â perhaps raising suspicion of drug use. Knapp says her eyes were red due to crying because she missedÂ her husband. The officer also noted she was wearing bulky clothing, which Knapp disputes, saying she was wearing a fitted yoga outfit. Lastly, the officer questioned why she was flying through Vancouver on her way home to Calgary from Mexico. ""That was because I was using Aeroplan and that was the only route I could do,"" says Knapp. ""But the thing is, no one ever raised any of these concerns with me."" Knapp says she is speaking out about what happened to her to try to encourage Ottawa to change how complaints about the CBSA are investigated. ""I'm a safe person to talk about it because I'm a Canadian citizen â€_ and I have no risk of deportation or anything like that,"" she says.

""He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me,"" Winfrey told The Associated Press through a spokesperson on Friday. It was not anything Simmons said that prompted Winfrey to withdraw from the On the RecordÂ film, according to Winfrey, but rather inconsistencies in the story of one of Simmons' accusers, Drew Dixon, that she felt needed to be addressed. Winfrey said Friday that she still believes Dixon and other women in the film, but that more reporting was needed. On the RecordÂ directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have said they have ample evidence against Simmons, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings. Winfrey has said she wanted to delay the release of the film, scheduled to premiere Jan. 25 at the Sundance Film Festival, but that that view was not shared by the film's directors. On the RecordÂ had been part of her partnership with Apple, which no longer will distribute the documentary. Winfrey, who herself has spoken openly of beingÂ sexually abused, announced she was leaving as executive producer on Jan. 10, saying that more work was needed and that the filmmakers were ""not aligned"" in their ""creative vision."" The film's producers, Impact Partners, said in a statement earlier this week that the movie was ready for Sundance. ""We have always championed the voices of those who have been wrongly silenced. The women in this film have made a great sacrifice by coming forward to tell their stories in their own words. We are honoured to support them,"" the Impact statement reads. ""We stand firmly behind the work of the intrepid filmmakers who continue to break new ground by advancing important stories in the public interest."" The AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Dixon has told her story publicly, including on CBS This Morning earlier this week. The communications between Winfrey and Simmons and her concerns about Dixon's story were first reported by The New York Times. Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, a Simmons representative issued a statement, saying ""If defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation, then there would be no justice."" Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Winfrey disputed allegations by the makers of On the RecordÂ that she gave them little warning before her Jan. 10 announcement. In a story which ran early Friday, Dick and Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter that they received just 20 minutes notice before Winfrey issued her statement. ""It was very disappointing and upsetting,"" Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them. That was our first thought. 'Oh my God. Let's tell everybody and figure this out.'""Â  Winfrey told the AP that Dick and Ziering knew well of her intentions. She said she had raised concerns last month about the film needing more work. According to Winfrey, she told Dick and Ziering that ""new information"" had made her see gaps she ""thought needed to be filled"" and that it was better to ""take a rest."" ""They said they would go on with or without me,"" Winfrey told the AP. She said the bottom line for her was that ""The film isn't ready.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/winfrey-decision-simmons-doc-1.5432160,[],N/A77,Fred Youngs,2019-12-21T11:00:00.737Z,Amateur hour LRT announcement shows Tories can't get past blaming Liberals,"This column is an opinion piece by former CBC journalist Fred Youngs. Youngs was a reporter, producer, executive producer and senior manager for CBC News in Winnipeg, Calgary and Toronto and covered politics at newspapers in Ontario and Manitoba.Â A Hamiltonian by birth, he was the senior project manager for the development ofÂ CBC Hamilton.Â Â For more information aboutÂ CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. If there is a checklist for how to bungle a sensitive and fractious political announcement, Caroline Mulroney's appearance - or non-appearance - in Hamilton this week would tick most of the boxes. Indeed, it might just tick all of them. In just a few hours the minister of transportation for Ontario kiboshed a long-planned light rapid transit project for Hamilton, and blamed ballooning costs on the previous government, but didn't give any details around how or why they rose. On top of that she ducked out of a planned media briefing, and left town, for some reason, with a police escort.Â  Predictably, this amateur hourÂ approach to political announcements has reignited the long-running debate over the LRT in Hamilton. Opponents are delighted; its proponents dismayed. City councillors â€” who were and still are pretty much in the dark â€” are left trying to figure out what to do with the $1 billion Mulroney left on the table for unspecified transit projects in Hamilton. They will have to hurry. Mulroney wants a plan by February â€” which doesn't leave a lot of time to figure out how to spend a lot of money. All this has served to underline that even though they have been in power for 18 months, the Ford government is still making things up as it goes along. And when it runs into turbulence as it did this week in Hamilton, its favourite response is to pivot quickly to blaming the former Liberal government for its troubles. It was Premier Doug Ford who came up with a plan for a new subway line for Toronto, along with $11.2 billion in funding to build it. It, too, came out of the blue to the city and its citizens, and upended planning and work that had already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.Â  For her part, Mulroney undid $165 millionÂ in work and preparation for the Hamilton line. About half of that sum was used to purchase property along the proposed LRT line â€” property the province now owns. All of which must make city officials in Mississauga, Ottawa and other Ontario municipalities, where transit projects are or will be in the works, just a tad nervous. Who knows what comes next if the province decides to draw up its own transit plan for one city, and unilaterally decides to kill a project in another?Â  That explains why Mulroney decided that the real culprit here is the previous Liberal regime.Â  The Wynne government, Mulroney said in a statement, had not been ""upfront"" about the cost for building and running the LRT. It was really $5.5 billion, according to her. Although Mulroney has yet to reveal the figures and details to show how the PC government came to that conclusion.Â  ""We cannot afford to continue the Liberals' approach of making empty promises today and accumulating a massive legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren,"" she said. Slagging the Liberals for ""empty promises"" on the LRT is a bit tricky, given that Ford declared a little over a year ago that if Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger ""wants an LRT, he'll get an LRT."" That was then, it seems, and this is now. Voters decided more than 560 days ago that they had had enough of Wynne and her party. The Liberal party is now just a beleaguered rump, huddled in a corner at Queen's Park trying to figure out how to claw its way out of a hole. The Liberals may have started this project, but the responsibility for it now lies with the PCs. Voters in Hamilton and across Ontario deserve a better explanation of how and why the cost skyrocketed, how the province plans to deal with all the property it owns in Hamilton, and what comes next for transit in Hamilton, and in other cities.Â  What they don't need is yet another helping of partisanship, finger-pointing and blaming someone else.Â  For more information aboutÂ CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/amateur-hour-lrt-announcement-shows-tories-can-t-get-past-blaming-liberals-1.5403214,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/liuna-lrt-1.5402413,N/A78,Karin Larsen,2020-01-22T03:12:10.824Z,The strange tale of the paid protesters supporting Meng Wanzhou at her extradition hearing,"Two people who demonstrated in support of Meng Wanzhou outside B.C. Supreme Court during her extradition hearing say they were unwittingly recruited under false pretences and paid to be there. Meng, the CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 at the request of the U.S., which seeks to extradite her to face charges of fraud. A number of people showed up on the first day of her hearing MondayÂ and held signs supporting her. For actor Julia Hackstaff of VancouverÂ it all started with aÂ promise of $100 for two hours of work in what she understood to be an appearance as an extra in a movie shoot. Hackstaff said the offer came over Facebook from a person in the acting community she hasÂ never met. ""It's terrible,Â it's horrifying,"" she said. ""I was sincerely going to participate in something that seemed cool and a nice opportunity. And they took advantage of my profession and my passion ...Â to make a false protest."" TheÂ second person, whom CBC News has agreed not to identify and will refer to as SP, said she was recruited by a friend promising aÂ $150 payday just toÂ show up at the courthouse and hold a sign. ""I was told it was to free Ms. Meng. I had never heard that name before in my lifeâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹,"" said SP, also of Vancouver. ""I had to go after and Google what Huawei was because I never heard that [name] before in my life. I didn't even know it was a company."" Both womenÂ say they don't know who was ultimately offering the payment for their participation. SP says a woman identified only as ""Jowe"" [pronounced ""Joey""] handed out the signs at the courthouse. ""She didn't say much, she just shook our hands,"" said SP, who was standing with a small group of people. ""She disappeared for a bit and came back and she had the red signs that you can see in the picturesÂ a lot of people holding. So I assume either she made them or someone got them made for her, and she just basically handed them out. That was it. We were given no instruction, no information on what we're doing."" HackstaffÂ saysÂ she and a friend were told by her contact to goÂ to the Holiday Inn a few blocks away and then brought to the courthouse. When they arrived, they approached a group of young people who looked ""lost""Â she assumed were background actors. ""I went and asked, 'Are you guys the extras?' And one guy said yes.Â He then asked me my name and my friend's name. So we gave him our first names and he checked on his phone like [as] if he had a list."" HackstaffÂ said she was handed a redÂ sign that said ""Free Ms. Meng, Equal Justice!"" Soon after, she began questioning what was actually going on. There was something very strange about this protest this morning. Participants said they had only heard about the hearing last minute, hence the basic signs. They were unwilling to tell media about their cause and where they were from and were becoming agitated at questions. <a href=""https://t.co/Gnva9yaW4b"">https://t.co/Gnva9yaW4b</a> ""AÂ CBS reporter approached me and my friend and she started interviewing us. And it was in those moments and questions where I started realizing, OK, if this was background work, they wouldn't need detail on background people."" ""And then I started realizing, wait, no one called 'action,'"" she said.Â  Hackstaff says she ""freaked out"" when a second reporter approached, coming to the realization that the movieÂ she thought she was appearing in was, in fact, something very real. She says that's when she left without being paid. SP says her friend paid her $150 via an e-transfer. She says after she read up onÂ Meng and Huawei, she feels deep regret at having participated in what she feels was a faux protest.Â Â  ""I wasn't educated ... and that's a shame on me,"" she said. ""I really wish there was a way to go back in time."" CBCÂ News has left messages with the woman identified as Jowe. She has not responded.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/paid-protesters-meng-wanzhou-1.5434613,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5433840,N/A79,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-04-11T00:00:00.447Z,Bank regulator's report on aggressive sales tactics weakened after government â€” and banks â€” reviewed drafts,"Last year's report from Canada's banking regulator about aggressive sales tactics underwent several drafts that eliminated proposed protections for consumers â€” edits that were made after the regulator sent early versions to the federal Finance Department and the big banks. Internal documents from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) â€” obtained under Access to Information and provided to Go Public â€” show that some recommendations for action were weakened or removed, including a proposal to require that banks work in the best interest of consumers.  Another key edit was the addition of a line saying the review did not find ""widespread mis-selling"" by the banks. It all paints a picture of the ""cosy"" relationship between the country's six big banks, the agency that's supposed to regulate them and the federal government, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""[The banks] have disproportionate access and perhaps disproportionate influence."" The report was prompted in part by months of reporting by Go Public, in which hundreds of current and former bank employees said they were pushed to upsell customers to try to meet sales targets. Some described feeling pressured to do such things as mislead customers about credit card fees and mortgage rates, forge signatures on credit card and loan insurance products and secretly increase lines of credit. At the time, the banks told Go Public that they act in the best interests of their clients, and that employees are expected to follow various codes of conduct. The documents were obtained through Access to Information by public policy researcher Ken Rubin, who asked for draft copies of FCAC's report on sales practices at the big banks, and related correspondence. The regulator's review focused on BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD and National Bank. It found that banks encourage employees to sell products and services and reward them for sales success. But FCAC also said it did not find evidence of widespread harm to consumers. Although FCAC staff interviewed 600 bank employees, and reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents and 4,500 customer complaints, the report did not name a single bank or quote from any of the interviews. ""When I saw the March [2018] report, I said, 'There's more to it than meets the eye,'"" said Rubin, one of Canada's most prolific practitioners of federal Access to Information requests. Thomas found it particularly interesting that the regulator sent a draftÂ of its report to the very banks at the centre of its eight-month review. ""[The banks] have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking,"" he said. ""It's a fact of life."" Sending the banks a draft copy is a big concern for consumer advocate Duff Conacher. ""You don't share â€_ the evidence you gathered,"" said the co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa. ""That evidence is the basis of your conclusions as to whether the law has been violated."" The banking regulator told Go Public it sent the banks a draft report so the financial institutions could ""identify factual errors."" ""If the agency wanted to check the facts in the report â€_ they could have just sent them those facts,"" Conacher said.  In a subsequent draft, a line was added pointing out that banks are ""in the process of enhancing their oversight and management of sales practices risk."" It's not known who proposed adding that line. Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) whether it requested a draft copy of the report.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labreche sent an email that did not respond to that question, writing, ""The Canadian Bankers Association and its member banks regularly communicate and meet with supervisory bodies, including the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as part of the normal course of the oversight process."" The internal documents also include dozens of pages from the big banks, which appear to be responses to the regulator's draft report.  Go Public is not able to know their contents â€” including the date they were written, or who wrote them â€” because entire pages were redacted under an Access to Information exemption that protects commercial interests. The documents also reveal that the banking regulator supplied a draftÂ to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his department three months before publicly releasing it last year. Conacher says the regulator, purportedly an independent agency, should not have given the minister and his department a chance to vet and comment on its report. ""It's inappropriate and improper for a minister to be looking at the draft conclusions of a law enforcement agency,"" he told Go Public. ""That means decisions could be made on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts and the law."" One of the most significant edits to the initial draft that was sent to the finance minister was the addition of a finding on Page 1 that says,Â ""FCAC did not find widespread mis-selling during its review."" ""It's hard to say â€_ exactly what happened,"" said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer organization based in Ottawa. ""The language seems to belie the rest of the report, which goes into some detail about how sales practices â€” which are a little unseemly â€” can be performed."" Go Public requested an interview with Morneau, but his spokesperson, Pierre-Olivier Herbert, said the minister was unavailable. In a statement, Herbert did not respond to Conacher's criticism that it ought to be consideredÂ inappropriate for the minister to receive a draft report from the banking regulator. A Finance Department spokesperson said it is routine for financial sector agencies to share documents for comment and to confirm facts. Go Public received various versions of the banking regulator's report, including several versions of the original draft, a revised copy after it went to the finance minister, and the final report.  Sentences, recommendations or conclusions are redacted in several drafts, based on an exemption in Canada's Access to Information Act that allows the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose any advice involving the institution or a federal cabinet minister. The exemption applies to advice or recommendations that occur at a ministerial level, essentially to allow confidentiality in the policy-making process. Go Public asked the minister about additions made after he had received a copy. In an email, Morneau's spokesperson wrote, ""the Minister's office did not provide comments or request any edits to the FCAC's report. The findings in the FCAC's report are entirely their own."" However, the documents indicate that Morneau's department made at least six comments on the first draft of the report, including about changing parts that say the regulator will introduceÂ certain reforms to the regulatorÂ ""proposes"" them. Most of the comments from the department are redacted. ""The biggest thing is there were three recommendations saying banks should be 'required' to make changes,"" ConacherÂ said. ""And those were all changed to 'suggestions' that the banks should do some things. ""Suggestions are meaningless, if you're actually trying to solve a problem. The banks don't have to do anything."" The draft sent to the minister's office included a line saying, ""Require banks to work in the best interests of their customers."" The line didn't make the final version of the report. Some other language that was critical of the banks â€” such as a line saying that banks ""lean disproportionately in favour of a sales driven culture"" â€” was also dropped before the report was published. Go Public checked the lobbyist registry to see how many times the banks or their umbrella group, the CBA, lobbied government officials, senators,Â MPs â€” including Morneau â€” the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and FCAC during the 12-month period between when the regulator announced it was conducting a bank review and the date it released its report. Between March 15, 2017, and March 20, 2018, the big banks and the CBA lobbied a total of 165 times. In the month leading up to the release of FCAC's report, the CBA met with the regulator's deputy commissioner, Brigitte Goulard, four times â€” including the day before the report was published. Lobbying is legal, but those who do significant amounts of it are required to file a record with the lobbying commissioner, who then makes the information public online. ""The banks â€” because they're an important economic asset to the country â€” have to be listened to,"" said the University of Manitoba's Paul Thomas. ""They have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking. It's a fact of life."" As a comparison, Go Public asked four consumer advocacy organizations how many times they had the ear of lawmakers and banking watchdogs during the same period. In total, they had fewer than 10 meetings with policy-makers and FCAC to discuss the sales practices of banks, they said. ""It's extremely concerning to us, of course, that consumer groups are not more meaningfully supported to participate in these important conversations,"" wrote Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. ""The council continues to have serious concerns about the resources available to facilitate meaningful consumer representation at not only FCAC but across government concerning consumer protection."" Thomas says after combing through the various versions of the bank regulator's report, the relationship between the banks, the government and the banking regulator can be difficult to figure out. ""The whole process is submerged. It's not transparent,"" he said.  ""If it hadn't been for Access to Information requests, we wouldn't know the extent to which the banks were given a certain privileged status in this process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fcac-bank-report-on-sales-tactics-weakened-1.5091115,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096,N/A80,Anonymous,2020-01-17T21:43:12.017Z,Scientists create a robot made entirely of living cells,"Scientists have unveiled the first ever ""living robot,""Â an organism made up of living cells, which can move around, carry payloads, and even heal itself. ""All of the computational people on the project, myself included, were flabbergasted,"" said Joshua Bongard, a computer scientist at the University of Vermont.Â Â  ""We didn't realize that this was possible."" Teams from the University of Vermont and Tufts University worked together to build what they're calling ""xenobots,""Â which are about the size of a grain of salt and are made up of the heart and skin cells from frogs.  ""The particular frog that we borrowed these cells from is known as Xenopus laevis,"" Bongard told Quirks & Quarks host Bob McDonald. ""But Xeno is also in Greek stands for alien, or unknown, or different, or new, and we think both interpretations apply to this new kind of technology."" Bongard's team used the Deep Green supercomputer clusterÂ at the University of Vermont to figure out how to configure the cells to work as a robot. The computer's ""building materials"" for the robot were heart cells, which could act as a kind of motor, and skin cells which could help provide structure for the organism.Â  Using an evolutionary algorithm, they told the supercomputer that they wanted these cells to achieve the simple task ofÂ movingÂ across a petri dish. Then, over the next few weeks, the supercomputer assembled and thenÂ reassembled a few hundred simulated cells into different shapes to see which ones could achieve this task.  ""The idea here is that you have these heart cells which basically increase and decrease in volume,"" said Bongard. ""And if you put them all together they push and pull on each other and produce overall motion in the organism. We want obviously that motion to propel this new organism along the bottom of the petri dish."" As the programs ran, the more successful designs were kept and refined, while failed designs were discarded. After hundreds of virtual tests, the most promising designs were passed on to a team at Tufts University to build in real life. Working under a microscope, microsurgeon Douglas Blackiston carefully crafted these skin and heart cellsÂ together into the designs chosen by the supercomputer, making use of the cells' natural tendencies to stick to one another.Â  Once they were built, these bots started moving around, just as the supercomputer predicted. But some of the ways they moved surprised the researchers â€” especially when they put multiple bots in the same dish. ""If...Â we add small pellets to the dish, the swarm of xenobots will act like very small sheepdogs. They will collectively push these pellets around and gradually push them into small piles,""Â saidÂ Bongard. ""Now, why they do that is still a complete mystery to us."" Blackiston's team also wanted to see how the xenobots recover from injury, so they sliced one almost in half, and watched as the bot slowly stitched itself back together. ""After some more thought, it's not really that surprising because biological tissue has four and a half billion years' experience with dealing with everything that physical environment can throw at us,"" said Bongard.Â ""So we sort of get this additional functionality for free.""Â  The research was published this week in the scientific journalÂ PNAS. The ultimate motivation for making these these living robots was to create a robot that can go where traditional robots can't go, and leave less waste when their purpose has been met. For example, aÂ xenobot could be used to deliver medication to a specific target in the human body, or be used to collect microplasticsÂ in the ocean.Â  ""A lot of the applications we see at the moment are things like environmental cleanup and also clinical applications,"" he said.Â ""Because these small bio bots are made up of 100 per cent living tissue, they're 100 per cent biodegradable and biocompatible."" Bongard also understands why some people are concerned with the idea of a living robot. Â ""There's no genetic engineering here, so we're not tinkering with viruses or the DNA of organisms. If you zoom in on a xenobot down to the level of an individual cell, you're looking at a normal frog cell,"" he said.Â  ""In a way xenobots are just frogs, they just don't look anything like a frog.""

Paul issued a news release Tuesday saying she has not agreed to allow the Pictou County, N.S., treatment facility to continue to be used after Jan. 31. She takes particular issue with the company's plan to run its power boiler to provide heat at the site while winterizing the mill, a move that would mean water would flow through the system and into Boat Harbour as late as April. ""We were not consulted about it,"" Paul said in the news release. She could not be reached for an interview. In her release, Paul said the community is disappointed. ""We were expecting a complete shutdown of the Boat Harbour treatment facility,"" she said.Â ""Northern Pulp could have started draining the pipes weeks ago in order to complete the work before Jan. 31 and avoid the need to heat the mill after that."" Last month, Premier Stephen McNeilÂ rejected calls from the mill to extend the legislated deadline for the company's use of Boat Harbour to treat its effluent. On Tuesday, McNeil said the government is dealing with the situation as it exists, while continuing to keep the promise enshrined in the Boat Harbour Act. ""There will be no new effluent going into Boat Harbour as of the 31st of January. Our commitment has been met to [the Pictou Landing First Nation] and we'll continue to work with them,"" he said. ""Here's where we are,"" McNeil added.Â ""The reality of it is, we also have an issue and that's that pipe. So we couldn't do anything with the pipe until [Jan. 31]."" Running water through the boiler means the pipe connecting the mill to Boat Harbour, which the province owns and is responsible for, will be flushed and cleaned, allowing it to be disconnected and permanently removed by the end of April, said McNeil. In the meantime, he's expecting a detailed plan from the company within the week about how they will deal with other issues on the mill site, such as leachate and the capping of manhole covers on the property that receive runoff water, which flows into Boat Harbour. As those details continue to be worked out, people who work in the woods and other industries connected to the forestry are on watch for what all of itÂ means for them. The province's forestry transition team has made several funding announcements to assist with silviculture work and retraining, but removing the industry's largest player all but guarantees some operators won't be able to remain viable for the long term. Already, companies from other provinces are advertising job fairs. Josh Molnar operates Molnar Welding in Lantz, N.S., a fabrication and repairÂ shop that specializes in work for sawmills, and employs 25 people. They've been in business for about 45 years. Molnar, the third generation of his family to runÂ the business, said he's watching closely to see what happens with sawmills around the province. If they reach the point where they have nowhere to send chips, it will have a direct effect on his own business. He's hoping that new markets for those chips come about quickly, such as for district heating orÂ biomass for electricity. As much as some people in the industry would like to see Northern Pulp keep operating, Molnar said the immediate focus right now must be on finding new markets and ways to keep the sector viable. ""[Sawmills] need time, they need a solution to get rid of their products so that they can invest for the future,"" he said. It would also mean a future for the 25 people at Molnar Welding and other businesses like them.

On the outskirts of Tehran, the fragments of what was once a journey of many dreams lie scattered against a bleak landscape. Amidst the twisted metal and clothing littering the scorched earth, there is a single red shoe of a child. It hasÂ a pretty bow, slightly singed by the flames that engulfed Flight PS752 in its last moments before it crashed from the sky in a great ball of fire, bringing to a sudden end so many stories yet to be told, so many joys yet to be discovered. The little shoe made me think of one-year old Kurdia, whose parents Evin and Hiva had taken her halfway across the world, from Canada to Iran, to celebrate a wedding. Persian weddings, we jokingly say, need a football stadium to accommodate the guests. How many adoring grandparents and elders, aunts and uncles, cousins and friendsÂ must have smothered little Kurdia with affectionate kisses, seeing her for the first time, not knowing that it would also be the last. It seems to be the fate of people in the Middle East to suffer. Some weeks earlier, hundreds of Iranian youths were shot on the streets of Tehran for protesting corruption, crying for freedom, and their loved ones were arrested for mourning their loss.Â Mothers and fathers have been killed by barrel bombs in Idlib and Aleppo,Â standing in a bread line to appease the unbearable pain of hunger. And it is only a matter of time before we witness, yet again, those desperate to flee such horrors, drowning in the depths of the Mediterranean while trying to cross the forbidding sea in rubber dinghies, in search of a better world. And now, the grim sight of a long succession of body bagsÂ amidst the wreckage of the aircraft that carried so many on their way home to Canada, the country that opened its doors to them, answering their dream of a better future. One tries to be philosophical at times like this. ""Death is our wedding with eternity,"" the great mystic Rumi wrote. It is difficult to reconcile that wisdom with the horrors the hapless passengers must have experienced in their final moments. Yet, just as weddings are a communal experience thatÂ teach us what it means to belong, so too communal grief and mourning shows us, in the hour of darkness, the astonishing light of the human spirit; the inextricable ties that bind us together. In ""Tehranto""Â and Montreal, Windsor and Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, Halifax and London, across this vast space we call Canada, people have lost family and friends, neighbours and colleagues, teachers and students. This isn't just another horrible thing happening ""out there,"" in that other world of suffering that momentarily intrudes on our lives of privilege, trivialized by a tweet or fleeting Facebook post, soon to be forgotten. Now it is happening to ""us,""Â we who call ourselves Canadians, who imagine belonging as something that is beyond the bonds of blood and soil; a transcendent connection built on a shared humanity. The flag flies at half-mast at my universityÂ in Montreal,Â as it does across other campuses through the country. Many on that ill-fated flight were professors, researchers, and students, part of Iran's massive brain drain as accomplished and ambitious youth settle here in our midst to start new lives. On my mobile phone, there are numerous e-mails and text messages from fellow Canadians, expressing sympathy and concern, mourning the loss that has become ours for the simple reason that we have come to live in the same place â€“ a wonderful and precious place where, amidst grief and suffering, compassion reigns supreme. Just as joyous celebrations defineÂ who we are, communal bereavementÂ â€”Â healing together, whether it is with our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were here before us or with the recent immigrant returning home from a previous homeÂ â€”Â teaches us what it means to be human. What it means to be Canadian. It unites us at the core, gives us a deeper identity, emancipates us from the superficial divisions and distractions that we confuse with true meaning.

Noakes,2020-01-15T23:26:45.604Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan: Welcome to Canada, but pay your own bills","This column is an opinionÂ by Taylor C. Noakes, an independent journalist and public historian from Montreal.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. It's remarkably easy to become financially independent, as Prince Harry and Meghan say they want to do,Â when other people pay your bills. Doubtless this will be a crucial lesson in Ontario's new high school financial literacy course; there's no better way to keep your money than by not having to spend it. Just ask any Canadian billionaire, whose tax rates have decreased over the past 20 years while their share of total income skyrocketed over the same time period. It's remarkable, too, that news of Meghan, Harry and Archie's planned Brexit to Canada has really only led to a single central question: will Canada pay their security costs? Not ""why are we maintaining this antiquated, obsolete and fundamentally undemocratic institution,""Â but rather how much more are we willing to fork over for Monarchy Lite? If the Sussexes are coming to Canada at least in part because they're looking to be more financially independent, they should pay their own security costs. Even without the estimatedÂ Â£82.4 million ($140 million Cdn) the royal family will receive this year from British taxpayers through the sovereign grant, the couple has an estimated net worth of Â£18 million and receives another Â£2.3 million annually from Prince Charles. What's particularly curious here is that the Sussexes are in fact doubling down on the monarchy even though they appear to be moving away from it. They're quite literally in the process of attempting to trademark ""Sussex Royal""Â in an application covering Canada and Australia, as well as noted bulwarks of British monarchism the European Union and United States. So while they're ostensibly stepping away from their public functions as senior members of the royal family, there are no plans to move away from the fortune to be made from branding and marketing their royal likeness on everything from coffee cups to beach towels. In other words, they're not taking a step back from the monarchy, they're bringing the monarchy to Canada on a semi-permanent basis, seemingly as part of a major product launch. (This ain't your grandma's royal family, it's new and improved!) As much as we might be tempted to feel bad for the embarrassing elements of Harry's family, or the nauseating racism of contemporary British society directed towards Meghan, we mustn't forget the Sussexes are fundamentally a business for whom the taxpaying public pays most if not all of the bills. And though it may appear the couple are fleeing the salivating hounds of Fleet Street, they are in fact imposing themselves on a people they have little in common with. According to some poll numbers, about half of Canadians think our relationship with the royal family should end once Queen Elizabeth dies, and more than 60 per cent believe the royals should have no role in Canadian society and culture. The monarchy in Canada is a lot more than just the occasional visit and some ceremonial relationships between princes and military units. It's also the governor general, the lieutenant governors and several properties that serve as official royal residences, such as Quebec City's Citadel and Ottawa's Rideau Hall. The rough estimate is that maintaining the monarchy in Canada exceeds $50 million annually, a considerable sum to spend on ceremonial frivolities in a country that still has trouble providing safe drinking water to rural communities. Complicated as disentangling Canada from the monarchy would be, that's also quite a lot of money to spend on unelected officials with the power to disrupt the normal functioning of Canadian democracy. Cuddly newborns and photogenic princesses aside, the monarchy is a symbol of the genocidal imperialism that all but annihilated the rightful heirs and stewards of this land. Canadians pumping money into the monarchy in 2020 makes about as much sense as Americans who defend the Confederacy: just because it's historic doesn't mean it's worth celebrating or spending money on. Moreover, far from encouraging a greater appreciation of our national history, our fascination with the celebrity circus that is the British monarchy occludes the reality that anti-monarchists, like William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, were trying to sever our ties with the Crown a full 30 years before Confederation. That an unfortunate number of Canadians can more easily identify latter-day, second-tier foreign royalty than explain what the Rebellions of 1837/1838 were about is demonstrative that the monarchy is a bit of a historical black hole.  It's time to move on and for precedents to be set. Meghan, Harry and Archie are welcome to immigrate to Canada. They just have to get in line like everyone else, and prove they won't be a financial liability.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/meghan-markle-hideout-this-b-c-property-believed-to-be-where-royals-are-1.5427722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-and-prime-minister-giddy-about-harry-and-meghan-s-possible-move-to-b-c-1.5425727 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-family-jobs-europe-harry-meghan-1.5427405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,N/A88,Jonathon Gatehouse,2020-01-22T13:03:43.107Z,"A 'second class' spy: Muslim CSIS agent alleges discrimination, abuse","Canada's spy agency is being sued for racial and religious discrimination by a longtime employee who alleges that his Muslim faith marked him as a target for harassment, emotional abuseÂ and even physical assaults.Â  The suit, filed in Federal Court in Ottawa last week by an intelligence analyst using the pseudonym Sameer Ebadi, claims a pattern of bullying and prejudice stretching back almost two decades that saw the man treated as a ""second class citizen"" within the ranks of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.Â  ""You know, it took me a long time to realize this, to see that, to begin with, anybody with [an] ethnic origin other than a Canadian-born oneÂ was a suspect.... Then you add faith and religion to that one, you're going one step down,"" Ebadi toldÂ CBC News in an exclusive interview, his voice choked with emotion. ""I don't think there is anybody in terms of the class of employees lower than the [a] practicing Muslim at the service.""Â  The statement of claim alleges that the analyst â€” who was recruited by CSIS at the beginning of the 2000s because of his Middle Eastern background and fluency in several languages â€” was subject to ""discrimination, bullying, physical assaults, religious persecutionÂ and the intentional infliction of emotional and physical harm"" by his fellow spies, including attacks while he prayed in the privacy of his office. And it contends that agency managers ""knowingly participated"" in the misconductÂ or ""stood idly by"" while it happened. As a result ofÂ what the suit called an ""irretrievably hostile""Â workplace, the analyst claims he suffered extreme stress, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage and left him with a host of psychological and medical ailments including severe anxiety, depression, hypertension and insomnia. He has been on sick leave since early 2018. The suit seeks a total of $750,000 in damages, and further compensation for past and future loss of income. It names five CSIS employees, all also under pseudonyms, and David Vigneault, the director and public face of the spy agency. None of theÂ allegations have been tested in court. In an emailed statement, John Townsend, head of media relations for CSIS, declined to discuss the specifics of the claim. But he said in a statement that the agency takes any allegation of inappropriate behaviour, including harassment and discrimination, very seriously. He said the spy service has been working hard since Vigneault took over the reins in mid-2017 to make improvements to its ""already robust"" internal accountability measures, including a new code of conduct, town halls and a ""respect campaign."" ""Our employees are always encouraged to report incidents of harassment, discriminationÂ or bullying without fear of reprisal, and all of our managers are required to act promptly on any issues brought to their attentionÂ and, if necessary, request a formal investigation,"" the statement said. ""We make every effort to ensure that all employees feel respected and valued."" Under Canada's Security of Information Act, revealing the identity of an intelligence operative is a criminal offence. CBCÂ News knows the analyst only by his alias, although his lawyer has vouched for his client's employment and position.Â  Ebadi said in his interviewÂ he was initially excited to work for CSIS and to be given the opportunity to use his knowledge and skills to help protect his adopted homeland. But in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the way he was viewed by his colleagues began to shift, and everyday interactions were tainted by hostility and fear. Eventually, he says the work culture became toxic, with his loyalties constantly under scrutiny from fellow employees and the bosses in his Western Canada office. Once while out driving with his then-infant child in the back seat, Ebadi noticed he was being closely followed by another vehicle. ""After a couple of intersections ... he is still coming. So I tried to evade. I increased my speed. I went to the highway. He did the same thing,"" EbadiÂ said. ""I wasn't sure if this person who is following me is an adversary, somebody who wants to harm me ... because we were told that you are at risk all the time."" Ebadi provided details of the high-speed chase to CSIS security officers, including the make and licence number of the other vehicle. But when there was no followup, he suspected he'd been tailed by members of his own teamÂ rather than a foe. Later, after his own car began to experience electrical problems, Ebadi says his mechanic found a mysterious GPS tracking device that had been hidden in the engine compartment and was draining the battery.Â  His lawsuit claims that ""other Muslim members of the service received the same treatment."" In response, the analyst rededicated himself to the job â€” working extra, unpaid hours and popping in on his days off to keep on top of his files. He hoped that his evident dedication would put all the suspicions to rest, but it had just the opposite effect. ""I learned later on that all those actions, they were actually raising more alarms at the service,"" he said, claiming his bosses were suspicious of why he would work all that extra time without compensation.Â  As the years went on, the indignities piled up, he said:Â intrusive questioning from his bosses about the state of his marriage, applications for promotion or transfer that were rejected out of hand, and a ""new"" office that turned out to be a converted, windowless supply closet next to the men's washroom.Â  ""People, they used to drop by and they congratulated me on my new position and I knew what they were talking about,"" Ebadi said.Â ""It was humiliating and it really took a toll on my soul."" And when he complained â€” to his immediate superiors in Western Canada and then up the chain to headquarters in Ottawa â€” things only got worse.Â  Ebadi's suit claims he was reprimanded and publicly humiliated by his bosses, then removed from active investigations and treated as an office pariah. ""The previous rumours and innuendos and backbiting went through the roof. I was isolated. Nobody was talking to me,"" EbadiÂ told CBC News.Â ""They passed by me as if I didn't exist."" As his spirits sank lower, the analyst sought comfort in his religion,Â a faith that he had long downplayed and kept hidden from his co-workers. He began to observe daily prayers in his tiny officeÂ â€” a practice that only served to heighten the workplace abuse.Â  ""It turned into an attraction, as if it's an amusement park or something that they have never seen,"" said Ebadi.Â Other employees would stop by to gawk, laughÂ or shout profanities, he said.Â And a type of ""game"" developed where his co-workers would abruptly throw open the door to the room as he lay prone on his prayer mat.Â Â  ""At times, suddenly somebody would open the door and pretend that they didn't know that I was there,"" he says. ""It would hit me. And it would disorient me."" The final straw came in early 2018, when the analyst returned from lunch to find his office door covered in spit.Â  ""I turned the door handle and I saw it is wet ... saliva was dripping from the face of the door all the way toÂ the door handle, and it was done [in] such an obvious and brazen manner,"" Ebadi recounted, his eyes welling with tears. ""When I saw that I thought this is not the place for me anymore ... I cannot do one more day here because I didn't feel safe.""Â  It's not the first time allegations of harassment and discrimination have been levelled against Canada's spy agency. In 2017, five intelligence officers and analysts filed a $35-million lawsuit alleging openly Islamophobic, racist and homophobic behaviour by their managers and co-workers. The complainants saidÂ they suffered reprisals and were ostracized when they tried to report or stand up to the bullying, and all of them eventually ended up on long-term sick leave.Â  That suit was settled for an undisclosed amount a few months later. And Vigneault, who had held a private meeting with the five spies to learn about their experiences first-hand, sent an open letter to all CSIS employees decrying the agency's ""categorically unacceptable"" culture of ""retribution, favouritism, bullying and other problems."" The director also vowed to take ""concrete steps"" to create a ""healthy and respectful"" workplace.Â  John Phillips, the Toronto lawyer who represented those five claimants and has now taken up Ebadi's case, says he is dismayedÂ but not surprised. ""I've watched organizations like this for 30 years of practice. You can see organizations try to fix things from the top, whether it's the RCMP or CSIS or other organizations, and what happens is that attempt to fix problems â€” to erase discrimination and try to equalize the work environment â€” are being undermined by the people in the middle, the central managers that aren't getting the message.... The lesson wasn't learned."" Ebadi says he holds CSIS responsible for the fact that he is no longer the confident, happy and active man he once was.Â  ""It is bothering me because they shattered my dreams. All the hope, all the good intentions, everything that I had,"" he said. ""That suffering hasn't stopped since I left work. It is with me and I think about it every day."" He said he hopes that those charged with sniffing out threats to the country's security willÂ turn their attention to the bad guys in their own midst. ""They need to do fundamental change,"" Ebadi said. ""They didn't just harm me by acting against the law, they harm Canadians. Because I believe I could still [make a] difference if they had allowed me to contribute.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-muslim-discrimination-lawsuit-1.5433654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-recruitment-retention-1.5245126 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/csis-right-wing-white-supremacy-1.5092304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/csis-toronto-spy-agency-employees-investigation-1.4206269 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/csis-spy-agency-harassment-lawsuit-settlement-1.4452118,N/A89,Anonymous,2020-01-20T14:00:00.442Z,Inquest into Cynthia Blackjack's death begins in Carmacks,"A coroner's inquest begins Monday into the 2013 death of Carmacks, Yukon, resident Cynthia Blackjack. The first two days of the inquest are scheduled to happenÂ in Carmacks at the local community centre. On Wednesday, it resumesÂ at the Kwanlin DÃ_n Cultural Centre in Whitehorse. If weather drops below -35 C, hearings in Carmacks may be rescheduled, according to a release. Ten days have been scheduled for the proceedings. Yukon Territorial Court Judge Peter Chisholm has been appointed coroner for the inquest. Six jurors have been selected from two pools of candidates: three from Whitehorse and three from Dawson City. Blackjack was 29 years old when she died during a medevac flight to WhitehorseÂ in November 2013. Yukon's former chief coroner refused requests from Blackjack's family and the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation for an inquest. The First Nation argued the coroner's original investigation was inadequate, andÂ did not address ""systemic racism""Â as a potential factor in Blackjack's death.Â  The Yukon Supreme Court agreed, and ordered an inquest. The coroner appealed, but theÂ earlier court decision was upheld. The Yukon CourtÂ of Appeal foundÂ that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of abdominal pain. The day before she died, BlackjackÂ was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital â€”Â a two-hour drive away â€”Â andÂ that she would have to find her own way there. The next day, Blackjack's conditionÂ worsened, but there was a delay in getting an ambulance to bring her back to the CarmacksÂ Health Centre and then another delay in getting her on aÂ medevac flight to Whitehorse.Â  The cause of her death was later determined to be liver failure. The Yukon appeal court ruled that the problems with the ambulance service alone justified holding an inquest. ""This is particularly apparent given her [Blackjack's] possible vulnerability as a First Nation citizen and the nature of the care she received in the period preceding her death, regardless of whether a causal link was established between those circumstances and the medical cause of her death,"" the 2018 appeal court judgment says.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-little-salmon-carmacks-first-nation-1.3996823,N/A90,Reneltta Arluk,2019-12-28T15:45:52.275Z,Shared Lines: Why one Inuvialuk woman decided to get facial tattoos,"My great-grandmother, Alice Simon, had facial tattoos.Â  In the pictures we have of her, there are visible markings all up her cheeks but what always struck me was the thick black line that connected her bottom lip to her chin. So when I began to imagine that thick black line on my face, from lip to chin, I had more questions than answers as to why I wanted it. I'm not fully Inuk. My mother is Denesuline and Cree from the Fort Chipewyan region. My father was Inuvialuit but he was also Dene with Gwich'in roots. The woman who gave me this tattoo is a well known tattooer, Maya Sialuk Jacobsen of Greenland. She is an Inuk that studies the historical markings of Inuit women across the circumpolar North.Â  She said, ""I don't study land, I study patterns."" Her tattoo methods are traditional stick and poke or skin stitching ink with needle and thread. When I first contacted her, I sent an image of my great-grandmother, and Maya knew exactly where Alice Simon was from.Â  My great-grandmother spoke very little English; she was a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker. I did not get to grow up with her unfortunately. She died when I was just a young one, but when I was born, she came down to Fort Smith, N.W.T., from Inuvik to meet me. I was five months old.Â  She took care of me one night while my parents went to the movies. It was winter. In what was then an Inuvialuit practice, my great-grandmother took me outside, bare, and put me in the snow. I am not sure how long I was out there for. I am sure I cried. But even now I know her doing that to me was an act of love.Â  Through this winter custom, I was given the gift of resilience â€”Â a teaching that remains with me still.Â  She lived during a time when survival was the only way. She was a respected elder, cherished for her knowledge of preserving berries in the winter using techniques that are no longer practised.Â  Today Inuvialuktun is spoken by only a handful of Inuvialuit â€”Â mostly my great-grandmother's relatives, and likely because of her.Â  Alice was a matriarch. She gave the younger generations their Inuit names when they were born. Mine is Akpik.Â  It is the cloudberry that grows in the barren land â€”Â not too sweet but makes the best jam. Often Inuit are named after relatives who have passed or people in the community that have lived good lives. It's a way to instil positive traits in the young ones.Â  So when I learned my Inuk name was Akpik, I was confused. Why a berry?Â  I have a wonderful great aunt, Lillian Elias. Alice was her grandmother. Lillian is the matriarch now, and also a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker.Â  In one of our visits I asked her why great-grandmother Alice named me after a berry and not a relative. Auntie Lillian thought for a moment and said, ""maybe because they were her favourite."" It was clear to me getting tattooed would be a journey of reconnection, not only to my great-grandmother, but to the community of Inuit women wearing their ancestors' lines in celebration of who we are. I asked myself, why get this now? Easy, because it is time.Â  So much of our cultural teachings have been lost or taken away by colonialism. We know this, but most importantly we still feel this. In recent years there has been a resurgence of facial tattoos among Inuit women across the circumpolar north.Â  I received my thick black line so recently that in reflection of writing this, I am still unsure of the teachings it will offer me. I am fine with it, though.Â  This was not done to resolve any doubts or insecurities.Â  It was done to keep asking myself the questions about who I am at a time when we areÂ needing to know who we are. We need to reconnect to our ancestral truths and I am grateful that my great-grandmother had the courage to wear hers at a time where many had started being denied theirs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-face-tattoo-reneltta-arluk-1.5397755,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,N/A91,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-19T20:15:55.738Z,Trudeau cabinet holding 3-day retreat to plot parliamentary strategy for minority government,"Liberal cabinet ministers began meetings inÂ Winnipeg today to set parliamentary priorities and strategize for what's expected to be a challenging winter session for the minority government. The three-day retreat will focus on themes laid out in the fall throne speech: growing the economy and the middle class, tackling climate change,Â and building healthy and safe communities, including new gun control measures and continued efforts to promote reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. One of the urgent orders of business is the federal response to the massive blizzard in Newfoundland and Labrador, where a state of emergency was declared in St. John's and several other municipalities. On Saturday,Â government ministers pledged whatever assistance the province requires, including military personnel, and today ministers confirmed that 300 or more troops plus equipment would be deployed. Governing without a majority means the government must get at least one of the opposition parties on board to pass legislation and the upcoming budget. On Sunday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau acknowledged there will be ""some differences"" in how the government drafts its economic plan. ""Importantly, we will have to, as we get to Parliament, make sure that we are talking with all of the other parties. That's been a priority we've had over previous years â€” I'm sure it will be more robust this year,"" he said. As the nation continues to grieve the loss of 57 Canadians killed in the Flight PS752 airline disaster in Iran, mounting tensions in the Middle East and other global affairs will also be high on the agenda. But domestic pressures are paramount, and the chosen location of the retreat is both symbolic and politically strategic. ""It is a city in the West where they should have done better in the last election and they have the potential to do better in the next election â€”Â that we know will be probably sooner rather than later,"" said Liberal commentator Greg MacEachern. ""Going to Manitoba makes more sense than going to Alberta. There's still a lot of active issues in Alberta, which might have obscured any messages the government wants to get out."" The Liberals were shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan in the Oct. 21 election, reflecting a strong dissatisfaction in the region over the federal carbon tax and slow progress on building a pipeline. While Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister may not be the Liberal government's biggest fan, MacEachern said, he has demonstrated a tendency to focus on areas of common interest rather than making partisan attacksÂ as other premiers, such as Alberta's Jason Kenney and Saskatchewan's Scott Moe, have done. In an attempt to heal the regional divisions, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Chrystia Freeland, one of his top-performing ministers, to take on the intergovernmental affairs file in his Nov. 20 cabinet shuffle. To further demonstrate the government's commitment to addressing regional discontent, Trudeau also named Freeland deputy prime minister and tasked her with working with all ministers to restore relations with the West. After his Liberals were reduced to a minority government, Trudeau promised to adopt a more collaborative approach in working with both the provincial premiers andÂ the federal opposition parties. The weeks and months ahead will test that resolve and the government's ability to navigate the new reality to pass legislation and a federal budget. ""This session for them will be where the rubber hits the road, where you have to look at things, very frankly, through a political lens,"" MacEachern said.Â  ""Who else is going to support this? You can have the best ideas in the world, but in a minority parliament, if it doesn't appeal to enough people in another party, they're going to go nowhere."" MacEachern said outside the work of the House of Commons, ministers must grapple with external issues: the raging bushfires in Australia, rising tensions with Iran and how to navigate Canada-U.S. relations in an election year, including ratifying a new trilateral trade dealÂ with the U.S. and Mexico. Daniel BÃ©land, a political science professor and director of the McGill Institute for the Study of Canada, believes getting ""NAFTA 2.0"" â€”Â also calledÂ CUSMA (the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade) past the finish line must be a top economic priority for the government. He said there's a danger in delay, because U.S. President Donald Trump could respond negatively if he becomes impatient. ""That's the most important issue by far in terms of our international footprint because our economic relationship with the U.S is so fundamental to our development, to our economic well-being,"" he said.Â  BÃ©land agrees that Trudeau and his ministers will need to adopt a more conciliatory approach to governing in order to pass that trade deal and other pieces of legislation, but said the Liberals likely have some breathing room before the next campaign. The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois and NDP don't have the desire or money to fight a snap election, and the Conservatives are in the throes of a leadership race to replace Andrew Scheer, he said. ""Right now I'm not sure who has the incentive to have an early election, who could pull the trigger,"" BÃ©land said. Conservative House Leader Candice Bergen expects the Liberals will capitalize on the fact her party is dealing with a leadership race, but warned that the opposition will work to hold the government to account on key files, including the new NAFTA. She said agricultural and other sectors negatively impacted by the deal must be properly compensated. Bergen said selecting Winnipeg as the venue for the cabinet retreat is likely meant to send a signal that the Liberals are listening and willing to address the issues driving western alienation. But to date, she said Trudeau has shown arrogance and a superficial acknowledgement of the region's pressing concerns. ""That will be a very important test that these Liberals are facing. And do they have the capacity to pass it? I don't know,"" she said. ""I don't know if they understand the challenges that western Canadians are going through and if some of their political ideology in terms of anti-pipeline sentiment in their caucus and cabinet, anti-development sentimentÂ in their caucus and cabinet, can overshadow the need for them to put the interests of all Canadians first."" NDP house leader Peter Julian said as the government prepares for its upcoming budget, New Democrats will be pressing for issues that will help Canadians, such as pharmacare and a $15 federal minimum wage and dental care for those who need it most. ""If all the Liberals want is to stay in power, they can keep counting on the Conservatives or the Bloc for support"" Julian said in a statement to CBC.Â  ""But, if they actually want to help people, they can work with us, and we can deliver what Canadians need to help with the problems they face every day."" Ministers are expected to hear from several guest speakers, including a panel on the state of the economy and the middle class with Canada's chief statistician Anil Arora and economists Armine Yalnizyan and Kevin Milligan. Talks on climate change will include implementing campaign commitments around electric buses, home retrofits and tree planting. Ministers will hold discussions with Andrew Leach, an energy and climate expert at the University of Alberta, and Katharine Hayhoe, a Canadian atmospheric expert at Texas Tech University. There will also be an update on the Trans Mountain pipeline, including engagement efforts with Indigenous peoples. Guest speakers on that issue are Ian Anderson, CEO of Trans Mountain Corporation, William Downe, chair of the board for Trans Mountain Corporation, and Linda Coady, who was named last fall to lead Indigenous engagement on equity for the project. Trudeau isÂ scheduled to meet with Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister and Winnipeg Mayor Bowman, and various ministers will sit down with stakeholder groups in the region. The agenda also includes discussions on health care and a panel of local representatives on regional development and economic competitiveness.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/minority-report-newsletter-7-cabinet-meeting-trudeau-agenda-1.5431386 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jim-carr-calgary-chamber-first-visit-1.5426455 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597,N/A92,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-20T21:45:32.750Z,Environment minister calls Maritime Iron's emissions projections 'concerning'  ,"The company pitching an iron processing facility in northern New Brunswick acknowledges in a major regulatory filing that carbon dioxide emissions will increase in the province if the plant goes ahead. Maritime Iron's 490-page registration for a provincial environmental impact assessment, posted online Monday, shows a potential increase of more than two million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over current levels. ""It is a little bit concerning that our emissions will rise when we're trying to be on the other side of that and reduce our emissions here in New Brunswick,"" said Environment Minister Jeff Carr. He said he would have to balance the potential economic boost in the Chaleur region with the likelihood the plant would cause the province to miss its emissions-reduction targets.Â  The EIA document says by linking the iron plant to NB Power's Belledune generating station, which would burn gas byproduct from the iron plant and reduce its coal consumption, the two facilities would emit a combined 4.9 million tons of greenhouse gases. That's almost double the 2.6 million tons that Belledune now emits alone, and more than the Irving Oil refinery, currently the province's largest emitter. But the document avoids that comparison. Instead, it says the 4.9 million tons of emissions would be less than the 6.5 million total if the Maritime Iron and Belledune plants operated separately.Â  However that scenario ignores the potential shutdown of Belledune in 2030, when NB Power must phase out coal-fired electricity generation. ""There's some pretty fancy math â€_ which is, 'based in a perfect world, if we were in charge of writing all the regulations, this might be okay,'"" said Lois Corbett of the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. ""But that's not exactly the situation that the climate faces right now. What this project will do is push New Brunswick greenhouse gas pollution way over its current cap."" The province's climate plan includes a target of getting emission to within 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.Â  The province is very close to that target now. ""I'd like to keep it that way,"" Carr said, conceding any major increase in emissions from a new industrial plant would put the goal in jeopardy. The Maritime Iron proposal was registered in the wake of 420 jobs being lost with the shutdown of the Glencore lead smelter in Belledune. If the project goes ahead, the company says it will create 1,300 direct jobs during construction and 200 permanent jobs during the plant's operations. In its EIA document, Maritime Iron says by supplying the Belledune plant with a gas byproduct as a fuel source, it can help NB Power cut coal consumption there by more than 50 per cent. That would mean Belledune ""can continue beyond 2029"" because reduced coal use will bring it in line with federal regulations, it says. But Carr said that would require what's called an equivalency agreement, in which Ottawa would agree to exempt the plant from the national coal-phaseout deadline in return for equal emissions reductions elsewhere in New Brunswick.Â  ""I don't think anyone who wants to build a billion-and-a-half-dollar facility should assume that there's going to be an equivalence agreement and there won't be a huge price on carbon by the time this project comes to fruition, ""Corbett said. ""They are writing a project proposal as if there were an agreement in place and that's not their decision. That's the federal government's decision.""Â  The $1.5 billion iron plant would also be subject to the federal carbon price on large industries, unless Ottawa accepts a proposal from New Brunswick's Progressive Conservative government for an alternative pricing system. NB Power CEO Gaetan Thomas said recently that the utility is working on an equivalency agreement.Â  If Belledune closed, Maritime Iron's emissions impact alone would be 3.8 million tonnes, still a net increase to the provincial total compared to today.Â  But it's not clear whether the company's business model is viable if it can't link to the NB Power plant and sell its gas byproduct to the utility.Â  In the EIA document, a legally required step to win provincial approval, Maritime Iron downplays its potential emissions of greenhouse gases in New Brunswick by urging officials to zoom out to a global perspective. Maritime Iron says its project should be considered ""within a global, national, and provincial context"" that allows it to argue it's climate-friendly. That includes an argument that its Finex technology, a new way of processing iron ore into pig iron, would reduce global emissions by 40 per cent â€” a figure irrelevant to New Brunswick's emissions target.Â  Maritime Iron also argues that by shipping Canadian pig iron to markets now using older processing technology, the company ""will be helping the world transition away from jurisdictions that use more energy intensive traditional technologies and that have higher GHG emitting electrical grids.""Â  It says Canadian iron ore from Quebec is now shipped 28,000 kilometres to China and Korea for processing. The shipping distance to Belledune would be only 425 kilometres, reducing emissions from freighters. At the same time, processed pig iron now shipped to a distribution hub in New Orleans travels 12,000 kilometres from Russia, whereas the trip from Belledune would be 4,500 kilometres. But Canada, and New Brunswick, can't earn any credit for those reductions from shipping emissions because there is no global agreement in place on how to measure and exchange such reductions.Â  ""We don't get a credit for that on the global scale,"" Carr said. International negotiators tried and failed to reach such a deal in the latest round of global climate negotiations in Madrid in November.Â  Carr said a technical committee will begin assessing the proposal. He said it's ""anybody's guess"" how long the process will take.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-eia-carbon-emissions-nb-power-belledune-1.5433510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/belledune-smelter-village-council-maritime-iron-plant-1.5364373 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/iron-processing-plant-carbon-tax-1.5379039 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-belledune-1.5372684,N/A93,Anonymous,2020-01-21T11:55:27.328Z,Harsh wind chill fizzles out today,"The late-January air will lose its sting as today goes along.

The revelations are just the latest in a parade of evidence pointing to the decade-long civil-war inside Boeing, pitting its famed ""safety culture"" against financial performance of the kind that pushes the stock price higher and provides big bonuses for senior executives. Longtime Boeing engineer Cynthia Cole, now retired, traces that conflict back to the company's amalgamation with rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997. ""McDonnell Douglas managers were more cutthroat, and it was all about the bottom line â€” cut those costs!"" she told CBC's The Fifth Estate. ""They didn't follow a good capitalist model. They followed greedÂ and putting people in the upper echelon, putting their interest first above the workers and the product and just society as a whole."" Watch The Fifth Estate's full documentary, How Boeing crashed: The inside story of the 737 Max, Sunday at 9 p.m./9:30 p.m. in NFLD on CBC TV and CBC Gem. The messages showed a concerted effort by employees, under pressure from their managers, to deceive safety regulators from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in an effort to save money and improve short-term financial performance. Internal messages from Boeing employees have described the 737 Max as an airplane ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" The messages were released by the company earlier this month as it copes with congressional criticism and the worldwide grounding of 737 Max planes. ""I don't know how to fix these things â€_ it's systemic,"" one employee wrote. ""It's culture. It's the fact that we have a senior leadership team that understands very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives."" All this came as Boeing faced greater competition from Airbus, which had designed a plane very similar to the 737 Max . Retired Boeing scientist Stan Sorscher agrees with engineer Cynthia Cole. ""In that business model, nobody says no. You're just going to follow the plan. That's the Walmart business model,"" he told The Fifth Estate. The compromise to safety intensified as deregulation became popular in Washington, D.C. The FAA budget was reduced, and much of the safety oversight was subcontracted to staff paid by Boeing. For longtime Boeing engineers and scientists, the conflict of interest was obvious. ""The downside is someone can threaten your position at work,"" said Cole. ""You play ball or else. The managers could tell you to keep your mouth shut or you lose your job."" Sorscher said it's not just salary at stake. ""It's your assignments. You get reassigned to another thing. You can be replaced by someone who is less capable of resisting pressure.""Â  In one striking email, Boeing's chief technical pilotÂ Mark Forkner bragged about ""Jedi mind-tricking regulators"" to convince them that no serious pilot training was required in the introduction of the 737 Max model.Â  That would save money for both Boeing and its airline customers. Boeing was so sure that pilot simulator-trainingÂ wouldn't be required that it had promised Southwest Airlines a rebate ofÂ $1 million US per airplane if it was. The desire to avoid pilot training also led Boeing to conceal from pilots the existence of a 737 Max flight-control system called MCAS, the manoeuvring characteristics augmentation system.Â  MCAS was designed to push the plane nose-down to avoid a stall in certain conditions. It has been blamed for the October 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in IndonesiaÂ that killed 189 people and the March 10, 2019, crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302Â in which 157 died, including 18 Canadians. The system was added to the plane to make it handle more like previous 737 models with smaller engines.Â  Boeing has been struggling to correct the MCAS system since the last crash, but problems reportedly kept appearing, including some beyond the original software flaws. WATCH |Â A Boeing 737 simulation shows how MCAS doomed the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610: In December, a leaked email showed that a Transport Canada official suggested simply removing the system from the plane. Pilots would then have to be trained to handle the aircraft without it. Two weeks ago, Boeing finally conceded that pilot simulator-training would be required to return the grounded 737 Max to service. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, is a lonely voice in Washington trying to pressure the U.S. government to rebuild the FAA and re-regulate Boeing, but he can't find a single Republican senator to co-sponsor his bill to do so. Boeing has spent millions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to politicians. ""Well, the system is broken right now,"" Blumenthal told The Fifth Estate, ""because the FAA has to be changed in its culture. It has to end outsourcing, end a system that, in effect, puts the fox in charge of the henhouseÂ and puts safety second, rather than first."" ""The system isn't broken,"" new FAA administrator Steven Dickson said when he appeared before the U.S. Congress in December. He insists the FAA is committed to safety and will be fully satisfied before allowing the 737 Max back into the air. WATCH |Â Cynthia Cole and Stan Sorscher describe how Boeing operated internally: At the climax of the hearing, however, he had trouble explaining what was done about an internal FAA study showing that there would be over 15 crashes of 737 Max aircraft with 2,920 likely fatalities if the MCAS system was not fixed. That study was completed over three months before the Ethiopian airliner crashed. In his appearances before Congress, then-Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg couldn't explain other internal documents that showed the company was aware long before either crash of the flaws in the MCAS system that lead to the tragedies. One engineering study showed that pilots would have only four seconds to recognize a problem with the flight-control system, and only 10 seconds to respond to it, otherwise there would be a ""catastrophic"" crash. It turns out the Indonesian pilots didn't even know the MCAS system was on the aircraft, and so would be unlikely to recognize a problem with it. Though the FAA issued a warning about the flight control problem that could cause ""impact with terrain,"" the Ethiopian Flight 302 pilots took 35 seconds to recognize the problem and try to correct it. By that time, the plane was in a fatal dive. All the internal warnings made it that much more astonishing that Muilenburg spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump after the second crash and assured him any production pause would be temporary. The fleet was only grounded in the United States three days later, after authorities in China, Europe and Canada had already taken action. Muilenburg has now been fired, walking away with a $62-million US ($81-million Cdn) settlement. The company will likely face severe fines. And there is a U.S. Justice Department investigation of Boeing's relationship with the FAA, but few expect any corporate executives to go to jail. ""I think that all these people in these upper echelons are too related and too intertwined,"" said Cole. ""I don't think they're going to find anything against one of their own. You know, people have died. They've got families, they've got lives that they didn't get to live, and for Boeing to pay a fine or to pay millions or whatever that is, where's the justice?""

In a letter obtained by CBC News, Doug Schweitzer calls for federal Justice Minister David Lametti to amend the Criminal Code so that certain elements of crimes committed in rural areas could be considered aggravating factors in sentencing. One such factor would be if the perpetrator selected a remote location to commit the crime ""in recognition of the victim's enhanced vulnerability,"" the letter said. Other aggravating factors would include being armed with a weapon, or refusing to leave the scene of a break and enter or theft when confronted by the property owner. ""We are standing up for Albertans by acting on concerns to deter crime, reinforce the rights of law-abiding property owners, and giving victims a stronger voice in the justice system,"" Schweitzer wrote in the letter, dated Dec. 5. The issue of rural crime will be discussed when justice ministers meet in Victoria on Wednesday. Schweitzer's request is the latest move in the province's strategy to tackle what he describes as ""skyrocketing crime rates"" in many of Alberta's rural communities. The province is hiring hundreds more RCMP officers, expanding the drug court treatment program and granting additional powers to sheriffs and wildlife officers. Those measures were introduced after Schweitzer spent two months hearing from rural Albertans at more than 20 town halls throughout the province. In his letter to Lametti, Schweitzer called for amendments to the Criminal Code's principles of sentencing to specifically address crimes committed in rural areas of Alberta and other parts of Canada. Current aggravating factors outlined underÂ Section 718 of the Criminal Code include offences against children, peace officers and more specific circumstances such as crimes motivated by hate. ""We want to make sure we send a clear signal to criminals that rural Albertans are not to be targeted, and with that comes harsher penalties, harsher sentences,"" Schweitzer said in an interview. ""Right now, too many people just see the criminal justice system as not being effectively a deterrent."" Jordan Stuffco, head of the Alberta Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association, questions that argument. ""Harsh deterrent punishment over 30 to 40 years of social science research,Â the results are the same, it doesn't work,"" said Stuffco, who practises law in rural locations. He said the changes would create more backlogs in the justice system. ""Longer sentences mean more jail time, which means more people that will be desperately doing whatever they can to fight their case,"" Stuffco said. In his letter to Lametti, Schweitzer also advocatesÂ for changes to the Criminal Code to address standards a review board considers when reducing conditions for people found not criminally responsible for their crimes. Schweitzer said review boards are required to impose the least restrictive conditions, which runs counter to the protection of public safety. He said families of the victims should play a greater role in the process. ""Public safety should be far more front of mind when review boards are making decisions,"" Schweitzer told CBC. ""We are fighting right now to make sure that we listen to the public, and to make sure that public safety is paramount in that process."" Gregg Perras, the father of Kaiti Perras,Â one of five young people killed by Matthew De Grood in Calgary in 2014, applauded Schweitzer's move.Â  In October, a review board ruled De Grood could leave Alberta Hospital for unsupervised outings and spend up to three days in Edmonton with added supervision. De Grood's psychiatrist said his risk of reoffending is low, but if he did commit another offence it would be severe. Perras fears De Grood is on track to an absolute discharge, which means he would not be monitored to ensure he stays on his medication. ""Our line in the sand is to have the Criminal Code revised such that there would be no absolute discharges for someone who's mentally ill who has murdered,"" Perras said. ""IÂ don't think anyone in our society wants to hear that MattÂ De GroodÂ has massacred five or 10 more people because his medication has failed."" In a statement, Lametti's press secretary Rachel Rappaport said the justice minister metÂ with Schweitzer a few days after the letter was sent. ""Minister Lametti emphasized a desire to work together toÂ ensureÂ that our criminal justice is effective at meeting the needs of Albertans and Canadians across the country,"" Rappaport said. ""It is important that any changes made to our criminal justice system are evidence-based, in accordance with the charter, and carried out in a manner that will stand the test of time.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/schweitzer-criminal-code-rural-crime-1.5434068,[],N/A96,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:52:19.424Z,N/A,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved,[],N/A97,Julia Page,2020-01-22T10:30:00.827Z,"Sherbrooke nurse suspended for complaining about working conditions in private online chat group, says union","The union that representsÂ health care workers in the Eastern Townships says employees who don't respect ""aÂ code of silence"" within the workplace risk facingÂ disciplinary measures. The regional health agency, the CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUS, suspended a nurse after she complained about working conditions onÂ aÂ Facebook Messenger group chat with co-workers, according to theÂ Syndicat des professionnels en soin des Cantons de l'Est. President Sophie SÃ©guin said the local health board shouldÂ listen to employees' concerns instead of punishing themÂ for speaking out. SÃ©guin said the nurse, who asked the union to preserve her anonymity, created a chat group with some colleagues last December and reported ""well-known issues"" within the health network. One of her co-workersÂ likely shared the content of those messages with administrators, said SÃ©guin. The nurse was then suspended for one month. During the same period, another nurse,Â Jean-SÃ©bastien Blais, was also suspended for three weeks after he published a public message on Facebook describing a lack of resources for mental health services in the region. The union has filed grievances inÂ both cases. ""What we want to denounce is the OmertÃ "" within the region's public health board, said SÃ©guin.Â  She said employees feel the need to speak out publicly because managementÂ ""doesn't move fast enough to solve the problems""Â that exist in certain sectors, she said. ""There is no OmertÃ Â within our establishment,"" a spokesperson for theÂ CIUSSS de l'Estrie-CHUSÂ responded.

However, in an emailed statement to CBC News, Lemay saidÂ ""staff members entirely have the right to express themselves on social media regarding their working conditions and work environment, without exposing themselves to the risk of disciplinary measures."" If ""disciplinary measures are taken,Â it is because the comments made do not respect the rules and regulations that apply in our establishment,"" she said â€” for example, the health agency's policy on harassment and itsÂ rules on social media usage. The office of Health Minister Danielle McCannÂ said personnelÂ issues are confidentialÂ but said the minister spoke withÂ CIUSSSÂ officials aboutÂ these kinds of situations and called any ""code of silence""Â ""unacceptable."" SÃ©guin said the union fears this kind of precedent will lead toÂ workers not comingÂ forward when problems surface.

The union will be holding a meeting with management at the end of January to address some of these issues.

""If the workflow doesn't allow nurses to provide adequate care, they should turn to their internal nursing committees to share their opinions,"" said the order's president, Luc Mathieu. Sophie Brochu,Â a Montreal lawyer who specializes in labour relations, said this kind of situation is happening more and more often in the workplace, because people ""assume Facebook isÂ not in the public domainÂ and is their own space to communicate with their friends and family."" But whether the comments are made publicly or within a private platform, she said employees should know ""there is no such thing as privacy on Facebook."" For health care workers, balancing their obligations to their employer and respecting their own code of ethics ""can come into conflict."" ""They are in a very tight spot,"" BrochuÂ said.

Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are trying to make this a reality. ""We have an increasing population on one hand â€_ and because of climate change we are experiencing environmental instability,"" said Nazanin Charchi, a PhDÂ student in chemical engineering at the U of S. ""So it's important to develop a stable, sustainable and more importantly a predictable food supply."" Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron on the U of S campus to develop a method to remove the chemical ethylene from the air, to help make a greenhouse viable in harsh environments like Canada's north. ""Basically when the plants grow they produce ethylene,"" said U of S professorÂ Jafar Soltan, who has worked for years in the area of treating polluted air and is overseeing Charchi's work. Soltan said ethylene works like a growth hormone. ""For adults growth hormones are good, but we don't want to give hormones to a six-year-old because they hit puberty sooner than they are supposed to. The same with plants."" In warm climates, excessive ethylene can easily be removed by opening the windows. That's not an option in colder, harsher areas. If you couldÂ somehow remove the excess ethylene without opening a window during cold winters, self-contained greenhouses become more cost efficient and sustainable. And that's where Charchi's research comes in. Charchi is using the Canadian Light Source synchrotron to develop a method, or catalyst,Â to remove ethylene from greenhouses without needing outside air. ""The biggest impact of this research is on reducing energy consumption in those self-contained greenhouses,"" Soltan said.Â ""The technology that we have removes ethylene in the air inside the greenhouse so you do not need to bring in a lot of air from outside."" That offers the tantalizing prospect of making these self-contained very energy efficient. On top of that, Charchi said being able to remove the excess ethylene means greater longevity for fruits and vegetables that goes bad faster because of ethylene. ""This technology could make greenhouses more environmentally sustainable and less expensive to run. As a result, we could have more food grown in greenhouses in cold regions like Canada and more food security for our families,"" Soltan said. Charchi said they have been successful in being able to use a catalyst to remove ethylene in the lab. She said the next step is to partner with the air conditioning and Hvac industry to develop a commercial application for aÂ  new generation ofÂ greenhouses.Â  Soltan said he foresees the technology being in the form of a small box, similar to a fresh air exchanger, that would be added to the air circulation system. ""It would just continuously get rid of the ethylene and reduce the need to bring in outside air,"" he said. The technology could be adapted to homes and other commercial buildings to reduce energy consumption in those places. When the air is circulating inside a building the technology would get rid of the solvents and smelly chemicals without having to bring in a lot of cold air. SoltanÂ can even see the technology being used in space. ""If you want to grow something in space or travel to Mars or something you want to have a suitable environment for these plants to grow,"" he said. ""We are taking out these hormones that are produced by mature plants and can harm the baby plants. If you remove the hormone you can have a healthy environment for plants to grow, that can be a new way for specially conditioned greenhouses.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-greenhouses-far-north-1.5433905,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-research-indoor-air-quality-1.5427912,N/A99,Anonymous,2020-01-20T14:00:00.220Z,"'It's not inevitable': Urbanization contributing to disenfranchisement of rural residents, says U of S prof","Creeping urbanization throughout Canada could lead to the creation of city-states that ignore rural issues within a decadeÂ if current trends keep up, according to one Saskatchewan academic. Urbanization and rural depopulationÂ is happening in countries like Vietnam, Nigeria or Pakistan, saidÂ University of Saskatchewan professor Ken Coates to CBC Radio'sÂ Saskatchewan Weekend. ""Rural Canada is in trouble. Many small towns are seeing the population, industries moving out,"" Coates, Canada Research Chair in Regional Innovation, said. ""We're gettingÂ mobile work forces, so people are flying in and flying out, rather than living in the northern communities, for example."" Coates said city-states diminish rural populations, the diversity of the human condition and the places to live where people can live the lifestyle they choose, because not everyone wants to live in a big city. He will be speaking at the Saskatoon Club on Monday eveningÂ with the presentation Do the 'People Who Don't Matter'Â have a Future: Prospects and Possibilities for Rural and Small-Town Peoples. Nearly half of Saskatchewan's population alone can be found in either Saskatoon or Regina, the city's two largest population centres. As small towns dwindle in population and industry, there is also a societal loss, such as history and culture from those small towns, the professor added. Coates said Canadians, including those in Saskatchewan, do not seem to be pushing against that trend like they have in other places such as Scandinavia. Innovation is needed to prevent city-states and one of the first avenues for that could be the government reviewing its policies, he said. Coates used the example of Norway where a certain quality of service is expected and guaranteed, such as the electricity grid or a reliable internet connection, regardless of where someone lives in the country. ""You don't get the disparity of circumstance that we have and take for granted in Canada,"" he said.Â  ""I've been in small towns where people say 'oh yeah, we aren't able to keep nurses and doctors.'Â  ""They sort of just accept it as as a natural way of things.

Speaking to reporters before a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, Lametti said more than 150,000 people have already participated in the government'sÂ onlineÂ survey. Roundtables have been held in cities across the country, and there will also be outreach in the territories. ""There's a diversity of opinion, but a lot of interesting and specific and concrete suggestions in terms of meeting the criterion of the Quebec Superior Court,"" he said. In September, a Quebec judge declared parts of the federal and provincial laws on assisted dying unconstitutional,Â and gave the federal government six months to pass new legislation. Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin said one portion of the federal law â€” requiring that a patient must face a ""reasonably foreseeable"" death before seeking medical assistance in dyingÂ â€” violated Canadians' charterÂ rights.Â  LamettiÂ left the door open to seeking an extension on passing the legislation. ""My goal is to get a draft bill in front of the House of Commons during the month of February, and then we'll see.

""We haven't ruled out the possibility of asking for an extension, but for the time being my priority is getting that bill in front of the House."" Lametti said the calendar for drafting the legislation was challenged by the federal election, the time to appoint cabinet and the holiday season, but he will do his best to succeed in meeting the mid-March deadline imposed by the court. Given theÂ time crunch, Canadians were given just two weeks to take part in the online survey One of the survey questions asks whether it should be mandatory for a patient to receive a third medical consultation with an expert before receiving permission to obtain a medically assisted death. The survey also asks whether the federal government should change the length of the current 10-day ""reflection period"" between requesting and receiving a medically assisted death. The government is also considering input on whether the updated law should allow advanceÂ requests, access for so-called ""mature minors"" who doctors consider capable of making their own decisions on medical care, and whether psychiatric conditions should be grounds for assisted death. The government commissioned three independent reports on those issues, which were submitted to the government more than a year ago by the Council of Canadian Academies, a group that pulls together experts to consider public policy.

""The situation at RHC in the summer of 2019 was one effectively created by the employer over a lengthy period of time,""Â Elizabeth MacPherson, vice-chair of the labour board,Â stated in aÂ 13-page decisionÂ issued Tuesday.Â  The bonus was meant to address challenges at the facility in northern New Brunswick that has come under scrutiny.Â The hospital was the subject of a provincialÂ ombud report last year that found 'significant mistreatment' and inadequate care of patients linked toÂ chronic understaffing. Days after the report was released in February 2019, Martin Michaud died by suicide at the hospital.Â VitalitÃ© Health Network's internal investigation into theÂ death of the 38-year-oldÂ resulted in a recommendation to continue recruiting staff at the psychiatric hospitalÂ so it can ensure an adequate ratio of personnel.Â  The employer, theÂ VitalitÃ© health authority and provincial Treasury Board,Â argued the bonus was necessary to quickly deal with the staff shortages after failing to agree with the union on a way to retain and attract staff.Â  The New Brunswick Nurses Union filed a complaint with the labour board, arguing the move was made unilaterally duringÂ contract talks in violation ofÂ the Public Service Labour Relations Act.Â  A hearing was held over several days last year. In December,Â MacPherson ordered the employerÂ to halt violations of the law and resume collective bargainingÂ with the union.Â MacPhersonÂ issued a written decision Tuesday. Paula Doucet, president of the union, said the decision speaks for itself.Â  ""The employer was in breach of the law,"" Doucet said.Â  MacPhersonÂ found the bonus violated a section of the law that forces the employer to ""freeze"" the terms of the collective agreementÂ once a notice of bargaining is issued. TheÂ notice wasÂ issued in October 2018. The union argued that the move changed employee compensation, violating the freeze. The union had sought a province-wide recruitment and retention initiative. The employer argued it tried to reach an agreement with the union on attracting and retaining employees over the summer of 2019. WhenÂ no agreement was reached, itÂ went ahead with the bonus usingÂ an exception to the freezeÂ for critical situations. But staff shortages were aÂ continuing issue rather than one that requiredÂ exceptional actions, the decision states.Â  ""To a large extent, the circumstances were due to a lack of planning that was fully within the employer's control,""Â MacPhersonÂ wrote. MacPhersonÂ wrote that the employer had a duty to bargain in good faith, which included exploring all options available to address the issue. But,Â MacPhersonÂ said there was no evidenceÂ the employer ever asked the union for its proposal on province-wide recruitment and retention initiatives. MacPhersonÂ wrote that a party can'tÂ adopt a ""rigid, intransigent position and then claim that the other party's failure to agree to it constitutes an emergency."" CBC News requested interviews withÂ VitalitÃ©Â and the provincial government about the board's decision. Neither provided one.Â  ""We are complying with the arbitrators' decision and are assessing our options,"" Bruce Macfarlane, a spokesperson for the health department, said in a statement. VitalitÃ©Â has maintained that the hospitalÂ is safe for patients. Witnesses for the employer testified during the labour board hearingÂ they were concerned staff shortages over the summerÂ could cause security risks for staff and patients GisÃ¨le Beaulieu,Â VitalitÃ©'s vice-president of performance, quality and corporate services, testified that without nurses at the facility, it becomes effectively a lodging house or jail and there's no ability to provide treatment or care. About 60 per cent of the facility's patients have been sent there by court-orderÂ for mental health assessments, the decision states.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/labour-board-nurses-restigouche-hospital-1.5434448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nurses-bonus-restigouche-union-vitalite-labour-complaint-1.5314695 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/restigouche-staffing-ratios-1.5018422 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/charles-murray-restigouche-hospital-1.5009426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/restigouche-hospital-rti-appeal-1.5430541,N/A107,Ã‰ric Grenier,2020-01-21T09:00:00.484Z,Not all lanes will lead Conservative leadership candidates to the finish line,"The Conservative Party leadership race is starting to take shape, but there are only so many paths to victory each candidate can take â€” and limited space inÂ each of them. Some candidates have a better path forward than others. To date, no one has yet met the bar to be classified as a ""verified"" candidate by the Conservative Party. Among those who have publicly declared their intention to run, only former cabinet minister Peter MacKay and Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu haveÂ a good shot of meeting the party's stringentÂ qualification requirements. Ontario MPs Pierre Poilievre and Erin O'Toole are expected to enter the race soon, while the decision of former Quebec premier Jean CharestÂ is reportedly imminent. Other candidates could come forward between now and the Feb. 27 deadline for entry ahead of the June 27 vote. Each of them will be looking to identify a lane that takes them to the leadership, cobbling together like-minded regional and ideological groupings within the party's membership that are large enough to elect a leader. These lanes are not always well-defined â€” and some candidates can blow them apart. Maxime Bernier, the runner-up in the 2017 leadership race, did not have particularly regionalized support. Holding a libertarian worldview, Bernier also defied the old split between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform, theÂ two legacy parties. But Andrew Scheer's lane was to draw supportÂ from the rural parts of the country and a mix of members from across the spectrum, pulling both from moderates like O'Toole and Michael Chong and social conservatives like Brad Trost and Pierre Lemieux. Scheer was able to attract support from both of the old wings of the party in part because Bernier was an unconventional candidate. The contours of the current roster of likely candidates, however, looks less unusual. The candidate with the steepest hill to climb is likely to be Gladu, who lacksÂ what could be a decisive factor in such a short race: a high profile. The two-term Sarniaâ€“Lambton MP may be able to build support from ridings in southwestern Ontario, but will have some work ahead of her to break through. The second-choice backing of her supporters, however, could prove a hot commodity by voting day. But how about the others? What are their most promising paths to victory? MacKay's path to the leadership looks the most obvious. He has a few things working in his favour. He has the aura of electability, with polls showing he is more likely than some other candidates to stack up well against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. His standing as the last leader of the defunct Progressive Conservatives makes him the natural heir to the support of more moderate, centrist members. His dutiful years of service in Stephen Harper's cabinet might also make him acceptable to the Harper wingÂ of the party. MacKay will likely have a strong and unopposed regional base in Atlantic Canada. Though there are only 32 seats in the region â€” all seats across the country will be weighted equally in the Conservative voting systemÂ â€” running up the numbers in this one smaller region could pay more dividends than narrowly leading a crowded field in bigger regions. He is already showing some support in other parts of the country, with endorsements from B.C. MP Ed Fast and Alberta MP Blaine Calkins. MacKayÂ has the potential for growth as candidates are eliminated from the ranked ballot, particularly candidates like Gladu, O'Toole and possibly Charest, if MacKay's lack of fluency in French is not seen as too big of an obstacle. He already seems to beÂ fishing in O'Toole's pond â€” both Fast and Calkins endorsed O'Toole in 2017. The clearest path to 50 per cent is to be seen as the Harper candidate â€” the person who most closely embodies the continuation of the Harper model, both in governing style and in party management. This person has a strong base in Western Canada and among the oldÂ Reformers, but is also acceptable to Conservatives in places like the Greater Toronto Area. Poilievre has the best shot at that title â€” and that makes him a potentially formidable candidate. The Ottawa-area MP has a ready-made base in eastern Ontario. His bilingualism will giveÂ him a fair chanceÂ in Quebec.Â Born and raised in Alberta, he also has the best claim to being the Western candidate. His team includes Jenni Byrne, Harper's former campaign manager, signalling a tacit (if not necessarily exclusive) endorsement from that camp. He has potential for down-ballot growth from O'Toole, whose supporters swung to Scheer over Bernier in 2017. If Charest enters the race, Poilievre could also peel votes away from him among members who believe the next leader needs to be bilingual. But there are still some open questions when it comes to Poilievre. Having played the role of partisan attack dog for his party, members may not see Poilievre as electable in a general election. His recent statements in support of both same-sex marriage and abortion rights could exclude him from getting the social conservative support that was a key component ofÂ Scheer's victory. And the entry of another Western Canadian into the race could scupper Poilievre's hopes of support in that part of the country. The need for one candidate to take the Harper lane is bothÂ Poilievre'sÂ best chance and greatest vulnerability, as being pushed out of that lane would cost him his spot as a front-runner. It is not immediately obvious which lane is Charest's. His standing as a former PC leader (from 1993 to 1998) is shared withÂ MacKay, who helped create the modern Conservative Party but doesn't carryÂ the political taint (in party circles) of also having been leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, as Charest was from 1998 to 2012. He could claim electability thanks to his profile across the country, flawless bilingualism and experience running (and winning) election campaigns.Â  But his regional base is likely to be restricted, even in his home province. The areas of Quebec that backed the right-leaning ADQÂ andÂ CAQÂ during the Charest years are unlikely to warmly welcome their former opponent. Charest also faces the prospect of an ""anybody but Charest"" campaign, which could severely limit his growth potential. While O'Toole has a path to the leadership,Â itÂ could be occupied by other candidates. His best results in the last leadership race came in the Maritimes, a region that is more likely to back MacKay. Representing a riding in the Greater Toronto Area is an advantage â€” there are more seats there than in B.C., Alberta or Atlantic Canada â€” but that is likely to be a hotly contested part of the country. O'Toole did not show great strength in the GTA in 2017, placing first in only five ridings on the last ballot before he was eliminated. His relatively lower profile and lack of fluency in French chips away at his perceived electability. But he does have the potential to be a consensus candidate â€” one that is acceptable to the broadest swathÂ of the Conservative membership, like Scheer in 2017. The problem for O'Toole, however, is that being everyone's second choice only matters if enough voters list you as their first. He might be able to pull significant support from Gladu, MacKay or Charest, but only if he finishes ahead of them. Much will depend on the final roster of candidates and how the race unfolds. It is early days. But the initial signals suggest MacKay and Poilievre have the most plausible paths to winning the leadershipÂ before anyone has taken their first steps.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-next-conservative-leadership-1.5400959 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A108,Anonymous,2020-01-21T00:40:52.742Z,Animator from Calgary opens up about her role on Frozen 2,"For those with children or for the Disney enthusiasts, you may know that the company's popular animated film Frozen came out with a sequel in November.Â  But what you may not know is that some of the scenes in the movie were created by a Calgarian. Jackie Koehler joined theÂ Calgary EyeopenerÂ on Monday to share how she got involved with the film and what her role was. For her, she said, the journey technically started when she was about 13 years old, when she developed an interest in animation. ""I just kind of pursued it ever since.â€_ Every year, you kind of get a little bit better, a little bit more knowledgeable"" Koehler said. ""Next thing you know, you're working at Disney."" She's since worked on big films including Ralph Breaks the Internet and The Book of Life. When it comes to Frozen 2, her job was to work on the very nitty-gritty details of how the characters move. Each movement is crafted ""from scratch,"" she explained. The animators review the script as voiced by the actors. They also take into consideration what the directors say they want out of each scene. ""Then we kind of take it from there,"" she said. That involves deciding how a character might cross a room, for example, or how they might pick up a glass, or the sorts of facial expressions they might have during various segments of dialogue. She was one of about 80 animators working on the film. When Elsaâ€™s powers are overtaken by another force, Jackie Koehler, who animated the scene, collaborated with our Effects Designer, Dan Lund, to choreograph Elsaâ€™s surprise. To support the story point, we changed the speed, color and direction of her magic as it is taken over. <a href=""https://t.co/RJwn7Jb0aJ"">pic.twitter.com/RJwn7Jb0aJ</a> Koehler said she could spend about two weeks for each four seconds or so of animation. ""Each shot is very personal,"" she said, adding the shot she worked on for the lullaby sequence at the beginning of the film took months. ""It's very labour intensive."" ""(The shots) kind of become your babies â€_ but then you watch it in the movie and it goes by in a blink of an eye."" While the process is similar to older methods of working on an animated film, goingÂ frame by frame, as technology advances, it's a little bit easier. ""The computer allows us to do more iterations so we're able to sort of explore a little bit more what different acting choices might look like on screen,"" she said. There's also a dedicated room for animators to act out a scene and film themselves so they can transpose those movements to the character. ""We'll use that as a basis to ground our characters to make sure that they look and feel like they're living in a real world,"" she said. There's also are multiple other departments in other very specialized roles, like lighting, who will work on the same scenes, she said. ""It looks and feels like magic but it's really a lot of hard work and dedication to our craft,"" Koehler said.Â  Next up for the animator is Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon.

And he's not the only one facing thousands of dollars in repair bills for vehicles under recall. In June, Rick Lingard's 2011 Hyundai Tucson's engine seized and died while he was driving down a major highway near Cranbrook, B.C. ""They showed me the engine after they took it out and there was a hole in it. It was destroyed,"" said Lingard, who lives in Nelson.Â  He paid more than $7,000 to replace it,Â opting for a used engine with 40,000 kilometresÂ on it, through an independent mechanic, after a Hyundai dealership quoted him more than $10,000 for a new one. A few weeks later, it happened again. ""The same kind of high-pitched rattle-y sound â€_ and then all the lights came on again and â€” boom! I was in disbelief,"" heÂ told Go Public. Then, another twist: Just three days after the second catastrophic engine failure, Lingard got a recall notice describing the same problem. The recall was issued in February, but the notice didn't arrive in the mail until August. Lingard says no one at two Hyundai dealerships he'd contacted about his engine breakdowns mentioned anything about a recall. ""To me, it's just irresponsible to the core,"" he said. Transport Canada could easily fix the problem, according to one automotive consumer advocate, by forcing Hyundai to cover Lingard's costs. But the federal agency, says George Iny of the Automotive Protection Association, tends not to use the full extent of its powers.Â  The agency also has the power to force recalls â€”Â under changes made last year toÂ the Motor Vehicle Safety Act â€”Â but has never used it.Â  ""Transport Canada is a bit like an out-of-shape person who just got a gold-plated membership to the gym. That doesn't automatically put you in shape,"" saidÂ Iny. ""Transport Canada needs to act more assertively."" After getting the recall notice, Lingard submitted his receipts to Hyundai Canada. It rejected the claim, saying his first engine failure was due to ""insufficient engine maintenance, not the recall"" because Lingard didn't do sufficiently frequent oil changes prior toÂ 100,000 kilometres of driving, and didn't provideÂ receipts for subsequent changes.Â  The company says he changed his oil every 20,000 kilometresÂ instead of every 12,000 as required by the manual. After the warranty expired, Lingard says he stopped going to the dealership for oil changes.Â  Iny says using oil changes as a reason to deny claims is common but puzzling.Â  ""The fact that you didn't keep records of oil changes doesn't make you negligent. That's just an invention,"" Iny said.Â ""It's not a valid reason for refusing coverage.""Â  He says both KiaÂ and its part-owner Hyundai have admitted,Â in some cases, that such engine failures stem from metallic debris left inside during the manufacturing process.Â  In those cases, ""whether you did oil changes or not,""Â Iny said, ""the debris was already there."" Lingard's recall notice doesn't mention debris.Â  Hyundai Canada also denies responsibility for Lingard's second blown engine because, according to a spokesperson,Â the engine was not ""provided, installed or inspected by a Hyundai dealer."" When Go Public asked why his recall notice took months to arrive, and why no one at the company told Lingard about the recall, it didn't respond.Â  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they, too, are being left out of the recall. Scott Wild and his wife Donna Stewart, of Cambridge, Ont., experienced the same dangerous breakdown as Lingard, when the engine of theirÂ 2013 Kia Sportage suddenly failed at high speeds on June 4. Their mechanic also found a hole had been blown in the side of the engine and it needed to be replaced. ""I said, 'You can't be serious â€_ this vehicle has 140,000 kilometresÂ on it and it's finally paid off,'"" Wild said. That's when the couple discovered there's a recall on the 2013 Kia Sportage, but their specific vehicle isn't covered. Kia told them their vehicle identification number was not listed under the recall.Â  ""It was really weird, "" said Wild. ""What happened to our vehicle is exactly the same as what happens to all the vehicles that are on the list."" Kia Canada told Go Public that the couple's vehicle had an MPIÂ (""multi-point injection"") engine â€” and only those with GDIÂ (""gasoline direct injection"") engines are part of the recalls.Â  What's the difference? When Go Public asked, the company didn't answer. But independent mechanic Chris Solodko, in Hamilton,Â told Go Public he's repaired dozens of both types and, in his opinion, their engine problemsÂ are almost identical. ""They all have the same noise, the same problem. One [type of engine] is running on a high pressure and the other one is running on a low pressure,"" he said.Â  Transport Canada told Go Public it hasÂ received 65 complaints of engine failures not covered by the Kia and Hyundai recalls since March and says it is investigatingÂ whether more vehicles should be added. Iny says they have to move faster. ""There is a pattern here. What we need of the carmakers is an open mind that the complaints that fall outside of the group are not just turned down but that they are looked into,"" he said. Wild and Stewart ended up selling their vehicle for parts, then joined one of at least four Canadian, engine-related class-action lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai.Â The lawsuits have not yet been certifiedÂ by the courts.Â  Both Hyundai and Kia have been dogged with engine failure and fire complaints and lawsuits in Canada and the U.S. Hyundai and Kia have recalled almost 500,000 vehicles in Canada for engine-related defects since 2015, due to manufacturing debris that could cause the engines to fail. The problem can also cause fires. Millions of other vehicles have been recalled in the U.S.Â and, in October, the companies agreed to set asideÂ $758 million USÂ to settle related class-actions in the U.S. and South Korea, pending approval by the courts. Iny is hopeful a U.S.Â settlement mightÂ mean one is coming for drivers in Canada, but it could be a while before that happens â€” if at all. ""We would want total parity,"" he said. In the meantime, Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a safety-related problem with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Wild and Stewart have filed complaints with Transport Canada. They are waiting to see what the agency decides. ""Zero compassion. Zero empathy. Zero everything,"" Wild said about his interaction with Kia staff.

For a third day, police officers and volunteer search and rescue specialists with the Avalon North Wolverines will be scouring the terrain near the Conception Bay community of Roaches Line. ""They are here. They are mobilizing now,"" Wayne Wall, Joshua's father, said Monday morning. Unlike Saturday and Sunday, however, there are no plans to deploy a helicopter, saidÂ RCMPÂ civilian spokespersonÂ Glenda Power. Searchers are assessing whether there's a need to recall air support to the area, she added. Power said the strategy Monday is to widen the search beyond the known trails in the wilderness area between Roaches Line and the community of Marysvale. Joshua has now been missing for three full days, and his family remains hopeful that he found some type of shelterÂ and will be rescued. ""My son is out there somewhere. He's most likely cold. Hopefully he's hung up into a shelter,"" Wayne told CBC's Kayla Hounsell on Sunday. The search was delayed Monday morning by another overnight snowfall, with 10-plus centimetres, followed by drizzle, complicating search efforts. Joshua Wall has been dealing with anxiety, and was not feeling well Friday morning, said his father.Â  By early afternoon, Wayne Wall said, his son was feeling better, and decided to walk to a friend's house in Marysvale, a distance of 10 kilometres by road. It was later learned that Joshua decided to enter the woods and travel along a backcountry trail. His last known communication was on Friday at 1 p.m., when he messaged his location to his friend, and writing that he was lost and his phone battery was low. An official search could not be mobilized until Saturday because of record amounts of snow and heavy drifting that prevented police and volunteers from reaching the scene. When asked how long police will continue the search, Power said an assessment will be made at the end of the day. ""At this point, there is no talk of ending the search,"" she said. ""But it is now Day 4 since he's been missing, and we'll carefully make that decision."" At its peak, there were 40 people searching for Joshua, said Power. Meanwhile, Power urged area residents to check their properties, and any buildings in which Joshua might have sought shelter from the storm.

In the same interview in which he announced his decisionÂ not to run for the leadership of the federal Conservatives, CharestÂ accused Quebec's anti-corruption unit (UPAC) of conducting a ""fishing expedition.""Â  Charest also cast doubt on the reliability ofÂ information gathered by UPAC investigators and defended a friend suspected of defrauding the government. It is the first time since leaving office in 2012 that Charest has directly addressed allegations that engineering and construction companies in Quebec were able to secure government contracts by donating to the Quebec Liberal Party. After Charest had stepped down, aÂ public inquiry heard evidence that during his time as premier, the provincial Liberals benefited from millions in illegal donations. It was also revealed that UPAC had opened an investigation into the party's fundraising practices. Media reports suggested CharestÂ was a key figure in that investigation. In his comments Tuesday, CharestÂ confirmed he'dÂ been singled out by UPAC.Â He said investigators had questioned a wide circle of his contacts, including former political organizers from as far back as the early 1980s. ""What do you call it when, suddenly, you begin an investigation and you interrogate 300 people about someone's life? Is that not called a fishing expedition?"" asked Charest. The investigation has been going onÂ for six years, and no one has yet been charged. It was ""common sense,"" he said, to ask forÂ the investigation to end. CharestÂ also said his government wasn't aware that firms were reimbursing employees to get around political fundraising laws in Quebec that prohibit companies from making donations.Â  ""I am accountable for the time I was premier of Quebec and leader of the Quebec Liberal Party.Â That said, what are the facts?"" When his government learned about the reimbursement scheme, Charest said he immediately tightened the Quebec Liberal Party'sÂ fundraising rules.Â  Tuesday's interview with Patrice Roy, host of Radio-Canada's flagship newscast Le TÃ©lÃ©journal, began with Charest's surprise announcement that he would not beÂ running for the Conservative leadership. But the rest of the interview revolved mostly around Charest's thoughts about the UPAC investigation and the allegations of wrongdoing that hounded the final years of his premiership. Many of these allegations resurfaced last weekÂ when Marc Bibeau â€” a former Liberal fundraiserÂ and close friend of Charest'sÂ â€” lost a bid to block the publication of UPAC affidavits.Â  The affidavits were filed in support of search warrant applicationsÂ â€” part of UPAC'sÂ investigation into Bibeau.Â  They contained summaries of police interviews with several witnesses, many of whom were high-ranking executives at engineering companies who allegedly said they felt pressured by BibeauÂ to illegally donate to the Liberals.Â  In one summary, a witness said Bibeau went around with a business card embossed with a Quebec government logo, even though he had no position within the government. ""I don't believe it. I don't believe one word,"" Charest of the allegations against Bibeau. He said that information in UPAC affidavits had been wrong in the past. He also raised the various governance problems that have checkeredÂ the anti-corruption unit's reputation in recent years. ""Do I need to remind you that UPAC is currently under investigation?"" Charest said, referring to its bungled arrest of a sitting MNAÂ in 2017. Though the information contained in the affidavits published last week wasn't newÂ â€” much of it was initially heard during the public inquiry into corruption known as the CharbonneauÂ commissionÂ â€” it reignited debate in Quebec about Charest's ethics. Several columnists questioned why he would want to re-enter the political fray given the questions raised by the open UPAC investigation.Â  ""What could be going on in Jean Charest's head?"" began one recent column in the Journal de MontrÃ©al.

Like others in her Millidgeville neighbourhood, she had been wondering for some time about what's happening with a vacant and crumbling 1960's era church property on nearby Millidge Avenue. The proposal, by a Guelph, Ontario-based numbered company, would see two, four-storey apartment buildings placed on the 1.9 acre lot at the intersection of Millidge and Daniel Avenue, less than a hundred metres from her child's school.Â  ""There is no space... on that piece of land for apartment buildings with 80 apartments,"" said Biryukova, who signed a joint letter of opposition with two of her Bellmanor Drive neighbours.Â  ""It will be like traffic jam road, we don't want our kids to walk through there."" City planning staff are recommending the development be approved, noting that, while the makeup of the community is mainly low to medium density residential, the Municipal Plan does allow for new housing development of higher density in such areas. Their report to the PAC says further that the property is located in a ""Suburban Intensification"" area. ""Intensification Areas are intended to develop with the highest concentration of land uses appropriate for their neighbourhoods, and they are the primary places for growth to proceed in a community,"" states the document. The developer could not be reached for comment Monday. The project is one of two, high density apartment building developments to be considered Tuesday by the city's Planning Advisory Committee. The developer is seeking approval for a municipal height map variance to allow placement of a building that will be about 25 metres tall. That's about 11 metres above what the height map for the Wentworth and Princess Street neighbourhood allows.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/high-density-planning-neighbours-traffic-noise-height-variance-1.5433624,[],N/A114,Jean Laroche,2020-01-21T22:00:53.404Z,CBC you later! TV building coming down to make way for Halifax hospital expansion,"The Nova Scotia government has issued a tender to demolishÂ the historic CBC building on Bell Road that has hosted popular national television programs likeÂ Don Messer's Jubilee, Street Cents and This Hour Has 22 Minutes. According to tender documents posted Tuesday, the company chosen to demolish the buildingÂ can begin their work April 1. This means thatÂ 22 Minutes, which records in the building's studio, must move out by March 31. StantecÂ Consulting Limited conducted an extensive survey of the more than 63-year-old building to determine what hazardous materials might be present. The company'sÂ findings make up the bulk of the tender documents. Investigators examined almost every nook and cranny of the five-storey, almost 60,000 square-foot building and discovered, among other things,Â ""asbestos-containing materials, lead-containing paint, mercury-containing equipment, PCB-containing equipment and bird droppings."" The tender, which closes Feb. 6,Â says the successful bidder mustÂ remove and dispose of the material deemed hazardous in accordance with established regulations. Last year, the province said it had set aside $1.6 million for demolishingÂ the building. In 2014, CBC Television, CBC Radio and CBC online moved to Chebucto RoadÂ in a renovated space that was formerly home to the Bay department store. The provincial government bought the Bell Road building and land from CBC inÂ November 2017 for $4.5 million. Removing the CBC building will allow for expansion of the Queen Elizabeth Health Sciences Centre, which is located next door. A news release from the province said the new building will include: The work isÂ part of the $2-billion Queen Elizabeth II hospital system's redevelopment.Â The project includes an outpatient centre to be built in the Bayers Lake Business Park, as well as expansions at the Dartmouth General Hospital and the HantsÂ Community Hospital. The project will ultimately make way for the closure of aging and decrepit buildings on the Victoria General site.

Back in Canada after meeting in Oman with Iranian Foreign MinisterÂ Mohammad Javad Zarif to discuss the disaster that occurred near Tehran, Champagne said he is aware of media reports that Iran is backtracking on its pledge to share the flight recordersÂ for independent analysis. ""When you say to the world you take full responsibility, that comes with consequences,"" Champagne told reporters at the Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. ""What I did say to the Iranian foreign minister is that the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, is that the black [boxes] be sent quickly either to Ukraine or to France. In light of new reports that suggest Iran may be wavering, ChampagneÂ reached out to his counterpartÂ today to make the point again. ""I wrote this morning to my Iranian counterpart to stress again the wish of Canada, the wish of the co-ordination group, and I would think the wish of the international community that the black [boxes]Â be sent where [they]Â should be sent,"" he said. The state-run Islamic Republic News AgencyÂ (IRNA)Â quoted the head of the accident investigation board of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Hassan Rezaeifar saying Iranian experts are examining the black boxes. ""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" the agency reported him saying. The black boxes containÂ theÂ cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder and haveÂ information that is critical for understanding the sequence of events around the crash. Iran has conceded it launched a missile attackÂ thatÂ struck down the Ukrainian airliner on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. There were 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents of Canada among the dead. Champagne said the repatriation process continues for the remains, and the wishes of the family are being respectedÂ on whether they want their loved ones to be returned to Canada or stay in Iran. ""In the interests of privacy, I won't go into too much detail ... but I can tell you that the wishes of the family are paramount and we will ensure this is the case in all cases,"" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was scheduled to meet with some family members of the crash victims on Monday evening in Winnipeg.

""I will not be a candidate. It is final,""Â he toldÂ Radio-Canada's Patrice RoyÂ in an interview broadcast this evening on ICI RDI. Watch the full French language interview with Charest here. Before Christmas, Charest told RDI that he was thinking of entering the race to succeed Andrew Scheer, who resigned as leader in December after failing to win the October federal election. ""I thought a lot. I consultedÂ and, finally, I made the decision not to be a candidate,"" he said in French. ""The party has changed,"" he added.Â ""There are subjects on which, obviously, I have principles, like the environment, but also on social issues, upon which I took positions."" During the federal election, the Liberals managed to weaponize Scheer's past opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion and the fact that he had never marched in a Pride paradeÂ â€”Â raising doubts in the minds of some Canadians about his commitment toÂ LGBTQ rights. Many Conservatives argued that the next leader would have to deliver a more moderate message on social issues for the party to be competitive in the next federal election. Charest said he weighedÂ the impact of a leadership run on his family and his already busy work schedule. He also said that the rules governing the contest played a part in his decision. ""The rules of the leadership race are very strict. Basically, the rules were not written for an outside candidate. The deadlines are very tight, it does not give much time to recruit new members and to set up a national organization,""Â he said in French. Former Conservative cabinet minister and Canadian Alliance leaderÂ Stockwell Day said Charest's decision not to run came as a bit of a surprise. Day said that Charest was in Vancouver on Friday making a presentation at a law firm with which Day is associated. After that presentation, he said,Â CharestÂ gave every indicationÂ that he intended to enter the race. ""There were some very significant people there â€_ and he was quite clear that he was pretty well in,"" said Day. ""I've heard as recently as today that one of the people that was helping to organize that meeting on Friday actually heard from him and he was still saying he was in. So yeah, I'm a bit surprised."" Over his long political career he served in Brian Mulroney's cabinet before taking on the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives when they were down to just two seats in the 1990s. He left the federal scene in 1998 to join the Quebec Liberal Party, eventually serving as premier between 2003 and 2012. For years now, Quebec's anti-corruption squad, known as UPAC, has been investigating the Quebec Liberal Party's financing during the Charest period. Sources previously have told Radio-Canada CharestÂ wasÂ aware of the shadow that investigation could cast over his candidacy, but the former premier maintains he did nothing wrong. Last week,Â Charest's lawyer said he is innocent of any wrongdoing in political financing and Quebec's anti-corruption squad should immediately end its six-year investigation, which has not led to charges against Charest's friend, Marc Bibeau, or anyone else. ""Stop this investigation,"" said Michel Massicotte. ""Stop saying we are hiding something, or whatever. We have offered our full co-operation, but this co-operation does not seem to have been reciprocated."" Last week,Â Maclean's magazine columnist Paul Wells reported that former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper resigned from the board of the ConservativeÂ Fund CanadaÂ â€”Â the financial arm of the national partyÂ â€”Â so he could be more actively involved in the upcomingÂ leadership race to succeed Scheer.

""I was in constant pain and I had problems going to the bathroom,"" said Wallace, 47 who had the surgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in 2014, after developing uterine fibroids. The 47-year-old says her doctors told her the problems were part of routine healing, but as the weeks passed, the pain and smell got worse. Finally, a friend convinced Wallace to show up at her surgeon's waiting room, and just sit there until the doctor agreed to see her. When the surgeon finally examined Wallace, the problem was apparent and ""horrifying.""Â  ""She put her gloves on and reached in and took a glove and two sponges out of my body,"" said Wallace. AsÂ Go Public recently reported,Â the number of objects being left in patients after surgery in Canada has jumped 14 per cent over the last five years.Â  That's no accident, but a systemic problem caused by doctors and nurses being pressured to rush through surgeries, according to veteran surgical nurse Bev McLean.Â  McLean has spent more than half of her 33-year career in operating rooms, as a nurse, among other positions,Â and,Â most recently,Â reviewing operating room mistakes for legal cases. She says Wallace's story reminds her of a caseÂ she reviewed in 2010. In a rush to finish an operation, a surgeon grabbed a sponge from the instrument table after a nurse had finished counting medical devices to ensure all were accounted. The sponge was lost in the count and left inside the patient. ItÂ was only discovered after he developed a painful infection and required another surgery to be removed, says McLean. In an effort to reduce wait times and cut costs, many provinces cap funding for certain kinds of surgeries, no matter how complicated or what problems arise. At the same time, theÂ provinces requireÂ hospitals to balance their budgets,Â resulting in a crackdown on overtime and adding to the pressure to rush through surgeries. ""There's a big push these days to be fast,"" McLean told Go Public,Â ""and that's part of the problem.Â The faster you go in any procedure, no matter how good you are as a team, there's always the risk that you're going to take a shortcut or that you might miss a step, or you're doing two steps at the same time."" The Canadian Nurses AssociationÂ and theÂ OperatingÂ RoomÂ Nurses AssociationÂ ofÂ CanadaÂ say they too see this as part of the problem. Asked what it's doing about the problem, Health Canada said in an email ""the practice of medicine"" is up to the provinces.Â  There areÂ oversights and safety measures in place. Accreditation Canada, an independent agency that sets standards for publicly funded hospitals, made it mandatory in 2011 for surgical staff to count the devices â€” sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. â€”Â used after a procedureÂ to ensure nothing is left behind. This kind of medical mistake is considered a ""never event,"" meaning there are enough safety measures in place that it should never happen. But despite that, it does. Alberta and Quebec have the highest rates of leaving foreign objects inside patients, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Â  Both are above the national average of 9.8 such mistakes per 100,000 patients:Â Alberta at 12 and Quebec at 15 per 100,000 patients. A spokesperson for Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services tells Go Public, suchÂ ""omissions remain very rare,"" adding operating room staff need to be vigilant and follow best practices. Alberta Health Services recently finished a comprehensive review of what's causing these errors, andÂ foundÂ the ""primary factors identified are distractions, incorrect surgical tool counts and challenges with surgical team dynamics,"" according to spokesperson Kerry Williamson. Williamson says there is no single, identifiable reason why Alberta's rates are higher, but that it's likely due to the province's good reporting system. In Ontario, hospitals areÂ required to report to the Ministry of Health on their use of the instrument checklist â€” which has shown toÂ ""reduce the rates of death and complications,"" according to ministry spokespersonÂ David Jensen. The ministry notedÂ the province's rateÂ of left-behind medical devices is lower than the national average, butÂ would not comment onÂ whether the funding model or the pressure to balance hospital budgets is leading to rushed operations.Â  In some parts of Canada, including Toronto and Ottawa, evidence about medical errors is being gathered in operating rooms equipped with ""black box"" recorders,Â similar to those in airplanes, providing aÂ window on what can go wrong. The boxes includeÂ cameras and microphones that monitor what's being said and done in operating rooms, analysis of which shows distractions like loud noises, irrelevant conversations and doors opening and closing may beÂ leading to medical mistakes. The Toronto doctor behind the project,Â Teodor Grantcharov,Â has been testing theÂ boxes for almost fourÂ years.Â  Noises distracted surgeonsÂ a medianÂ of 138 times per surgeryÂ according to findings released in June 2018.Â  Misplaced medical devices are part of theÂ broader problem ofÂ ""preventable patient harm incidents"" â€” a category of mishaps that also includes hospital-acquiredÂ infections,Â blood clots and childbirth trauma.Â  Those mishapsÂ are part of a ""silent epidemic,"" according to advocate Kathleen Finlay, founder of the CenterÂ for Patient Protection, anÂ independent,Toronto-basedÂ group aimed at improving health care. ""People are being injured, permanently disabled and even dying â€_ so the federal government needs to treat this as the public health-care crisis it is,"" said Finlay. And when it comes to such incidents, Finlay says the futureÂ looks grim, based onÂ a 2017Â reportÂ from the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, aÂ not-for-profit health-care watchdog.Â  The reportÂ found more than 12 million Canadians in hospital and home-care settings will be harmed by the healthcare system over the next 30 years, costing the health-care system an additional $2.75 billion per year. Another 1.2 million people will lose their lives.Â  So what can be done? Finlay would like to see those black boxes routinely used in operating rooms across the country. She's also calling on the federal government to create an independent organization that would investigate hospital medical errors and wants Canada to implement a national hospital rating system, like those in the United States. She also wants to see provinces standardize what data is collected and reported about medical errorsÂ so Canadians have a clear picture of what's happening. ""They're very different from one province to the next,"" she says. ""So they're really not the kind of numbers that give you a full picture."" Tracy-Ann Wallace, the former patient,Â says she was shocked to learn how many patients have had the same â€” or similar â€” experiences to her own. In her case, the surgeon apologized, telling her it shouldn't have happened. Yet, five years later, she's still wondering how it did. ""This doesn't need to be happening and it shouldn't be happening. We need to tend to it,"" she said. St. Michael's Hospital tells Go Public it reviewed what happened in Wallace's case and the results led to changes that strengthened its process for counting equipment at the end of a procedure.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/medical-devices-left-in-patients-1.5364248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/fetal-monitor-left-inside-surgical-medical-error-1.5349111 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736,N/A119,Shannon Flaman,2019-12-27T11:00:00.604Z,Don't pity my disability; it's not the same as being kind,"As someone with an external disability, I'd like people to know there's a line between kindness and pity. It's a realization I've come to after a lifetime of struggling with stuttering. Every single time my mouth opens, my disability is announced to the world. I've heard it all: ""spit it out,"" ""slow down,"" ""I can't understand you."" Drive-thrus are a challenge. When I talk on the phone, people think I'm cutting out. On many occasions, I've had people assume I'm drunk or disabled in other ways. These are just a few of the barriers I face every single day. I will continue to face them for the rest of my life. This is my reality. But it's not these barriers that get under my skin. I'm a smart, educated, ambitious woman, yet many people can't see past my disability. Don't get me wrong: I've never been bullied. It's actually the opposite â€“ I'm repeatedly pitied. At least once a day, I can see pity in the eyes of someone I interact with. Take the gas attendant who's used to five-second exchanges. For me, the ""F"" in ""fill her up"" is 20 seconds and the ""R"" in ""regular"" another 20 more. I can see his expression change from confusion to panic to pity. Still, he just rolls with it, fills my tank and sends me on my way. The same can't be said for a woman who insisted on praying (quite loudly) over my head to God. She prayed pretty darn hard that God should take away my speech disability and fix my tongue. That situation was embarrassing and uncalled for. I didn't ask for her pity, nor did I ask for her prayers to ""fix"" me. Stuttering is the brain not connecting at the same pace as my tongue and lips. It also occurs because one side of my brain is stronger than the other. Do either of those sound like the end of the world? I think not. I don't pity myself and neither should you. We all have something ""wrong"" with us, whether it can be noticed by the naked eye or it's hidden inside of us. We all love to be shown kindness, but unless someone asks for pity, don't give it. Pity makes us feel less than or not enough. Over the past few years, social media has helped influence all of us to be kinder, to pay it forward. I love this movement and I think in general we are creating positive change with it. So, the next time you encounter someone different than you, rather than giving them an eye of pity, give them a big ole fist bump.

Others reject it as propaganda,"After tying his sneakerÂ shoelace, Laur An-Yochim jumps back to his feet.Â  Gym is his favourite class, and the fifth-grader does not intend to miss a moment of physical literacy consultant Stacey Hannay's instructions. ""What is this in Mandarin?"" Hannay asks, hopping around the basketball court inside Kildare School in Edmonton. The students yell the answer, then move along to a game that involves finding hidden trinkets underneath rows of plastic cups, following directions shouted in English and Mandarin.Â  Kildare is one of 14 schools in the Edmonton Public School Board's jurisdiction that takes part in programming offered by the Confucius Institute. That includes Mandarin classesÂ but also other subjects taught in Mandarin, ranging from physical education to math. The Institute is partly funded by China's Ministry of Education and offers programming at elementary and high schools, as well as colleges andÂ universities across Canada. China provides annual funding to run the programs as well as Chinese instructors who are areÂ paid by China. In Edmonton's case, they work alongside the school's regular teachers to deliver language immersion programming. Much of Confucius Institute programming consists of classes inÂ language and aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy. China says it helps operate more than 500 of them around the world. In Canada,Â eight colleges and universities andÂ three school boards have signed agreements with the organization.Â  Some critics, includingÂ the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), accuse the Institute of political interference and censorship in some of its classes, but the EPSB says it hasn't experienced those problems and has had thousands of its students complete theÂ program since it first struck an agreement with Beijing in 2007. ForÂ An-YochimÂ and other students, the immersion program means his Mandarin is as smooth as his English. He switches effortlessly between the two and says knowing one of the world's most widely spoken languages has allowed him to connect with his grandparents when he visits China annually. ""They say every year, 'Wow, how are you this tall? Or, 'Your Chinese is really good this year,'"" he said.Â  WATCH | Students at Kildare School in Edmonton test out their Mandarin: The Edmonton school board insists it carefully reviews teaching materials and has no concerns about controversial subjects getting suppressed in class. The boardÂ receives annualÂ fundingÂ from ChinaÂ to run the program, and 10 EPSB delegates flew thereÂ to renew the deal last October at Beijing's expense. ""I needed to go to see what it is, what does this look like? Right? What is the value?"" saidÂ Trisha Estabrooks, the board's chairperson and a former CBC News journalist,Â who was part of the delegation, there for six days. ""I learned about the value that some of our principals in Edmonton Public see in having that partnership.""Â  EstabrooksÂ does not believeÂ her independence as a trustee wasÂ compromised by having the trip expenses covered byÂ China.Â  Â ""Taxpayer dollars were not used,"" she said.Â  ""I'd be concerned about the optics if Alberta taxpayer dollars were used to pay for my trip to China. I would not have gone on that trip.""Â  But Kathleen Lowrey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Alberta, doesn't want her nine-year-old daughter anywhere near Confucius programs. ""We're inviting them into elementary schools that Canadian taxpayers have paid for,"" she said. ""It's important to separate Chinese culture and language and civilization from the Chinese state.""Â  Lowrey supports student exposure to Chinese culture, but she worries the country's government ""has very different values from Canada."" She citedÂ the example ofÂ two Canadian citizens â€” Fan Wei and Robert Lloyd Schellenberg â€” who wereÂ sentenced to death in China for drug offences. Some schools that originally took on Confucius Institute programsÂ have since severed their ties. In 2013,Â McMaster University in Hamilton ended its contract with the organizationÂ after a teacher, Sonia Zhao, left the Institute, citing discriminatory hiring practices over her membership in the Falun Gong religious group. The Toronto District School Board dropped out of a partnership before it got off the ground five years ago.Â  At the time, Concordia and McGill universities in Montreal told CBC they were approached by China but never signed up. McGill cited a lack of safeguards to ensure its academic freedoms. New Brunswick's Education Department, meanwhile, is opting out completely by 2022, calling the program ""Chinese propaganda."" A 2013Â intelligence report by CSIS warned that Chinese leaders identifiedÂ Confucius as ""an organization for spreading propaganda and building soft power"" and spoke of a ""perception that CIs do not allow discussion of topics that the Chinese government deems sensitive,"" such as the political situation in Tibet and Taiwan or the 1989 TiananmenÂ Square massacre.Â  Other foreign-governmentÂ funded institutions promoting culture and education operate in Canada, including Germany'sÂ Goethe Institute,Â Spain's Cervantes Institute and the British Council, but CSIS placed the Confucius InstituteÂ in a different category. ""Unlike the British Council, whose charter ensures that it is free from political interference, the CIs are closely linked to the Chinese part state,"" the report said. In 2014, the director of the Confucius Institute in Quebec told CBC she was visited by CSIS agents shortly after setting up shop in Montreal, and they only left her alone after she threatened to file a human-rights complaint. Determining exactly what kind of contracts are in place betweenÂ Canadian schools and the Confucius InstituteÂ can beÂ tricky.Â  CBC News reached out to eightÂ higher-education institutions to find out about their agreements with China. Four of them didn't respond: The University of Waterloo, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina and Halifax's St. Mary's University disclosed that they renewed their contracts in 2016Â but only Waterloo and the Saskatchewan schools provided copies to CBC News. St. Mary's asked CBCÂ to fillÂ out a freedom of information request. The Coquitlam School District in British Columbia and the Edmonton Public School Board provided copies of their agreements. The two boards' contractsÂ specify that China's role will include providing a set amount of annual funding but don't spell out anÂ amount other than a one-time ""start-up"" contribution ofÂ $150,000 in Coquitlam's case.Â  If Canadian educational institutions have to accept foreign funding, theyÂ should control the curriculum, saidÂ Gordon Houlden, a former diplomat with the Canadian government who has workedÂ in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""If there isn't enough money available, it's very hard sometimes ... to say no,"" said Houlden, who now heads the China Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which is mostly funded by the province and receives no money from China. Houlden says young Canadians should continue learning about an important economic powerÂ like China, but the funding for any such education programs should come fromÂ local governments orÂ school boards.Â  ""The 21st century will be, in my view, dominated by Asia,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/confucius-institute-schools-funding-1.5370858,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confucius-institute-programs-china-school-1.5259963 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/xi-jinping-global-ambition-1.5373557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-cbc-1.5372916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-power-belt-and-road-caribbean-jamaica-1.5374967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinas-power-editors-note-1.5373823,N/A123,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2019-12-04T20:00:17.049Z,Plastic surgeon vows to fight potential class-action lawsuit alleging he filmed patients without consent,"UPDATE: Since the publication of this article, Dr. Martin Jugenburg has responded to CBC's request for comment. The article has beenÂ updated to reflect that response.Â  A Toronto plastic surgeon who could face a class-action lawsuit over allegationsÂ he breached the privacy rights of patients by recording them without their consent using surveillance cameras at his clinic said the suit is without merit and that he intends to vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Dr. Martin Jugenburg â€” known online as Dr. 6ix â€” is well-known on social media and was the focus of a Marketplace investigation last year that found security cameras in examination roomsÂ at his clinic in the Fairmont Royal York hotel.Â  The petition to have the lawsuit certified as a class action was filed on behalf of former patients on Nov. 28 in theÂ Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It alleges that Jugenburg failed to act in the class members' best interests and that he placed his interests over theirs ""in pursuit of his own personal and commercial gain.""Â  J.C., a representative plaintiff in the case, went to Jugenburg's clinic for a breast lift consultation and said the behaviour alleged in the lawsuit is unacceptable.Â  ""I can't imagine how many other women out there don't even know this has gone on. No doctor should be able to get away with this type of behaviour.""Â Â  The statement of claim also alleges that Jugenburg's clinic posted images of patients on social media without their consent. The allegations have not been proven in court. In a Dec. 2 statement to CBC News, Jugenburg saidÂ patient privacy continues to be his highest priority. ""We believe this legal action is withoutÂ meritÂ and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit,"" he said. Jugenburg said heÂ has apologized to his patients for not posting visible signage alerting them to the security cameras in his clinic and said the footage was ""protected, secure, and auto-deleted itself after a time delay.""Â  If given the go-ahead by a judge, the class-action could represent patients who visited Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, between January 2012 and February 2019.Â Â  ""The heart of the lawsuit is really to get damages for women who had their trust abused by Dr. Jugenburg and who suffered some pretty serious mental health effects as a result of realizing that they were filmed without their consent,"" said Tina Yang, one of the lawyers involved in the case.Â  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record' The plaintiffs are seeking $50 million in damages, including aggravated damages, and $25 million in punitive damages, plus an amount to be determined for special damages. Lawyers say these numbers could change if the lawsuit is certified, the number of plaintiffs in the class is determined and their additional experiences are gathered.Â  Last year, while reporting undercover for a story on breast implants, Marketplace producers spotted security cameras in a closed-door examination room where patients are asked to undress, as well as in the waiting area. The small black-and-white devices were attached to the ceiling in the corners of the rooms. At least some of the cameras in these rooms were also recording audio. Following CBC's coverage, Jugenburg said in an email that he provided clear signs about security cameras and removed the cameras from examination rooms.Â  J.C., one of two representative plaintiffs on the statement of claim, had read Marketplace's article last year.Â Â  ""I remember I was walking through my basement reading it and then I ... literally fell onto the chair and I was overcome with humiliation."" J.C. visited Jugenburg's clinic in the summer of 2018. She said a nurse asked her to remove her top and bra so that photos of her breasts could be taken for her medical record with a hand-held camera, which is common practice.Â  At one point, J.C. also took off her pants so the nurse could examine her for a ""tummy tuck."" J.C said that at no point during her consultation did staff tell her about the additional security cameras in the room. ""The entire time I was there, it wasn't private,"" she said. At one point during the consultation, the nurse left the room to give J.C. and her friend who accompanied her to the appointment a moment to discuss their thoughts, J.C. said. ""That private conversation for starters wasn't private,"" she alleged. ""But [the nurse] knew it wasn't private.""Â  Both Ontario's Information and Privacy CommissionerÂ (IPC) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) launched investigations into Jugenburg's clinic following Marketplace's reports in December 2018. The commissioner's investigation found that the clinic's use of security cameras went against Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and that the clinic did not obtain patients' consent to film them with security cameras during appointments.Â  The commissioner reported that the clinic had a network of 24 security cameras that were recording 24 hours a day in examination rooms, the operating room, pre-operative room, reception areas, hallways, administrative offices, a computer workroom and the staff kitchen.Â  According to the commissioner's report, some cameras were first installed in 2012 but stopped working sometime that year. When the clinic expanded to two floors, the system was reset. These recordings began running in January 2017. The clinic said it shut off the cameras on Dec.Â 13, 2018.Â  The footage was available for Jugenburg to view live through a secure application on his phone. Footage from the security cameras was also stored on devices that were automatically overwritten with new footage approximately every 30 days, the report said. Jugenburg told the IPC that the cameras were installed for the security of the clinic, staff and patients and not for health-care purposes.Â  As part of the investigation, the clinic gave the IPC examples of when footage from the surveillance cameras was reviewed by staff. On two occasions, the footage was reviewed to verify statements made by staff to patients during consultations and on another occasion to review staff conduct.Â  In the spring of 2019, the college told Jugenburg to remove all cameras from rooms where patients undress and required that the clinic post clear signage alerting visitors to video surveillance.Â  WATCH: A plaintiff says security cameras were a huge violation of her privacy The clinic told the IPC that there are now only two security cameras â€” one at each of the two reception desks on both floors of the clinic. These cameras are only recording after office hours.Â  The clinic confirmed with the IPC that it destroyed all footage recorded prior to January 2019 except for footage that was seized by the college for its investigation.Â  ""Even though the cameras are no longer rolling, he still has to be held accountable for what he's done,"" said J.C. Â Neither of the two representative plaintiffs know if the clinic shared photos of them on social media. ""We're alleging that there were photographs taken of patients that were then placed on social media without consent,"" said Kate Mazzucco, another lawyer involved in the claim.Â  The lawyers who launched the lawsuit said these allegations are in the statement of claim based on a pending case against Jugenburg with the CPSO that alleges Jugenburg engaged in ""disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct"" by allowing a film crew into a patient's surgery without her consent, touching her inappropriately and posting photos of her on social media without her consent.Â  When asked previously about these allegations, Jugenburg said they are ""denied and being defended."" These allegations, and allegations that Jugenburg used video recording devices at his clinic, will be addressed at a college disciplinary hearing in May 2020.Â  If you have a story you'd like to share, send it to caitlin.taylor@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239,https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/toronto-plastic-surgeon-marketplace-cameras-1.5137052 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-breast-implant-cameras-1.4944628,N/A124,Anonymous,2020-01-22T00:16:19.602Z,WestJet says its 737 Max 8s will stay grounded until June on advice from Boeing,"WestJet Airlines Ltd. says it is removingÂ Boeing's grounded 737 Max jet from flight schedules through June 24 following the manufacturer's latest guidance about regulatory approval for the plane to fly again.

But not one Grade 6 Regina student, who has traded in her bus pass for fresh air. MilÃ¨ne Card, 11, admits she stopped taking the bus last year after almost missing it one day, whichÂ she foundÂ frustrating. SoÂ Card vowed she was done with the bus and would walk insteadÂ â€” which she kept up even last week, when wind chill made the city feel as cold asÂ â€“45 and school buses stopped running.Â  Card now walks the 2.9 kilometres to and from school every dayÂ â€” even on the coldest daysÂ â€” and says the weather never stops her. She hasn't been alone braving the Regina elements. CardÂ has amassed a small army of friends who have been with her every step of the way.Â  ""IÂ wanted to encourage younger people that live close to the school to walk â€_ because the bus is not fun"" says Card. She has reasons for walking besides the fact she doesn't love the bus, though. Card has attended several climate rallies in Regina andÂ follows the daily news, which is how she became inspired by climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Swedish teen is her activist idol, Card says, becauseÂ ""she isÂ famous, but not for being in a movie â€” but for doing good."" Card says she wants to do the same.Â  Now, her day starts at 6:30 a.m., as she gets dressed, eats breakfast, practises the piano,Â packsÂ her backpack and heads out the door for the walk. She's met by four other friends she picks up all along the way, who say they've made a year-long pact to walk to school together. TheÂ five say it's a great way to start and end each day, as they talkÂ and laugh all the way to and from school, walking so fast they say they barely feel the cold.

Without notice or consultation, the government removed the 285 hectares of coastal Crown land from its list of properties awaiting legal protection last March. The move cleared the way for the province to consider a proposal from a developer who wants to buy the land in Little Harbour to build golf courses. The decision, and how the government went about it, haveÂ sparked vocal opposition. Caitlin Porter, a biologist in the Saint Mary's UniversityÂ ecology of plants and communities lab, has been doing field work at Owls Head since 2011 as part of a study examining biodiversity in coastal barrens, or heathlands, across the province. Porter said her lab first identified the area for study based on aerial photos that showed prominent, tall bedrock ridges. ""It looks very strange when you're out there, as opposed to a Peggys Cove-kind-of-landscape where there is a lot of topography, but it's not this repeating pattern of ridges,"" said Porter. ""You don't often get straight lines in nature, so we find that pretty cool."" The types of plants and species reflect those ridges, she said. There's a lot of bog in the hollows where water can collect from the rain and at the tops of the ridges are plant communities that have adapted to the dry environment. Owls Head is also home to a globally-rare ecosystem and several endangered species, including the piping plover. It all makes the decision not to protect the area perplexing to Porter. She and a colleague have written to members of the government outlining why they believe Owls HeadÂ is special and calling on them to undo their decision and protect the land. Because the area is so rocky and has so muchÂ wetland, Porter said a massive amount of fill would have to be trucked in as part of any development at Owls Head. ""It would completely alter the site,"" she said.Â ""There's no way to minimize that or mitigate that. It's just the way that the land is shaped. And so impacts would be complete destruction of those important ecological features."" Those effects could also spread to the marine environment, she said, where any runoff would likely affect eelgrass beds surrounding the headland. These types of concerns will also be the subject of a public information session on Sunday at the Ship Harbour Community Hall. Barbara Markovits, one of the people helping to organize the meeting in conjunction with Eastern Shore Forest Watch, said residents have been promised for years that the area would be protected and they want to help people become as informed as possible. Markovits takes particular issue with the fact there was extensive public consultation to develop the Parks and Protected Areas Plan, which called for the protection of Owls Head, but no consultation when it came to the decision to delist the property. ""It was less honest and less honourable than we expect our government to behave,""Â she said. Markovits said not long after writing to Premier Stephen McNeil about how he brought integrity to government by not interfering with the Boat Harbour Act, she found herself writing him again, this time to condemn the way the government has handled the Owls Head matter. Although cabinet ministers have said they must balance the need for land protection with the need for economic development, Markovits said Owls Head ""was never meant to be anything but itself."" ""You wonder what was in the air when this plan was hatched,"" she said. ""Our concern is not with whatever development or destruction might be planned for this area. Our concern is with the government and how the delisting was done without any public consultation, without anybody knowing except those who might have something to gain financially.""

""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont. ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'"" Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.Â  Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.Â  ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there."" Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit.Â By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.Â  To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775. ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable."" Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.Â  Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite. Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit. ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good."" Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked â€”Â moving money from point A to point B â€”Â and that it was not going to investigate. ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess."" Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in aÂ statementÂ said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly."" Interac would not address Sinani's â€”Â or other customers' â€”Â concerns. Interac is a private company andÂ Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders. Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what â€”Â if anything â€”Â it was doing to help trace the money, but inÂ aÂ statementÂ said funds sentÂ ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover."" York Regional Police are investigating.Â  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buyÂ and shareÂ email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts. ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems,Â said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.Â  ""It's turning into an arms race."" Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites â€”Â from the local library to pizza delivery â€”Â and any one of those databases can get hacked. ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out."" Heywood says hackers then use bots â€”Â custom software â€”Â that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers. ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" â€” such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and â€” ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer."" So Interac's e-transfer system, he says,Â is only as secure as users' email and passwords. On the heels of a Go Public storyÂ published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank. ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.Â  ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system."" Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, saysÂ Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries. Vijayaraghavan, anÂ assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business,Â says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfersÂ directly from bank to bank â€”Â using only a bank code and a person's account number.Â  ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system."" Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authenticationÂ â€”Â a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address. Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work. ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks."" Popa, the cybersecurity expert,Â says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers â€” and the auto-deposit optionÂ â€” is if the government forces them.Â  He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place. ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians."" Sinani the contractor,Â says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.Â  But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient. ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""

These arts stand to be lost in the age of mass production and planned obsolescence. Photos taken on film are meant to last but when they're forgotten about and sit undeveloped, especially for a long period of time, it gets trickier to recover those memories.Â  That's where Greg Miller, of Film Rescue International in Indian Head, Sask., steps in. ""It's great work. We've never got rich doing this work, but we've always been highly entertained,"" Miller said.Â  The stories customers tell him tend to be similar: a family member died, then they go through their belongings and old rolls of undeveloped film are discovered. Sometimes, the photos are ""a bit naughty"" or sexually explicit, but Miller said, for the most part, family members are excited to see them and rarely ask for those to be withheld in their final package of images. He noted the company is intensely private the images they process, Â so they can't accidentally be leaked. Because regular film processing labs, which are increasingly rare, don't always have the right chemicals or materials to process those rolls of undeveloped film, this business 70 kilometres east of Regina, fills that niche.Â  When he started the business in 1999, Miller would get two or three phone calls a week from prospective customers.Â  That changed when he was put on Kodak's referral list; he then started to receive 20 to 30 calls a day. Miller said the company has worked with film dating as far back as the 1920s, and has done work with various law enforcement agencies, two presidential libraries, the Smithsonian Institution and for customers from around the world. ""It's opening time capsules for a living, basically,"" Miller said.Â  ""That's fun work. To this day, I love the job. I like getting up in the morning and seeing what we'll discover."" In particular, Miller said he enjoys working with old, high-quality photo negatives. He said they're similar to antiques, and he likes seeing how careful people were about taking photographs because they were expensive and more difficult to make. Miller said the company is working to future-proof his business. The company is relaunching its website soon, and it will be shining a light on the business's film scanning and archive digitization services as well as their film recovery work.Â  He said it's not always the most exciting work, but it's work that will keep the business alive as there becomes less and less old film to process.Â  ""We're always trying to innovate and do that type of work better than other people,"" Miller said.Â  Read other pieces from the Made to Last series:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-photo-film-recovery-digitization-1.5429355,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-luthier-1.5423298 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-bookbinding-1.5403310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-venice-tailors-1.5402224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-franks-shoe-repair-1.5403245,N/A131,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:23:34.829Z,The story behind the national anthem of the Mi'kmaq,"The Mi'kmaw Honour Song will be an important part of the opening ceremonies at this summer's North American Indigenous Games in Halifax.

""It's monumental,"" said Natalie Plato, deputy director of the Giant Mine Remediation Project, which is leading the cleanup. The project is seeking a water licence for a 20-year term and a land-use permit for a five-year term from the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. If all goes well, Plato anticipates her group could have those permits â€”Â along with terms and conditions â€” as soon as this summer, and start work on the cleanup project in 2020/2021. ""It means we can actually start the work and get this site remediated,"" Plato said. The Giant Mine site, which sits within the boundaries of the City of Yellowknife, is one of the most contaminated sites in Canada. From 1948 until 2004, gold from Giant Mine was a major economic driver for Yellowknife and the N.W.T. The mine became the property of the government of Canada in 1999, when Royal Oak Mines Inc. went into receivership. It operated for another five years before closing for good.Â  The closure and remediation plan first and foremost addresses 237,000 tonnes of highly toxic arsenic trioxide left behind. The plan is to freeze the waste undergroundÂ foreverÂ using thermosyphon technology. The cleanup will also fill old pits, cover up tailings ponds and build a new water treatment plant so that runoff water can be treated before being discharged. It will also see the cleanup of the former Giant Mine townsite, on the shore of Back Bay, as well as the future site of a mining heritage museum.Â  ""Our pitch is to make the site safer for the environment and the public,"" said Plato.Â  In 2007, when the plan was first presented and before an environmental assessment was ordered, it came with a price tag of $947 million, which was frequently rounded up to $1 billion. Plato said she expects that number to be revised once the terms and conditions of the water licence are made clear.Â  Most of the details of the cleanup plan have already been reviewed by stakeholdersÂ and discussed at length during two technical sessions and a ""closure criteria"" workshop.Â  StakeholdersÂ â€”Â from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation to Fisheries and Oceans CanadaÂ â€” have already filed their evidence, all of which is available on the land and water board's public registry.Â  ""There has been a lot of work done up until this point,"" said Shelagh Montgomery, executive director of the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board. The enormous project is not without controversy.Â  ""While we support the overall goals of the Project, in its current form, the water licence process is not capable of accommodating the YKDFN's rights,"" reads the opening slide of a presentation from the Yellowknives Dene First Nation.Â  The First Nation is still seeking compensation and an apology for the damage caused by the mine. It also fears that Baker Creek, which runs through the site, will not be returned to its full health, and that the Yellowknives will be shut out of environmental monitoring to follow the remediation unless more is done to train and build capacity among First Nation members. The City of Yellowknife also has concerns.Â  ""The project's responses to the City's outstanding concerns have mostly refused to acknowledge validity of the concerns and a consequential absence of effort in addressing them,"" reads a slide the city will present this week. ""Rather than working to resolve the issue, the project's effort has been in denying their applicability or value."" City administrator Sheila Bassi-Kellett is most concerned with the socio-economic impact of the cleanup. In particular, maximizing the business and employment opportunities for Yellowknifers and the Yellowknives Dene.Â  ""This is a complex project,"" she said. ""There are opportunities associated with the remediationÂ and those benefits should accrue here given the legacy of the project for the region."" Bassi-Kellett notes that the mine site takes up about seven per cent of the land within the city's municipal boundary, presenting unique opportunities. ""It's not like it's 350 miles away.""Â  But no matter what happens, Bassi-Kellett said this week's hearings are significant.Â  ""This is huge,"" said Bassi-Kellett. ""If there is an opportunity nowÂ â€”Â which we believe there isÂ â€”Â to find some good to come out of the mine, we really want to see that happen."" The hearings will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.Â Monday through Friday in the Caribou Room at the Chateau Nova hotel, most of it taken up by registered interveners.

Born and educated in Canada, he has worked at major Canadian and American Universities, as well as two U.S. national laboratories.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. Some of the brightest minds from around the globe have been quietly working on technology that promises to turn the world on its head, but so far Canada has been watching from the sidelines. While it is unlikely that people will be huddled around their televisions to watch the power to these incredible machines being switched on, the scientific discoveries that follow the debut of exascale computers will change our daily lives in unimaginable ways. So what exactly is an exascale computer? It's a supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion billion calculations per second â€” or 1 exaflops. ""Exa""Â is the metric system prefix for such grandiose numbers, and ""flops""Â is an abbreviation of ""floating-point operations per second."" For comparison, my laptop computer is capable of about 124 gigaflops, or 124 billion calculations per second, which sounds fast. According to the TOP500 list, today's fastest supercomputer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit, which tops out at a measured 148.6 petaflops â€” about oneÂ million times faster than my laptop. However, Summit is a mere welterweight relative to an exascale supercomputer, which is more than 60 times faster. To put that speed in perspective, if you took all the calculations a modern laptop can perform in a single second, and instead did the arithmetic non-stop with pencil and paper at a rate of one calculation per second, it would take roughly 3,932 years to finish. In a single second, a supercomputer capable of 1 exaflops could do a series of calculations that would take about 31.7 billion years by hand. While colloquially a supercomputer is referred to as a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of servers â€” or compute nodes â€” connected by a dedicated high-speed network. You might assume that an exascale supercomputer could be built simply by using 60 times more compute nodes than today's fastest supercomputer; however, the cost, power consumption, and other constraints make this approach nearly impossible. Fortunately, computer scientists have an ace up their sleeves, known as a GPU accelerator. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the professional-grade cousins of the graphics card in your personal computer and are capable of performing arithmetic at a rate of several teraflops (ie. really, really fast). And a feasible route to exascale can be realized by not only making supercomputers largerÂ but also denser. Sporting six extremely powerful GPUs per compute node, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora will follow this approach. Scheduled to come online in 2021, Aurora will be the first exascale supercomputer in North America â€” althoughÂ the title of first in the world may go to China's Tianhe-3, which is slated to power up sometime in 2020. Several other machines in the U.S., China, EuropeÂ and Japan are scheduled to be brought to life soon after Aurora, using similar architectures What exactly does one do with all that computing power? Change the world, of course. Exascale supercomputers will allow researchers to tackle problems which were impossible to simulate using the previous generation of machines, due to the massive amounts of data and calculations involved. Small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) design, wind farm optimizationÂ and cancer drug discovery are just a few of the applications that are priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project. The outcomes of this project will have a broad impact and promise to fundamentally change society, both in the U.S. and abroad. So why isn't Canada building one? One reason is that exascale supercomputers come with a pretty steep sticker price. The contracts for the American machines are worth more than $500 million US each. On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU signed off on â‚¬1 billion for their own exascale supercomputer. While the U.S. and Europe have much larger populations, the annual per capita spending on large-scale computing projects demonstrates how much Canada is lagging in terms of investment. The U.S. DOE alone will spend close to $1 billion US on its national supercomputing facilities next year, a number which does not take into account spending by other federal organizations, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation. In comparison, Compute Canada â€” the national advanced research computing consortium providing supercomputing infrastructure to Canadian researchers â€” has a budget that is closer to $114 million Cdn. In its 2018 budget submission, Compute Canada clearly lays out what it will take to bring our country closer to the forefront of supercomputing on the world stage. Included is the need for increasing the annual national spending on advanced research computing infrastructure to an estimated $151 million â€” a 32 per cent increase from where it is now. Given cost of the American exascale supercomputers, this is likely a conservative estimate. However, the need for an exascale supercomputer in Canada does not seem to be on the radar of the decision-makers in the federal and provincial governments. Hanlon's razor would suggest that this is not due to some sinister plot by politicians to punish the nation's computer geeks; rather, our politicians likely don't fully understand the benefits of investing in the technology. For example, the recent announcement by the premiers of Ontario, SaskatchewanÂ and New Brunswick to collaborate on aggressively developing Canada's small modular reactor (SMR) technology failed to mention the need for advanced computing resources. In contrast, corresponding U.S. DOE projects explicitly state that they will require exascale computing resources to meet their objectives. Why should the Canadian government â€” and you â€”Â care? For the less altruistic, a benefit of supercomputing research is ""trickle-down electronics."" The quiet but persistent legacy of the space race is technology like the microwave oven found in most kitchens. Similarly, the technological advances necessary to achieve exascale computing will also lead to lower-cost and more energy-efficient laptops, improved high-definition computer graphics, and prevalent AI in our connected devices. But more importantly for Canada, how we invest our federal dollars says a lot about what we value as a nation. It's a statement about how we value the sciences. Do we want to attract world-class researchers to our universities? Do we want Canada to be a leader in climate research, renewable energyÂ and medical advances? It's also a statement about how much we value Canadian businesses and innovation. The user-facility model of the U.S. DOE provides businesses with access to singular resources, which gives American companies a competitive advantage in the world marketplace. Compute Canada has a similar mandate, and given the large number of startup companies and emerging industries in Canada, we leave our economy on an unequal footing without significant investments in advanced computing infrastructure. Ultimately, supercomputers are apolitical: they can just as easily be used for oil exploration as wind farming. Their benefits can be applied across the economy and throughout society to develop new products and solve problems. At a time when Canada seems so divided, building an exascale computer is the kind of project we need to bring the country together.

Among its conditions, the injunctionÂ ordered people not to enter the work site or block access to it.Â  Some of the charges related to a five-day period during which a large group occupied the work site, while others were inÂ  connection to other dates and in some cases multiple breaches of the injunction as well as breaches ofÂ undertakings.Â  ""The fact that there is and has been compliance with the Injunction for over two years and the need to promote Indigenous reconciliation are in my assessment relevant factors to be considered by the court when deciding whether to decline to impose a finding of contempt,"" Murphy wrote in a 50-page written judgment accompanying his verbal decision. ""However, in the circumstances of this case, when I balance those factors against the important societal goal of ensuring people understand the importance of compliance with court orders, I do not believe it can be said that to impose a contempt finding in any of these cases would 'work an injustice.'""

There's no doubt that Harry and Meghan would enjoy a relatively peaceful life if they relocate to Canada. Toronto is where Harry and Meghan started their relationship four years ago, and where she lived for several years while filming the TV series Suits. Besides familiarity, Canada offers a fresh sense of stress-free simplicity they are not afforded in the U.K. Not only is celebrity culture almost non-existent in Canada, but fascination with the Royal Family tends to take a far more friendly tone. In contrast, there's no escaping the paparazzi in places like London. While the U.K.'s reality TV stars relish the flashing bulbs of photographers, several celebrities will recall ""terrifying"" experiences of erratic driving and little to no privacy as photographers go to extreme lengths to get ""the shot."" This is because there is no governing body for paparazzi â€”Â it's a grey area. The paparazzi and tabloid culture prevalent in the U.K. is clearly something Harry is wary of. Last year, the Prince said that every camera flash ""takes him back"" to the tragedy of his mother's death in 1997, grief which he compared to a ""wound that festers."" And the media attention in Europe can be unrelenting. Kate Middleton and Prince William won Â£91,000 in damages in a French court verdict in 2017, for example, after topless paparazzi photographs of the Duchess were published in a French celebrity magazine. The couple said the incident was a ""serious breach of privacy."" It's telling that only one photograph emerged during Harry and Meghan's recent six-week Christmas holiday on Vancouver Island â€” an image they released on their own terms, showing Harry with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in front of a dazzling backdrop of water andÂ mountains. Is it so wrong for Harry, who has not only grown up under the weight of media attention but also faced such tragedy in his life, to want some peace? After all, the couple who have put such a spotlight on mental health surely deserve to look after their own. Escaping the relentless pressure of media attention by itself isn't the only incentive for the family to leave the U.K.Â Â Since their first meeting, Meghan's race has been the talking point of headlines adorning British tabloids. Toned-down prejudice has seen the Duchess described as having ""rich and exotic DNA"" and being ""almost straight out of Compton."" The fact that she makes mixed-race women, such as myself, feel more in-touch with their identity is merely overlooked. Despite 1.2 million people identifying as mixed-race in Britain, Meghan is often reduced to being an outsider. Meghan has openly expressed her struggle to adapt to British tabloid scrutiny, saying she ""tried to adopt"" the ""British sensibility of a stiff upper lip."" It's a struggle that now appears over, resulting in the U.K. losing a progressive and refreshing couple who are not only responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in tourism, retail and fashion, but also newspaper sales and website clicks. They wouldn't be the first members of the Royal Family to see the attraction of Canada. Speaking in Toronto in 2010, the Queen praised the ""vast, rich and varied"" country for ""inspiring its own and attracting many others."" And Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, resided in Canada from 1911 to 1916 and acted as hostess for her father, Prince Arthur, during his term as governor general.Â The Princess's portrait was even on the $1 banknote issued in 1917.Â  Of course, there's no guarantee the paparazzi wouldn't follow them, the way they did when Charles, Diana, William and Harry visited in 1991. But a move to Canada would likely mean at least a reduction in the media scrutiny of Harry, Meghan and Archie. And that spotlight is something Harry has tried to escape his entire life, a significant curiosity about his private life which he has admitted he has ""never been comfortable with."" And it could also see the Royal Family spread its wings and become an international brand in a country where, unlike the U.S., Harry and Meghan are less regarded as ""celebrities,"" but are undeniably extremely popular. Viewed from that perspective, Harry and Meghan relocating to Canada could be a win for their familyÂ â€” and the Royal Family.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harry-meghan-doc-media-1.5328618 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-harry-paparazzi-settlement-1.5138130 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5420966/royal-reporter-says-pressure-on-meghan-markle-is-typical-she-s-just-complained-more-1.5420972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025,N/A138,Santiago GuzmÃ¡n,2020-01-12T11:30:00.858Z,"I'm new to Canada, and here's why I'm terrified of falling on iceÂ ","Picture this: you just finished grocery shopping for the week. Standing in front of the glass door that leads to a crowded parking lot in St. John's, you see a not-so-scary snowstorm coming before you.Â  Luckily, you'reÂ just a couple of metres away from the bus stop, so it shouldn't be that bad. You don't take the bus regularly because of its lack of efficiency â€” sometimes it's easier and faster to walk,Â instead of waiting for an extra half-hour. This time, the bus is your best bet.Â Plus, the bus will leave you almost in front of your door. Sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're trying to be positive. Although this is not your first winter in Newfoundland and you know how to deal with it, sometimes it's hard to keep yourself positive. Kudos to you. Now that you've made a plan, you put your groceries on the floor to prepare yourself to face this winter crusade: you pull out your mittens, put your warm hat on, cover your mouth and nose with your bulky scarf. You walk through the glass door.Â  You can feel the immediate change in temperature, and the wind. You start walking slowly, aware of the slippery street, balancing the grocery bags you're carrying. It seems like there is enough salt on the floor to protect you from sliding, and the bus stop is barely 60 metres away. Slip. Your right boot swiftly slides on an icy spot that the salt didn't cover. Miraculously, you juggle the grocery bags, as though you were on a tightrope above a hungry shark waiting for its prey to fall. You find your balance and stand still for a second. That was close! You let a laugh out, take a deep breath and try all over again. Slip. Crack.Â  Now you're sitting on the barely cleared sidewalk with all your groceries around you. NoÂ laughs this time. Instead, slow tears that freeze as they fall down your face. Your ankle. Despite the cold numbing your body, you can feel pain. Deep, sharp, acute pain. It's broken, you know it. In the distance, you see the bus arrive. Its passengers get out while some others hop on, and you're still on the ground in pain. No bus, no groceries, no laughs, but a broken ankle and the fear of having to go to the doctor. No, you're not afraid of needles, and prescriptions â€”Â you're afraid to have to pay fully for the medical service in the ER. You don't have health coverage. You really don't know why you're crying now,Â if it'sÂ the pain of your broken ankle or of depletingÂ your minimum wage savings to pay the medical bills.Â  Unfortunately, the previous scenario is the fear of multiple immigrants in Newfoundland and Labrador. In order to be eligible for the provincial Medical Care Plan, you have to be a current resident of the province, and fall under one of these groups: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, international post-secondary studentÂ or international worker (with a valid work visa). It seems simple, but it's not. I put myself forward as a case study. IÂ live in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to the Medical Care and Hospital Insurance Act, a resident is a person ""who is lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, makes his or her home in the province, and is ordinarily present in the province but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the province."" Since I was pursuing my studies here,Â I envisioned making Newfoundland and Labrador home.Â  So, emotionally speaking, I would argue that I was a resident even back then. Of course, my feelings could be debatable compared with the actual number of international students who decide to remain in the province. Therefore, as students, we'reÂ only given the credit of a temporary resident, because what will happen after we graduate? Nonetheless, after graduating, I decided to stay here. I moved from Corner Brook to St. John's and signed a lease in the house I'mÂ currently renting. I think that's enough for me to become a resident.Â  I am not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (I have all the intention to become one when I can actually afford it), and I am no longer a post-secondary student â€”Â so these are three other categories I don't qualify for. OK, but I do have a valid work permit, so I take it that I'm considered as an international worker. Well, yes but no.Â  I have to be employed by a Newfoundland and Labrador-based company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for MCP. I'mÂ a self-employed artist trying to make a living from what I came to study in Newfoundland and LabradorÂ to begin with. Securing a full-time position in my field can be quite challenging, but that hasn't stopped me from finding continuous work in my field almost since I graduated last May. However, my contract work won't be considered as full-time employment. Immigration and career consultants have worked hard with me to find a solution. They'veÂ helped me look for and connected me with available resources in order for me to get an affordable health care plan. Have I been lucky? No. The answer I've always encountered is ""you're not eligible."" Like the character in the scenario above, I'mÂ afraid to get injured because I wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills. I blamed myself in the beginning for not looking into this situation earlier. I truly thought that this was only happening to me. However, as I became more vocal about it, I found that fellow former international students who decided to reside in N.L. have struggled with this issue as well. Why haven't we found a solution? Why is there nothing in place to support the transition of these international graduates from students-to-workers in matters of health care? Here's a tip: if you're currently an international student, want to stay in thisÂ province, and find yourself reading this article,Â make sure to purchase insurance with your current insurance provider withinÂ 30 days of graduating.Â  I wish someone had told me,Â because I walk my days afraid of falling.

One of the infantsÂ was taken by ground ambulance to the hospital because air transport was not available, the quarterly report says. The infant, who was in unstable condition, had a heart attack on arrival. The report, released on Thursday, saysÂ intubation was difficult, and the infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Treatment was later withdrawn and the infant died. Another infant, who was premature and in unstable condition, was alsoÂ taken to the hospital by ground ambulance. The report says transportation by the Lifeflight air ambulance was declined. The infant had surgery for a bowel obstruction and died the next day. While the exact circumstances of the deaths are not known, the twoÂ incidents happened at a time when tensions were high between Lifeflight staff and the provinceÂ â€” which oversaw the air ambulance service for decades before shuffling it over to Shared Health, the organization that co-ordinates health care in Manitoba, last October. In December 2018, the doctors who work for the air ambulance service threatened to stop working on private medevac planes if the province didn't hire more pilots and fund annually required training for pilots, citing safety concerns. The move came after the province signalled the possibility of privatizing the flights. TheÂ critical incident report, released quarterly by the province, details serious health-care events reported to Manitoba Health. It provides short descriptions of each event, but does not provide identifying factors or specific locations. ""While we can provide general information on recommendations that have come from critical incidents, we are unable to provide information about specific incidents (including recommendations),"" a provincial spokesperson said. The two-page Oct. 1 toÂ Dec. 31, 2018, report lists 30 such incidents. Of those, seven resulted in death. The report also lists a patientÂ who fractured a hip after being pushed onto the floor by another patient as a major incident and not a death â€” although the patient died two days later. The report also refers to an incident where a patientÂ died after a STARS air ambulance arrived almost two hours after being called and without a doctor. The patient initially arrived atÂ the emergency room with chest pain and had a heart attack, but was resuscitated. A transfer via a STARS air ambulance was needed, but the ambulance arrived almost two hours later without a physician on board, the report says. Staff were initially unable to intubate the patient, and later made the decision to transport the person by ground, but the patient was dead on arrival at the destination, the report says. The report says another patient, who was supposed to be supervised during mealtimes, choked to death while eating unsupervised. The report says the need to supervise the patient ""was not consistently communicated to the entire care team."" The report also details misdiagnoses, including a patient who received an invasive procedure that was not indicated for their condition. Another didn't get expert consultation for a skin condition that turned out to be misdiagnosed, resultingÂ in a delay in appropriate treatment. AÂ patient who was assessed for an acute condition and sent home later died after ""the opportunity to immediately consult expert medical services to assess the patient's risk was not realized,"" the report says. The report also details falls that led to serious injuries, and a miscalculation that led to a medication overdose, requiring the patient to be resuscitated.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-manitoba-winter-2018-healthcare-1.5429195,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-shared-health-takeover-1.5336152 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lifeflight-air-ambulance-doctors-refuse-1.5199326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-manitoba-summer-2018-healthcare-1.5362916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/critical-incidents-healthcare-2018-1.5290716,N/A140,Shawn Jeffords,2020-01-21T23:57:56.001Z,"Public health restructuring should be negotiated, not forced, report states","Any merger of health units must be negotiated and not forced, public health officials in Peterborough, Ont., said Tuesday as they urged Premier Doug Ford's government to let communities drive service amalgamations. The recommendation is one of a series included in a discussion paper released Tuesday by the city's board of health at a rural municipalities' conference in Toronto. The board chairman of Peterborough Public Health said the agency wrote the report as the province conducts consultations on its plan to reduce the number of provincial health units from 34. ""As they try to determine the right number, that needs to come through conversation,"" Andy Mitchell said. ""It needs to come from the bottom up, from the communities."" Premier Doug Ford's government announced in the 2019 budget that it planned to begin a sweeping merger of public health units by 2020-2021, saying at the time it would strengthen the system. The government said it had conducted a review of the province's public health units and believed their structure did not allow for consistent service delivery. Ontario's public health units co-ordinate services including vaccination programs, infectious disease outbreak investigations, and restaurant inspections. The consolidation would mean that health units would serve larger geographic regions, which include communities with different needs. But Health Minister Christine Elliott appointed special adviser Jim Pine last fall to conduct consultations with municipalities who had warned that the amalgamation, coupled with changes to public health cost-sharing with the province, could jeopardize services and result in frontline staff layoffs. A spokeswoman for Elliott said Tuesday that consultations continue but the government intends to move forward with its plan to ""amalgamate certain units."" ""This work will be directly informed by feedback from Mr. Pine's consultations and, as such, it is too early to say how many units the province will establish or when amalgamation will start,"" Hayley Chazan said in a statement. Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, Peterborough's medical officer of health, said the local health board is encouraging the minister to build on established strengths of many public health units, including those in rural Ontario. ""Amalgamations of boards, particularly into regional, rather than local structures, threatens both the accountability and the responsiveness of public health governance,"" she said. The report does not oppose merging health units, but said that based on studies, the agencies should not serve populations greater than 500,000. Any new model must also take into account rural communities' ability to pay, it adds. ""Funding should be predictable and consider factors such as equity, population demographics and density, rural/urban mix,"" the report said, adding it should also ""increase to meet new demands."" Dr. Joyce Lock, the chief medical officer for Southwestern Public Health, said that agency was created in May 2018 as a result of a voluntary merger between two health units near London, Ont. The former Elgin-St. Thomas Public Health Unit and Oxford County Public Health Unit separately served 205,000 rural and small city residents. The agencies joined together to ensure they could continue to provide programing after multi-year funding increases below the rate of inflation, she said. ""Without longer-term efficiencies we would need to shutter some programs,"" she said. ""Our amalgamation has allowed us to pool our resources, become a stronger voice for rural public health and blend the best of our skills, talent, and knowledge."" Lock said their merger will save money over the long-term, but urged the province to take a ""thoughtfully planned, strategic, and well-funded"" view of the process. ""It takes dollars and time up-front to save dollars and time down the road,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-public-health-1.5435445,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/reconsider-public-health-restructuring-region-waterloo-1.5245480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lhin-management-jobs-cuts-1.5055191 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ontario-health-super-agency-private-health-care-funding-1.5039944 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-are-ontario-health-teams-doug-ford-government-1.5035750,N/A141,Emily Chung,2020-01-20T14:47:38.887Z,"Goodbye, gas furnaces? Why electrification is the future of home heating","It's a stereotype, but it's true â€”Â Canada's winters are cold. And many of us stay toasty by burning fossil fuels such as natural gas in our furnaces or the boilers that feed our radiators. In an effort to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions and meet targets to reduce global warming, the U.K. has proposed banning fossil fuel-based heating in new homes by 2025. Cities in the states of California, Washington and Massachusetts are also trying to phase out natural gas. If your home is hooked up to aÂ district heating system, where a utility supplies heat directly, you may be able to tap into a variety of greener energy sources.Â  But if your home relies on its own individual heating system, as most do, what are the alternatives to fossil fuels and will they work in the colder parts of this country? Here's a closer look. About 45 per cent of Canada's emissions come from burning fossil fuels to make energy, including heat and electricity â€” quite a bit more than transportation (28 per cent), the Prairie Climate Centre reports. Of that, about half is from houses, shops, schools and other private and public buildings. The other half is from industry. Nearly 70 per cent of the energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil fuels, a 2014 study estimated. Forced air furnaces and hot water or steam boilers with radiators, which most often burn fossil fuels such as natural gas, make up a majority of the primary heating systems in Canada, Statistics Canada reports. ""Very important,"" saidÂ Fin MacDonald, program manager of the Zero Carbon Building program at the Canada Green Building Council, a non-profit that advocates for and certifies green buildings. In provinces such as B.C., Ontario and Quebec whose power grids don't produce a lot of emissions, fossil fuel combustion from buildings represents the biggest source of carbon dioxide, he said. That's certainly the case in Vancouver, where more than half the greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings, said Brady Faught, green buildings engineer with the city. While people may be concerned about a car idling for 10 minutes, Faught says ""your house is basically idling all day."" And it's not just the gas it's burning that's the problem. Natural gas or methane â€”Â a greenhouse gas that traps heat far more effectively thanÂ carbon dioxide, causing much more global warming per molecule â€”Â also leaks from the entire distribution system used toÂ deliver gas to people's homes and furnaces, Faught said. Buildings heated with fossil fuels can cut some of their emissions by reducing the need for heating through things like better insulation and reusing ""waste"" heat. But in order to make a big difference, the green building industry is looking to electrify heating. ""The only fuel that we can truly make 100 per cent carbon neutral is electricity,"" MacDonald said. That's why the City of Vancouver is trying to come up with regulations and incentives for homeowners to electrify their home heating. ""The ultimate goal is zero emissions,"" said Faught, whose job is toÂ develop policies to encourage green retrofits for single-family homes in Vancouver. In provinces with anÂ electrical grid based mostly on hydro, nuclear or other non-fossil fuel energy sources, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C., replacing a gas-burning furnace with an electrical heating system can nearly eliminate a home'sÂ emissions. In some provinces, such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, power is largely generated by burning fossil fuels. For now, homeowners who want to cut heating emissions need to go beyond electrification and also install green power generation, such as solar panels. Baseboard heaters are the most common option in use across Canada. They're powered by electrical resistance heating, just like your toaster and oven. Electric forced air furnaces, electric convection heatersÂ and electric radiant floors also use electrical resistance heating. Heat pumps are far more efficient, because they simply move heat into your home, rather than generating heat. There are two kinds: Air source heat pumps, which draw heat from the air. (Yes, it can work even when it is very cold outside, just as your freezer can use its heat pump to cool itselfÂ to -18 C in a 20Â C kitchen.)Â  Ground source heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground and are sometimes referred to as geoexchange or geothermal heat pumps. However, MacDonald says the industry is trying to move away from calling it geothermal, as it gets confused with geothermal power generation. Baseboard heaters are popular because they're very cheap and easy to install. However, those and other kinds of electrical resistance heaters are very inefficient. ""They're like just having a toaster running in your house all day â€_ resulting in high electric bills,"" saidÂ Faught. For those reasons, baseboard heaters are often popular in rental units where landlords install them and tenants pay the cost of electricity. That said, it's possible to bring the cost down in a small home by making the building more airtight and better insulated. David Turnbull, a former homebuilder and current manager of Enerspec Energy Consulting, said his company built a townhome complex in Edmonton where units were relatively small and so well-insulated that ""you could almost heat the house with two hair dryers."" In that case, baseboard heating made financial sense. Heat pumps are way more efficient than electrical resistance heating. Both MacDonald and Faught say it's possible to get 300 per cent efficiency from a heat pump â€”Â that is, you can get three kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity you put in. They're especially efficient in spring and fall.Â Â  However, MacDonald says heat pumps tend to produce a lower temperature heat than burning fossil fuels, and therefore don't heat a building as quickly. That means a building needs to be airtight and well insulated to keep the heat from escaping and reduce the ""heating load"" before you shouldÂ consider this as an option â€” and even more so the further north you go. Faught says air source heat pumps can heat an airtight, well-insulated home to a comfortable temperature until it gets to about -10 C outside. InÂ places with colder winters than that, supplementing with baseboard heaters may be necessary with conventional air source heat pumps. However,Â some manufacturers have brought cold climate heat pumps onÂ the market that they say can deal with outside temperatures down to -25 C or -30 C. One big advantage of heat pumps is that they don't just heat homes, theyÂ can also cool them. In fact, air conditioners are technically heat pumps. The difference with the heat pumps capable of heating homes is they can run in reverse. Air source heat pumps are cheaper and easier to install, but less efficient and more expensive to run. That's because the ground temperature tends to remain stable all year round â€” containing more heat in the winter and more ""coolness"" in the summer than the air. However, ground source heat pumps tend to be a lot more expensive â€” and require more space â€”Â to install because it's necessary to digÂ deep to access stable underground temperatures. That can be particularly costlyÂ in places where the ground is bedrock, said Turnbull. It's more economical if you're building on clay or sand, he said, and especially if you're digging anyway â€”Â for a parkade, for example. Solar power is useful for generating green energy to run devices like heat pumps in provinces withÂ aÂ fossil fuel-based electricity grid. However, there's also solar thermal energy, where heat is collected directly rather than by generating electricity. MacDonald said that tends to be more expensive than other options and requires lots of space for the solar panels. Because most of the heat is collected in summer, it also needs to be stored somewhere. ""If you have a pool, perfect,"" he said. If you have a ground source heat pump, in theory you can also store the heat in its underground heat exchange loop. Turnbull and Faught both think solar technology is not quite ready for heating individual homes in Canada (although solar thermal heating with storage has been successfully tested for district heating in Okotoks, Alta.). In Canada, the federal government is holdingÂ public consultations on proposedÂ changes to theÂ National Building Code and its National Energy Code for Buildings. Some jurisdictions such as Vancouver are also coming up with their own regulations and incentives to encourage electrification, especially in new homes. The city's climate emergency response reportÂ  proposes that by 2025,Â all new and replacement heating and hot water systems shouldÂ be zero emissions.Â  ""Having a fully electric house without a gas line is the direction we want to go,"" Faught said. Turnbull says governments need to plan to phase out fossil fuels in home heating. ""It's an inevitability that we are going to get off them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-home-certified-as-alberta-s-1st-passive-house-1.4803890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/district-energy-1.5378650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/what-on-earth-newsletter-home-heating-carbon-emissions-1.5429492 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/passive-house-affordable-housing-1.4432331,N/A142,Anonymous,2020-01-21T22:03:54.859Z,TransLink increases Canada Line capacity during peak hours by 15% with 4 new trains,"B.C.'s transit authority, TransLink, is promisingÂ a bit more breathing room for train passengers on the Canada Line between Richmond and Vancouver.

For her oldest daughter, Marina Penney, that gesture says a lot about what her mother was thinking in the days leading up to her disappearance in St. Anthony. ""She knew that something was going to happen to her,"" Penney said from her Clarenville homeÂ this week.Â ""She was living in fear."" Hillier-Penney disappeared from Dean Penney's home on Nov. 30, 2016. Documents show theÂ change in her life insurance policy â€”Â removing Dean Penney andÂ leaving her two daughters asÂ beneficiaries â€”Â was signed and dated on Nov. 16, 2016. ""The 16th of November, as I know it, it was the day her life was threatened. She went back to work that day and she had her friend witness those changes to take my dad off that policy,"" Marina Penney said.Â  The RCMP haveÂ not named any suspects in the suspicious disappearance of Hillier-Penney. Documents, however, indicate the Mounties believe she was kidnapped and killed.Â  The RCMP are not commenting on the existence of the life insurance policyÂ or what it could mean. ""All tips and any new information received are being pursued,"" RCMP spokesperson Glenda Power saidÂ in an email. ""Police do feel there are people who may have information relevant to the investigation who have not come forward."" Marina Penney said she knew about the change in her mother's policy shortly after she went missing. But after three years without answers, she's decided to take it upon herself to reveal details she believes are important in the case. She posted the policy documents on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her mother.Â  ""There were very few people that knew that had happened, and I'm to the point now where I just need to put her story out there,"" Marina Penney said. Â ""People need to know that."" Hillier-Penney went to her estranged husband's homeÂ that night to stay with their daughter, Deana.Â  Dean Penney told The Fifth Estate last year he was going hunting at their cabin in Northwest Arm, 45 minutes away. The next morning, her daughter woke to find her mother's cellphone, purse, jacket and books were still inside the house. Her vehicle was also still outside.Â Â  Police believe she disappeared around 8 p.m. Before she disappeared, Hillier-Penney was looking into leaving her estranged husband and her hometown behind, her daughter said.Â She had a job interview lined up in Glovertown. Friends of Hillier-Penney have said she expressed fear over leaving Penney. ""Jennifer told me â€_ that he said that he would make away with her. And they would never find her. Like she knew that,"" friend Vicki Burden told The Fifth Estate in 2018. ""She had said stuff to me, but not to the extentÂ she told other people,"" Marina Penney said. ""She just didn't want to burden me with it."" Dean Penney did return to his home the night of Hillier-Penney's disappearance, he toldÂ The Fifth Estate, to get his duck decoys. Penney saidÂ last yearÂ he has no knowledge of what happened to Hillier-Penney. Marina Penney is unable to move forward until her mother's body is found. ""I'm in limbo. A lot of anger right now. Coming up on the third year, the weight of all this is heavy,"" she said. For three years, she has racked her brain thinking of where her mother could be. She has no doubt she's dead. Those suspicions have torn Marina Penney's family on both sidesÂ apart, she said, ""No one looks at each other the same anymore."" Dean Penney's lawyer, Bob Simmonds, declined comment whenÂ reached by phone Tuesday about the change in Hillier-Penney's life insurance policy.Â  In the years following Hillier-Penney's disappearance, Marina Penney has longed to have her mother near herÂ â€” especiallyÂ when she had her first child, who's now 19 months old.Â  It's not about what Marina has missed, she insists, but about the life her mother never got to live.Â  ""She was 38 years old. She had plans. She was sick of living a miserable lifeÂ and she wanted to do more for herself,"" Marina Penney said. ""She wanted to be happy and that was taken from her."" What tears Marina Penney up inside is knowing her grandfather went to his grave in August without knowing what happened to his daughter. ""In the last three years, he spent so much time sat down by himselfÂ consumed by his own thoughts,"" she said. ""That killed him. It was too hard on his heart."" The RCMP were granted an extension last Thursday to hold items seized from Dean Penney's home, the family cabinÂ and a vehicle. Some exhibits have been tested at the RCMP's national crime lab in Ottawa, while others may need to be sent for analysis. ""IfÂ they had hard evidence, somebody would be in jail,"" Marina Penney said.Â  Penney said she's not confident in the case that the RCMP is building, and has been disillusioned by the investigation.Â  ""It's not that [the RCMP]Â don't want her found. They want her found more than anything but they got to start taking more action. Because people are going to start doing it themselves.""

It was his older sister, Natasha Barlow, who inspired him. She sparked his interest in moving picturesÂ by showing the four-year-old Bride of Chucky. ""Even though it scared the living hell out of me, after that I just couldn't stop watching movies,"" said Kennlin. ""In retrospect, I probably would never show a four-year-old a horror movie like that now, but I was a teenager at the time,"" said Natasha. Decades later, the two are a brother-and-sister team. Both filmmakers in their own right, they help each other out with filming and acting. Now both of them have found an outlet to screen their films. Films from both of them have been selected for St. Thomas University's Indigenous Film Festival, which begins at the end of the month. Natasha said it's exciting for the Indian Island First Nation, outside Richibucto,Â duo. ""I never thought something like this could happen,"" she said. She said film has always been something that's connected the two, even though she only recently found out the extent of that connection. ""I had never realized probably until the last year that he used to steal my movies,"" she said. ""He would then quote them and I didn't realize like he had watched some of my films."" It's not always easy working with family, however. Natasha said sometimes it can be hard to get any work done, especially when the two of them start laughing. ""We love to laugh when we get together, so sometimes there's been instances when it's taken us a little longer to complete projects,"" she said. But it's not always laughing that keeps the pair form working well. Kennlin recalls a time when he cut much of his sister's performance from his film Mancanti. He hadÂ insecurities over the script. ""I wasn't happy with the script I wrote I unfortunately cut it out,"" said Kennlin. ""That decision did not feel good."" Natasha admits she wasn't happy, especially considering she had to memorize lines of dialogue. But she now looks back at the dispute as a teaching moment. ""I find it very funny now,"" said Natasha. ""If I have to memorize anything I guess I'll be a little more aware that things will change with Kennlin."" TheÂ feeling of love and deep respect between the two is apparent. This comes, in no small part, from their different approaches to filmmaking. Natasha calls her brother a ""creative genius"" for his avant-garde, non-narrative approach to film. ""I just want people to see how great he is,"" said Natasha.Â  ""It bothers me when people do not understand his vision."" Meanwhile, Kennlin considers his sister fundamental to his filmmaking, noting that while her filmmaking could be considered more mainstream and conventional, she is willing to broach subjects he still finds difficult even to talk about. ""My topics have never really been focused on Indigenous issues,"" said Kennlin. ""My sister is a lot braver when it comes to that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brother-sister-film-making-1.5432676,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/indigenous-filmmakers-stu-fredericton-1.5405129,N/A145,Anonymous,2020-01-22T16:25:48.942Z,"St. John's airport opens, relieves stranded passengers","After five days without commercial flights flying in or out of the St. John's airport, travellers are happy to finally be able to take off and touch down. The City of St. John's has agreed to allow the St. John's International Airport to resume operations as of 5:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. The announcement is somewhat bittersweet for Beverly Steele whose sister who lives in St. John's missed a surgery that could only be done in Halifax. The 12 hour surgery would be critical in removing some of the cancer in her abdomen. ""The sooner she gets the surgery the better,"" said Steele, who is concerned about the cancer getting worse as she waits. Steele said the surgery was booked for Wednesday but the hospital needed her sister there by Tuesday, which didn't happen due to so many cancellations.Â  ""There is nobody to blame,Â it is just the luck has not been in our corner as of right now,"" she said Steele said it has calmed her family's nerves to secure another appointment for surgery and to see those flights back up and running. ""I am relieved, yes, because it's not just my sister in this situation, there are a lot of people that have to leave for many other reasons,"" Steele said. ""We just really need the airport, don't we."" Krista Mulrooney, who lives in Edmonton, was among the first passengers to landÂ Wednesday morning. Her father passed away Sunday.

Lawmaker Jess Phillips said in a video message that the party needed ""a candidate that can unite all parts of our movement â€” the union movement, the members, the elected representatives."" Phillips, who has been a member of Parliament since 2010, added that ""at this time, that person isn't me."" Four contenders remain in the race to lead the left-of-centre party as as it tries to rebuild support and regain power after last month's electoral drubbing. Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry are vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn, who is stepping down after Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 in Britain's Dec. 12 election. The GMB union, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers across a number of industries, said on Tuesday it was endorsing Nandy. Labour is one of Britain's two dominant political parties, but hasn't won a national election since Tony Blair's third consecutive victory in 2005. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won 365 of the 650 House of Commons seats in the Dec. 12 election, while Labour took 203, its worst total since 1935.

Labour is also agonizing over its Brexit stance â€” which tried unsuccessfully to satisfy voters who wanted to leave the European Union as well as those who wished to remain â€” and continuing claims of anti-Semitism in party ranks. Candidates must secure support from fellow lawmakers, local Labour associations and trade unions.

Saputo said his lawyers will serve Radio-Canada andÂ EnquÃªteÂ reporters with a demand letter.

Ten Thousand Villages announced Tuesday it will be shutting down its corporate operations in Canada this year, which includes the closure of its two stores in Winnipeg. In an update on its websiteÂ Tuesday, the Mennonite Central CommitteeÂ â€” the Winnipeg-based charity that runs most of Canada's Ten Thousand Villages stores â€”Â  cited aÂ ""challenging retail environment""Â as the reason for the decision to shutter all remaining companyÂ stores in Canada. The closure also includes Ten Thousand Villages Canada's head office and distribution centre in New Hamburg, Ont., as well as its online shop andÂ wholesale operations. ""It is with the heaviest of hearts we announce the closure of the corporate operations of Ten Thousand Villages Canada,""Â the stores said on its website.Â ""Thank you for 74 years."" After embarking on what it called an ""unsuccessful multi-year sustainability process,""Â theÂ Mennonite Central Committee said it was forced to announce the closure. ""For the last 10 to 12 years, this has been a very, very challenging business. Not a decision we took lightly. There simply wasn't a way,""Â executive director Rick Cober BaumanÂ said onÂ Tuesday. With major shiftsÂ in the Canadian retail landscape and consumer habits, Cober Bauman explained the existingÂ retail model is no longer viable.Â ""There's simply not enough people coming into our bricks-and-mortar stores,"" he said, adding the companyÂ also fell short inÂ online sales and wholesale contracts. Ten Thousand Villages had attempted to create a market in Canada for handcrafted products made by artisans in developingÂ countries. The move affects 10 remaining corporate-owned stores across Canada, including the two currently operating in Winnipeg. Stores in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick are also set to close by the end of May. However, a number ofÂ Ten Thousand Villages locations in Canada which are owned and operated by separate boards â€” including Manitoba stores inÂ Steinbach and Brandon â€” will remain open. Ten Thousand Villages U.S.Â â€” which operates separately from the Canadian enterpriseÂ â€” is unaffected by the change, the Mennonite Central Committee said in its news release. The company stores which are closing will be liquidating inventory in the coming months, with the last store closing by the end of May. The announcement was sad news for volunteers and employees likeÂ Jobina Westman, who started with Ten Thousand Villages as a volunteer five years ago and nowÂ fills in asÂ acting manager at the Henderson Highway location in Winnipeg. The store has been like a second home forÂ her, she said. ""It's been just wonderful learning about marketing around the world, and what kind of a difference we can make with our dollar,"" Westman said. Many of the store's handmade items comeÂ with informationÂ about who made the item, what materials they used and how purchasing the item supports global fair trade. ""That is just a beautiful piece to be able to pass on to our customers,"" said Westman. She said she's worriedÂ about the artisans around the world who relied on sales at the stores, and hopes customers will find other placesÂ to buyÂ fair-trade products. ""I really hope that someone else picks up the torch, and keeps running."" TheÂ Henderson Highway store where she works will shut its doors on March 31. TheÂ Plaza Drive location, in Winnipeg's south end, is scheduled to closeÂ May 29. The store's retail website will also shut down on May 29. The unique fair-trade stores haveÂ been around for as long as many consumers can remember. ""I think it's really sad,"" Devina Sirota, a Winnipeg customer,Â said. ""If you come here, you can actually see the products. But if you see it online, you can't really get a feel for the love that goes into them."" The Ten Thousand Villages chain's origins stretch back toÂ 1946, according toÂ the organization's website, whenÂ American MCC worker Edna Ruth Byler visited volunteers in Puerto Rico who were teaching sewing classes to help improve the lives of women living in poverty. When she returned to her home in Pennsylvania,Â she filled her car with their embroidery and started selling pieces at churches, parties and sewing circles. That work expanded to Canada in 1965, the MCC's Tuesday press release said, with the first Ten Thousand Villages store (then known as SelfhelpÂ Crafts of the World)Â opening in Altona, Man., in 1972. The Altona store announced its closure late last year. That followed the closure of nine other Ten Thousand Villages stores across Canada in 2018. ""We recognize this has a huge impact on artisans, staff, volunteers, shoppers, all of whom I'm deeply grateful for the contributions that they've all made,""Â the MCC's Cober Bauman said onÂ Tuesday.

The overall average vacancy rate for the city is 3.3 per cent, relatively stronger than other regions in the province, and a big change long term.Â  Seven years ago, the vacancy rate hovered around eight to 10 per cent, among the highest in the country for an urban centre.Â  Ndoro said the low vacancy rate is because more people are moving to Saint John, boosting the city's population and increasing demand for more apartments.Â  ""This is accounting for the low vacancy rate we are seeing, especially for the south end."" The city of Saint John has also made development of the south end's residential properties a priority in recent years, including demolishing more run-down buildings. A higher demand for apartments has in turn driven rent up, leading renters to look for apartments with more bedrooms.Â  ""Units with more bedrooms allow individuals to room together and split rent costs,"" Ndoro said in an interview with Information Morning Saint John. A lower vacancy rate means demand is outpacing supply, which is good news for developers and landlords, Ndoro said, but not so great for renters.Â  ""[More demand] also increases rent and affordability becomes an issue."" Ben Appleby is the housing team lead for Housing Alternatives Inc., a Saint John-based non-profit that helps people in need find suitable and affordable housing.Â  He said the high demand for affordable housing has serious implications for low income renters in Saint John.Â  ""If the rent keeps jumping, they can't afford those units anymore. You have an increase in homelessness amongst a population that typically wasn't homeless before."" Rent prices have increased by four per cent since last year, Appleby said.

But the lab may not be open for much longer, as questions swirl about whether Joi Scientific's technology works as previously described. NB Power spent $178,413 US (about $237,325Â Cdn) on costs associated with the lab, according to records obtained by CBC through access to information.Â The records capture costs between February, when NB Power opened the lab, up toÂ Oct. 16, 2019. The biggest expense in running the Florida lab has been the $42,372 US for standard lab equipment, followed byÂ  $38,694 US for support staff. The records don'tÂ specify how many people were considered support staff or how many people may have been brought in to workÂ in the lab. Other costs included instrumentation, H2 specific equipment, a work station andÂ rent and utilities at the facility, located at the Space Life Sciences Lab at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., where Joi Scientific is headquartered. Two former Joi Scientific employees interviewed by CBC News have raised questions about Joi's technology, saying it doesn't work as previously described. Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland has also said there's no proof Joi's technology is viable. Earlier this month, Holland said the NB Power lab in Florida will continue to stay open until the end of 2019, as a final test is underway to determine the technology's viability. ""Once [the test is] completed, either you send me somebody from MIT who says, 'Eureka!' or it didn't deliver the results and then we wrap things up,"" Holland said on CBC New Brunswick's Political Panel in November. A spokesperson forÂ Joi Scientific did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday before deadline. Last month, Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, acknowledged the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them. Her emailed statement didn't elaborate on those delays or challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement from November said. NB Power spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology, with the help of the Regional Development Corporation. NB Power planned to keep the Florida lab operating ""until we can make a decision whether we can go forward or not,""Â NB Power CEO GaÃ«tan Thomas told CBC News last month. He said the utility was doing that to ensure it could recoup some of the investment it made in Joi's technology. But the utility hasn't budgeted any money for its Florida lab in the 2020-21 fiscal year, according to documents the utility filed with the Energy and Utilities Board on Tuesday. ""NB Power is obligated to make payments related to the lab space and related equipment until the end of January 2020,"" the documents say. ""The payment for January 2020 is US$16,717. There are no other continuing obligations.Â NB Power will maintain the licensing rights should there be no further testing or funding by NB Power."" AfterÂ NB Power's latest rate application, New Brunswick's public intervener, Heather Black,Â asked the utility to provide Joi Scientific's ""most recent evaluation of the technology and its potential economic viability."" But in its response, NB Power said it couldn't answer those questions ""due to strict confidentiality requirements."" In response to a question from Black about whether NB Power has decided to ""pull the plug"" on the initiative, NB Power said Joi's ""technology is producing hydrogen from seawater,"" but the utility didn't provide further details. ""Additional testing is scheduled in the December time frame which will determine future direction,"" NB PowerÂ wrote in its filing. In a separate filing, the EUB asked the utility whether outside experts were asked to help evaluate the investment in Joi Scientific. ""With respect to the Joi Scientific initiative, NB Power had access to third party validation testing,"" NB Power wrote in response. ""NB Power also engaged its own third party to conduct testing."" The utility has never identified the third party that may have validated the testing andÂ hasn'tÂ released copies of theÂ those tests, citing a confidentiality agreement signed with Joi Scientific. Both the public intervener and NB Power declined requests for interviews about the utility's EUB filings. Do you have a tip about this story?

Now they live in Maritime barns ,"It's quite a step up from roaming the rocky shores of a remote Newfoundland island in sub-zero temperatures, scrounging for food and shelter. After travellingÂ 1,000 kilometres by land and sea, 40 feral cats from Little Bay Islands, N.L.,Â are settling into their new homes in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.Â  Most of the catsÂ âÅ â€” 29 of them â€” have been sent to warm barns, some sharing space with horses and chickens. ""They're very cute,"" said Shannon Doane, who took in two of the catsÂ toÂ help with rodent control at her barn in Elmsdale, N.S. ""They're very skittishÂ because they are feral, but they're not completely wild."" The cats were rescued by volunteers atÂ the Halifax-based charityÂ Spay Day HRM Society, who heard about the plight of the animals and their imminent doom due to the permanent departureÂ of the island's 54 residents. Citizens of Little Bay IslandsÂ voted in favour of accepting government financial relocation assistance lastÂ year, meaning services like power and water were cut off on Dec. 31. Although the cats were feral, many were fed by and interacted with the island's residents, which raised concerns about whether they would survive once everyone was gone. After arriving at a makeshift shelter in Dartmouth, N.S., the cats were checked by vets and spayed or neutered. They were then assessed to determine where they should be placed. One of the cats âÅ â€” likely an abandoned petÂ âÅ â€”Â was friendly enough to be put up for adoption through the SPCA. Another 10 have been placed in foster homes in the hopes they will become socialized for eventual adoption. The cats considered too feral to be socialized were found homes through the charity's barn cat program. Cats live inside hobby or commercial barns and have access to food, water and warm shelter. Three of those felines have hit the jackpot. They're living in Wendy Stewart's guesthouse in the coastal community of Halls Harbour, N.S. Stewart said she originally intended to keep the critters in a drafty barn on her property, used mostly to store firewood. But she also had an empty guesthouse and so she decided to move the cats in there. ""These cats were just rescued from a cold place. I wanted them to be warm,""Â said Stewart, who has only named one of the cats so far â€” CliffordÂ â€” since she's waiting for the other two to show more personality. Stewart said the catsÂ âÅ â€” two black and white and one all blackÂ âÅ â€” spend most of their time in a loft and occasionally leap onto a stack of rolled-up rugs to peer out of windows, surveying their new environment from high above. Once they become acclimated, Stewart will open up an already-installed cat door on the guesthouse so they can come and go as they please. She said the felines are already warming up to their new digs. ""I justÂ gather from their posture, their body language, that they're more relaxed than they were a week ago when they arrived,"" said Stewart. Doane's cats are currently being confined to a horse stall in her barnÂ while they become familiar with life in Elmsdale, which includes having chickens as roommates. They have a heated bed inside a large dog crate. There is a heated water bowl, cat tree, cat toys andÂ bales of hay for climbing. She, too, has yet to name the cats, as she's waiting for them to show their individuality. She hopes they will eventually become socialized enough that she'll be able to approach and pet them. ""They've gotten comfortable enough with me that when I go in and feed them, if I sit quietly in the stall with themÂ and read, they will eventually come out and eat,"" she said. ""The little black one is a little more adventurous than the black and white one and he'll come out and walk around the stall, around the perimeter, and doesn't seem to mind too much that I'm there."" Linda Felix, president of Spay Day HRM, said the cats have been sent to barns all across Nova Scotia and one in P.E.I. She said they were sent in groups of two or three and one group of five. ""They always have buddy,"" said Felix, adding there wereÂ three colonies on the N.L. island. ""We match them with cats from the same colony where they were trapped, so they went with a cat they would know and wouldn't be alone and afraid."" Felix said the cats currently in foster care are youngerÂ â€” between five and six months oldÂ â€”Â and so there is more of a chance they can be socialized. If not, they will find homes for them through the barn cat program.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/newfoundland-little-bay-islands-feral-cats-nova-scotia-rescued-barn-1.5432139,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/late-fee-renew-licence-frustrates-n-s-doctor-1.5431493 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/rocky-johnson-curtis-bowles-johnson-1.5429494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/border-collies-seized-new-homes-1.5428233 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/total-loss-fire-insurance-policy-recovery-guide-1.5429182,N/A152,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:25:55.411Z,Paraguay president among thousands in country suffering from dengue fever,"A dengue fever outbreak that has affected thousands of Paraguayans in recent weeks has reached as far as the presidential palace, with the country's leader Mario AbdoÂ Benitez confirmed as having been struck by the disease. The country's Health Minister Julio Mazzoleni said on Wednesday that the 48-year-old president fell unwell during a trip to the east of the country and returned to the capital Asuncion where the diagnosis was confirmed. He has been ordered to rest. ""The result of the blood test effectively confirms that the president has dengue,"" Mazzoleni said at a press conference. ""He will fulfil his agenda in Mburuvicha RogaÂ [the presidential residence]Â with some restrictions,"" he said, adding the president was in a ""good general condition."" The diagnosis underscores the potential severity of the outbreak of the disease in Paraguay, which has the second highest incidence of dengue in South American after Brazil. A severe outbreak in 2013 led to 250 deaths in the country. The World Health Organization says the incidence of dengue, which causes high fever and joint pain, has been growing rapidly in recent decades. There is no specific treatment, but early detection and care reduces risks associated with the disease. The minister said Abdo BenitezÂ must complete a rest period of at least 48 hours and will be evaluated day by day in order ""to discharge him when appropriate."" He added that the rest time could last three to seven days. Dengue is an endemic disease in Paraguay, with cases peaking in the summer months when the transmitting Aedes Aegypti mosquito proliferates. The government announced days ago that it is preparing for a strong epidemic that would peak in February. The health ministry has also confirmed that so far this year two people have died due to the disease and another 14 deaths are being investigated.

Iran does not recognize dual nationality. Many of the 176 people killed in the disaster were Iranians with dual citizenship. Canada had 57 citizens on board. ""We have informed Canada that Tehran considers dual nationals who were killed in the plane crash as Iranian citizens â€_ Iran is mourning their deaths,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Abbas Mousavi told a televised weekly news conference. MousaviÂ announced that the ""loved onesÂ who have perishedÂ were Iranian"" and that Iran did not accept their dual citizenships.Â  ""According to our laws â€_ we recognize them as Iranians. We will take measures for the victims and their families according to our own laws,"" he said.Â  In his speech, MousaviÂ alsoÂ criticized Canada for following diplomatic pressures imposed by United States, saying Iran had announced its ""readiness to have a consular section"" but the requests had been ignored by the Canadian government.Â  ""Yet they don't even allow hundreds of thousands of Iranians who are in Canada to use basic consular services â€_. And now, in this type of situation, they are worried about Iranians."" Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the federal government cut diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012. The Liberals pledged to re-engage with the country in 2015, but to date, bilateral relations have not been renewed. As protests erupted in Iran over the plane disaster, the British ambassador in Tehran was briefly detained. Officials said he was at an ""illegal"" rally, while the envoy said he was attending a vigil for victims. Britain criticized his detention. ""Iran respects all foreign diplomats in Iran as long as they do not violate international laws,"" Mousavi said. Aurel Braun, professor ofÂ international relations and political science at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, said Iran's statement was tantamount to denying the Canadian citizenship of those killed.Â  ""It complicates co-operation [with Canada] when recovering remains and investigating the crash. It just makes everything vastly more difficult,""Â Braun told CBC News.Â  Refusing to acknowledge dual citizenship was a ""matter of control,"" and a signal to those travelling the country that they are subject to the ""whims of the totality of the regime's power,"" he said.Â Â  ""It is a fear of external interference."" Foreign Affairs Minister FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne's office told CBC News thatÂ Canada has had assurance from Iran that the deceased families'Â wishes would be respected regarding where remains would go.Â  ""We continue to expect that that will be the case and have been clear with the Iranians about that expectation,"" spokespersonÂ Adam Austen said.Â  Also on Monday, UkraineÂ urged Iran to return the black boxes from the downed plane. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said returning the boxes would show that Iran was committed to an unbiased investigation. Prystaiko was speaking as an Iranian delegation led by Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami was visiting Kyiv to discuss the Jan. 8 tragedy. ""His main task is to apologize and acknowledge what happened. We hope that we can go a little further than just political discussions and discuss practical problems. Among them in particular is the return of the black boxes,"" Prystaiko told reporters. Iran said on Sunday it was trying to analyze the black boxes, denying an earlier report it would give them to Ukraine. ""At first they stated that they were handing them over, then the same person stated that they were not handing them over. This created some misunderstanding in Ukraine and we were starting to be asked: are they being handed over or not?"" The office of President Volodymyr Zelensky said Iranian experts were expected to assess Ukraine's technical ability to decode the black boxes.

This will be the last year that Calasurdo, whose eldest child attended the school as well, will be picking anybody up at St. Dorothy â€” one ofÂ three east-end schools slated to shutter in June. With the English Montreal School Board (EMSB) facingÂ declining enrolment, the closures announced Monday evening were not unexpected, butÂ Calasurdo said he was not the only one not toÂ see the writing on the wall. ""It's pretty sad,"" he said. ""It's a downer for everybody. All the parents are down. All the kids are down."" He describedÂ St. Dorothy as aÂ centre point for the English community in Saint-Michel, with students coming in from surrounding boroughs to attend. St. Dorothy's student population will be merged into Our Lady of Pompei Elementary School, located 1.2 kilometres away in Ahuntsic. Both schools are operating at less than 50 per cent capacity. Calasurdo said he's not sure if he will send his child to the Ahuntsic school forÂ Grade 5Â in the fall. ""We've never been there. It's just a different school. A different set-up. Whereas here, we've been here for years,"" he said. ""We weren't really expecting it."" ""Everybody's feeling quite emotional,"" acknowledged St. Dorothy's principal, Denis Maroun. ""We're all coming together as a school community."" ""Some of our parents' parents went to school here,"" she said. ""It's been a cornerstone of this community â€” it's been an English footprint."" She said she hopes to keep togetherÂ as many students, families and staff as possible through the merger.Â  The decision to close three east-end schools was made by former MP Marlene Jennings, the Quebec-government appointed trustee of the EMSB, who said she had no choice given the lack of English-language students signing up for school in the area. The deeds of John Paul I Junior High and General VanierÂ Elementary School areÂ beingÂ revoked along with St. Dorothy's. ""I'm actually pretty sad because I love this school and it's pretty fun,"" saidÂ Brandon, eight, a Grade 2 student atÂ St. Dorothy who took a break from his basketball game to speak toÂ reporters. ""I really love this school, and I want to stay here."" At the same time, Brandon saidÂ he's excitedÂ to go to a new school and make new friends. St. Dorothy studentsÂ will have the chance to visit their new schoolÂ to ""make sure they aren't going in cold,"" said EMSB spokesperson Mike Cohen.Â  ""We're thinking of it as less of a closure and more of a merger,"" Cohen said. ""It's a merger many St. Dorothy's students say they're excited to take part in â€” especially making new friends."" Quebec Education Minister Jean-FranÃ§ois Roberge said Jennings' decision was a tough one, but it was necessary.Â  ""Of course, some parents will be sad,"" he said, stressing the decision was made by the EMSB and not the government.Â  Jennings was appointed to take over the powers and functions of the EMSB's commissioners last fall after a scathing report found serious irregularities in how the board was run.

The focus on removing existing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft's climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones. Speaking from a stage at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., Chief Executive Satya Nadella said that corporations need to create profitable solutions for the problems of both people and planet. ""If the last decade has taught us anything, it's that technology built without these principles can do more harm than good,""Â he said. ""We must begin to offset the damaging effects of climate change,""Â he said, adding if global temperatures continue to rise unabated, ""the results will be devastating."" The announcement by the world's largest software company is the latest in a flurry of climate goals set out by firms after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change. Microsoft plans to cut its carbon emissions by more than half by 2030 across its supply chain. The plan includes the creation of a ""Climate Innovation Fund,"" which will invest $1 billion US over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology. ""When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. He added that the effort ""will require technology by 2030 that doesn't fully exist today,"" Microsoft will also expand an internal fee that it has charged to its business groups to account for their carbon emissions, Smith said. Since 2012, Microsoft assessed the fee on direct emissions, electricity use and air travel, among other activities, but will expand it to cover all Microsoft-related emissions. ""That money is used, then, for us to invest in our work to reduce our carbon emissions,""Â he said. Co-founder Bill Gates was an early backer of British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, one of a handful of companies developing direct air capture technology. Microsoft's goal to have removed enough carbon by 2050 to account for all its emissions since its founding in 1975 encompasses direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles and indirect emissions from electricity use, it said. But even as technology companies have stepped in with their own climate goal plans, they have faced criticism from their employees for doing too little. Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, last year pledged to be ""net zero carbon"" by 2040 and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a startup, after employee activists pushed the retailer to take a tougher stance on climate change. Microsoft plans to become net zero carbon a decade earlier than Amazon, although this is in part because its emissions are roughly a third less. Microsoft expects to release 16 million tonnesÂ of CO2 in 2020, including indirect emissions from activities like corporate travel. Amazon runs a bigger cloud business than Microsoft and a massive retail and logistics organization, with packaging, delivery and customer trips to its chain of Whole Foods stores all piling on to its carbon footprint. Including indirect sources, it emitted more than 44 million tonnesÂ of carbon in 2018. It was not immediately clear if the figures reported by the companies were exactly comparable. Both Microsoft and Amazon have come under fire from activist tech workers who have demanded they stop supplying technology to oil and gas companies. Microsoft in 2017 announced a multi-year deal to sell cloud services to U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp In a blog post, Microsoft on Thursday reiterated its commitment to working with oil and gas companies. ""It's imperative that we enable energy companies to transition, including to renewable energy and to the development and use of negative emission technologies like carbon capture and storage and direct air capture,"" Microsoft said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/microsoft-cabon-negative-1.5429484,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/carbon-capture-faq-1.5250140 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/data-centres-energy-consumption-1.5391269,N/A156,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-23T20:00:43.698Z,'Is that even legal?': Companies may be sharing new credit or debit card information without you knowing,"A Vancouver woman is sounding the alarm for millions of Canadians who have credit and debit cards, after information about her debit card was shared when it shouldn't have been. Vanessa AcuÃ±a blames an ""updating service"" that some credit and debit card companies have that allows new account numbers and expiry dates to be shared with merchants customers have dealt with in the past.Â  Information about the sharing of this kind of information with third party companies is often buried in the fine print of bank and credit card agreements. She thought the details of her Visa debit card â€” a debit card that can be used for online purchases â€” were secure. ""[I thought], 'How is this legal?'"" AcuÃ±a said after discovering PayPal was given the new expiry date on her Visa debit card without her knowledge. Visa â€” and other major credit cards â€” have ""updater"" programs, that automatically provide updatedÂ customer credit card information to subscribing merchants, including account numbers and expiry dates. Companies automatically opt-in their customers to the service, whether they realize it or not.Â  The program is meant to be a convenience for customers and help merchants avoid missed payments on recurring bills. ""I have huge privacy concerns â€_ I would really prefer that they tell you and give you an option to opt out of it. But that's not what they did."" The merchants who get the automatic updates pay for the service. Â  Thomas Keenan, author of TechnoCreep â€” a book about how technology is eroding privacy â€”Â says financial institutions need to ask themselves if they should be making money by sharing customers' information.Â  ""Banks make a business out of information sharing. They actually have services â€” Visa, MasterCard â€” and they are paid to share that information,"" said Keenan.Â  AcuÃ±a believes that updater service is the reason the online payment system got her card information when it shouldn't have â€” but when she tried to find out why it happened, she couldn't. AcuÃ±a thought what happened to her private information was her decision, when PayPal sent an email in March asking her to update her debit card's expiry date.Â  She says she ignored the request, since she opened the account five years ago and rarely shops online and didn't want PayPalÂ to have her new card information.Â  ""Two days afterwards, I got another email saying, 'Oh we updated for you, so you don't have to.' And I just thought 'what?'"" AcuÃ±a said. She spent hours on the phone withÂ TD Canada Trust, PayPal and Visa Canada,Â but instead of getting an explanation, she got three different answers. PayPal told AcuÃ±a it got her new expiry date from her ""financial institution or her credit card company.""Â  Visa and TD both denied giving PayPal thatÂ information. ""[They said] they don't know who gave PayPal my information, which I don't think is a very good answer,"" AcuÃ±a said. It turns out AcuÃ±a's information shouldn't have been shared at all, since only Visa credit â€”Â not debit â€”Â cards are part of the updating agreement with TD. Yet, none of the three companies involved will explain how herÂ new debit card data ended up with PayPal.Â  After initially telling Go Public it got AcuÃ±a's information from the ""account update services,"" PayPal Â backtracked a few days later, saying the account updater service ""doesn't apply"" in AcuÃ±a's case. So, how did PayPal get her new expiry date? It won't say, citing customer confidentiality â€”Â even though AcuÃ±a agreed to waive confidentiality to allow the company to answer Go Public's questions. Visa Canada and TD also won't say who gave her card's new expiry date to PayPal.Â  ""Visa does not automatically update expiry date information on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email.Â ""Please refer your questions to PayPal."" ""TD has no ability to automatically update expiry date information with merchants on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders. For more information about the service, we recommend reaching out to Visa,"" wrote Geraldine Anderson from the bank's public relations department. The lack of answers is why banks and credit card companies shouldn't be sharing anyÂ credit or debit card informationÂ without clear consent from customers, says Ann Cavoukian, who heads up the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto.Â  ""It's totally unacceptable,"" said Cavoukian, who worked as Ontario's information and privacy commissioner from 1997-2014. ""PayPal is one thing. But your own personal bank where your financial info is stored and kept? As I keep telling businesses, this is not your information. The information belongs to the individual."" She wants to see banks get what she calls ""positive informed consent"" before providingÂ a third party with a customer'sÂ information.Â  ""The banks have to step up and do this. They can't just assume you're OK with them sharing your new credit information.""Â  Cavoukian wants to see Canada's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, upgraded to match the one the European Union introduced in May. The General Data Protection Regulation is considered to have some of the world's strictest online privacy rules. For now, if customers want to stop merchants from getting updated credit card information, they have to opt out through their banks â€”Â although it's unclear if that would have helped AcuÃ±a. ""I'm capable of putting in my information online if I need to. It's not a hassle for me, so I definitely would like the option,"" AcuÃ±a said She says from now on, she'll take the time to read through all the legalese on those lengthy card agreements, and make sure she opts out of anything that allows financial institutions to share her information with third parties.Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

The number of new cases has risen sharply in China, the centreÂ of the outbreak. According to the Communist Party's Peoples Daily newspaper, there were 544 confirmed cases as of Wednesday. China discouraged public gatherings in Hubei province, where the virus emerged last month, and tightened containment measures in hospitals, while the World Health Organization (WHO) was due to hold an emergency meeting to determine whether the outbreak constituted a global health emergency. ""There has already been human-to-human transmission and infection of medical workers,"" Li said at a news conference with health experts. ""Evidence has shown that the disease has been transmitted through the respiratory tract and there is the possibility of viral mutation."" The illness comes from a newly identified type of coronavirus, a family of viruses that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-2003 and killed about 800 people. Symptoms of the virus, which can cause pneumonia, include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.Â There is no vaccine for the virus, which can be passed from person to person. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China. WATCH:Â 'Very high' probability that Canada will see coronavirus, says Toronto respirologist Hong Kong quarantined a 39-year-old man on Wednesday after the city's first preliminary positive result in a test for the new flu-like coronavirus found in an outbreak in central mainland China, authorities said. The tourist from Wuhan came to Hong Kong on Tuesday via high-speed rail from nearby Shenzhen and was detected as having fever at the border. He was in stable condition in an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, Health Minister Sophia Chan said. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's leader, said on Wednesday at theÂ World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, that the rapid flow of people across the Hong Kong border makes the city highly vulnerable to theÂ coronavirusÂ outbreak.Â  ""The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control,"" the National Health Commission vice-ministerÂ told reporters. There was evidence that the virus was being spread through ""respiratory transmission,"" Li said. And, the director-general of China's CentreÂ for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said virus was adapting and mutating, underscoring the challenges for health authorities. The Chinese government has provided updates on the number of cases in a bid to head off panic, as hundreds of millions of people prepare to travel at home and abroad for Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week. Gao said officials are working on the assumption that the outbreak resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating. Mutations can make the virus spread faster or make people sicker. Thailand authorities Wednesday confirmed four cases, a Thai national and three Chinese visitors. Japan, South Korea, the United States and Taiwan have all reported one case each. All of the illnesses were of people from Wuhan or who recently had traveled there. ""The situation is under control here,"" Thailand Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, saying there are no reports of the infection spreading to others. ""We checked all of them: taxi drivers, people who wheeled the wheelchairs for the patients, doctors and nurses who worked around them."" Macao, a former Portuguese colony that is a semi-autonomous Chinese city, reported one case Wednesday. WATCH:Â Emerging disease specialist optimistic that coronavirus can be contained Â  Travel agencies that organize trips to North Korea say the country has banned foreign tourists because of the outbreak. Most tourists to North Korea are either Chinese or travel to the country through neighbouring China. North Korea also closed its borders in 2003 during the SARS scare. Other countries have also stepped up screening measures for travellers from China, especially those arriving from Wuhan. Worries have been heightened by the coming of the Lunar New Year holiday rush. U.S. officials said they will begin screening travellers coming from Wuhan at three major airports â€” New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. While in Canada,Â Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC NewsÂ thatÂ it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the last 14 days.Â  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters that there are no reported cases of this new coronavirus in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out in the last week, Tam said.Â  ""It is important to take this seriously, and be vigilant and be prepared. But I don't think there's reason for us to panic or be overly concerned,"" Tam said. Officials said it was too early to compare the new virus with SARS or MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, in terms of how lethal it might be. They attributed the spike in new cases to improvements in detection and monitoring. Jiao Yahui, a health commission official, said ""the disease will continue to develop. It has developed different features compared with the early stage, and the prevention and precautionary measures need to change accordingly."" WATCH:Â Should Canadians be worried about the coronavirus? Dr. David Heymann, who headed WHO's global response to SARS in 2003, said the new virus appears dangerous to older people with other health conditions, but doesn't look nearly as infectious as SARS. ""It looks like it doesn't transmit through the air very easily and probably transmits through close contact,"" he said. ""That was not the case with SARS."" Health officials confirmed earlier this week that the disease can be spread between humans after finding two infected people in Guangdong province in southern China who had not been to Wuhan. Fifteen medical workers also tested positive for the virus, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has said. Fourteen of them, one doctor and 13 nurses, were infected by a patient who had been hospitalized for neurosurgery but also had the coronavirus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/new-viral-respiratory-illness-rise-sharply-in-china-1.5435736,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/as-wuhan-virus-spreads-fears-about-pandemic-readiness-1.5435286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494,N/A158,Kevin Yarr,2020-01-21T18:56:50.152Z,Why welcoming everyone is 'part of doing business' for Stratford,"For the town of Stratford, P.E.I., making people feel welcome has been part of an ongoing project for more than a decade. In 2007 the town became one of 80 in Canada, and the only one on P.E.I., to join the UNESCO-led Coalition of Inclusive Municipalities. ""It's important to signal that we welcome newcomers,"" said Mayor Steve Ogden. Signing on was timely for the community, coming just before the beginning of the biggest wave of immigration to the Island in a century. Ogden said being inclusive has become part of the process at town hall. It's not a project that is ever complete. ""We do a regular assessment of our programs and services to ensure all our offerings are diverse and inclusive, and that we make sure that all our information is accessible and easy to navigate, and that it's up to date,"" he said. It's not just about including different cultures, but also about different abilities. A hearing loop for the hearing impaired is being installed at town hall, the building â€” including change rooms for the gym in the community centre â€” is accessible, and the town hosts a weekly wheelchair basketball league.

Mohan Karki's parents,Â who don't speak English and require assistance to travel,Â were found almost 12 hours after being dropped off at aÂ service counter at the Vancouver airportÂ â€”Â just not by the airlines responsible for assisting them during their trip, WestJet and Cathay Pacific.Â  ""We wereÂ thinking they were somewhere in the corner of the airportÂ ... not knowing where to go,"" said Karki. ""My parents told me, 'We never left this place' â€_Â 12 hours they were there. They tried to communicate with some other people, passersby, and nobody responded to them. Maybe they couldn't understand what they were saying."" On Feb.Â 23, Chhaya and Narayan Karki, aged 66 and 69,Â were on the final leg of a trip from their home in Kathmandu, Nepal, to visit their son and his family in Edmonton, with a stopover in Vancouver.Â  Mohan Karki saidÂ Cathay Pacific told him it delivered his parents to the WestJetÂ customer service counter at the airport, andÂ WestJet was to transport the pair to the gate for their final flight to Edmonton.Â  When his parents failed to arrive, a worried Karki spent hours on the phone trying to track them down. They didn't have a cellphone. ""For about six or seven hours, I kept on calling both airlines, but they never found my parents,"" he said.Â  Karki then called the RCMP. It took officers 20 minutes to find the couple, located just steps from the service counter. The coupleÂ hadÂ placards with Karki's name and phone number, in case of an emergency. No one responded when they tried to get help by holding them up, he said. According to an Ontario-based advocate for people with disabilities,Â services for those who need assistance travelling are ""unreliable and inconsistent"" because airlines are allowed to set their own rules â€” instead of being told to meet specific standards. ""It is appalling treatment â€_ the regulator should make it clear that [airlines] can't pass the buck to each other,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. Thanh Phan shares that frustration;Â the same thing happened to his 76-year-old mother at the same airport. In August, Niem Thi Le,Â who has trouble walking and doesn't speak English,Â was left in a wheelchair for eight hours after being dropped off at the wrong departure gate by WestJet. Le was on her way home to Hanoi, Vietnam, after visiting family in Victoria.Â WestJet was supposed to connect her with China Southern Airlines for her next flight. ""My mom told me that the wheelchair attendant just left her there without talking to anyone.â€_ I was shocked â€_ this is a human being,"" PhanÂ said. An employee with another airline eventually noticed Le sitting alone, found someone who could speak VietnameseÂ and brought the woman to the China Southern Airlines counter. That airline contacted Phan and suggested he call WestJet to find out what happened. He did, asking if someone could help his mother until he could get there himself. ""I said, 'Could you please help her give her some food and drinks.'... They said, no, they didn't do anything wrong and that's not their business,"" Phan said. He called China Southern Airlines back and it agreed to help, bringing Le a hamburger and a drink. Phan complained to customer service and WestJet apologized, saying it would review its internal process. But he said the airline never got back to him to explainÂ what happened. WestJet also told him travellers who don't speak English shouldn't be travelling alone, he said, though they offered him a $100 travel voucher. ""It's very frustrating because they blame passengers, and they did not think that is a serious problem."" Both Phan and Karki are still demanding an explanation from the airlines involved in their respective cases.Â  ""We sincerely apologize for the stress and worry that these guests and their families experienced,"" WestJet's media relations managerÂ Lauren Stewart wrote in an email to Go Public. ""The nature of these incidents is serious, and we are in touch with both airline partners involved to investigate and make enhancements to our processes to prevent this type of incident from happening again. We are also reaching out to the families involved.""Â  The airline says it provides mobility assistance to more than 900 guests per day. Cathay Pacific told Go Public it wasÂ sorry to hear what happened to the Karkis, adding it followed ""standard operating procedure"" when it delivered the couple to WestJet staff and exchanged wheelchairs. ""The proper turnover to WestJet was made by our staff. Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing this situation with WestJet and we will apply learnings from this experience to future transitions between our airlines,"" wrote Julie Jarratt, the airline's communications director. Lepofsky, who is blind, saidÂ he's had his own problems travelling. ""I dread entering Canadian airspace if I'm travelling aloneÂ â€_Â not because the service is always bad, but because it's not reliably and consistently good."" Airlines have a duty to accommodate passengers with disabilities under Canada's human rights laws, he said. ButÂ when that doesn't happen, it's tough to figure out where to turn for help. ""There are multiple agencies involved,""Â Lepofsky said.Â ""The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Transportation Agency â€” and you could be kicked from one to the other, trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. ""The Canadian Transportation Agency, where you're often kicked to, does not, from the perspective of people with disabilities, have a good track record in this area."" The CTAÂ says it's aware some of the standards are out of date and a binding set of rules is needed. Until now, accessible transportation has been governed by mostly voluntary codes of practice.Â  The agencyÂ hasÂ proposedÂ new accessible transportation regulations for airlines and all travel providers.Â The new rules would be legally binding and impose penaltiesÂ up to $25,000Â for non-compliance.Â And if another proposed law passes, the Accessible Canada Act, that fine could jump to a maximum of $250,000. ""They need to make sure that passengers don't fall between the cracks,"" said Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency. Under the CTA'sÂ proposed rules, airlines would have to provide people who need assistance a place to wait, near personnel who can assist them and will ""periodically inquire"" about the person's needs. Airports would be responsible for providing assistance from curbside to check-in, whileÂ the airlines would be responsible from check-in to boarding.Â  StreinerÂ said theÂ proposed recommendations would have helped in both cases. The agency plans to have the final regulations published beforeÂ summer and hopes to have the majority ofÂ requirements in placeÂ in about a year. ""Persons who require wheelchair assistance, including older Canadians, absolutely are covered by these regulations,"" Streiner said.Â ""We want to make sure that there's no confusion about who's providing assistance and that people aren't left without assistance."" As for Karki, he saidÂ that the next time his parents visit, he won't leave them in the hands of the airlines.Â Instead, he'll try to match their itinerary with other Nepali-speaking travellers. After hearing from Go Public, WestJet called Karki last week, promising an explanation once it looks into what went wrong. Phan saidÂ WestJet has yet to follow up with him, adding that his mother is now afraid to travel and will no longer come visit.Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment onÂ CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Public transit in the region saw a four per cent increase in ridership, meaning there were 417,000 new people using the system between 2013 and 2018, the report says. Riders between the ages of 20 and 44 are more likely to use public transit: while the age bracket only represents 35 per cent of the population of greater Montreal, they represent 52 per cent of all public transit users. ""Before, young people took public transportation to go to school, then as soon as they entered the job market, they bought a car â€” what we are seeing now is that they remain in public transit,"" said BenoÃ®t Gendron, the general director of the transport authority, known as the ARTM. Car travel is down by one per cent, which means 15,000 fewer cars were on the road during morning rush hour in 2018Â compared to 2013. Gendron said there is still a long way to go: 70 per cent of rush hour trips are still made exclusively by car. The numbers are especially stark forÂ the North and South Shores of Montreal. According to the report, in 2018 only 10Â per cent of people on the South Shore take public transit for their morning commute. The number is worst for the suburbs north of Montreal (excluding Laval), where only nine per cent take transit. That's virtually unchanged compared to 2013, when nine per cent took public transit in both. Even fewer are taking transit into Montreal itself â€”Â only one per cent in the South ShoreÂ and three per cent north of the island. ""We need to provide them with good, reliable services that are easy to use,"" said Daniel Bergeron, the chief planning officer with the ARTM. He said that moving people between suburbsÂ â€” and not just to downtown MontrealÂ â€”Â would encourage more people to use transit. Bergeron said the ARTM also wants to simplify the fare system by having a single fare structure for the entirety of the greater Montreal region. But Gendron is optimistic that future projects will continue to encourage people to use public transit, citing the RÃ©seau express mÃ©tropolitain (REM) light rail project, with stations in the West Island and South Shore. ""As soon as we increase capacity on existing systems [such as the train or the metro], we quickly reach rider capacity,"" Gendron said.Â  He said that when the Azur trains arrived in the Montreal Metro system, the network was able toÂ increaseÂ its capacity byÂ 10 to 15 per cent. Gendron said he has been collaborating with theÂ Montreal Metropolitan Community (CMM), the organization that oversees Montreal-area municipalities, to tackle urban sprawl and put in place more public transit. The CMMâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹Â wants 35 per cent of morning rush hourÂ commutes to be on public transit by 2031.Â  Gendron said it was an ambitious target, but attainable as long as different levels of government commit to financing the system. ""It will be a challenge in itself,"" he said.

Federal regulators have ordered the owners of all pipelines in Canada to post guarantees there is money available in case of a leak or other incident. ""What it really means is that in Canada, polluters pay,"" said Sarah Kiley, a spokesperson for Canada Energy Regulator, theÂ agency that has succeeded the National Energy Board. Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline â€” known as the MN&P line â€” has been assessed the maximum for a natural gas pipeline, based on the diameter of the pipe and the pressure it operates under. It means that if something were to go wrong, regardless of who is responsible,Â MN&P would be required to pay up to $200 million to cover costs and damages, Kiley said. ""If they are found to be at fault, there is no limit to the cost that they would have to pay,"" she said Monday night in an interview from Calgary. The owners of large oil pipelines have been assessed a maximum of $1 billion because a leak would cost moreÂ to clean up and compensate people who were impacted, KileyÂ said. Maritimes and Northeast has proposed to cover its obligation with $100 million in insurance and the remainder in credit guarantees from the pipeline owners, based on their stake in the pipeline. This month,Â EnbridgeÂ Inc.Â pledged $78 million, Halifax-based EmeraÂ Inc. $12.79 million and ExxonMobil $9.5 million. ""It's another level of assurance that we provide,"" said Steve Rankin of Maritimes and Northeast. Kiley said theÂ Canada Energy Regulator is currently assessing the financial plan to ensure it meets federal requirements. The 1,100-kilometre pipeline was built in the late 1990s to carry natural gas from fields near Sable Island off Nova Scotia to markets in New England. It travels across Nova Scotia and across southern New Brunswick before crossing the U.S.Â Â border near St. Stephen, N.B. These days the MN&P line only carries natural gas into the region.

The girl used a low-level of force to push one of the boys, RCMPÂ said in a statement. Police say the boy is alleged to have responded with anÂ inappropriate level of force, injuring the girl. The boy was arrested atÂ the scene. He is accused of assault causing bodily harm and uttering threats. The boy does not have a history with the police and was released on conditions, according to the police statement.Â He will appear in court at a later date.

That investigation is being guided by a special prosecutor from Ontario.Â  The Calgary-based Callaway ran his campaign in collaboration with that of the race's eventual winner, Jason Kenney, now the premier, in order to attack the latter's main rival, former WildroseÂ PartyÂ leader Brian Jean, before dropping out of the race and endorsing Kenney. Both men deny the allegations, but CBC News has obtained emails and documents that outline the collaboration, including a resignation speech emailed to Callaway's team from Kenney's then-deputy chief of staffÂ and current director of issues management, Matt Wolf. Numerous Callaway donors have been visited by RCMP officers, who askedÂ about their contributions andÂ took the receipts, CBC News has confirmed.Â  ""They just seemed interested in whether I thought my contribution was honest, and I said yes,"" said Lee Eddy of Innisfail, a community north of Calgary, who was visited by the RCMP in December. Lee said he donated $500 believing the campaign was real,Â and doesn't regret it because heÂ did not want Jean to win. ""There's some people that run in an election just so they can voice their concerns, they have no hope of winning,"" said Eddy.Â  ""That's what I felt Jeff was doing. I didn't think he was going to win, but he was going to be able to stand up for our rights in the debates and stuff."" The allegations against the campaign appear to fit the definition of fraud â€”Â misrepresentation for a benefit â€”Â says criminal defence lawyer AndrÃ© Ouellette; adding whether the donors feel they were defrauded doesn't alter that fact.Â  But they might not feel like co-operating with prosecutors, he said.Â  ""Potential witnesses who do not feel victimizedÂ or do not feel defrauded may not be inclined to co-operate with the prosecution and may not be inclined to testify against Mr. Callaway,"" he said.Â Â  ""So, in that sense, it may make [the case]Â more difficult.""Â  Duane Bratt, a political scientist at Calgary's Mount Royal University, says the investigation won't have a big impact unlessÂ charges are laid. But the allegations are an important issue.Â  ""We're talking about deliberate fraud â€” allegations of deliberate fraud, of criminal activityÂ â€”Â involving people tied to the current government,"" said Bratt. The Callaway campaign has been under investigation by Alberta's election commissioner and the RCMP for irregular donations funnelled from a corporation into the campaign through fake donors.Â  The election commissioner has handed down $176,223 in fines against 11 individuals and two corporations. Documents outlining the findings of the commissioner say the campaign was largely funded through two corporations controlled by Calgary businessman Robyn Lore. Lore's lawyer said theyÂ have appealed those findings and penalties.Â Others, including Callaway,Â are also appealing.Â  Officials are still investigating, but in November the provincial government shuttered the office of the election commissioner and shifted its duties to Elections Alberta.Â  The move provoked widespread condemnation, but the government insisted any investigations would continue.Â  Elections Alberta says it has retained the investigators looking into the UCP leadership race and that staff continue to work out of their old office space for the time being.Â  ""How and when to move forward with the commissioner of elections position,"" will be determined after an evaluation into workload and time commitment is completed, according to deputy chief electoral officer Drew Westwater.Â Â  The role is currently being filled by the head of Elections Alberta, Glen Resler, whose job is up for review on April 16. The RCMPÂ is also investigatingÂ allegations of voter fraud in the UCP leadership race. CBC News has previously revealed fraudulent emails were used to cast ballots in that contest and has spoken to a volunteer who alleged he phonedÂ UCP members in order to get their PINs and then passed them to other volunteers in order to vote for Kenney.Â  â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹At least five cabinet ministers, three UCP MLAs and ConservativeÂ MP Tim UppalÂ have been questioned as part of that investigation.Â  The party insists the vote was clean.Â  The UCP declined to comment on theÂ RCMP investigation into potential fraudÂ tied to the Callaway campaign.Â  ""The UCP is not a party to this matter,"" said director of communications Evan Menzies in an email.Â  ""Any questions with respect to Mr. Callaway's leadership campaign, and the donations to that campaign, are best directed to Mr. Callaway.""

""No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director, in a statement Monday. The IEA is an independent non-governmental organization that advises countries and industry on sustainable energy. The world is demanding energy services and emissions reductions at the same time, the report says. Social pressures on the industry are rising, it notes, highlighting growing opposition to new infrastructure projects in certain areas and fracking bans. ""Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option."" Some companies have taken steps to address climate change, but the report saysÂ the industry as a whole could do more. The diverse industry requires a variety of approaches basedÂ on theÂ particularÂ circumstances of individual companies, according to the report, which was produced in co-operation with the World Economic Forum and will be presented at the organization's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. The ""immediate task"" for the industry is to reduce its operational environmental footprint, Birol said. Approximately 15 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers, the report says. ""A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,"" said Birol. The most important and cost-effective measure would be to reduce methane leaks to the atmosphere, the report says. Other measures include integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments. The report argues the industry and its resources and skills ""will be critical"" in helping some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies, like low-carbon hydrogen and biofuels, reach maturity. It says that scaling up such technologies and lowering their cost requires qualities the industry has, such as large-scale engineering and project management capabilities. ""Without the industry's input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions,"" Birol said. On average, oil and gas companies invest about one per cent of their total capital spending in non-core areas â€” with the greatest amount in solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind. Leading companies spend about five per cent, according to the report, which says ""a much more significant change"" in capital spending allocation is needed to accelerate energy transitions. The energy sector can transform without the help of the oil and gas industry, the report reads, but that is a more difficult and expensive path. ""Regardless of which pathway the world follows, climate impacts will become more visible and severe over the coming years, increasing the pressure on all elements of society to find solutions. These solutions cannot be found within today's oil and gas paradigm.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greener-heating-1.5429709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A166,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-07T22:08:05.248Z,Medical device used during labour falls out of patient 10 weeks later,"As Laura Jokinen made her way home from a walk with her newborn son in October 2018, the shooting pain she'd been experiencing in her abdomen for weeks became unbearable. She limped home and buckled to the floor, screaming for her husband to help. ""It was at that point I reached down and felt a metal device protruding out of my vagina,"" said Jokinen, who works in health care as a risks assessment researcher. ""I freaked out â€_ I didn't know what the device was or where it came from. It looked almost like a battery, and there were wires that were running up inside me. I was afraid to remove it, because I wasn't sure if it was attached to my insides."" The experience points to alarming statistics. Canada saw a major jump â€” 14 per cent over the last five years â€” in the number of medical items left inside patients after procedures, according to a study released ThursdayÂ byÂ the Canadian Institute for Health InformationÂ (CIHI), a not-for-profit group that collects data on the quality of health care in the country.Â  CIHIÂ said 553 such objects were left inside patients over the last two years.Â  Canada has the highest rate among developed countries of medical items being left inside patients, according to a separate study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That means medical teamsÂ across the country need to do a better job of following existing safety procedures, according toÂ Sandi Kossey, senior director of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), a not-for-profit healthcare watchdog. ""There are checks and balances that should happen,"" said Kossey. ""There are enough preventative measures that should be in place, that these things should not happen."" Jokinen, who lives in Parksville, B.C., had to have an emergency caesarean sectionÂ on Aug.Â 11, 2018, at the Nanaimo General Hospital. Before surgery, the medical team attached an electrode to the baby's head while he was still in the womb to monitor his heartbeat. Part of the monitor was removed during the C-section. But the medical team forgot to take out the rest.Â  Two weeks after Jokinen was discharged, she started having complications: an infection of her surgical incision and heavy, prolonged vaginal bleeding. Her doctors prescribed antibiotics but didn't detect what had been left inside her. ItÂ remained there for 10 weeks until it dislodged. JokinenÂ tried to find out, through the regional health authority, what the monitor was made of and how the mistake might have affected her healthÂ and that of her baby. ""At that point, he was two months old and I was breastfeeding, so I was really concerned about what risks this posed to his health,"" Jokinen said. Jokinen says she was on pins and needles for more than a month waiting to hear back. The response she finally got, she says, was less than helpful. The Vancouver Island Health AuthorityÂ told her even the manufacturer couldn't say what the effect might be since the device was only designed and tested for use over periods of 24 hours or less. It said it looked at devices made of similar materials and didn't believe there were any long-term risks to Jokinen or her baby from the breakdown of the components.Â  Jokinen says she wanted the health authority to take responsibility, but it refused, saying the failure was by the surgeon who is an independent contractor and not an employee.Â  ""Physicians in B.C. are independent contractors who are licensed and regulated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C.,"" the authority said in an email to Go Public.Â  Jokinen said she was surprised byÂ  the health authority's reaction. ""They're responsible for their subcontractor's actions and â€_ providing safeguards to make sure that people aren't harmed."" Kossey, at theÂ CPSI, agrees.Â ""Certainly, they are responsible for what happens under their watch and within their facility,"" she said.Â  JokinenÂ chose not to pursue action against the surgeon. Go Public reached out to HealthCareCAN, an organization that represents hospitals across Canada, for comment but did not immediately hear back.Â  According to the most recent report on the quality of healthcare in OECDÂ countries, a foreign bodyÂ â€” sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. â€” is left inside a patientÂ in Canada 9.8 times out of every 100,000 surgeries. That's three times the average. The next-highest OECD results wereÂ Sweden at 8.3Â followed by Netherlands with 4.6 per 100,000. ""The data shows that we're not doing as good as we should be as a developed country,"" KosseyÂ told Go Public.Â  But she also suggests the reason Canada appears to have more mistakes could be in the accuracy of the reporting itself. ""Some of the other countries â€_ being compared against may have different cultures around how they're collecting and using that information â€_ it's a bit of a mixed signal,"" she said.Â  Kossey says medical teams need to ensure they do an appropriate inventory of equipment used during all procedures and to communicate clearly with the patient and family membersÂ â€” even in the most chaotic situations â€” what's being done so there are no surprises. Jokinen was surprised to hear how often something goes wrong. ""That points at a systemicÂ flaw in our healthcare system,"" she said. ""In order to address that, we need to first acknowledge that it's happening. The health authorities need to take responsibility for the actions of their subcontractors and they also have to come up with a mitigation plan to avoid these types of events,"" she said.Â  The Vancouver Island Health Authority toldÂ Jokinen it has made changes.Â Non-surgical devicesÂ like the monitor that was left insideÂ herÂ were added to a checklist of items that need to be retrieved after medical procedures. ""We deeply regret that this patient had a poor care experience and we sincerely apologize to her,"" a spokesperson wrote in its email to Go Public.

The committee held its first meeting Monday, largely a planning session, and MPs from all parties agreed it was essential to hear from Barton, despite some minor differences of opinion on the timing. Eventually, they agreed he would testify before Feb. 7. Conservatives are pushing for an earlier appearance because Barton will be in Houston next Tuesday. Barton was a high-powered business consultant who was named in September to Canada's top diplomatic post in Beijing to help repair Canada's shredded diplomatic and economic relations with China. Opposition parties have flexed their collective muscles to push for answers from the new Liberal minority government as the Chinese imprisonment of two Canadians by the People's Republic enters its second year. The committee is the result of a Conservative motion passed in December that was supported by opposition parties in the minority Parliament. Conservative deputy leader Leona Alleslev said Barton told her in an email that he is ""ready and willing"" to testify. She said it was important that he testify first because he could help the committee understand the government's strategy towards China. ""It's such a critical witness,"" she told the committee. Alleslev said Barton could help the committee understand ""what the lay of the land is from Canada's man on the ground, as they say."" Liberal MP Rob Oliphant, the parliamentary secretary to the minister of foreign affairs, said government MPs on the committee realize the importance of Barton testifying, but he initially suggested that a briefing from officials at Global Affairs Canada would better set the table for MPs. ""We will operate in good faith,"" he told reporters before the meeting. ""We have Canadian lives at stake, and we're going to take that very seriously."" Thirteen months ago, China detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, who remain imprisoned without access to lawyers or their families. The move has been widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at the behest of the United States, which wants to extradite her on fraud charges related to U.S. sanctions against Iran. The motion that created the committee authorized it to order Barton, as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to appear as witnesses ""from time to time as the committee sees fit."" Conservative foreign affairs critic Erin O'Toole said in December the committee will work to address Canada's current diplomatic dispute with China and help develop a specialized approach to easing the bilateral challenges between the two nations. The all-party Canada-China relations committee convened Monday afternoon to deal mainly with a series of procedural issues, and the subject of Barton's testimony took up a good portion of the discussion. The meeting coincided with start of Meng's extradition hearing in Vancouver. Earlier Monday, China's foreign ministry reiterated its call for Canada to release Meng. ""The U.S. and Canada abused their bilateral extradition treaty and arbitrarily took compulsory measures against a Chinese citizen without cause,"" said spokesman Geng Shuang, according to translated remarks on his ministry's website. ""This is entirely a serious political incident that grossly violates the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen."" Meng is free on bail and living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Monday that the well-being and release of Kovrig and Spavor is a ""clear priority"" for the Liberal government. ""That is at the heart of all the work we are doing and rightly so,"" she said in Winnipeg, where she was attending the Liberal cabinet retreat. Freeland also defended the Liberal government's handling of the Meng case. ""Our government has been clear that we are a rule of law country and that we honour our extradition treaty commitments,"" she said.

""I came out of that curve, and gee, it was a vehicle on fire,"" he recalled. ""You know, you look twice â€” what do I see? Yeah, it is a vehicle on fire!"" The long-distance truck driver from Whitehorse was the first to find them â€” three men whose pickup truck went off the road the night before, leaving them stranded inÂ â€“50Â C weather. They had set it on fireÂ to keep from freezing to death. As he approached, LafondÂ only saw the flaming wreck. ""If there's no vehicle around, like another vehicle around, that means nobody came to help. Where is the driver? Or the people? And I was kind of freaking out a bit,"" Lafond said. Then he spotted them, on the other side of the flames. ""They started waving their hands ... 'OK, alive,' I thought."" The three were alive, but in deep distress. By the time LafondÂ rolled up, they had been waiting for hours and were dangerouslyÂ chilled. They scrambled to get into Lafond's warm truck,Â but it was a struggle.Â  ""They were moving like robots, really."" Lafond said. By that time, another truck hadÂ pulled up behind Lafond and took one of the three stranded travellers in. Then they left the burning wreck behind and headed up the road to Pelly Crossing. Lafond offered them some fresh coffee, but one of the men immediately spilled his cup because his hands were too cold to hold it. As they drove, Lafond heard more about their ordeal.Â  ""They were telling me some parts, and my foot was going down on that fuel pedal,Â instinctively. I thought, man, I have to get those guys in the heat, fast."" The men told him they had tried to get wood for a fire, but there was too much snow in the bush. One of them had alsoÂ started out walking to get help, but soon decided that was a bad idea. Early the next morning, they told Lafond, they were in serious trouble. No cars had passed. One of the men said he had started to feel warm and unzipped his coat â€” a sign that confusion was setting in. ""So he told the two other guys, 'This is it, we're in the life-and-death scenario right now, so we have to do something fast, because in five minutes, well, we won'tÂ be able to take any decision,'"" Lafond said. ""They had a quick meeting and finally the guy who owned the truck agreed,Â and they set it on fire."" Lafond thinks they did the right thing. He says it's easy for other people to judge, but they weren't there. ""You're in the heat of your house, you think about all the possibility, what you could have done, and this and that, and it's easy to think â€”Â it's like the 'hockey pro' at the tavern,"" he said. RCMP said last week that two of the people were being treated for injuries due to exposure to the cold, but there's no word on their condition. LafondÂ says stopping to help was a no-brainer for him. Working as a truck driver in the North means you don't take life for granted, he says. ""We've got to help each other on the road up here.

An outpouring of love will help it heal  ,"I was standing on the second floor at the Saville Centre, watching the team of volunteers prepare the stage about three hours before Sunday's memorial.Â  Baskets of flowers were being moved around and large framed pictures of the victims of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 were being placed in front of the podium.Â  Even from that distance, I could see the faces of the victims. It was as if they were watching the volunteers work.Â  Nasim Rahmanifar's picture, with her beautiful smile; I could imagine so vividly how she would be one of the people helping, if her face was not stuck in that frame forever.Â  Â How could a smile that beautiful be trapped forever inside a wooden frame? The picture of Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two little girls fit so effortlessly among the flowers. My goodness, if Dorina or Daria were not gone, they would have been too young to attend this memorial! That is a piece of reality I don't have the strength to focus on. A few feet away, in yet another wooden frame, Dr. Shekoufeh Choupannejad and her two daughters Sara and Saba Saadat were standing side by side. On the far left side, Elnaz Nabiyi's photo somehow looked like the only one who was watching me as I looked at them from above. I cried in silence all through Sunday: getting ready as the emcee, in between the speeches, listening to the tributes, walking up and down from the podium. I cried as I watched people coming in, as I hugged friends and families, as I looked at the non-Iranian crowd who showed up to pay their respects even though they likely didn't know anyone.Â  A green room was assigned to the speakers and dignitaries; again, I cried as soon as I stepped into the room.Â  Going in, I wondered if my professor from back when I was a student would remember me.Â  Dr. Joseph Doucet, now dean of the school of business, saw me and came forward. Before I knew it, I was crying in his arms. It was as if I had graduated a week ago. It's amazing how 12 years can feel like a week and a week can feel like months. Sunday's memorial was a beautiful event.Â  And I'm not thinking that just because everything went well. The presence of people is what touched many grieving hearts.Â  With a loss this big, there is no relief. Nothing can help but time. And time doesn't always move like a river, especially not now.Â  Looking down at the main floor, watching the crowd come in, I thought to myself, ""I wish I could tell you, one by one, how much it means to see you here."" Going down the stairs for sound check, I passed by the media in the room. A CBC camera tech waved at me; I went down the stairs in tears.Â  How supportive everyone has been, every reporter, news anchor, radio host, freelance writer that I met after this tragic event. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did all these people become my friends? And friend is an understatement. What is the word for a person that you just met, who looks you in the eyes and makes you believe that you are not alone? I looked at the people,Â Iranian and non-Iranian, sitting side by side. It looked like a freshly knitted scarf, meshed like one piece. I thought, did we always feel so connected, so much like we belong?Â  When I went behind the podium to start, I felt a little tremble inside. I could see the first words that came out of my mouth, floating like snowflakes, dancing so calmly.Â  I looked at the crowd and at my words floating in front of me, and all of a sudden I felt so strong.Â  These are my people, all of them, Iranian or not. I knew that in my heart.Â  As O Canada was being sung, speaking in front of them didn't seem so hard. I only found out on Monday how many of my friends and co-workers had either attended, or watched,Â the memorial. Now, a week after the crash, our hearts like broken ceramics, we know it's time for us to speak up.Â  To glue ourselves back together, one piece at a time, with resilience and all this shared loveÂ â€”Â likeÂ kintsugi, the elegant ancient Japanese art of mending pottery.Â  The Iranian community has formed a new bond with Canada. This tragedy did break us apartÂ but the love and support we received glued us back together, even stronger now. And like kintsugi, we will slowly heal, and with every day that goes by, we will become closer to our hosting country.Â  Not ashamed of our scars, we understand that our wounds are what makes us, us. It was â€“35 C on Sunday, and I believe I speak for every Iranian in Edmonton when I say we had never felt so warm. This column is an opinion.

The follow-up to 2018's KamikazeÂ â€”Â also released without warning â€”Â was announced on Twitter just after midnight.Â  The Detroit rapper also released a new music video for Darkness, one of the 20 tracks on the album, that depicts a shooting at a concert. The lyrics and storyline of the video specifically allude to the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival that left 58 people dead, making it the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The video closes with audio and video footage of news broadcasts from other recent mass shooting around the U.S. as well as an appeal for viewers to register to vote and ""help change gun laws in America."" Warning: The following video contains graphic scenes of violence and strong language ""When will this end? When enough people care,"" reads the text. A link to the music video on Eminem's website encourages viewers to contact or visit several gun violence prevention organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Sandy Hook Promise. The album's cover art features blood spatter and a bearded Eminem clad in a suit and fedora and holding a shovel. An alternate cover features the same splatter as well as a hatless Eminem holding both a hatchet and a gun to his head in an homage to Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 album of the same name.Â  ""Inspired by the master, Uncle Alfred!"" Eminem posted via Twitter. Another track from the album,Â Unaccommodating, has sparked outrage for also touching on a recent tragedy. In a line from the song, the rapper references the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb attack, which killed 22 people outside a concert by American singer Ariana Grande. eminem stans are really trying to defend his joke about a terrorist attack that killed 22 people and gave ariana PTSD...literally bye If yâ€™all are hyping up eminem after his line â€œiâ€™m contemplating yelling bombs away on the game like iâ€™m outside an ariana grande concertâ€ù please unfollow me thatâ€™s disgusting Some listenersÂ labelled the line ""sick"" or ""disgusting.""

When the RCMP first investigated the death of Preston Lochead at his home in Airdrie, Alta., in 2010, they called in the major crimes unit. The body of Lochead, 36, was found in the basement of his home, next to an overturned table. His roommate told police he saw a man scurrying from the house after the discovery of the body. Police suspected foul play, began interviewing witnesses and brought that man in for questioning. But then came the autopsy. Calgary medical examiner Dr. Evan Matshes told the RCMP that contrary to what they might have thought, Lochead died from cardiac disease. And with no homicide, there was no crime to investigate. The RCMP broke the news to Lochead's widow, Sally Wheeler. ""I was like, 'You've got to be kidding.' I was so shocked that this is what [the RCMP] was telling me,"" she said in a recent interview with The Fifth Estate's Mark Kelley. Lochead's death is one of several cases that came under scrutiny in 2012. Alberta's Justice Ministry ordered a review of some of the autopsies done by a Calgary medical examiner after questions were raised about the accuracy of his findings. Documents obtained by The Fifth Estate reveal that Alberta Justice commissioned that review, which exposed several potential miscarriages of justice. Wheeler said the RCMP told her a few months after her husband died that the autopsy prevented them from laying charges. ""They mentioned that he had a blow to the head and a broken bone in his neck,"" she said. ""But they couldn't take it any further because it hadn't been ruled a homicide and I was like, 'What?'"" Turns out Wheeler wasn't the only one to question the autopsy results. Documents obtained recently by The Fifth Estate show that a second medical opinion from three expert forensic pathologists â€”Â written two years after Lochead died â€”Â differed from the original medical examiner's finding. They wrote that Lochead's death was more likely a homicide by ""strangulation."" Senior officials in the Alberta Justice Ministry received that report as part of a larger review of Matshes's autopsies, but the findings were buried in court files for several years until unearthed by The Fifth Estate. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Wheeler and roommate Jimmy Dean, who were both in the house the night of the death, say it was obvious to them from the beginning that Lochead was killed. The evening started with Lochead acting as a Good Samaritan. He had gone out to pick up refreshments for an evening poker game and came back with two strangers he met at the store. The strangers claimed their vehicle had broken down at the side of the road. Lochead, a friendly Maritimer and father of three whom Wheeler described as her ""angel,"" wanted to make sure the stranded travellers would not freeze in the frigid November night. Wheeler remembers the two men as Americans who spoke Russian. One of the men appears to have stayed late. Dean went to bed early and woke up just before 7 a.m. to discover the body. He said when he was on the phone to 911, he heard movement in another room. ""That's when I seen this fellow standing in the hallway,"" Dean told The Fifth Estate. ""I told him to stay and he opened the door and took off."" Dean and Wheeler said police later told them that the stranger from the hallway was hiding in an unlocked car down the road. The American was taken in for questioning and treated for injuries he claimed were sustained in a fight with Lochead. Dean said the RCMP told him some of what the American said in the police interrogation. Â  According to the suspect, a struggle began after Lochead began to have concerns about who the visitor really was. ""That's how the fight started because the guy didn't want to give Preston his ID,"" Dean said. Soon after the death, local news reports indicated that the RCMP were already getting signals from the medical examiner that it might not be ruled a homicide. ""Police are still awaiting Monday's autopsy results to determine if the struggle contributed to Lochead's death or if he died from natural causes afterward,"" the Calgary Herald reported. According to Wheeler, the RCMP told her the American was eventually allowed to return to the United States. Wheeler said the RCMP told her: ""We're keeping an eye on him and we're in touch with the police down there."" But months later, Wheeler said, the RCMP told her that the finalized autopsy report meant they could not lay charges. A later review of 14 of Matshes's medical files would include Lochead's autopsy. That review, commissioned by Alberta's Justice Ministry, stated that the medical examiner made unreasonable conclusions in 13 cases.Â  Airdrie RCMP told The Fifth Estate recently that Alberta Justice did not provideÂ them with the 2012 report pointing to the death as a homicide. A major crimes investigator at the RCMP was assigned to check their old case file and did not find the report. ""There is no communication from Alberta Justice on this investigation,"" Airdrie RCMP spokesperson Cpl. Laurel Scott said in a recent email. In their peer review report to Alberta Justice, the expert medical pathologists wrote that more ""weight"" should have been given to ""strangulation"" as the cause of Lochead's death. ""A homicide manner [of death] is more appropriate,"" the three pathologists wrote in their November 2012 critique of Matshes's original autopsy. Wheeler is still confused about why nothing happened next. ""There was a fight, he's dead. It was so clear to me,"" Wheeler said. ""Why didn't they reopen the case?"" Eric Tolppanen, now head of Alberta Crown Prosecution Service and then a senior justice official, declined an interview with The Fifth Estate. In a statement, he did not answer directly whether the expert review panel document was provided to the RCMP in Airdrie. Tolppanen said that the RCMP were told that ""this police file would benefit from additional peer review."" He said that the RCMP acted on that advice and later ""sent the file to the Crown for review for possible charges."" Tolppanen said that Crown prosecutors determined there was ""no reasonable likelihood of conviction."" However, the RCMP appear to dispute that version of events.Â  The RCMP agree that in 2015 they discussed the case with the Crown prosecutor who did not support laying charges. However, the Mounties say they were not told about the expert peer review panel finding of a possible homicide. ""The RCMP is not aware of a formal review that was done on the [medical examiner's] autopsy report,"" Scott said in her email to The Fifth Estate. Wheeler points the finger directly at Alberta Justice for not acting more quickly back in 2012 when they learned the death may have been a homicide. ""Why did nothing happen?"" she said. ""Why did it just stop there? So they determine he was killed, but then say 'Oh, I guess that doesn't matter?' That's not right."" Wheeler is calling on Alberta Justice to provide the documents to the RCMP so that they can reopen their investigation. ""Why wasn't that guy brought back to Canada to face charges?"" she said. Matshes declined repeated requests for an interview with The Fifth Estate. In statements to the CBC, he said he stands by his work. In 2013, Alberta Justice agreed to set aside the report of the expert panel at his request. Matshes successfully argued he was not adequately consulted in the process and that the review was based on limited information. A judge signed off on that agreement in November 2013. In a brief to the Court of Queen's Bench in Alberta, the justice minister said it was ""integral to the administration of justice"" that they continue to investigate the accuracy of Matshes's work and promised to hold a second review panel. In a recent statement, Matshes said he was also cleared by an expert pathologist working for the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons in a related investigation. ""That expert reviewer, who was in possession of all of the evidence that I had at the time I certified the deaths, concluded that I met the standard of care in each case,"" he wrote. The Fifth Estate has also obtained records from that college review. A complaint was made to the college in 2012 about the appropriateness of Matshes's dissections during some autopsies. The college ruled that Matshes was permitted to make those dissections. The college forensic pathologist also concluded that homicide was a likely scenario in Lochead's death. The college expert, whose name was redacted in the report acquired by The Fifth Estate, stated that although cardiac disease may have been a factor in the death, the ruling should have been ""homicide,"" as the violent struggle precipitated any existing physical condition. ""If one determines that the cause of death was cardiac precipitated by the physical altercation, the manner becomes homicide,"" the college expert wrote. The college's forensic pathologist also noted ""evidence of blunt force injury"" and ""neck compression."" The college expert also contemplated the possibility of charges against the killer and noted that careful documentation of the injuries would be essential as the accused might try to argue self-defence. ""If charges were considered, a potential defence in this case would be self-defence. In such a case, documentation of all injuries to the deceased is essential,"" the college review wrote. Today, Wheeler wants Alberta Justice held accountable. ""I want somebody to apologize to his family and to me and for all the people that cared about him,"" she said. ""They just looked at this information and decided it wasn't enough, it wasn't important enough. Well, Preston was damn important to us.""

Jason, 47, has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Jenny to death about two weeks later. He's on trial by judge alone at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench.Â  Earlier in the trial, a forensic pathologist testified that Jenny died from stab and cut wounds to the neck which caused excessive blood loss. He said she was stabbed numerous times both before and after her she died.Â  Jenny's journal is one piece of evidence that has been presented asÂ part of a voir dire, a trial within a trial. Breker and defence lawyer Thomas Hynes made submissions Monday, advocating for what evidence should â€” or should not â€” be applicable during the trial proper. Breker said Jenny's journal entry gave insight into the McKay couples' relationship. He also highlighted testimonyÂ from McKay's daughters, colleagues and police officers, along with a 911 call made by Jenny on Aug. 27, 2019,Â and anÂ in-police-car recording of Jason. The evidence, he said, demonstrated that Jenny ""had a fear of the accused."" He noted that evidence showed Jenny was trying to leave herÂ situation, but Jason ""begged her"" to come home. ""She was telling him that she would not do so and needed to be away,"" Breker said.Â  He spoke to evidence that suggested past abuse, including two witnesses whoÂ testified that Jason had hit Jenny.Â  Breker saidÂ Jenny's state of mind and the nature of the relationship between an accused and the deceased are commonly presented as evidence in domestic homicides. He suggested the fact that this was a judge-alone trial favoured the inclusion of said evidence. Defence lawyer Thomas Hynes raised questions about Jenny's diary and text messages, calling her an ""unreliable narrator"" who could not be cross-examined. He said Jenny could have misperceived, exaggerated, or ""misremembered"" situations orÂ encounters with Jason because of alcohol consumption. HynesÂ pointed to an allegedÂ alcohol addiction as the driving force behind her behaviour. He questioned ifÂ Jenny wanted to leave the McKay home because she was afraid, or if it was because the two enabled each other to drink. Hynes questioned whether Jenny was forming an escape plan to leave an abusive relationship or if she was trying to ""sober up.""Â  ""Was Jason McKay abusive as indicated, or was it just drunk misinterpretation?"" Hynes asked. Breker argued against Hynes' suggestion that what Jenny said or wrote were ""misperceptions.""Â He said the Crown had presented direct evidence that corroborated Jenny's accounts. Justice Michael Tochor reserved his decision on what will be admissible to the trial for Wednesday morning. After that, Hynes is expected to let the court know if the defence will call any evidence of its own.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-week-second-degree-murder-1.5433136,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074,N/A177,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-08T13:00:00.380Z,The RCMP said it didn't have any records about an investigation. But it had thousands.,"The RCMP is apologizing for saying it didn't have any records about its 11-month investigation into the death of Michel Vienneau, who was shot by a Bathurst Police Force member in 2015. In fact, the police agency had more than 10,000Â records about the Nova Scotia RCMP's investigation into Vienneau's death, which led to criminal charges against two Bathurst Police Force officers. The charges were dropped in 2017 after a preliminary inquiry. More than two years after CBC News asked for the records through an access to information request, and more than four years after Vienneau's death, the RCMP disclosed nearly 1,800 pages of documents and more than 1,000 images and videos related to the investigation. That came only after an investigation by the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The RCMP blamed human error, saying the search for records wasn't done properly. ""Although in the end it is clear that we did not meet our obligations, this appears to be a process failure, not the result of any ill-intent,"" Dan Brien, the RCMP's director of issues management and media relations, wrote in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""I am not aware of any intent to hide or suppress information on the part of RCMP personnel."" No one from the RCMP was made available for an interview. Minutes after Vienneau was shot outside Bathurst's Via Rail station on the morning of Jan. 12, 2015, Nova Scotia RCMP officers were called in to investigate. New Brunswick doesn't have its own serious incident response team like neighbouring Nova Scotia. Instead, police agencies from other jurisdictions are often tasked with investigating police-involved shootings or deaths. In this case, the two subject officers were employed by the Bathurst Police ForceÂ but worked in the now-disbanded Northeast Integrated Intelligence Unit. The unit, made up of officers from several police forces in the area, including RCMP, focused on gathering intelligence about drugs and organized crime. Vienneau appeared on the officers' radar that day when their supervisor, RCMP Sgt. Ron DeSilva, now an inspector, received Crime Stoppers tips that Vienneau was returning from Montreal with a load of drugs. The tips were false. For months, a team of Nova Scotia RCMP officers pieced together what led to the shooting. They interviewed about 100 witnesses. Lead investigator Larry Wilson described the investigation as ""complex"" and ""exhaustive"" in an email he sent to his team after the investigation concluded. ""The fact that the subjects of this case are police officers added another layer of complexity but each and everyone of you brought an unbiased and professional approach to your tasks,"" Wilson wrote. But when CBC News asked for all records about the Nova Scotia RCMP investigation into Vienneau's death, the RCMP had a surprising response. ""Based on the information provided, a search for records was conducted in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"" Insp. Richard Haye of the RCMP's access to information and privacy branch wrote in a May 2017 letter. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to locate records which respond to your request.""Â  How is it possible that a division of Canada's largest police force could spend months on a complex investigation into a man's death but not have any records about the investigation? It wasn't possible because it wasn't true. The original request, filed in February 2017, also asked for records that detailed the process of sending the file to the Crown, which has to approve criminal charges in New Brunswick, and about the false Crime Stoppers tips that led police to Vienneau on the day of his death. CBC News filed a complaint about the request in June 2017, suggesting it was inconceivable the RCMP wouldn't have records about a lengthy investigation. ""We posed numerous questions regarding the institution's processing of your request and the nature of their search for the records requested,"" the investigation report from the commissioner's office says. ""A second tasking was conducted and the RCMP located relevant records which were then reviewed to determine which documents could be released.""Â  An investigator with the Office of the Information Commissioner was tasked with reviewing the records, combing through nine CDs. One CD had thousands of written records on 6,645 pages. There were also more than 3,500 photos, videos or audio records that were reviewed, according to correspondence sent to CBC News. Some of those records ultimately weren't disclosed, for a variety of reasons. Some were duplicates. The final package didn't include any video recordings of what unfolded that day outside Bathurst's Via Rail station. According to the Nova Scotia RCMP's report on the shooting, no such video exists. While the commissioner's investigation prompted the RCMP to disclose records it previously said it didn't have, it doesn't explain what went wrong in the first place. That's problematic for Ken Rubin, an Ottawa-based investigator and researcher who has spent decades using Canada's freedom of information systemÂ to draw out information that's in the public interest. ""I think they have to be held more accountable,"" Rubin said about the commissioner's office. ""You can't just go from no records to 10,000 and say, 'Oh, aren't we wonderful. We got the records for you.' No, what happened? Come on.""Â  In its explanation, the RCMP said it relies on people to search its records. ""In addition to our ongoing challenges related to the scope and volume of incoming requests, we occasionally encounter situations where individual searches do not identify all the documents that they should,"" Brien wrote in an email. ""In this case, through the Information Commissioner's investigation, we discovered that, for a variety of reasons, the document search was not executed properly."" He said not all of the units that should have been asked to search were asked to do so. Others who were searching found no records, which wasn't accurate. ""This situation has provided us with valuable insight into gaps in our system and we will continue to take every opportunity to improve our processes."" Rubin sees the case as part of a larger problem with the RCMP's access to information system. Last year,Â the RCMP was wading through a backlog of unanswered requests, prompting the police force to reverse a policy that forced members to go through access to information to get their own medical or personnel files. RCMP backlogged with access-to-information requests from its own staff Earlier this year, an access to information officer emailed CBC News to ask whether theÂ requesterÂ still wanted overdue records from 2017, noting the RCMP is ""experiencing a high volume of requests with limited resources."" ""It's common knowledge that the RCMP, at least in terms of access to information, has not been that well organized or forthcoming in the last few years and has huge delays and some other problems â€_ they are not the top of the transparency bureaucracy,"" Rubin said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vienneau-rcmp-foi-1.5387196,[],N/A178,Veronica Sheppard,2019-12-22T09:00:00.675Z,The phantom menace: When Baby Yoda memes go bad,"This column is an opinionÂ by Veronica Sheppard,Â a writer and marketing manager based in Toronto specializingÂ in human-driven storiesÂ aboutÂ culture, food and media.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. ""You're telling me you're the only person on the internet who doesn't find Baby Yoda cute?"" This is a conversation I had with my brother on our way to dinner recently. I had told him, much to his dismay, that this was the case. My feed had been inundated with the same four memes from dozens of accounts, each one feeling more like a discount Disney billboard than the last. ""And it's working for them,"" he said. In theory, he's right. The robed, big-eyed creature deemed Baby Yoda from Disney's new series The Mandalorian, based in the Star Wars universe,Â has dominated online pop culture recently: memes, articles and even fan tattoos have sprung up in a matter of weeks. From a bird's-eye view, it's another successful wave of meme marketing. But my grievance extends beyond the repetitiveness of the content; it's with the unmeasurable risks companies are taking by handing over their brands to unknown creators. From a marketing perspective, it's smart at the surface level. It's no coincidence that Baby Yoda's popularity is spiking during a monumental time for the brand. Disney+ is in its infancy and has been highly anticipated as a contender in the streaming world, a new Star Wars movie is in theatres, and the holidays are a busy time for merchandise sales. Given the success of meme marketing as a tactic late last year with Netflix's Bird Box, Disney recognized that a few well-positioned still frames of their beloved new character could get them the extra attention needed to get subscriber numbers up. What they might not have considered is the damage being done to the integrity of their brand. Handing over the reins of a valuable pop-culture asset to a community of random creators is a double-edged sword. It endangers loyalty with existing fans by potentially cheapening the Star Wars name, and begins to turn off people who feel oversaturated by the character. The cracks have already begun to show in Disney's marketing method â€” they opened the floodgates and are now at the mercy of Instagrammers everywhere, and they should hope that they can regain control soon. The danger extends beyond Instagram's already massive reach of more than 1 billion daily active users. It's true. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheMandalorian?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TheMandalorian</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/BabyYoda?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#BabyYoda</a> <a href=""https://t.co/yA25RpIrjK"">pic.twitter.com/yA25RpIrjK</a> Many brands have fallen victim to bandwagoning on platforms they aren't equipped to own conversations on. Improper attempts to appeal to younger demographics through memes and slang have become so regular, it even spawned its own community on Reddit called r/FellowKids, where users publicly shame brands and their social media managers' poor attempts to stay relevant. It's this kind of tone deafness that puts so many brands on the defensive. Just this year, Sunny D was under fire for turning depression into a ""cute brand joke,"" as one Twitter user put it, and Chase Bank caught major backlash for seemingly turning a blind eye to poverty. .<a href=""https://twitter.com/Chase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Chase</a>: why arenâ€™t customers saving money?<br>Taxpayers: we lost our jobs/homes/savings but gave you a $25b bailout<br>Workers: employers donâ€™t pay living wages<br>Economists: rising costs + stagnant wages = 0 savings<br>Chase: guess weâ€™ll never know<br>Everyone: seriously?<br> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/MoneyMotivation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#MoneyMotivation</a> <a href=""https://t.co/WcboMr5MCE"">pic.twitter.com/WcboMr5MCE</a> Now beloved Baby Yoda is hitting the wrong nerve with some audiences, coming off as a tacky spin-off and showing upÂ in a slew of NSFW (not safe for work) memes. Attempting to go viral through social marketing is nothing new, but as more competitors join the streaming wars, I expect Instagram feeds will increasingly be laden with lazy, monotonous content from the big brands. Apple, Hulu, HBO and other streaming goliaths are set to collectively spend dozens of billions on content development in 2020 alone, all of which will be aimed at similar audiences. I can only imagine that as the space becomes more crowded, we'll be inundated with quick, cookie-cutter content designed with memes in mind. But at what cost? Meme marketing means relinquishing control of a brand. And given how it can alienate the very audience meant to be reached in the first place, I'd say it's rarely worth it.

One outspoken transit commissioner isÂ even calling for the city to break theÂ $1 billionÂ long-term deal, and bring the maintenance ofÂ the trains in-house. ""Because clearly, holding back the money is not enough incentive for them to do their job,"" said Sarah Wright-Gilbert, one of the commission's fourÂ appointed citizen members. Since the Confederation Line launched in mid-September, the city hasn't paid Rideau Transit a cent. Its monthly payments are supposed to be $4.5 to $5 million,Â so the group is currently out up to $20 million. Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM) is an arm of Rideau Transit Group (RTG), the partnership between ACS Infrastructure, SNC-Lavalin and Ellis Don that built Ottawa's $2.1-billion Confederation Line. RTM is in charge ofÂ maintaining the entire LRT system, including the Alstom Citadis Spirit light rail vehicles. RTM actuallyÂ subcontractsÂ the maintenance of the trains themselves to France-basedÂ Alstom, which did not respond to questions Tuesday.Â  In the last week alone, one train somehow pulled down 80 metres of overhead electrical cable, and other trains had issues with their wheels, causing them to skidÂ and smoke. Switch issues over the weekend caused hours of delay. When RTG handed overÂ control of the LRT to the city last August, the system was supposed to come with 17 double-car, fully tested and commissioned trains. It's now unclear whether all 17 ever worked. These last few days, so many trains have had issues that, at times, only eight or nine have been available to carry passengers. Transit chair Coun. Allan HubleyÂ pinned the recent problems on RTM not meeting the city'sÂ expectations for maintaining trains and dealing with winter-related issues. HubleyÂ and his colleagues will be looking for answers from Rideau Transit CEO Peter Lauch, who is set to appear at an emergency transit commission called for Thursday afternoon. But unlike Wright-Gilbert,Â Hubley doesn't believe the LRT's issues have become so dire thatÂ the city should go through the complicated legal process of breaking from RTM. ""That's bad news if we have to go that route. To me, that's the last straw [when] we're absolutely convinced they don't have the expertise to do what they're supposed to do."" Mayor Jim Watson agreed that it is too early to be talking about the possibility of pulling out of the maintenance contract.Â  ""I think most members of the public want us to deal with getting the damn trains fixed, first and foremost, and then deal with repercussions with the consortium,"" said Watson, adding he has had no discussions about possible litigation. O-Train Line 1: Afternoon peak services normally use 13 trains for a train every 4 minutes. RTM has provided 10 trains. Trains will run approximately every 5 minutes. <a href=""https://t.co/dHTT4UcS2c"">https://t.co/dHTT4UcS2c</a> In recent days, the city has made a point of emphasizing how it's RTGÂ that is failing commuters, and not the city. It appears OC Transpo boss John Manconi is less willing to speak for RTGÂ â€” at the news conference last Thursday to address the collapsed 80 metres of electrical cable, Manconi stood at the back, behind reporters. At the next day's news conference, Manconi sat at the table with other officials, but said little. Instead, it appears that the city is insisting that Rideau Transit'sÂ Lauch, who has rarely spoken to the media over the years of this project, be on hand to answer questions. While city officials are at pains to focus the blame for the problems on RTM, it is difficult to see what the city can do at this point to improve the systemÂ other than holding back maintenance paymentsÂ â€” a strategy that doesn't seem to be fixing the trains any faster. As Hubley said:Â ""It's big money. Wouldn't you love to be making $5 million to do a job? Get to work and do the job.""Â  Watson is still confident that withholding payments is effective leverage because it hits RTM ""in the pocketbook and also hurts their credibility and reputation both nationally and worldwide.

Representatives from the new committee say they filed a complaint with the police in late September, the same day they got access to the local service district's bank account. The financial situation means the community's dream of purchasing a new fire truck is now in doubt, and it will have to continue to rely on a vehicle that is nearly a half-century old. ""We had a public meeting when we found out the money was missing, and we had grown men and women here with tears in their eyes,"" said new local service committee chair Annie Perry. In interviews with CBC News, some current and past representatives are raising questions about the community's financial situation. PerryÂ said she believes thousands of dollars is missing from the district's bank account, and she's seen cheques that she believes were written inappropriately before her term began. Perry took her position with the new district committee on Sept. 16, after the Department of Municipal Affairs called for a public meeting and dissolved the former committee. She said there is evidence of unexplained spending between 2017 and 2018. ""There's big amounts of money being written out,"" she said in an interview. ""For a little community, where did all this money go?"" David Squibb, another new member of the local service districtÂ committee, andÂ Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, also spoke to CBC News. Each said they believed money may have been inappropriately spent. The new seven-member committee is split, with some other members condemning Perry's choice to speak publicly about the community's finances while a police investigation is underway. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department of Municipal Affairs said it was aware of the complaint to police, which it described as ""possible financial irregularities,"" and was planning a financial audit. The three new representatives told CBC News that thousands of dollars in funding that was earmarked for the purchase of a new fire truck for the Bunyan's Cove Fire Department appears to be gone from the community's bank account. Correspondence between governments show that in 2018, the Department of Municipal Affairs sent $248,131 to the local service district under its fire protection vehicles infrastructure program.Â  The district and the fire department were expected to raise another $62,034, and borrow even more to cover the HST and GST portion of the purchase. But the purchase of the fire truck was never completed â€” the truck remains in storage in Clarenville â€” and as of Sept. 20,Â the local service district had only $223,919 in its account. ""There's no money there that we're allowed to touch, because the $223,000 is not ours to spend,"" said Perry. Â  ""And if we don't get this new fire truck that's sitting in Clarenville, that money got to go back to the government."" Nicholson said the local service district has collected another $10,000, as residents have been paying their yearly fees. But the committee has also been stuck with overdue bills that must be paid â€” and they are not quite sure if more are coming. Perry said the local service district owesÂ three months of bills to the garbage collector and the power company. CBC News obtained financial documents, including photocopies of cheques and partial bank statements for the Bunyan's Cove LSD account at CIBC. The documentation includes photocopies of 12 cheques that were written to Stephanie Chatman, a former member of the local service district committee, and two businesses that are linked to her: Chatman's Convenience and Chatman's Welding. Altogether, the cheques total a combined $96,598. The cheques were written between April 2017 and July 2018, and each cheque shows two signatures. Eleven of the 12 cheques have no information on the memo field that would indicate what the payment was for. The biggest payment, for $32,693, went to Chatman's Welding and was dated July 26, 2018. On Aug. 31, Stephanie Chatman, trading as Chatman's Welding, wrote a $100,000 cheque to the local service district. That cheque was deposited on Sept. 16 â€” the same day that the provincial government dissolved the former local service district committee. Chatman was one of two remaining members on the committee that was being dissolved. A full committee has seven members, but over the course of 2017 and 2018 committee members had resigned, and the committee was down to two this summer. There were several attempts to hold public meetings to elect new members, but those meetings never attracted enough residents from the community. Stephanie Chatman did not respond to several interview requests from CBC News. Eleven of the 12 cheques written to Chatman or her companies show what appear to be the signatures of two former LSD members â€” Chelsea Keats and Wade Bowring. When CBC News contacted Keats for comment, Clarenville lawyer James Hughes replied. Hughes wrote that his client was anticipating a call from the RCMP's investigating officer to give a statement as a potential witness. ""The signatures on the cheques purporting to be Ms. Keats's were forged and during that time period when the cheques were written, Ms. Keats was not part of the committee,"" Hughes wrote. Hughes wrote that he advised his client to only speak with police. Meanwhile, Wade Bowring â€” whose signature also appears to be on 11 of those 12 cheques â€” declined to comment about financial practices during his term on the committee, or why his signature appeared to be on those cheques. A local service district memberÂ said Bowring has told them that he did not sign inappropriate cheques. Reginald Perry was one of only two members who remained active on the local service district before it was dissolved Sept. 16. The other was Stephanie Chatman. Perry said his three years on the committee were ""terrible"" and he ""didn't know anything that was going on."" Perry told CBC News that he spent the majority of his term fighting for access to financial documents, which he said Chatman held.Â  He alleged his consistent requests were ignored, and also said he wrote to the Department of Municipal Affairs to ask it to launch an investigation. Other former committee members could not be reached by CBC News, or declined comment. Ruby Nicholson, the committee's new treasurer, said there are discrepancies between receipts provided to homeowners paying their fees, and money that was deposited into the CIBC account. ""From the receipts that I had, there was like $53,000 and change for receipts that people paid for their fees, and the deposit book only shows $27,000 and change,"" she said. The Bunyan's Cove local service district is responsible for providing water service, garbage collection and fire protection for the households in the community. Squibb, who volunteered with the fire department before starting with the local service district committee last month, said there are now questions about how the community will pay forÂ a new fire truck. The new truck would replace a 1971 Ford 750. ""Right now, the old fire truck that we've got there, it leaks water. So every so often, you've got to go fill the tank up, top the tank up,"" Squbb said. ""Two years ago, we had a breakdown with one of the brakes.â€_ We had to order to the States to get parts, because nobody has it anymore."" The fire department raised its own money for the truck, which Squibb says remains in the department's own bank account.Â  But because other money appears to be missing, the truck remains parked in Clarenville.

""Unifor members had completely blocked the entrances/exits to the Co-op Refinery Complex, not allowing vehicles to enter or exit the property,"" the Regina Police Service said in a statement.Â  The blockades were taken down Monday evening.Â  A court injunction issuedÂ in December stated that picketers could block someone's access to the refinery for no more than 10 minutes and only to provide information on the union's cause. It also said that anyone who declined to hear the information should be let through. Dias said at a media conference Monday morningÂ that the blockades were set up by members of other Unifor locals. He arguedÂ that they therefore did not violate the injunction. ""We'll deal with that in court because our argument today is that we are not violating any injunction at all,"" Dias said.Â  We need thousands more <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unifor?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Unifor</a> members to come to Regina because <a href=""https://twitter.com/reginapolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@reginapolice</a> have decided to side with <a href=""https://twitter.com/CoopFCL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CoopFCL</a> <a href=""https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV"">https://t.co/IJPjqGp6BV</a> Dias, on Twitter, later accused the police of picking sides, and called for more Unifor members to travel to Regina in solidarity. Police did not confirm who else was arrested or if any charges were laid.Â  Monday markedÂ 46 days since Unifor members were locked out on Dec. 5. The dispute mainly comes down to pensions. A previous deal included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan.Â  The union says this amounts to taking away workers'Â pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive.Â  ""We are going to guarantee you that not one fuel truck is going to leave this facility. From now on we're not going anywhere,"" Scott Doherty, Unifor's lead negotiator and executive assistant to the president, said. The refinery said in a statement that the blockades were illegal and that it is exploring legal options.Â  ""Unifor continues to use illegal blockades as a bullying tactic and has brought in extra people to help them to it,"" the statement said. ""Today's actions by Unifor represent yet another violation of the court injunction."" Regina police saidÂ they were monitoring the situation. In a statement, police said they were communicating with both sides to keep the peace and advising motorists to avoid the area of Ninth Avenue N., MacDonald Street and Fleet Street. Before his arrest, Dias estimated thatÂ about 500 people were brought in from across Canada to Regina and said more are expected. Dias said the union also plans to increase theÂ boycott of Co-ops across Western Canada if a deal isn't made.Â  ""Clearly the only place that this dispute will be resolved will be at the bargaining table,"" Dias said.Â  The refinery previously said Unifor hasn't returned to the bargaining table since SeptemberÂ 2019.Â  A video showing a large flare at the Co-op Refinery on SaturdayÂ has been circulating on social media.Â  The refinery said in a statement that the facility momentarily lost power from SaskPower. As a result, some units came down at the same time. ""The flare system did the job it is designed to do in that situation. Power was restored within a minute of the incident, and our highly skilled management team brought the refinery units back online per normal operating procedures,"" the refinery said in a statement. ""Power failures happen occasionally, and our team is always prepared for an emergent scenario such as this."" Dias said flare-ups happen when replacement workers without proper experience are running a plant.Â  ""We're hoping that the safety concerns are being addressed,"" Dias said. ""We're hoping that the facility is just being taken care of properly, from a maintenance point of view. But ultimately we're not in control of that today. We wish we were but we are not.""

They were hung in front windows and on porchesÂ in memory of a nine-year-old hockey player who died of a brain tumour on Friday. For people in The Pas, Man., and on the nearby Opaskwayak Cree Nation, the massive show of support was a reminder of how Ryder Armstrong united the two communitiesÂ in the year he spent battling an unrelenting, high-grade glioma. ""It's amazing how everybody just comes together if someone needs help or someone needs some support,"" said Deann MacInnis, a close friend of Ryder's parents, Lissa Whitehead and Bryan Armstrong. The Manitoba communities areÂ located about one kilometre away from each other, one on eachÂ side of the Saskatchewan River, and 521 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. Ryder's diagnosis last January sent shock waves through the northern communities, his former hockey coachÂ Jerome Conaty said. With a mother from Opaskwayak Cree Nation and a father from The Pas, he had strong support systems in both communities. ""It bound the communities together, because everyone was just so supportive of him and just wished him the best,"" said Conaty. ""He was amazing. I honestly don't know of one person in our community who isn't somehow already connected to him through family and friends or through hockey. He touched a lot of souls."" A spokesperson for University College of the North said Ryder spent many summers in one of the school's kids' programs. The college displayed a message of support for him at its campus in The Pas, with a sign reading #RyderStrongÂ in the windows. ""Whether you knew Ryder or not, his story of strength while facing such a terrible disease is both inspiring and heart breaking,"" spokesperson Monte Koshel wrote in an email on Saturday. ""I don't personally know Ryder's family, but after I dropped my daughter off for a play date last night, I had to drive through tears while jersey after jersey wasÂ displayed in everyone's windows."" Over the course of his treatment last year, Ryder seemed to be getting better, Conaty said. ""It was a super big thrill for the kids,"" he said. ""He came back in his wheelchair, but he was able to come and spend some time with all of his teammates and even go on the ice. And then again he progressed and had one heck of a year."" Even a month ago, things were looking up. ""The tumor was shrinking and that was a blessing,"" said MacInnis. ""[This] past December, they said it had shrunk so much, that things looked good. They had a positive visit in December."" But a few weeks ago, things took a turn for the worse. After Ryder started having seizures, tests revealed the cancer hadÂ spread rapidly through his spinal cord fluid. And on Friday morning, the nine-year-old took his last breath. Now, theÂ communities are focused on the person they've lost, and on how they can make sure he's never forgotten. ""It's tough. It's really hard. But I think from here, there's probably many lessons that people have learned and we just know how much Ryder loved everybody. And it'll probably stay with people for a long time,"" said MacInnis. ConatyÂ said Ryder's friends and family are coming up with ways to keep his legacy going. ""Our whole communities are really devastated right now,"" said Conaty. ""We just have to kind of propel ourselves forward. Take that fierceness that Ryder had, and focus it on positivity and doing good in the communities."" For now, they're starting with something small, something familiar. On Monday, Ryder's friends and family are asking other people, even outside the communities, to hang a jersey in their front windows in honour of a huge hockey fan who saw his last game too soon. ""He was one of the fiercest,Â fiercest kids out there. Always had a lot of hustle, always skating super hard for the puck, had a really good attitude,"" said Conaty. ""An extremely kind child, lots of energy. Big, chubby cheeks. He was an amazing soul.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/remembering-ryder-northern-manitobans-hang-hockey-jerseys-for-boy-lost-to-cancer-1.5432307,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-jets-choir-ojibwe-o-canada-1.5429759 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/hockey-wedding-cancer-newlyweds-1.5386245 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/stelio-mattheos-nhl-testicular-cancer-1.5260552 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pas-huskies-first-place-good-deeds-cup-1.4507195,N/A184,"Katie Pedersen, Melissa Mancini, David Common",2019-11-23T16:17:02.731Z,Seniors' homes using 'trespass orders' to ban family members from visiting,"Mary Sardelis wasn't allowed to visit her 97-year-old mother's Ottawa retirement home for almost a year. Sardelis lives less than five minutes away from her mother Voula, but the home prevented Sardelis from seeing her, using sections of Ontario's trespass law. ""For 316 days â€_ I was banned from entering the home,"" she said. ""You have no idea of the toll it's taken."" She could call, but her mother's hearing is poor and she often couldn't understand what her daughter was saying.Â  ""All I could hear was her fears or concerns. And I couldn't even soothe her."" Sardelis was banned from City View Retirement Community under Ontario's Trespass to Property Act. So-called trespass orders allow private property owners to limit who can come onto the premises and,Â some experts say, are being increasingly used to keep out family members who complain about conditions in retirement and long-term care homes. It's difficult to know how often homes ban or restrict family members, since families have to breach the trespass order for there to be any record of it. WATCH: Daughter banned from visiting 97-year-old mother at retirement home. Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto,Â estimates she gets calls about trespass orders in long-term care homes and retirement homes at least once a week.Â  ""Generally, what happens is that it's a family member who is in visiting their family member and they get upset,"" she said. Marketplace reviewed over a dozen cases of family members from provinces across Canada who say they believe the homes were trying to silence them for advocating on behalf of their loved ones. ""The person maybe raises their voices and the home says, 'Well, that's it. You're not coming anymore, because we see you as a danger,'"" said Meadus. WATCH: Voula Sardelis waves to her daughter on the sidewalk outside her retirement home. ""If [the complainants] were really a danger, they should be calling the police. So if they were actually threatening someone, that's what they should be doing, ""But instead, what they're doing is to try to control their premises, trying to stifle people from complaining and trying to stifle people from speaking out on behalf of these very vulnerable seniors."" The home told Marketplace they prohibited Sardelis from visiting her mother because she was ""aggressive"" towards staff. But she believes she was banned for speaking out and filing complaints about the living conditions at the home which she felt were intolerable. Meadus said in Ontario, homes do not have the right to ban residents' visitors.Â When it comes to retirement homes, residents who pay to live on the property have a right to receive visitors they choose ""without interference,"" she said, citing case law established in Cunningham vs. Whitby Christian Non-Profit Housing Corp. That case found that banning guests of a tenant would contravene Section 23 (1) of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, which entitles a tenant to ""quiet enjoyment"" of their space. Meadus says in the case of long-term care, they have the same rights under Section 3 (14) of the Long-Term Care Homes Act, which states that every resident has the right ""to receive visitors of his or her choice â€_ without interference."" The home says it ""disagrees"" with that analysis and that it has the right to ban anyone deemed to have breached its ""zero-tolerance abuse"" policy. Meadus has been invited to train Toronto's police officers on how to deal with calls from retirement and long-term care homes that try to use Trespass to Property Act against family members. ""When we talk to police officers, they're surprised and they're usually very grateful that we've provided that information to them. That's not something that they're trained for generally,"" she said. Meadus says often the families she has heard from have negotiated for restricted visits, agreeing to only come into the home during certain hours or under certain conditions.Â  That was the case for Susan Macaulay, who says her mother's Quebec long-term care home threatened to ban her, and ultimately issued restrictions on her visits. ""I was a thorn in the side of the managers,"" she said. ""They threatened on several occasions to not allow me to see my mother."" Macaulay said the home sent her a letter stating that she would only be allowed to visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. â€” the two hours of the afternoon when her mom was normally asleep. She said she tried to explain to her mother, who had dementia, why she wasn't going to be visiting as much. ""If I don't come to visit, it's not because I don't want to,"" she recalls telling her mother.Â  ""I thought that if they stopped me from coming to see her, she would never know why I didn't come."" Macaulay faced restrictions on her visits to her mother for 18 months, until her mother died. In Ontario, the Trespass to Property Act doesn't allow people who have been issued a ban to fight it. Once a notice or verbal warning is given to someone on the property, the only way to fight the ban is to go back to the property and wait for the owner to call the police. Meadus says most of the time, families don't challenge the order, because they would have to get arrested to do so.Â  But for Mary Sardelis, her fear of being arrested wasn't enough to stop her. In March 2019, she went into the retirement home even though she was banned and waited for the home to call the police and arrest her. She hoped that this way, she would be able to bring the matter before a judge. The police were called, and Sardelis was charged under the Trespass to Property Act. ""Someone had to do something,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it will just keep going on and on and on."" But in October, Sardelis found out she wouldn't have to go to court after all. Her lawyer met with the home's lawyers, after which the prosecutors dropped the charges. The home toldÂ MarketplaceÂ itÂ will let her visit as long as she follows their rules. Although her battle is seemingly over, Sardelis said on behalf of her mother, she'll continue to advocate for other family members in her community who have been banned from visiting their loved ones. ""I'll do whatever it takes to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" she said. ""I will not stop.""

It increases intensity and frequency, say two Calgary experts. The intensity of the Australian wildfire, followed by flash flooding in other parts of the country. Military called in to deal with multi-day Newfoundland weather event like none in recent memory. One-in-100-year flood in Calgary in 2013. A common thread between these and other extreme weather eventsÂ is climate change, which has increased ambient temperatures, making extreme weather as a wholeÂ more intense and more frequent. ""If you see what's going on in Newfoundland right now and hear some of the stories, a lot of people don't have this in living memory,"" University of Calgary climatologist Shawn Marshall told CBC Calgary News at 6. ""It comes down to statistical distributions. If you picture a normal curve where you have extreme minima and maxima on either end, climate change shifts that whole distribution and that changes the frequencies."" He saysÂ it could be the economic cost of cleaning upÂ that might drive a change in beliefs and actions. ""The costs associated with that could hammer us, could cripple us pretty hard,"" Marshall said. ""This is what the future looks like, more and more commonly. That's very disruptive, very expensive. What used to be exceptional is becoming normalized. It's not necessarily going to be easy for us."" Israel Dunmade, an associate professor in Mount Royal University's earth and environmental sciences department, says that despite tweets and statements by influencers whenever a cold stretch hits, weather and climate are not the same thing. ""Weather is for a short period. Climate is over a long period, usually 30 to 35 years average,"" Dunmade told CBC News. ""Over a long period of time, we are seeing from anthropogenic activities, our economic activities, an increase in ambient temperature. Over the years, as a result of that increasing temperature, it has led to the current climate change."" That increase makes things drier, so wildfires burn more often and with greater intensity, he said. Wind plays a factor, too. ""Increasing temperature increases the capacity of the wind to carry more water. So instead of rainfall coming down, it will be carried to other places. That's why you find more dryness, and more incidents of a lot of fire breaking out,"" Dunmade said. It also melts ice, which contributes to flooding. Again, more often and more intense. When your uncle argues thatÂ there hasÂ always been extreme weather, therefore climate change isn't a thing, Marshall has a response for that. ""It's pretty hard to always attribute severe weather to climate change, but there is no question that some of these events, especially Australia, have a huge climate change layer to them,"" Marshall said. ""Extreme weather has always happened â€_Â but when you add a bit of climate change, more energy, more moisture [in the] atmosphere to the mix, then you start to get things we have not seen before."" And that term used to describe the 2013 Calgary-area floods, a ""one-in-a-100 year event,"" we might need to adjust it. ""Maybe becoming one in 20, one in 10 â€” that kind of frequency."" Still, Marshall is an optimist. ""Reversing it is going to take a long timeÂ â€” decades, maybe a couple generations â€” but I think it's possible,"" he said. ""I still hold out hope that, even in my lifetime, I will see it stabilize, I will see our emissions level off. It's really important to reach some equilibrium.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/extreme-weather-climate-change-1.5433908,[],N/A187,CBC Books,2020-01-22T16:25:52.588Z,Meet the Canada Reads 2020 contenders,"What is the one book all of Canada should read?

Nova Scotia's minister of energy is helping fast-track a study into a pilot project that could ease problems following an explosion of public transit ridership in the municipality. The aim is to take advantage of federal infrastructure funding for green initiatives. ""The quicker the funding can come, the quicker our electric buses in CBRM will become a reality,"" said Wayne MacDonald, CBRM's director of engineering and public works. He said transit ridership has tripled over the last two years and the municipality needs help. In 2017, CBRM transit provided about 350,000 rides a year, said MacDonald, and ridership is now around 1.2 million, thanks to an influx of international students at Cape Breton University. The provincial study has only been underway for a couple of weeks, but MacDonald said it will help the municipality decide what kind of buses are needed, the potential cost, and what the vehicles would need for maintenance and infrastructure. ""We've been working with the bus producers and manufacturers to determine what's available and how long the timeline would be associated with ordering and how does that line up with our available funding,"" he said. ""How quickly that can happen, what infrastructure is required on the ground, how do we maintain, how do we charge, how do we make sure the buses are properly available to be used each day."" Derek Mombourquette, the MLA for Sydney-Whitney Pier and the province's minister of energy and mines, saidÂ the need for transit service in CBRM is growing and if infrastructure is needed, that is the time to invest in electric buses. Mombourquette said the department is working to speed up the study with the aim of creating a pilot project as soon as possible that would help CBRM qualify for federal funding. ""If this becomes a priority for them, we would determine what we could do to go after the money,"" he said. ""We need to determine what infrastructure we need to put in place to actually support the electric buses, so as fast as we can get that work done, we're going to get it done, so we can try to get these on the road.""

If they were to change that, we do have to respect that."" Canada has about 500 military members in Iraq associated with two separate missions. Canadians wereÂ part of the NATO mission to train Iraqi security and armed forces, and also tookÂ part in the U.S.-led coalition mission to hunt down remnants of the Islamic State, or ISIS. Gen. Jonathan Vance, Canada's top military commander, halted both those missions earlier this month after the U.S. drone attack that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani at the Baghdad airport increased theÂ risk to foreign troops in the region. The Department of National Defence said ThursdayÂ both missions remain on hold, although some supply missions have taken place. In the wake of the Soleimani killing, Iraq's Parliament voted in favour of a non-binding resolution calling on the Iraqi government to expel foreign troops from the country. Adel Abdul Mahdi, now the caretaker prime minister since resigning in November, supported the call. Sajjan said that discussions are taking place between the two countries as Canada looks to get its mission back on track. ""The current Iraqi leadership realizes why we came here in the first place, which is actually to help Iraq, to stop the scourge of Daesh, known as ISIS, from controlling the country,"" he said. ""Obviously the Iraqi government has concerns. We're listening to those concerns."" Sajjan said that, for now, the priority of the Canadian mission in the region is to ensure the safety of Canadian Forces on the ground. He said no decision will be made on resuming either mission until the security situation improves. ""We are looking at all measures to get back, to continuing both our missions within the coalition but â€_ we will only do so when the security situation is appropriate,"" Sajjan said. Sajjan would not say how many Canadian soldiers are now in Iraq, or if any of the Canadian personnel who moved out of the country in the wake of the drone strike have returned. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo spoke with Foreign Affairs Minister FranÃ§oisâ€‘Philippe Champagne about the possibility of NATO expanding its role in the region. According to a readout of the conversation from the U.S. Department of State, the two foreign ministersÂ "" â€_ spoke about the Iranian regime's continued aggressive and destabilizing actions in the region and steps to contain it, specifically the opportunity for an expanded NATO force in Iraq and appropriate burden sharing."" Asked if the U.S. had made a specific request of Canada,Â Sajjan said that while Canadian participation in the missions was always intended to change as the situation on the ground changes, no formal request of Canada has yet been made.

The Liberal government will contribute up to $20 million over five years to provide for the new Canadian Institute for Climate Choices, which launched on Tuesday.Â  The institute, which is to maintain independent control over its own research and reporting,Â isÂ the result of a partnership between 15 climate-focused organizations that answered a federal call for proposals in 2018. ""I hope that we're able to contribute some really good, solid, evidence-based analysis and advice that looks at the issues and complexities of climate and what decisions the country is facing in a more integrated frame,"" saidÂ Kathy Bardswick, the institute's chief executive officer. ""The country is facing choices, and they're complex choices and they need to be well supported."" The Canadian Institute for Climate Choices will be overseen by an 11-member board of directors that includes Mel Cappe, a former clerk of the Privy Council, Dave Collyer, former president of theÂ Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, and Christopher Ragan, chair of the former Ecofiscal Commission. Three expert panelsÂ â€” focused on adaptation, mitigation and clean growthÂ â€” will inform the institute's work. Those panels areÂ made up of some of Canada's prominent experts and voices on climate policy, including Blair Feltmate,Â  Nancy Olewiler,Â Mark Jaccard,Â Nicholas Rivers,Â Jennifer Winter,Â Stewart Elgie andÂ Kathryn Harrison. The institute's first report, also released Tuesday, provides a broad overview of global climate change, climate policy in Canada and the possible paths forward, in hopes of establishing a ""starting point for a new conversation about Canada's future in a changing world."" The Liberal government's move to establish and support such an organization echoes aÂ decision made by Brian Mulroney's Conservative government to create the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy in 1988. (Its founding chair was David Johnston, the future governor general.) Over the course of 25 years, the advisory agency produced more than 50 reports on climate change, public policy and environmental protection. The Harper government announced its intention to eliminate funding for the roundtableÂ â€” $5 million per yearÂ â€” in 2012. At the time, Conservative Environment MinisterÂ Peter KentÂ said the roundtable was no longer needed because there were other organizations producingÂ research and analysis.

""Why should taxpayers have to pay for more than 10 reports promoting a carbon tax,Â something that the people of Canada have repeatedly rejected?"" Baird asked, when challenged in the House of Commons. The former roundtable is not the only example of an arm's length institution relied on for expert analysis.

Recently published papers from scientists at the University ofÂ Waterloo question previous studies done for the federalÂ governmentÂ and the United Nations as well as long-held conclusions fromÂ Indigenous people. ""Our findings counter widespread perceptions,"" said RolandÂ Hall, an aquatic ecologist who is one of the co-authors.Â ""There'sÂ been lots of controversy and claims that weren't necessarily supported by data.""Â  Others say the jury is still out.Â  ""[The scientists] overstate their position, stretching theÂ applicability of their limited dataset,"" said Melody Lepine of theÂ Mikisew Cree First Nation. The band has long voiced concerns aboutÂ its traditional land in northern Alberta's Peace-Athabasca Delta andÂ Wood Buffalo National Park.Â  The park is one of the world's largest freshwater deltas and aÂ World Heritage Site. But its water levels have been dropping, which the Mikisew blameÂ largely on B.C. Hydro's W.A.C. Bennett Dam. They also say contaminants haveÂ been flowing downstream from the oilsands.Â  In 2014, the Mikisew voiced concerns to UNESCO, which askedÂ Canada to assess the park's 45,000 square kilometresÂ of grasslands,Â wetlands and waterways. That study found ecological health was declining from climateÂ change, dams and industry. It also noted the proposedÂ Teck FrontierÂ oilsands mine, waiting for federal cabinet approval, is only 20Â kilometres south of the park. UNESCO is considering the park's status while Parks CanadaÂ considers a $27.5-million plan to rescue it. But after analyzing 150 years worth of lake and delta sedimentÂ cores, Hall said dams and industry aren't the problem.Â  Parts of the delta are drying out and climate change may play aÂ part, he said. But the biggest factor, Hall said, is the EmbarrasÂ River, which redirected large volumes of water when it broke itsÂ banks in 1982.Â  ""It's probably the biggest hydrological event of the century andÂ you don't even find it mentioned,"" said Hall. What's more, researchers found that the delta didn't start dryingÂ out until the 1980s. The W.A.C. Bennett Dam was built in 1968. The cores, which were examined for six heavy metals associatedÂ with oilsands, revealed changes over time that predate development. ""We see flat lines, no rising trends,"" Hall said. Joshua Kurek, an ecologist at Mount Allison University in NewÂ Brunswick, was not involved in the study, but called the papersÂ valuable. ""We have a scarcity of observations and their approach providesÂ convincing evidence of fairly stable baselines,"" he said. But Kurek pointed out that industry releases many more chemicalsÂ than those considered by the researchers. As well, Kurek noted, theÂ cores were taken from a small area of the delta far from oilsandsÂ mines. ""It's definitely not the final answer."" Lepine said in an email that the research didn't test forÂ contaminants other studies have found, including mercury,Â arsenicÂ and many carcinogenic chemicals. And the paper doesn't look at theÂ dam's impact on the Peace River, she added. Hall, who has been working in the area for 20 years, said conflicting theories speak to how little data is available on theÂ large, complex, remote region and how hard it is to study. ""It's not an easy place to figure stuff out."" He suggests others may have let assumptions influence them. ""Almost from Day 1, it was anticipated that [the dam]Â wouldÂ cause negative changes,"" Hall said. ""That idea has been in people's minds for so long that other possibilities are not beingÂ explored.""Â  He stands by the conclusions in his papers.Â  ""The extent to which industrial developments have altered theÂ delta are not as bad as feared. ""It doesn't mean industry can't change things in the future.

ButÂ not Nine Mile River, N.S., resident Ranulph Hudston, who persisted in his battle to have Volkswagen honour its 12-year corrosion warranty. The retired educator wouldn't take no for an answer when his 2007 Jetta started rusting and the companyÂ denied his warranty claim. He decided toÂ takeÂ Volkswagen to Nova Scotia small claims court, and earlier this month won a judgment of $7,886.40 to pay for the repair costs. ""I was very surprised and very pleased,"" Hudston said of the court's Nov. 7 ruling. ""As I read the decision, I saw a lot of what I put into the case coming back to me as the truth, and the truth coming through felt really good."" His win came despite a list from Volkswagen of possible causes for the corrosion on the Jetta's door sills and rocker panels, including tree sap, bird droppings, shoe buckles and an improperly stored seatbelt. In her ruling, small claims adjudicator Shelly Martin didn't buy any of the excuses, saying she failed ""to see how a seatbelt or footwear could affect the areas in question, as the site of corrosion is not easily in contact with footwear or a seatbelt."" The 12-year corrosion warranty was provided to Hudston when he bought the vehicle brand new in 2007. He first noticed rust on the left front fender when his Jetta was almost seven years old. He went back to Hillcrest Volkswagen in Halifax, where he purchased the vehicle. He was then sent to a Volkswagen-authorized repair shop, which fixed most of the rusted areas and replaced the right quarter panel. But three years later, in 2017, he noticed blistering paint and a small strip of paint peeling on theÂ rocker panels, as well as blistering paint on the front door sills. He took the Jetta to a body shop for repairs andÂ was told the body work under the paint was rusting. He was advised the repairs should be covered under Volkswagen's warranty. Hudston went back to Hillcrest, where he was told to fill out an online inspection request that included acceptance of additional terms and conditions that were not in the original warranty. One new clause said any decisions by Volkswagen were final, while another said repairs must be made ""promptly."" Hudston was subsequently sent for a repair estimate where a technician told him any attempt to clean the rust on the door sill would likely ""blow a hole right through it."" More than a month later, Hillcrest Volkswagen told him the repair would not be covered, saying the corrosion was not the type covered by his warranty. It also refused to cover the rocker panels. Hudston continued to push Volkswagen to pay for the repairs, but the company responded in an email: ""We are unable to base our decisions on information received from independent shops and our decision remains unchanged."" It cited a number of reasons why the corrosion might have occurred â€” ranging from bird droppings, to rocks, to lack of rust proofing â€” andÂ also suggested the problemÂ was due to a general lack of maintenance. But in her decision, Martin noted photos of the vehicle showed ""an older but well cared for Jetta, stored in an impeccable clean garage."" The adjudicator said she was not convinced that any of the reasons provided by Volkswagen ""were of sufficient magnitude in the location of the corrosion to be its cause.""Â She also noted that three technicians that inspected the vehicle suggested it was corrosion covered under the warranty. George Iny, with the consumer advocacy group Automobile Protection Association, said he's not surprised by the potential causes cited by Volkswagen. He saidÂ automakers have a template for rust cases that includesÂ 18 reasons why corrosionÂ might have occurred. ""In many cases, they would just throw as manyÂ as they can and hope that one or two will stick. They really need only one for the judge to be convinced they are not responsible,"" he said. He calls it ""laughable"" that Volkswagen would say bird droppings are responsible for the rust on vertical surfaces on the lower part of the car. Iny said his organization has heard from dozens of Volkswagen owners who have had difficulty getting their corrosion warranties honoured. As a result, his groupÂ has posted tips on its website. Iny noted Volkswagen last year reduced itsÂ warranty from 12 to seven years, which he said is still good coverage by industry standards.Â  ""The impression we have is that they're applying that reduction retroactively and they're not supposed to do that,"" he said. A spokesperson forÂ Volkswagen Canada,Â Thomas Tetzlaff, saidÂ the automakerÂ takes all matters of quality very seriously and always honours the full terms of its warranties. He said while the companyÂ respects the court's decision, it is now considering whether to appeal. Iny said Hudston'sÂ case is a template for other Volkswagen owners facing rust problems. He said people can't go to court and simply say, ""I have a warranty and my vehicle is rusting."" He said vehicle ownersÂ need an expert or, at the very least, a report from an expert. Hudston, who has owned numerous Volkswagens and thinks they're excellent cars, said it was the company's own actions that led him to continue his fight. ""They didn't seem to want to hear me. They, in fact, seemed to be stonewalling me and I guess that insulted me. I expect to be respected by the companies I buy products from,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/warranty-corrosion-volkswagen-group-canada-small-claims-court-1.5363613,[],N/A197,Brittany Spencer,2020-01-21T00:00:00.887Z,Medical Society of P.E.I. working with province to recruit more doctors,"The province has signed an agreement to partner with the Medical Society of P.E.I. to create a plan to recruit more doctors to the Island.

The 47-year-old chief financial officer has been living under house arrest since December 2018, when she was released on $10 million bail pending the conclusion of proceedings to determine if she should be sent to the United States to face fraud charges related to allegations that she violated U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. In a five-day hearing starting Monday, aÂ judge will hear arguments on so-called double criminality. CBCÂ brings you up to date on the arguments for and against as well as the background of the case. A B.C. Supreme Court judge has to decide if the offenceÂ American prosecutors have accused MengÂ of committing would be prosecutableÂ if the alleged conduct had occurred in Canada. This is a principle known as ""double criminality,"" and it is at the core of the Extradition Act. The Act saysÂ the conduct doesn't have to be ""named, defined or characterized"" the same way on both sides of the border, but it would have to be punishable by jail time in Canada. For Meng to be extradited, the Crown must prove double criminality. The U.S. Department of Justice has charged MengÂ with bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The allegations arise from a series of Reuters articles in 2012 and 2013 that claimed HuaweiÂ had misrepresented its relationship with Skycom, a firm accused of offering to sell U.S. computer equipment to an Iranian telecommunications company in violation of U.S. economic sanctions. The articles alleged that SkycomÂ â€” which Huawei described as a local partner in IranÂ â€” was in fact controlled by the Chinese telecommunication giant. In response to concerns raised by banking executives, Meng allegedly met with an HSBC executive in a Hong Kong restaurant on Aug. 22, 2013, to give a PowerPoint presentation denying the relationship. U.S. prosecutors say HSBC and other banks continued their business relationship with Huawei based on Meng's assurancesÂ â€” putting themselves at risk of violating U.S. economic sanctions and criminal prosecution. Meng's lawyers claimÂ her conduct would not be prosecutable if it had occurred in Canada because Canada did not have the same economic sanctions against Iran at the time Meng's extradition warrant was sworn. In a written argument filed in advance of this week's hearing, they frame the issue this way: ""A walks into a bank in Canada. B works for the bank and asks A whether her company is doing business in Iran. A misrepresents to B that her company is not doing business in Iran. The bank then processes financial transactions in Canada for A's company related to Iran,"" the defence lawyers write. ""The fundamental question is whether A has committed the crime of fraud in Canada. The answer is no. Since Canada does not prohibit A's company doing business in Iran, there is no risk of deprivation to the bank under Canadian law."" Lawyers for Canada's attorney generalÂ sayÂ the alleged offence is fraud â€” which is a crime in both the U.S. and Canada. The Crown says the decision the judge has to make gets at the heart of Canadian extradition law, which is ""conduct based""Â as opposed to ""offence matching."" They say the object of the hearing is not to compare specific elements of laws in each country, but to consider the ""essence"" of the alleged offence. They say the judge may consider American economic sanctions to provide contextÂ â€” but only as a means to understand why the bank might have faced problems by trusting Meng's word. ""The fact that Canada may have different sanctions against Iran than the United States should not distract the court,"" the Crown claims. ""Deceit and risk of loss are at the heart of the conduct."" It's tough to say. There are not a lot of similar cases of people facing extradition because of alleged violation of U.S. economic sanctions. Vancouver lawyer Gary Botting, who has written a book on extradition between Canada and the U.S., says if B.C. Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes followsÂ recent precedent, she may side with the Crown. Botting says in the last decade, with theÂ blessing of the SupremeÂ Court of Canada, courts have moved away from superimposing a complete set of facts into a Canadian setting to determine double criminality. ""[They've said]Â if there is any kind of aspect of the lawÂ â€” like the lowest common denominator of the lawÂ â€” that is criminal, then it becomes criminal in Canada."" But Botting says because of the unusual nature of the case and itsÂ complicated circumstances, the judge might want to look further back for precedent. ""She'll say, 'No this isn't criminal in Canada.' How can we arrest somebody who's done something in Hong Kong to a bank registered in England?"" he says. ""What jurisdiction does the United States have or would Canada have?Â That's the situation."" If double criminality is not met, the extradition proceedings would be over, although the Crown could appeal. But if the Crown wins, the next significant court dates for MengÂ will occur in May as part of the lead-up to a hearing in June to address Meng's allegations that her rights were violated during her arrest at Vancouver International Airport. If that hearing goes ahead, Meng will claim that Canadian authorities conspired with American authorities to mount a covert criminal operation against her at the time of her detention and arrest. She will also seek to have the extradition proceedings tossed out in relation to her claim she is being used as a pawn by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would intervene in Meng's case if doing so would achieve a better trade deal with China.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-arrest-anniversary-blog-post-1.5380500 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/huawei-iran-syria-meng-china-1.4970107 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-huawei-canada-china-1.5187662 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/huawei-meng-extradition-millions-iran-1.4942164 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-disclosure-documents-1.5391535,N/A199,James Devine,2020-01-21T09:00:00.675Z,Why Iran has little interest in a 'Trump Deal' with the White House,"This column is an opinionÂ by James Devine,Â an associate professor at Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B., whose research focuses on the politics and foreign policy of Iran.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. Iran's growing tension with the U.S. might seem irrational from a Western perspective, but from Tehran's point of view it makes perfect sense. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Iran last week toÂ accept a new ""Trump Deal""Â to replace the old, now defunct, Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement. Given the extreme events of recent days, which saw TehranÂ narrowly avert war with the United States, shoot down a civilian airliner andÂ face renewed domestic unrest, one might think that the regime would be ready to talk. However, Iranian PresidentÂ Hassan Rouhani, often described as a moderate,Â rejected Johnson's appeal outright. There are a number of reasons why Tehran is not interested in negotiating with the Trump administration. First and foremost, Iran thought it already had a deal. Western critics of the JCPOA are quick to point out the many compromises Barack Obama made when theÂ U.S. signed the 2015 agreement, but Tehran also felt it had made painful concessions. The JCPOA did not put an end to all sanctions against the Islamic Republic, only those related to its nuclear program. Moreover, when the deal was in effect, the Iranian government complained that the U.S. used loopholes to keep as many sanctions in place as possible. Even if we are not sympathetic to Tehran's complaints, it would be unrealistic to expect them to reopen talks. If they were to negotiate a ""Trump Deal,"" what would there be to stop future U.S. administrations from demanding more concessions later on? Tehran is also reticent because Trump would surely insist that Iran give up its regional influence, forcing it to withdraw from Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. While Tehran may have extended its reach during the Arab Spring, Iran's leadership likely sees its latest regional moves as defensive rather than ambitious. The instability in Syria and Iraq threatened to sever their alliance networks and create dangerous power vacuums that could be occupied by hostile Sunni extremist groups or the U.S. Trump would also undoubtedly call for Iran to decommission its extensive missile system. From the West's perspective, these weapons are part of Iran's strategy for regional hegemony. From Tehran's perspective, they are essential parts of its deterrence strategy. Without nuclear weapons,Â Iran's missilesÂ are the main thing standing in the way of potential American and/or Israeli military strikes. Complying with Trump's demands would therefore leave the state defenceless, and invite the U.S. to keep pressuring the regime until it is finally toppled. Given the weight of U.S. power, one might think that Iran has no choice but to renegotiate, particularly if Washington is truly committed to forcing the issue. The Islamic Republic, however, has been remarkably resilient, and probably feels like it still has some cards to play. When Trump scrapped the JCPOA, Iran looked to the Europeans as a means of escaping economic and diplomatic isolation. Once it became clear that the EU could not play that role, Tehran turned to brinksmanship, provoking crises with the U.S. by shooting down an American drone, reportedly having allied militia forces in Iraq fire rockets into American installations, and possibly bombing Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Tehran is essentially playing a game of ""chicken,"" predicated on the belief that the U.S. is at least as averse to war as they are. Therefore, with each escalating crisis, Iran is presenting Trump with a choice; ease-off his strategy of ""Maximum Pressure"" or allow America to get dragged into an all-out conflict. By killing Qassem Soleimani, the U.S. signaled that they could play the brinksmanship game, too. However, earlier last year when Trump called back airstrikes after Iran downed a U.S. drone, he tipped his hand. He may want a new deal with Iran, but not at the cost of war. So, despite U.S. claims to have ""re-established deterrence,"" Iran is unlikely to embrace a ""Trump Deal"" with the White House. And in Tehran's perfect world, the Democrats will win the next election and the new president will walk U.S. policy back from the brink. In the meantime, Tehran will likely continue its strategy with cyberattacks and lesser provocations until it builds to another crisis.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-iran-united-states-strategy-1.5433090,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-uranium-enrichmant-nuclear-deal-1.5428896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458,N/A200,Connell Smith,2020-01-22T11:53:21.163Z,Millidgeville apartment plan fails to get green light from Saint John PAC,"Saint John's planning advisory committee surprised the people backing a Millidgeville apartment project Tuesday by recommending against the proposal. The plan, by developer Charles Bird, would seeÂ two, four-storey buildings placed on a former church property on Millidge Avenue. It is being recommended by city planning staff, who say the location isÂ in an ""intensification"" area dedicated to greater density. But opponents crowded the two small rooms being used for the committee hearings Tuesday night. The committee also received 37 letters about the project, the vast majority opposed. Many raise concerns about the density and height of the project, which would be placed on a 1.9-acre lot (about seven-tenths of aÂ hectare).Â  Â Â  Â  Neighbour Hazel Kerr described the profile the buildings would create as ""a blot on the horizon,"" when compared to the single family homes surrounding it.Â  ""It's great that the city needs apartments, but there's a right place and a wrong place,"" said another opponent, Yuriy Klitinskiy. Gary Sullivan, Saint John council's representative on the advisory committee,Â is also a Millidgeville resident. HeÂ made the motion to recommend against the 88-unit development.Â  ""I've had a really hard time with this,"" said Sullivan. ""I know it will be a quality project, I just don't think it's the right thing for that area."" The amount of opposition caught the developers off guard. ""We didn't expect 37 people to show up against this. â€_ We had knocked on all the doors, we thought we understood how the community felt,"" said engineer Andrew Toole, who was representing the proponent on the application. Toole said he would reach out to some of theÂ neighbours toÂ address their concerns before the proposal goes to a city council vote on Feb. 10. A second apartment project, planned for the Gothic Arches site on the city's Central Peninsula got a unanimous recommendation for approval from the committee. A series of supporters spoke in favour of the proposal, which would see a seven-storey building with 83 high-end units constructed on the Wentworth Street property.Â  Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-opposition-nimby-height-variance-planning-1.5435711,[],N/A201,Michael Smee,2020-01-21T13:49:48.808Z,Province eyeing changes that could see developers hire their own building inspectors,"The City of Toronto is pushing back against a provincial government proposal that could give developers the power to skirt the rules surrounding municipal building inspections. The Certified Professionals Program would allow architects and engineers to undergo additional training in the work that city inspectors do. Developers could then hire the newly-minted professionals, instead of calling in cityÂ inspectors to approve their progress. ""Toronto Building staff do not support the introduction of a program whereby builders would be allowed through legislation to hire designers to assume the plan review and inspection roles and responsibilities on behalf of municipalities,"" Will Johnston, the city's chief building official, wrote in a report to the planning and housing committee. ""There are a number of concerns with this model, including potential conflicts of interest."" Even if the proposal is eventually approved, it may have a tough time getting architects onboard. The Ontario Association of Architects, which regulates the profession, weighed in last November in a letter to the province. Â ""The development industry may have pitched this to government as a cheap and simple way to to get building approvals faster,"" the letter reads in part. ""As risk is transferred from municipalities to individual practitioners, the profession's liability would increase, and higher insurance costs would directly translate into higher building costs."" Adam Tracey, the association's manager of policy and government relations, warned those extra costs would likely be passed on to the public. ""There will be some kind of cost transfer from municipalities back on to homeowners and business owners,"" he said. ""Somebody has to pay for it. It's not going to be done for free."" The proposal is part of larger discussion paper, circulated by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing among professionals in the building industry last fall. The aim of the consultation, according to a statement from the ministry to CBC Toronto, is ""modernizing and transforming the delivery of building code services to help speed up the construction of new housing and building projects, and better support Ontario's $38-billion building industry."" Builders have been complaining for years about red tape that's slowing down the building process. They've been asking for a more streamlined system. As things stand now, every builder â€”Â from single-home contractors to the largest developers â€”Â must adhere to the Ontario Building Code when erecting a new structure. Municipalities enforce the code, signing off on each stage of construction, from the original building permit application, through foundation work, framing, plumbing, and other work normally done by tradespeople. Ultimately, after a final inspection, the city issues an occupancy permit. The only permits not covered would be those that affect personal safety, such as electrical inspections, according to Joe Vaccaro, CEO of the Ontario Home Builders Association, which has also been involved in the consultations. Under the new model, developers would be allowed to hire their own certified professionals, rather than have city inspectors visit the site, according to Johnston and Vaccaro, who's in favour of the certified-professionals model. ""We are struggling to get permits, we are struggling to get inspections done in a timely way,"" Vaccaro told CBC Toronto. ""And when those delays happen it backs up the entire project. So, now the idea here is to get people in their home sooner and safer."" But Johnston said municipal regulators are essential in ensuring new buildings are properly constructed. ""What's important to Toronto Building is that we have a robust regulatory system where the public can have confidence that the buildings that they work and that they live in, that they visit, are safe,"" he said. ""The best way to achieve that in my view is to have a system where you have independent oversight of the building design and construction process."" The ministry would not agree to an interview with CBC Toronto. But in an email, a spokesperson maintained no decisions on streamlining the system have been made. ""Modernizing and transforming the delivery of Ontario's building code services will take time and this is the beginning of the conversation,"" Conrad Spezowka wrote. ""Consultation feedback is currently being reviewed and no decisions have been made."" Although the province has not provided details of the proposed changes, it has stated that the idea to establish certified professionals in Ontario is based on a British Columbia model.Â  But Maura Gatensby, a B.C. architect and certified professional, said only the cities of Surrey and Vancouver have opted to let certified professionalsÂ bypass municipal inspections. The issue is scheduled to be discussed at Wednesday's meeting of the planning and housing committee, as part of a broader discussion on possible changes to the way the Ontario Building Code is administered.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/province-eyeing-changes-that-could-see-developers-hire-their-own-building-inspectors-1.5434037,[],N/A202,Don Pittis,2020-01-20T09:00:32.906Z,Statistics are great unless they measure the wrong things: Don Pittis,"If prices are rising byÂ about twoÂ per cent, asÂ inflationÂ data is likely to show this week, why did one of my newspaper subscriptions just go up by 17Â per cent? And if wages are rising at about four per cent, as recent jobs data has shown, why are some provincial governments insisting thatÂ wage increases be held below one per cent? AsÂ house prices go through the roof, the fact that the price of the biggest purchase Canadians make in their lives is not included in our inflation statistics makes it easy to see why many young people have expressed doubts about the accuracy of those figures. It is a struggle that Statistics Canada faces every day as it tries to sketch out with numbers an authenticÂ picture of the reality Canadians experience. But Oxford fellow and bestselling author of Age of DiscoveryÂ Chris Kutarna says the task is far more complicated than many statisticians like to admit. KutarnaÂ worries that Statistics Canada'sÂ planÂ to plunge into the oceanÂ of ""Big Data"" soÂ beloved ofÂ retailers and credit card companies â€” described last week by chief statistician Anil AroraÂ â€”Â will inevitably create bias in the results simply because we are measuring the wrong things.Â  ""One of theÂ terrifying and most fundamental sources of risk is that we only consider what we're now measuring as real,"" said Kutarna, on the phone from London, England. For example, long-standing data sets built on debt, spending, prices and gross domestic product simply close the door onÂ values such as family, respect, happiness and speciesÂ extinction. ""There is far more that is real and not being measured than there is that is real and we are measuring it,"" said Kutarna. One practical example from his book is the failure of modern statistics to measure the value of the online encyclopedia Wikipedia which, despite providing value to billions, adds less to GDP figures than the old Encyclopedia Britannica which reached far fewer people. In a recent speech, Stephen Poloz, governor of the Bank of Canada, described an economy changing so fast that our statistical models fail to grasp it. Poloz paraphrased the Solow Paradox, the observation by economist Robert Solow thatÂ computers had led to an increase in productivity everywhere but in the statistics. Poloz suggested GDP isÂ being understated by as much as twoÂ per cent. One example he offered was theÂ way so many companies are distributing computer services to the cloud, turning whole computer divisions into a budget line item. ""How does StatCan deal with that?"" asked Poloz. Last week,Â AroraÂ boasted to a gathering of the Empire Club that Statistics Canada was respected everywhere as a global leader, but he acknowledgesÂ it is constantly struggling to keep up with changing technology and the shifting understanding ofÂ how the world works. ""Look, that's what statistics is, right? To take what are evolving concepts, nebulous concepts, things that haven't even taken a lot of shape and then quickly try to turn them into numerics,"" said Arora in an interview. The statistics chief calls it a ""team sport"" where governments and individuals need to decide which of the millions and millions of things that could possibly be measured shouldÂ be addressed by the some 5,000 employees at Statistics Canada. Their job, he says, is to bring scientific rigour to the process, so that the numbers are as accurate as possible. ""This is always going to be a journey,"" said Arora, addingÂ that finding and incorporating into our figuresÂ what have so far been labelled intangibles may be a never-ending task.Â  Part of that journey that those employees are now undertaking is the attempt to mine the immense bodies of information embedded in Big Data, thoseÂ traces of activity we leave behind when we do almost anything on the internetÂ from buying to searching. Not only are they readily available for quick analysis but they reduce the employee hours required in traditional surveys.Â  ""Alternate sources of data are increasing exponentially and weÂ have the technologies and the mechanisms to convert them to public good with high quality statistics,"" said AroraÂ in his speech. When it comes to the inadequacies of GDP, a big part of the problem has less to do with Statistics Canada than how we continue to use familiar indicators that may be out of date. Arora says the University of Waterloo's Canadian Index of WellbeingÂ includes 200 indicators â€” from crime and safety to sustainable growth â€” most of which come from Statistics Canada data. But it's GDP that gets the attention. Statisticians are always groping to find the data sets that matter. But even in areas we think we know and understand, statistics are merely an indicator â€” an estimate, of reality. Things we don't understand are, by definition, even harder to measure. ""We live in this culture where what is real is what we measure,"" saidÂ Kutarna, ""ThatÂ the things we measure are reality."" In which case, a certain amount of healthy skepticism, whetherÂ about this week's inflation numbers,Â about GDP, productivity or the many other financial statistics that are often offered as solid immutable facts, may well be in order.Â Â  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/statistics-canada-bias-1.5429156,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-canada-1.4505207 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inflation-canada-world-1.5419612 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-canada-jobs-1.5412808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/university-college-wages-pay-gap-1.5426250 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gordon-kutarna-economic-resurgence-decline-1.3903433,N/A203,Anonymous,2020-01-20T05:53:48.094Z,"Ted Hughes, B.C.'s first conflict-of-interest commissioner, dead at 92","Ted Hughes, B.C.'s first conflict of interest commissioner who also led more than a dozen public inquiries on issues from child protection to sexual discrimination in the justice system, died on Friday, Jan. 17.

He also served as conflict of interest commissioner for the Northwest Territories and Yukon. In addition, he led numerous investigations and commissions including one in 2005 that followed the violent death of a child in foster care.

Soon after his appointment as Conflict of Interest Commissioner in 1991, Hughes accepted the task of investigating the conduct of Vander ZalmÂ in connection with the sale of his theme park outside Vancouver to Tan Yu, a Taiwanese businessman. Hughes found that the premier had arranged a meeting with the finance minister and a luncheon with the B.C. Lieutenant Governor for Yu, receiving an envelope full of cash from the buyer. In his report, Hughes concluded that Vander Zalm mixed his personal business with the public interest throughout the negotiation and sale, in violation of his own conflict of interest guidelines.Â  ""Hughes just did a meticulously thorough report, laid out all the facts, and said the premier is guilty of conflict of interest and that was the word,"" said Les Leyne, theÂ Victoria Times Colonist's political columnist. ""He delivered the word, everybody accepted it. The premier quit about three or four days after the report landed."" While Hughes's reputation spread, along with demand for his services as an inquiry commissioner, his wife Helen Hughes entered municipal politics in Victoria. She served 18 years as a city councillor and took on volunteer roles.Â  Saanich councillor Susan Brice first met Hughes back in 1988 while she was the mayor of Oak Bay when he invited her to join a review of B.C.'s justice system. ""I have felt probably over the last 25 to 30 years he might be one of the most significant Canadian figures who was called upon to review huge social issues,"" said Brice.Â ""We are all grieving, we know it was a life well-lived."" Brice says Hughes hadÂ been in hospital over the last few weeks with declining health. For their public service, both Ted and Helen were appointed members of the Order of Canada and received honorary doctorates from the University of Victoria. Ted Hughes also heldÂ honorary degrees from the University of Saskatchewan and Royal Roads University, and has been awarded numerous accolades for his volunteer work. He acted as chair for the Saskatoon City Hospital board of governors, the Saskatchewan Cancer Foundation, Juan de Fuca Hospitals in Victoria and the Vancouver Island CNIB capital fundraising drive.

The woman, whose identity is protected by the process, alleges that in 1971 a man who worked as a guidance counsellor for the federal Department of Indian Affairs Department, as it was then called, told her it was his job to take her to St. Michael's Indian Residential School in Duck Lake, Sask., about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. She says the man sexually assaulted her while they were on their way to the school. The case was filed under the independent assessment process created through the wider Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement to adjudicate individual claims of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and to determine compensation. Last week, a B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled her claim falls outside the scope of the agreement, because the woman was not yet enrolled at residential school at the time of the alleged sexual assault, and because the accused was not an employee of the school. She further noted the alleged assault did not happen on school property. In rendering this decision, the judge upheld three earlier rulings that came to the same conclusion. In her ruling, B.C. Supreme Court Justice B.J. Brown called the case and its outcome ""troubling,"" but noted that she is not precluded from pursuing a claim ""through other means."" Angus called the case ""appalling,"" and the judge's position ""ridiculous."" Angus says he believes it's part of a pattern of tactics used to block some residential school survivors from receiving compensation. He cited multiple cases of claims that have been denied over the years, including those brought by former students of St. Anne's residential school in Fort Albany, Ont. ""What we have seen time and time and time again is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors,"" Angus told reporters Monday in Ottawa. He is calling on Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett to intervene in this particular case and immediately award compensation to the woman. But he also says a parliamentary committee should conduct a broader review of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said.

Fisher, 50, formerly known as Kevin Daniel Hudec, was charged in March 2018Â with possessing and making child pornography, followingÂ an investigation by theÂ Saskatchewan Internet Child Exploitation (ICE) Unit.Â  Two years earlier, under his old name, Fisher received a long-term offender designation after being convicted of child porn-related offences. Fisher's name change was listedÂ in the Saskatchewan Gazette on March 2, 2018 â€” while he was under investigation, and just weeks before he was arrested on the charges currently before the court.Â  The Saskatchewan Ministry of Justice is considering changing the law to banÂ sex offenders from changing names. Fisher is charged with accessing, possession and making child pornography and failing to comply with an order prohibiting him from accessing child pornography. The investigation into the current charges began after a concerned phone call from officials at the Oskana Community Correctional Centre in Regina. Court heard on Monday, Fisher was making and receiving phone calls there in 2017, and officials were concerned about the potential subject matter, so they called ICE. Const. Peter Froh of the Regina Police Service working for ICE was given the case and began his investigation in January 2018.Â  Froh told the court Fisher was using a phone system known as Interactive Male. Froh said Fisher could leave and hear messages from other users. FrohÂ had transcriptions and recordings of the conversations made, which were submitted as evidence. The agreed statement of facts describes Interactive Male as a telephone service for men over 18 years of age.Â  Users can record a greeting which helps them connect with other users. The court heard a recording of Fisher's greeting, in which he describes his interests as ""foot fetish, young girls and taboo."" He invites others with similar interests to contact him. The service allows for live chat or recorded messages. Froh said the service's purpose was ""predominantly sexual."" Froh said Fisher's account made 346 calls using Interactive Male. He said the account was created using a credit card in June 2017. In one call, Fisher speaks with a man known as Jeff, who Froh later determined was in Michigan.Â In the conversation, Froh said ""Jeff"" discussed his 10-year-old daughter. This prompted Froh to contact the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Froh was asked by the Crown to read or describe the details of three messages received by Fisher from unidentified users. In two messages, one man describes a sexual assault of a person under the age of 10. In a third message, the sender described a sexually explicit act involving a child. Froh said he believed all three a constituted child pornography by definition in the criminal code of Canada. The Crown closed its case on Monday. The defence will present its case in June.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-man-child-porn-trial-1.5433507,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/48-year-old-regina-man-facing-several-child-pornography-charges-1.4600203 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/david-donald-stryker-moves-to-regina-1.5418126,N/A206,Sarah Morin,2020-01-20T21:37:40.072Z,Loss of youth centre the latest blow to Hillsborough,"After losing its bank and grocery store, the village of Hillsborough is about to suffer another loss.Â  The Hillsborough Drop In centre, which offers free services for kids aged 10 to 17, will close at the end of February because of a lack of funding.Â  The centreÂ offers youth in the area a safe place to hang out and relax on week days after school from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.Â  Lynda Carey, theÂ executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Riverview, which runs the program, said she's concerned about what the loss will mean for the community of 1,200 people and what the kids will do for fun once the program closes. ""Before we came, the village did indicate that there was a significant number of RCMP calls for mid-afternoon, late afternoon vandalism and mischief,"" Carey said, adding that those calls weren't happeningÂ a year later.Â  ""I'm afraid that if we're not there, this sort of might reappear."" The two-storey centre in Hillsborough, about 24 kilometres south of Riverview, began offering a variety of programs six years ago. They includeÂ physical recreation, planned trips, foosball, video games, cooking, arts and crafts, homework space and computer access for children and teens. Children and teens from Hillsborough, Hopewell Cape and Riverside-Albert use the program. About 75 kids are enrolled in the program this year, as of the beginning of January.Â  ""For some events, we've had up to 50 kids in that building because it's something that they're really looking forward to doing,"" Carey said. On quieter days, six or seven kids still go to the building to work on homework.Â  The Riverview Boys and Girls Club gets 90 per cent of its funding from local grants, but about $30,000 was cut in December. Carey said $30,000 is half what's needed to run the Hillsborough centre. ""When you lose that kind of money â€_ it's hard to think how are you going to find that in such a short period of time, but we're hopeful.""Â  The Riverview Boys and Girls Club has an operating budget of $865,000. That money is divided among 12 programs run by the club, including the Hillsborough centre.Â  Carey said it seems like there are more non-profit organizations in the greater Moncton area and only so much money to go around, so she understands why a donor may have wanted to support another non-profit this year.Â  A town hall meeting will take place Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. at the centre, at 61 Academy St. in Hillsborough, to talk about its future.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/hillsborough-drop-in-centre-closes-1.5433032,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/hillsborough-grocery-store-closing-1.5340821,N/A207,Anonymous,2020-01-22T05:25:05.406Z,Burnaby RCMP seek public tips after woman grabbed from behind,"Police in Burnaby are asking for help in locating a suspect after a women was grabbed from behind while walkingÂ in the 7200 block of Gray Avenue on Sunday around 11 p.m. PT.

""It's just going to take us a little bit longer."" Williams said his fire department can respondÂ to one or two off-road rescues a year.

Security footage shows aÂ four-door sedan stoppingÂ in front of the trailer. Then aÂ passenger gets out, and the car takes off. Williams said the thief used aÂ hand tool to pry the open the door of the trailer. On the video, the car returns a few minutes later and the passenger throws a number of items into the backseat of the car. Then the passenger returnsÂ toÂ the trailer and grabsÂ more items. The individual gets back intoÂ the vehicle again, and the car takes off. ""It was kind of disappointing to say the least,"" Williams said.Â  The tools were sharedÂ by volunteer fire departments in North Lake, Meductic, Canterbury and Debec.Â  The local departments raised the money to buy the equipment.

The study, published this month in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at 3.1 million children born in Ontario between 1990 and 2016 and examined who died and from what cause between the ages of one and 24. Researchers excluded those who died in their first year of life, saying those deaths are generally due to congenital anomalies or other causes that are not readily preventable. They found boys and young men had a greater tendency to die, especially starting at age 14, and were three times more likely to do so than young women by age 24. Deaths due to injury also increased after age 14, while intentional causes such as suicide accounted for one in five male deaths from injury between the ages of 15-24, and one inÂ six female deaths from injury in that age group. The study says nearly half of injury deaths were due to accidental poisoning or overdose. Transport accidents were the second leading cause of injury-related death for all sexes from age 15 onwards, accounting for roughly a third. But it notes not all deaths had a documented cause, and it was not known which were confirmed by autopsy or an on scene investigation. Some suicides can be misclassified as accidental poisonings, which could mean more teen deaths were due to suicide than the data reflect, the study says. Lead author Dr. Joel Ray, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, said the jump in deaths during adolescence, particularly in boys, is ""likely"" due to an increase in risk-taking behaviours, but said biological factors and changes may play a role in those behaviours as well. In any case, the study shows more mental health supports are needed for teenagers and preteens, he said. ""We have this upswing [in deaths]Â right around this age in which we would argue strongly that a lot of these deaths are actually preventable and definitely untimely,"" said Ray, who is also affiliated with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.

The $407-million hospital has been plagued by leaking water, first with defective insulation panels in the outside walls, then with a leaky roof also caused by faulty insulation panels. The SHNB has also had issues with the building's drinking water system,Â which was deemed unsafe to drink due to high levels of lead or copper. The documents the NDP released Tuesday were obtained via a freedom of information request for correspondence related to the water damage, roof leaks and structural concerns with the roof of the SHNB.Â  Opposition Leader Ryan Meili said Tuesday that documents received through SaskBuilds and the Saskatchewan Health Authority contained troubling information. ""[The contractor]Â just powered ahead with a roof that they wound up replacing which means sections of the facility did not open,"" Meili said. ""It means patients not being able to access that space. It even meant some concerns about patient safety as there was fear of roof tiles actually falling in parts of the hospital that were being used."" Meili said the government needs to disclose why they opened the building despite the concerns about the roof. Access Prairies Partnership (APP) is responsible for building the hospital. It is a consortium led by Graham Design Builders. A government document says testing revealed the roof leakage was caused by the modular insulation panels shrinking. The government has said that APP shouldered the entire cost of fixing the walls and roof. In October, a third-party construction audit of the Saskatchewan hospital project was triggered.Â  The audit will review the quality of materials, equipment, labour and workmanship used during building. It's expected to be completed sometime in the spring. Meanwhile, a process review will look at whether the project adhered to terms in the agreement and use those lessons to apply to future major projects. SaskBuilds Minister Gordon Wyant said in a news release that the government is monitoring the situation at SHNB. ""In any build â€“ be it P3 or traditional â€“ the government does not select or approve individual materials for use during construction,"" Wyant said.Â  ""In the case of the SHNB the selection of products would have been up to APP and its subcontractors. We understand that in this instance, two different products were used but provided by the same manufacturer and the builder is seeking recovery from the supplier."" The release said the government raised the issue of faulty walls in the fall of 2017 and was told by APP there was ""no issue with the roof, which was constructed at the same time but used different material."" It said the roof failure wasn't identified until 2019. Meili said issues surrounding the hospital and other major builds like the power plant in Swift Current and the Regina bypass show that public-private partnership (P3) projects aren't working. He said it's time to stop building P3 projects and to change the procurement system so that local contractors are favoured. ""The vast majority of the major projects through this government have been done by out of province and out of country companies,"" Meili said.

""People have this image of the monster avalanches that occur on huge mountains, but that's just sort of the extreme end of it from our perspective. It can still be a problem on smaller, open slopes,"" said Jennifer Hoffman, a member of Avalanche Canada based in western Newfoundland.Â Â Â  Avalanche Canada is a national not-for-profit organization that educates the public about avalanche hazards and risks.Â  Any slope steeper than 25 degrees has the potential to be hazardous, according to the organization. Hoffman said even on smaller slopes a person can trigger an avalanche themselves, whether it be on foot, snowmobile or skiing and snowboarding. A change in temperature can also be a trigger. Avalanches in eastern Newfoundland are often not thought of as a threat. On Friday, during one of the worst winter storms inÂ recent history, an avalanche triggered in the Battery neighbourhood of St. John's crashed through a home causing extensive damage. It prompted the city and the fire department to partially evacuate residents fromÂ the area.Â  ""The danger is when we have this kind of extreme event of this sudden massive dump of snow, you have a situation where small isolated features cause problems for people,"" Hoffman said. The organization is also warning ofÂ cornices â€”Â overhanging masses of snow. Cornices can suddenly collapse or fall,Â and even small ones can weigh several tonnes. Hoffman said that the snow in avalanches is much like the snow pushed to the end of driveways by snowplows. She said it tends to ""set up"" very quickly.Â  ""A person that's caught in it has a great deal of difficulty of getting out,"" she said. Hoffman's tips in the event you areÂ buried by an avalanche include trying to get to the edge of the moving snow, raising an arm to try to reach the surface and putting a hand over your mouth to create an air space. But the warning from the organization isn't to deter people from getting outside during the winter, Hoffman said â€”Â just a reminder to remain cautious.

Here's why.,"Like many new parents, Meggan Larson was anxious to learn everything she could about keeping her kids healthy. So, she joined community groups and forums on Facebook, hoping to learn the ins and outs of healthy living as she navigated her new role as a parent. What she found instead were piles of warnings about vaccines. ""It seemed like everywhere I looked, there was [a post about] another child being injured by vaccines â€” and not a child getting polio,"" she said. ""It was definitely convincing."" As a result, Larson became ""vaccine hesitant."" Unlike strident anti-vaccination activists known as ""anti-vaxxers,"" those who are ""vaccine hesitant"" don't consider themselves against vaccination necessarily; they are just unsure about the safety and/or efficacy of vaccines. The number of vaccine-hesitant parents worldwide is growing. Last year, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy a Top 10 threat to global health. ""You just kind of go down a rabbit hole of information,"" said Larson. ""It seemed like the more you clicked on links that people would post, the more stories you would see. And it just seemed so loud."" WATCH | CBC Marketplace's Asha Tomlinson is joined by associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health Dr. Vinita Dubey, answering your questions on vaccinations and myths. Have a question? Ask on YouTube here: About half of Canadians have some level of hesitancy, according to the Wellcome Global Monitor, a survey by a U.K.-based health foundation that looks at global confidence in immunization. In its latest 2018 survey, only 53 per cent of Canadians chose ""strongly agree"" when presented with the statement ""vaccines are safe"" while 58 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are effective"" and 76 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are important."" Marketplace sifted through studies and arguments, examined anti-vaccination documentaries and attended an anti-vaxx rally in Washington, D.C., to get a sense of the information being distributed. The team also spoke with more than a dozen vaccine-hesitant and anti-vaxx CanadiansÂ and heard from many more via email. Many of theÂ arguments and scientific studies seemed reasonable, so Marketplace ran them by specialists. Journalists further consulted with toxicologists, vaccinologists, microbiologists, psychologists and academics throughout this investigation, all of whom confirmed the safety and efficacy of vaccines. So, why does anti-vaxx messaging remain so effective at sowing doubt? Some experts point to our cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that help us understand and remember information. The way that misinformation is disseminated on social media manipulates us â€” intentionally or not â€” into wanting to believe it. Dr. Olivier Drouin, a Montreal pediatrician with a background in behavioural psychology, sees these biases at play with parents of his patients. ""They just care deeply about their child, and so those cognitive biases are amplified,"" he said. One bias that vaccine misinformation plays on is our omission bias, or our tendency to prefer inaction over action when we are faced with potential negative consequences, because we will feel less personally responsible for the outcome. Larson says she can relate. ""For me, the worry is paralyzing initially because I don't want to hurt my kids,"" she said. Larson said the misinformation she'd read was convincing, so she was delaying making a decision about vaccination until she felt more sure. ""My kids will be fine for now while I figure out what I'm going to do,"" she recalls thinking. ""And the years just go by â€” and suddenly, you have a five-year-old who's never had a single vaccine."" Another bias that makes us susceptibleÂ to misinformation is our identifiable victim bias, or our tendency to feel more connected to the emotional story of a single victim, rather than a larger cause backed by statistics. If a charity wants to inspire people to donate toÂ its cause, for example, it might tell the story of a single victim rather than explaining why a cause is important through figures and facts. Even though she'd seen the statistics proving the benefits of vaccines, Larson said the individual horror stories were more impactful and sowed doubt. ""I was like, 'Gosh, this is happening all the time, I can't do this to my children,'"" she said. Much of the anti-vaccination information spread online is anecdotal. When parents come to Drouin with doubts about vaccines, he says, they often start with an anecdote they read or a video they saw. ""They always start with the story of somebody â€” either a celebrity,Â or some relative, or their hairdresser, or somebody in their environment who had a personal story â€” so they feel that connection,"" he said. ""I think that's one of the strongest biases I see when it comes to vaccinations."" Another big issue, Drouin says, is a bias called probability neglect, or our tendency to disregard numbers when there's a highly emotional potential outcome â€” even an extremely unlikely one. ""If I'm with my patient, and I speak about the risk of [requiring] a transfusion, for example, it's one in a million. Well, you know, they're not listening to the number,"" said Drouin. His patients immediately start to worry about their child having to be in the ICU and being really sick, he said. ""The minute I mention the risk, it's forgotten,"" he said. ""They're focusing on the vividness of the image it brings to mind."" The bigger the number, the harder it is to put into context, he says. ""What is one in a 100,000 versus a one in a million chance? Like, it's really kind of a strange number to think about,"" he said. ""We don't even really have context about what it means, even though something might be 100 times more likely."" Larson says she struggled with the numbers even after she had decided to vaccinate. ""It was still scary because I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I hope they're not the one in a gazillion who is going to have some horrific reaction,"" she said. So, what convinced Larson to vaccinate? She had started questioning the rhetoric behind the information she was reading and was talking to her doctor about it. ""I started clicking on the sources that anti-vaccine campaigns were linking [to] and realized that most of them were garbage,"" she said. The scientific studies were not the hard evidence she thought they were. ""Once you actually followed it to the conclusion, it didn't actually state at all what [the messaging] said it did."" WATCH | Meggan Larson's children, along with her sister's kids, came down with whooping cough: Just when she was about to book an appointment to vaccinate, Larson's unvaccinated niece came down with whooping cough â€” and it quickly spread to all five of her niece's siblings, as well as to Larson's three kids. It was a scary reminder of how contagious many vaccine-preventable diseases are, she said. ""Coming across someone with whooping cough or polio, I mean, you're going to get it, it's a miracle if you don't."" All of Larson's kids fully recovered and have since been vaccinated, along with the children of her her sister, Tara Hills. Hills spoke out about vaccine misinformation back in 2015, but it has taken LarsonÂ four years to go public about her experience. ""The only reason that I wanted to share my story is because I don't want people to sit in fear anymore,"" she said. Here are some of the most pervasive concerns Canadians have about vaccines, and why experts say we shouldn't worry about them: It's true that vaccines contain chemicals that would be considered toxic at very high doses. But so does pretty much everything humans interact with daily. Even water is toxic in high enough quantities. Although the idea of a ""chemical"" may sound harmful, everything we eat can be broken down into its chemical makeup. A banana, for example, contains dozens ofÂ chemical compounds. The vaccine ingredients that most people are concerned about â€” mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum â€” are presentÂ in very small, non-toxic quantities. Mercury was previously used as a preservative in some vaccines in the form of thimerosal. It was one of the first ingredients that parents took issue with, and there was so much public concern that it was removed from almost all vaccines, despite the fact that it never existed in quantities that would be considered problematic. Vaccines only ever contained 50 micrograms of thimerosal (equal to 25 micrograms of mercury) per 0.5 millilitre dose. For comparison, that's about the same amount of elemental mercury in a three-ounce can of tuna.Â Nowadays, mercury only exists in certain types of flu shots. Formaldehyde is another ingredient often of concern. There is only between 0.1 mg and 0.003 mg of formaldehyde in a single dose, depending on the vaccine. Compare that to a 200-gram pear, which contains 12 mg of formaldehyde, or 120 times as much. Formaldehyde is actually a chemical that your body creates itself as part of the metabolic process. Aluminum is another ingredient people are concerned about. It is also found in very low quantities in vaccines for diseases such asÂ HPV and hepatitis. Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food and water and breast milk. Keep in mind that very few vaccinations contain aluminum, and those that do, only contain 0.85 mg per dose. Compare that to 10-20 mg of aluminum in one tablet of buffered aspirin. Antacids can contain anywhere from 104 to 208 mg of aluminum per tablet, or more thanÂ 100 times more aluminum than any vaccine. The reason it is added to vaccines is because it helps create the immune response needed to develop immunity. Vaccines work by injecting a dead, weakened or partial version of the virus into the body so the immune system can learn what it looks like and how to fight it the next time it is encountered â€” before it gets deep within the body and causes physical harm. Adjuvants, like aluminum, make that dead virus look more threatening than it is in order to activate an immune response, prompting the body to learn how to fight the disease instead of immediately flushing it out. It is important to note that all traces of aluminum (and the rest of the ingredients in the vaccine) would still be flushed completely out of the body within a day or two, leaving behind only the lessons learned by your immune cells. The ingredients don't build up in the body, therefore, receiving many vaccines will not stack up the levels of aluminum or other ingredients. Learn more about aluminum and other adjuvants here. The claim that links vaccines and autism originates from a now-discredited 1998 study published in the prestigious Lancet medical journal by former gastroenterologist Andrew WakefieldÂ titled ""Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children."" There were 13 authors listed on the study, with Wakefield being the lead author. But in 2004, 10 authors retracted the interpretation of the study after ""serious allegations of research misconduct"" were brought to the attention of The Lancet, including allegations of biased selection of patients and unethical, invasive procedures. The journal also found Wakefield had unreported conflicts of interest, namely, that some of the research was funded by lawyers who were acting on behalf of parents suing vaccine manufacturers. As a result, Wakefield lost his medical licence. Many studies have since been done to test his hypothesis, but all scientifically reputable studies found no link. A 900-page analysis by the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) looked at all relevant studies and meta-analysis, finding that ""the mechanistic evidence regarding an association between MMR vaccine and autism is lacking."" This may sound like the science is simply insufficient, but microbiologist Jocelyn SrigleyÂ explainedÂ that in scientific terms, ""lacking"" is tantamount to saying evidence is not just weak, but absent altogether. The biggest and most recent study looking for a correlation between vaccines and autism followed 657,461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 2013. This study compared MMR-vaccinated with unvaccinated children and found ""no increased risk for autism."" This study even looked at sub-factors, such asÂ sibling history of autism, autism risk factors or other childhood vaccinations to see if those factors could combine with a vaccine to create a higher risk. But again, it found no increased risk. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a profitableÂ industry, but vaccines are not big money-makers compared to other drugs. Only two to three per cent of the global pharmaceutical profits come from vaccines, despite the fact that most people on earth are vaccinated. In fact, most childhood vaccines have expired patents, and it's estimated that once a generic drug enters the market after a patent expiration, name-brand sales drop by 80 per cent. Physicians often lose money on the administration of vaccines, and some governments have to incentivise drug companies to keep making them because of the fact that the profit margins are so low. Vaccines take lots of time and money to develop because the regulatory standards are higher than for other drugs since they are being injected into healthy people. They may make some money in the first few years, but they also have to carry the burden of cost for all the years of research and development. Vaccines prevent millions of people from getting seriously sick every year. If you're worried about motives, keep in mind that Big Pharma makes a lot more money off people who are sick than people whom vaccines have kept healthy. Even though we rarely encouter certain diseases anymore, such as pertussisÂ orÂ polio, they are only kept at bay becauseÂ the vast majority of the population is vaccinated. If you talk to older generations, they'll tell you stories of their friends who became deaf, blind, disabled or died from the diseases that vaccines have eliminated in North America. In areas where vaccination rates drop past a certain threshold, we can see resurgence of these diseases, which can be picked up and brought back to countries that had virtually eliminated them. For example, Samoa had a significant drop in vaccination rates over the past few years due in part to anti-vaccination campaignsÂ and an MMR scare after a nurse accidentally mixed up two shots with an expired anesthetic, resulting in two deaths. When measles made it into the community, it quickly infected thousands of people; 81 of those infected died, and almost all of them were babies and young children. Authorities arrested an anti-vaxxer for spreading misinformation during the epidemic while the government was frantically trying to get everyone vaccinated. The only disease that has been entirely eradicated worldwide is smallpox. This was because of a very effective mass-vaccination initiative in the 1960s that managed to drive the disease into extinction. Polio is a candidate for eradication, with only three endemic countries left. Until complete eradication is reached, vaccination is still necessary for highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Measles can live for two hours while airborne, which means if an unvaccinated person entered a room where someone with measles coughed an hour earlier, they would still be likely to catch the virus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccines-trust-1.5181208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955,N/A220,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:34:58.067Z,"Greenhouse gas 12,000 times worse than CO2 shows surprise rise in the atmosphere","A greenhouse gas that can cause 12,000 times more warming per tonne than carbon dioxide is rising unexpectedly in the atmosphere, despite reports by its major producers, China and India, that they've mostly eliminated emissions of the gas. Atmospheric gas measurements at five stations around the world show that emissions of HFC-23 or trifluoromethane reached a record high in 2018 of 15,900 tonnes, reports a study led by Kieran Stanley, a visiting research fellow at the University of Bristol. That's a lot higher than the 2,400 tonnes of emissions of that gas reported by China and India to the United Nations Environment ProgramÂ in 2017, notes the study, published this week in Nature Communications. HFC-23 is a byproduct in the production of the refrigerant HCFC-22, which is a greenhouse gas and depletes the ozone layer. Based on China's and India's reports, scientists had expected to see HFC-23 levels drop 90 per cent between 2015 and 2017 in measurements by the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. Instead, the difference between reported and measured emissions during that period is equivalent to all of Spain's carbon emissions for one year, the researchers estimate. ""Our study finds that it is very likely that China has not been as successful in reducing HFC-23 emissions as reported,"" said Stanley in a news release from the University of Bristol. ""Alternatively, or additionally, there may be substantial unreported production of HCFC-22 at unknown locations, resulting in unaccounted-for HFC-23 byproduct being vented to the atmosphere,"" the study suggests. HFC-23 produced during the manufacture of HCFC-22 was traditionally released into the atmosphere. Under international agreements to protect the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol and its 2016 Kigali Amendment, HFC-23 is supposed to be destroyed.Â However, the phaseout is slower for developing countries such as China and India and isn't officially yet in effect. Nevertheless, both countries were reporting reductions, and India passed a regulation in 2016 requiring incineration of HFC-23.

The onus is also on other countries and airlines to proactively complete their own risk assessment and decide whether it's safe to fly in the region, according to international aviation conventions.Â  ICAO confirmed to CBC News it will look into its conflict zone guidance and compliance once theÂ investigation into the crash is complete.Â  ""All of this depends on the recommendations brought forward by the investigating states,"" ICAO spokesperson Anthony PhilbinÂ said in a statement to CBC News.Â  Iran invited ICAOÂ to provide expert advice as part of theÂ probe. The move came as pressure from the international community mounted for a thorough and transparent investigation into how and why Iran shot the passenger plane out of the sky. Four out of six senior and technical staff ICAO assigned to the case are based out of the agency'sÂ headquarters in Montreal. The team is advising and observing Iran's work to make sure its investigators comply with international requirements. ""Whether they may eventually be required to go to Iran will be up to the states they're assisting as things proceed,""Â PhilbinÂ said of ICAO'sÂ experts.Â  TheyÂ will also work directly with other countries involved in the investigation, including Canada.Â Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday he isÂ encouraged ICAO is involved because its presenceÂ will help ""ensure that these situations no longer happen.""Â  There haveÂ  been six other cases since the 1980sÂ whereÂ ICAOÂ consulted on a deadly aviation crash.Â  More than 30 years ago, the agency had an advisory role after a U.S. navy ship missile shot down an Iran Air jetliner on itsÂ way to Dubai, killing all 290 people on board. Iranian PresidentÂ Hassan Rouhani reminded the world about that 1988 crash in a tweet just days before Iran admitted it mistakenlyÂ shot downÂ Flight PS752. Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/IR655?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#IR655</a><br>Never threaten the Iranian nation. Other cases the UN agency monitored include:Â  More recently, ICAOÂ consulted on the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over Eastern Ukraine in July 2014. The crash killed 298 people, including one Canadian. The investigation found the plane was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian separatists. After MH17, theÂ Dutch Safety Board followed up with a report about the risk of flying over conflict zones andÂ found that countries with ongoing armed conflict are reluctant to close their airspace. The board concluded the aviation parties involved hadÂ not adequately recognizedÂ theÂ risks of the armed conflict in the area. But it also found the current system of assessing risks associated with flying over conflict areas is ""in urgent need of improvement."" ICAOÂ set up aÂ special task force following theÂ MH17 tragedy and created an online tool so countries could better share their conflict zone information. ""Airlines are required to conduct regular risk assessments along their route networks using all available information,"" according to the agency'sÂ website.Â  Kathy Fox, chair of Canada's Transportation Safety Board, was asked last week if the world went far enough implementing the recommendations, and she said no. SheÂ cited a warning included in the DutchÂ report: in countries where there is ""ongoing armed conflict,"" officials cannot be counted on to bar commercial airliners from the airspace on their own initiative.  ""They recognized, when this report was issued, that there were still potential gaps. And unfortunately, we're seeing the results of that,"" Fox said. ICAO has also made a series of updates to its international requirements because of the lessons learned from the shooting down of MH17. That work includedÂ improving its risk assessment manual on civil aircraft operations over or near conflict zones.Â  Countries have also endorsed a manual about safety measures related to military activities that could pose a danger to commercial airliners, as well asÂ guidance on civil and military co-operation in air traffic management.Â However, these amendments won't come into effect until later this year.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/flight-752-plane-crash-icao-joining-investigation-1.5432888,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ps752-flight-iran-missile-1.5422912 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tsb-plane-crash-iran-visit-1.5425971 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/aviation-authorities-want-better-risk-assessment-over-conflict-zones-1.2721550 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-justice-crash-ukranian-arrests-1.5426809,N/A222,Hallie Cotnam,2020-01-21T19:09:14.463Z,Residents rally to keep town's only bank,"The Ottawa Valley community of Beachburg, Ont., population 1,054, is about to loseÂ its only bank.

Court documents say the alleged assault on Scott McLaughlan took place on July 4, 2019, near Second North River, about 28 kilometres west of Moncton.Â The documents were filed Dec. 27. McLaughlan could not be reached by CBC News for a comment, but CUPE 1190 laid out the allegations, quoting union member McLaughlan, in a news release last November.Â  The release said Wetmore and Douthwright drove up to a Department of Transportation roadside work site along Route 112, where McLaughlan and other workers were gathered. Wetmore ""shouted at us, insulted us, using derogatory words and saying road workers were incompetent,""Â McLaughlan is quoted as saying. The union accusedÂ both the Progressive Conservative MLA for Gagetown-Petitcodiac and his assistant of insulting the employees. The release wentÂ on to allege that the situation escalated when Douthwright grabbed McLaughlin by the shoulders and shouted an expletive at him. Union president Brent Wiggins alleged this was not an isolated incident and said in the release that there has been ""repeated harassment"" of highway workers by Wetmore. When reached by the CBC, DouthwrightÂ replied in an email: ""I look forward to telling my story in the proper venue. I have no comment at this time."" Communications director Vicky DeschÃªnes said there would be no comment from the province becauseÂ ""it would be inappropriate to discuss a matter before the courts.""Â  But the alleged assault was addressed in the legislature on three separate occasionsÂ late last year.Â  Robert McKee, the Liberal MLA forÂ Moncton Centre, broached the issue on Nov. 22, 2019, when he outlined the allegations during question period and said, ""we would like to give the minister an opportunity to give his side of the story to the house here this morning."" To which Wetmore replied, in part, ""I've been told that this has been forwarded to the RCMP, so right at the time being I'll have no comment."" McKee then asked Wetmore if he would be willing to step down from cabinet until the matter was fully resolved. Wetmore answered by saying: ""This is an HR [human resources] issue that has been dealt with, and I have no intention of commenting any more until this has been concluded with the RCMP."" McKee accused Wetmore of deflecting and then askedÂ Premier Blaine Higgs about removing Wetmore from his position. ""I can't speak of the particulars of that situation, but I am under the understanding it has been fully dealt with,"" said Higgs,Â who said that because of privacy issues, he wasn't free to discuss what happened. The next week, questions persisted from the Liberals. Lisa Harris, the Miramichi Bay-Neguac MLA, asked the premier specifically how the matter was dealt with and what consequences there were for Wetmore and Douthwright. Wetmore responded again that it was a human resources issue, and anyone wanting to know more should file an access to information request with the province.Â  He then spoke about his success as a minister, a response that surprised Harris. ""Mr. Speaker, it is unreal that the member opposite would switch the conversation when we are talking about a serious allegation.""Â  She again asked if Wetmore would be stepping down. Higgs replied: ""I agree with the member. It is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to have any type of abusive situation, whether it be physical or verbal. We would not tolerate it, and we did not."" He then suggested someone had been disciplined. ""We feel that the disciplinary action was suitable for the situation and that it was done promptly,"" Higgs said. But he did not say what disciplinary action was taken. Higgs said if the RCMP were to investigate, his government would co-operate. An investigation by the RCMP resulted in a charge of assault against Douthwright. He is scheduled for a first appearance in a Moncton court on Friday.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wetmore-douthwright-assault-road-worker-highway-mclaughlan-1.5434988,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/nadine-wilson-assult-charges-withdrawn-1.5375828 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/snow-crab-right-whale-fishing-gear-research-1.5143321,N/A224,Ainsley Hawthorn,2020-01-11T11:30:00.842Z,When every January is dry: The surprising appeal of living without alcohol ,"It's January, a month that many people now observe as 'Dry January' â€” a period to set aside alcohol and focus on health.Â  It's not something I will be observing as a special occasion, because I don't drink at all. I can't remember when I decided not to drink. It was before I turned 19, because my celebration didn't include the traditional first (legal) bar visit.Â It was before I started university, because I was able to enjoy being the only sober person at the end-of-orientation-week party, where I banked some wild stories to recount to my friends once they recovered from their hangovers. I had had the occasional sip of alcohol as a teenager, and I thought it tasted terrible. I never enjoyed the astringent kick of wine, the malty foulness of beer. But, honestly, who does? Alcoholic drinks taste objectively bad to most people at first. As the saying goes, you don't drink them for the taste, and it's likely that if alcoholic beverages were uncoupled from their euphoric effects we wouldn't drink them at all. The difference between me and most of my peers, I suppose, is that I wasn't enthusiastic enough about the idea of getting buzzed to push through the nasty flavour. My choice puzzled my friends at the time. After all, in our society we drink alcohol not only for its pleasurable effects but as a rite of passage. Alcohol is a symbol of our transition into adulthood, and most teenagers are anxious to enjoy adult freedoms and to prove themselves worthy of adult responsibilities. We indulge in alcohol furtively when we begin to feel suffocated by the authority of our parents and guardians. We partake in alcohol openly to celebrate when our numerical age makes us legally (if not actually) independent from them. When I declined a glass or bottle, I often found myself in the hot seat, being grilled on my reasons for abstaining. Not drinking, I've discovered, is one of the few purely personal choices that can make even strangers deeply uncomfortable. It's a singular experience to be questioned about why you don't drink alcohol, because there are a limited number of answers people consider legitimate. An illness, a religious doctrine, a family history of alcoholism â€”Â these seem to be acceptable explanations for abstaining. My reasons? I don't like the taste, I'm having a good time already, I just don't feel like it? These never seem to be good enough, so much so that I've sometimes fallen back on the excuse that there's been alcoholism in my family (which is true, but not a factor) just to cut these awkward conversations short. Why all this public concern over one aspect of my diet? I don't like spicy food or cilantro either, but no one interrogates me about that. Not drinking, on the other hand, is often taken as an affront. This is probably a legacy of the temperance movement, the organized crusade against alcohol consumption that snowballed during the 19th and early 20th centuries and eventually led to prohibition. The temperance movement took a moral stance against alcohol and portrayed drinkers as reckless libertines or hopeless degenerates. As a result, when you say you don't drink, even today, the people around you begin to wonder if you're looking down your nose at them like the temperance teetotallers of yore. Add to that the fact that our society considers alcohol essential for relaxing, socializing, and partying, and the non-drinker becomes a very suspicious animal indeed. Is she a puritanical square, the sworn enemy of all things fun? This heap of cultural baggage makes it difficult for each of us to untangle how we really feel about alcohol from how we're supposed to feel about it, how alcohol really affects our bodies from our expectations of how it should affect them. I know a number of moderate drinkers who've recently given up alcohol after realizing they don't actually enjoy drinking. Alcohol is a depressant. It can lower your inhibitions and relax you, but it can also dampen your mood and make you feel gloomier than you did before. If you're already prone to depression, drinking alcohol may not be a fantastic experience. Others quit drinking because it's getting in the way of their fitness goals (many alcoholic beverages are high in calories but, because they're liquids, don't fill you up) or because they want to save money.Â Newfoundlanders and Labradorians spend $1,056 per person on alcohol each year. Each of us deserves to assess for ourselves whether drinking works for us, our bodies, and our pocketbooks. So, I propose a reality-based reset of our society's approach to alcohol: Whether you'll be enjoying the occasional drink this month or having a dry January, just remember that, if you're of legal age, drinking is an option, not a requirement.

Dan Bobbett, mayor of Paradise, tweeted a warning to residents early Saturday morning: clearing over 75 centimetres of snow off town property will take time. Advice from all sides? Hole up, hunker downÂ and wait, since there's nowhere to go anyway. Some Avalon residents have found uses for the nine- to 10-foot drifts blocking their doors, leaving them wondering how to tunnel out â€”Â and then, of course, how to stomp and flail their way through the drifts to get enough leverage to move the snow around. Others have given up entirely. On Saturday, CBC Radio's Cross Country Checkup opened the national phone lines to hear how Canadians across the country are coping with winter weather. Still snowed in, many callers from Newfoundland shared their stories. Sonja Mills of Port Rexton toldÂ host Duncan McCue that she and her wife, Alicia,Â are passing the time with marathon games of cribbage.Â  ""[We are] really just kind of hanging in there, hoping the power doesn't go out [and] getting prepared for it,"" Mills said. But the couple had a more pressing concern on their minds. As owners of Port Rexton Brewing Company, they strapped on skis Saturday afternoon and braved the weather to check on their beer. ""With the power on ... things are still happening in the brewing tanks, so we're going to go keep an eye on things,"" she told McCue. For Bob Cole, the legendary broadcaster who retired last year after a half-century of work for Hockey Night in Canada, it was a chance to give some old friends an update on what's happening in his home province. ""It took a state of emergency, by the way, to get me on Hockey Night again,"" Cole told Hockey Night in Canada host Ron MacLean on Saturday night before the beginning of the Toronto Maple Leafs-Chicago Blackhawks game. Watch as Bob Cole discusses the blizzard on Hockey Night in Canada: Others took advantage of the snowdrifts for a little thrill seeking. When he looked at the snow-covered streets of St. John's, free of moving vehicles, Matt Wells saw an opportunity. ""I walked out the front door, strapped on the snowboardÂ and then I proceeded on down Prescott, over Duckworth and on down to Water Street,"" Wells told McCue. ""It was surprising, actually, because there was so much snow, it was actually difficult to get any speed up. It was difficult to go faster or pick up any speed because the snow was so deep,"" he said of his ride. Video of Wells' slide through the streets was shared widely on Facebook on Saturday. Wells is originally from the west coast of New ZealandÂ and attended university in Halifax, but only moved to St. John's a few months ago.Â  ""It was probably ill-advised for me to go do it myself. But definitely worth it in the end,"" he says of his ride. There were those who wouldn't let the blizzard get in the way of a fun Saturday night.

Some, like Adam Meyer, turned to the ephemeral. Meyer called in CBC's radio special to read something he'd written while watching the blizzard rage: I moved to St. John's just in time for the greatest winter storm in a generation. Now I stand half-buried in a cold Sahara watching streetlights flicker meekly likeÂ  tea candlesÂ on the verge of being snuffed by the greatest winter storm in a generation.Â  The house rocks and surges like a wooden ship so that when I close my eyes I see icy cliffs, too close, disappear under the frigid surf thrown around by the greatest winter storm in a generation.Â  When the power finally fails the world goes not black, but purple, and from the otherworldly shadeÂ  it's obvious St. John's is a sibling of Pluto; an icy frontier at the edge of system space, in orbit butÂ  made distinct by the distance and cold as a dwarf-planet by the greatest winter storm in a generation.Â  The air around the city feels sick as if decades of jet fuel and international trade routesÂ  have concocted a nasty bug to be slowly purged with each retching gust that spewsÂ  a break-locking, street-clogging mess culminating in the greatest winter storm in a generation.Â  I moved to St. John's in time to witness its cold burial butÂ  tomorrow I will wake and find life in the morning afterÂ the greatest storm in a generation.Â  What a load of snow!!

On the final day of a two-day hearing, the judges peppered a Crown lawyer TuesdayÂ morning with questions about the conduct of a private detective described as a ""traitor"" by a lawyer for Sandeson. Samson,Â a Dalhousie University student,Â was killed in an apartment in south-end Halifax. His body has never been found. A jury convicted Sandeson, 27, a former Dalhousie medical student, of first-degree murder following an eight-week trial that ended in June 2017. TheÂ hearing in the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal got underway yesterdayÂ in a Halifax courtroom with Sandeson's lawyer, Ian Smith, asking for a new trial. The CBC's Blair Rhodes live bloggedÂ from court. Smith focused much of his arguments on Bruce Webb, a retired RCMP sergeant who worked for a private detective agency hired by Sandeson's lawyers to help them prepare for the trial. In the course of his work, Webb interviewed two men â€” Justin Blades and Pookiel McCabe â€”Â  who were in the apartment across the hall from Sandeson and initially told police they didn't see or hear anything the night Samson was killed. But when Webb pressed them, the men changed their story. They told Webb they saw a bleeding man slumped over the kitchen table in Sandeson's apartment. Webb subsequently told a police officer that investigators should requestion Blades and McCabe, which they did. It wasn't until the middle of the trial that Sandeson's lawyers realized that Webb was the reason police reinterviewed Blades and McCabe. The lawyers asked for a mistrial on the grounds that Webb's actions breached Sandeson's privileges as a client, butÂ Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Joshua Arnold refused. Smith argued ArnoldÂ underestimated the seriousness of Webb's actions and its impact on the fairness of the legal process. But Crown lawyer Jennifer MacLellan argued the defence was given adequate opportunity to address the issues with Webb. MacLellan said Arnold found Sandeson's fair trial rights were not infringed upon because the witnesses' evidence would have come out even without Webb having spoken to police. She also noted Arnold determined that while the Crown failed to disclose the information in a timely fashion, there was no violation of litigation privilege. Judges on the three-member Court of Appeal panel spent much of yesterday afternoon and this morning asking MacLellan about Webb's actions. Justice David Farrar questioned Arnold's characterization of Webb ""merely"" telling the police to requestion the witnesses when describing the impact of his actions. ""This is a breach of a duty that Webb had to his client â€_ and it's during the trial process,"" said Farrar. MacLellan reiterated that Arnold found police did not do anything wrong in their handling of Webb's information. She said he considered Sandeson's right to a fair trial against the defence's request for a mistrial. She noted a mistrial is a ""remedy of last resort,"" and a particularly undesirable one seven weeks into a trial.Â  ""Other less drastic remedies have to be considered,"" said MacLellan. ""The trial judge is in the best position to determine in the circumstances of what has happened here if a mistrial is the best remedy."" Smith also argued that a search of Sandeson's south-end Halifax apartment without a warrant was not lawful, because there were noÂ ""exigent circumstances"" that justified their actions. But MacLellan argued the situation was urgent, asÂ at that pointÂ it was a case of suspected kidnapping and therefore an ongoing concern. She noted Sandeson's first statement to police, which he gave voluntarily, raised concerns with police when they compared his answers to his text messages and found out he had liedÂ about meeting Samson that night. He saidÂ police searched Sandeson's apartment because they believed it was the last place Samson had been seen. Smith also claimed that Sandeson's rights were violated by police as their investigation shifted from a missing persons case to a homicide. Sandeson was initially arrested on a kidnapping charge, but Smith said the officers' aggressive line of questioning suggested he was suspected of murder. MacLellanÂ noted that kidnapping is ""not a bloodless crime,"" and that the investigation was at that pointÂ still a kidnapping. She said the phrasing of the officers' questions â€” such as, ""Why won't you help him, Will?'"" â€” suggested Samson was still alive. ""It shows that they'reÂ very sincere in their belief that this is still a kidnapping and it's nothing more than a hunch, or serious fear, that Samson is dead,"" said MacLellan. Sandeson is currently serving a life sentence with no parole eligibility for 25 years. In his closing arguments, Smith said a new trial would allow Sandeson to apply for a stay of proceedings. If that remedy wasn't available to him, Smith said Sandeson could apply to have certain evidence excluded from a new trial, such as the evidence from Blades and McCabe.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-hearing-continues-1.5434312,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/coast-guard-ship-sir-john-franklin-software-winch-problem-1.5433841 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/fatal-snowmobile-crash-new-ross-lunenburg-county-1.5434326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-provincial-park-development-golf-eastern-shore-1.5433792 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/prince-andrew-high-school-name-change-online-forum-1.5433374 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-outbreak-province-sexually-transmitted-infection-1.5433651,N/A227,Yvette Brend,2020-01-22T00:14:52.223Z,"Some layoffs at MEC but more permanent staff to be hired, CEO says in restructuring plan","Mountain Equipment Co-op (MEC) is laying off some of itsÂ 2,400 employees â€”Â but offering permanent positions to many of its casual workers â€”Â as it restructures in a bid to restore its financial health. The outdoor retailer, which lost more than $11 million in the past fiscal year, is aiming to cutÂ costs, and changeÂ what it stocks and how it staffs, according to an online statement from CEO Phil Arrata. The statement was released afterÂ the company's 22 stores across Canada were shut down on Sunday afternoon for a nationwide all-staff meeting, according to employees at several outlets.Â Store managers read a statement outlining the new direction Arrata plans to take MEC. In some stores that meant a handful ofÂ layoffs. MEC declined to confirm a total number. But in his statement, Arrata said the co-op would moveÂ away from using casual employees and hire more permanent staff, and aim to sharpen customer service. More than 950 casual staff will be given full- or part-time jobs, with benefits, Arrata said.Â  ""While MEC is not profit-driven in the same way as the retailers we compete against, we still must be profitable to ensure we deliver great service to our members,"" Arrata said, citing the retailer's co-op model,Â in an open letter to staff posted online Jan. 20.

He had been suffering from dementia. Jones's agent said he died Tuesday evening. In a statement, his family said he died ""after a long, extremely brave but always good-humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD."" In 2016 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which gradually robbed him of the ability to write and speak. Jones's wife, Anna Soderstrom, and children Bill, Sally and Siri, said ""we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades."" With fellow Britons Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and American Terry Gilliam, Jones formed Monty Python's Flying Circus, whose anarchic and surreal humour helped revolutionize comedy. Jones wrote and performed for the troupe's TV series, which ran over five yearsÂ on BBC and was later picked up in the U.S. by PBS, and their films. Jones directed Monty Python's Life of Brian, with a co-director credit with Gilliam on Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life. He went on to direct the non-Python films Personal Services starring Julie Walters and Erik the Viking starringÂ Cleese and Tim Robbins. He also wrote books on medieval and ancient history, presented documentaries, directed films, wrote poetry and wrote the script for the Jim Henson-directed fantasy film Labyrinth. In 2014, the group reunited for a series of shows at London's O2 Arena, one of which was later filmed, entitled Monty Python Live (Mostly). ""His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programs, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath,"" they said. Chapman died in 1989 of cancer, while Neil Innes, the musician often known as the ""seventh Python"" for his contributions to their songs and sketches, died in December. Palin paid tribute to his longtime colleague in a statement given to Britain's Press Association, while on social mediaÂ Cleese, Idle and British comedians Stephen Fry and David Walliams were among those remembering Jones fondly. ""He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian â€” writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have,"" said Palin. You will be very missed old friend. I feel very fortunate to have shared so much of my life with Terry. <a href=""https://t.co/4oNANoIeB2"">pic.twitter.com/4oNANoIeB2</a> ""So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him,"" said Idle. ""It feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently awayÂ â€_Â Two down, four to go,"" said Cleese. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones attended Oxford University, where he began writing and performing with fellow student Palin. After leaving university, he wrote for seminal 1960s comedy series including The Frost ReportÂ and Do Not Adjust Your Set before Monty Python's Flying Circus was formed.

""When you look at the city, all of the easy land has been developed,"" Bill Budd, the city's director of urban planning, told council Monday. He hopes the new bylaw will help fill in the gaps, leading to development in areas previously considered hard to reach.Â  The new Development Charge Bylaw sets out mechanisms to pay for new infrastructure like bridges or water and sewer lines Budd said otherwise would be too costly for private developers to take on.Â  Previously, Budd said if the city opted not to pay for capital costs of something like a bridge, the developer would have been responsible for itÂ before any development could start. Budd said that meant a part of the city dubbed the Vision Lands between Wheeler Boulevard and the Trans-Canada Highway that require new roads, bridges and other water and sewer infrastructure was less appealing to develop. The city has long eyed theÂ Vision Lands, which includes about 1,400 acres of mostly undeveloped property,Â as the next big area for growth in the city.Â  The bylaw passed second and third reading unanimously Monday following a public hearing. No one voiced objections to the bylawÂ in advance of the hearing or during the meeting. ""It's too bad we didn't have this years ago,"" Deputy mayor Pierre Boudreau said. For now, the new bylaw applies onlyÂ to an area along a stretch of Twin Oaks Drive where aÂ new YMCA is under construction in the city's growing north end.Â  However, Budd said the concepts in the bylaw would be used as the basis for future bylawsÂ to implement the system in other parts of the city, such asÂ the Vision Lands. Before a bylaw is introduced, though, Budd said the city will carry out a study to determine what infrastructure may be needed.Â The city paid the costs of the study for Twin Oaks, but said future studies may be cost-shared with developers.Â Â  Budd listed several areas where the bylaw could be used beyond Twin Oaks and the Vision Lands. One example is the area southwest of the Junction development along the corner of Main Street andÂ Vaughan Harvey Boulevard.Â  Ivan Rand Drive branches offÂ Vaughan Harvey through the development, but stops at Jonathan Creek. Another portion starts on Main Street near car dealerships. Budd saidÂ Ivan Rand is meant to be connected, but would require a bridge over the creek. The development charge bylaw could be used to fund that bridge, he said.Â  The city previously used a payment mechanism that changes to provincial legislation meant could not longer apply. That prompted the city to hireÂ Watson & Associates Economists Ltd.,Â a consulting firmÂ that's worked with other cities on preparing similar bylaws.Â  ""I think this will be a model for most municipalities to do this in the future,"" Budd said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-council-development-charges-bylaw-growth-1.5433926,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-ymca-moncton-north-end-1.5343137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-construction-permits-development-1.5315065,N/A231,"Eric Szeto, Katie Pedersen, Asha Tomlinson",2020-01-18T19:18:53.848Z,"Hidden cameras capture misinformation, fundraising tactics used by anti-vaxx movement","They came from across North America, paying $200 each to attend the ritzy event in Washington, D.C., hoping to snag selfies with some of the biggest names in the anti-vaccination movement. For the anti-vaccination activists gathered in the U.S. capital last November, it was also a chanceÂ to strategize on ways to further their cause. And they were more than willing to share those strategiesÂ with the undercover Marketplace journalists who attended the event, posing as activists trying to grow the movement in Canada. TheÂ Marketplace investigation providedÂ a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the anti-vaxx movement, which experts say is largely to blameÂ for a shift in mindset about vaccination. Nearly half of Canadians today have some concernÂ about vaccine safety. ""Take vaccines out of the name â€” that way you won't get flagged,"" said one Virginian woman attending the event. She was speaking about how to get aroundÂ social media filters geared at weeding outÂ anti-vaccination content.Â  WATCH |Â A glimpse inside the anti-vaccination movement: The woman also pointed to another popular tactic: Challenging vaccination policies under the seemingly libertarian banner of ""health freedom,"" ""medical freedom,"" or ""informed consent."" Her own groupÂ is named Virginians for Informed ConsentÂ and has about 1,200 members. She's also gone a step further, making the group almost impossible for the public to find. ""We're secret,"" she said. ""You can't search our name [on Facebook]."" The VIP event attended by Marketplace followed a public rally on Washington's National Mall, where a number of anti-vaccination celebrities â€” Andrew Wakefield, Del Bigtree and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. â€” galvanized loyal activists, eager to speak out against what they claim is a coverup of a massive vaccine injury epidemic. The movement persists despite a scientific consensus among medical professionals, vaccininologists and toxicologists that vaccines are safe and effective.Â  ""Their goal is to create noise, to create uncertainty,"" said Timothy Caulfield, a health law and policy expert and author of The Vaccination Picture, a book debunking anti-vaccination myths. ""Spreading misinformation will create chaos â€” and that's exactly what they've done."" Non-medical exemptions from vaccines have spiked in recent years, as have outbreaks from vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles.Â  In California, where exemption rates reportedly reached 10 per cent or more in some schools, lawmakers passed new laws limiting such exemptions. Last year, Toronto Public HealthÂ passed a motion asking the province to consider removing non-medical exemptions in Ontario. Health officials said exemption rates had more than doubled, to around two per cent, over the past 12 years. But it didn't come without protest: dozens of anti-vaccination activists showed up at city hall to fight that motion.Â  ""People around the world have stopped vaccinating because of the rhetoric that they've read online, that they've had in discussion groups, about how vaccines may be harmful,"" said Dr. Vinita Dubey, of Toronto Public Health. ""At what point are we going to say: the exemption rates are too high, and we're putting the population at risk?"" In October, Vaccine Choice Canada, an anti-vaccination non-profit group, along with five Ontario mothers, launched a constitutional challenge arguing the province's current vaccination policies â€” which force parents to go through a course before getting a non-medical exemption or else risk school suspension for their kids â€” were too onerous and infringed on their rights. The province previously told CBC it would not be considering an end to non-medical exemptions. A few months prior to the constitutional challenge in Ontario, when the government of New Brunswick introduced a bill that would have removed non-medical exemptions, anti-vaxxers gathered in Fredericton to push back against it. At the time, the bill was delayed, though a new bill has since been reintroduced and is currently at second reading. Similar challenges have been launched at statehouses across the United States â€” most recently in New Jersey, where lawmakers voted down a bill to remove non-medical exemptions. ""They would love to be able to predict what we have going on. They can't predict [it],"" James Lyons-Weiler, a well-known activist who runs a U.S. non-profit anti-vaxx group, said at the Washington event. ""Keep their heads spinning."" Such tactics are ""incredibly craven,"" said Seth Mnookin, author of The Panic Virus: The True Story Behind the Vaccine-Autism Controversy.  ""It's a dishonest way to go about things,"" he said.Â ""I think it shows there's an awareness if they try to have this debate in a real way, and try to present the facts and have honest discussions with parents and with legislators, that their side would lose. ""They don't have facts on their side, and they don't have science."" Marketplace set out to find out just how anti-vaxx groups rally people â€” and money â€” for the cause.Â  Using hidden cameras, social media, court documents and tax returns, Marketplace pieced together a portrait of the movement's misinformation and fundraising tactics. One man who knows a lot about those tactics is Andrew Wakefield, one of the world's most notorious anti-vaxxers, who attended the Washington event. The disgraced British ex-doctor famously helped spawn a generation of vaccine fear after co-authoring a 1998 study linking the MMR vaccine to autism. The study was eventually retracted after it was revealed much of the research was fraudulentÂ and that Wakefield had financial conflicts of interest while doing the work.Â  Wakefield also lost his medical licence, though he now has a career in the anti-vaccination movement. ""I love Canadians,"" said Wakefield when the undercover Marketplace team introduced themselves. Saying they were hoping to have him speak at a future event in Vancouver, the team asked about Wakefield's speaking fee. Marketplace later learned via email he would charge $3,000 for the engagement. ""I don't begrudge people to earn money to write and give speeches,"" said Mnookin. ""The part I find offensive is that it's money that's made off stoking people's fears and anxieties. I wish he wasn't making money off of falsehoods â€_ he's apparently made a career out of this."" According to tax filings, Wakefield brought in more than $3 million US to advance his debunked cause through non-profits and research over the past decade. A number of those non-profits have since been dissolved. Wakefield's lawyer, Jim Moody, confirmed his client has raised ""a few million"" dollars for the causeÂ but said he is not a ""profiteer on this issue."" Moody said the money was originally put toward research projects, but Wakefield has since pivoted, and ""most of his output now is in advocacy, film, written work and speeches, and not in published research papers."" ""If he does know that it is a lie, this is a pretty evil pursuit,"" said Caulfield of Wakefield's ongoing anti-vaxx advocacy.Â Â  ""If he doesn't know it's a lie, that he's somehow tricked himself into believing his nonsense, it shows an incredible ability to ignore the truth â€_ it shows an incredible ability to allow harm to continue despite what the science says."" Another leaderÂ of the movement is Del Bigtree, a former TV producer and controversial filmmaker who travels the world to host various speaking engagements and founded a non-profit called the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN). He's also one of Wakefield's biggest defenders, working on a controversial documentary with him in 2016, and is often at the forefront of rallies protesting legislation that would limit vaccine exemptions. Bigtree grabbed headlines last year when The Washington Post and others reported that the Selz Foundation â€” run by a wealthy New York hedge fund founder and his wife â€” gave ICAN more than $1 million US to further the anti-vaxx cause. According to 2017 tax filings for the non-profit, that accounted for a majority of the $1.4 million the group raised that year. Watch as Marketplace host Asha TomlinsonÂ questions Del BigtreeÂ about vaccine research: When asked about Bigtree's speaking fees, his manager, James Sherrer, told an undercover Marketplace journalist he, too, charged $3,000, not including airfare and hotel. ""It's worth it these days,"" he said. ""He's pretty in demand."" Bigtree later told Marketplace that speaking fees ""help to fund the greater part of my work, which involves travelling state to state to speak and educate for free."" Other anti-vaxx figures, such as James Lyons-Weiler, find workarounds. Since 2015, Lyons-Weiler, has run a self-described ""progressive science"" group. He told Marketplace's undercover journalists that he's ""not for or against"" vaccines.Â  ""I'm a not-for-profit â€” I'm just educating,"" he said at the VIP event. Yet in speeches, he touts the false claim that ""vaccines can and do cause autism"" and holds events at which he vows to ""bring the science."" Earlier this month, he held an event in Los Angeles with another high-profile activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where they charged $40 to $55 US per ticket. When asked how much it would cost to bring him to Canada to speak, Lyons-Weiler told the undercover Marketplace team that he didn't charge, because it would make him ""an international lobbyist."" ""So, what I would rather do is, I do a science day the day before,"" he said. ""I'd run an event where you ... charge admission as per my website."" ""Sounds like a promo thing for you, a marketing thing for you,"" said our journalist. ""Now we've gotta quid pro quo.""Â  ""That's right,"" he said, later detailing through an assistant that for a group of 400 people, he would want about $20 US per person, netting around $10,000 Cdn. ""I think that there is a large majority of them ... [that] must be aware of the science.Â And this is a way of creating celebrity, this is a way of creating demand, this is a way of making a living,"" said Caulfield.Â  Lyons-Weiler later told Marketplace in an email that there is nothing wrong with getting paid for his services and that there are costs associated with holding events. One activist at the Washington eventÂ recommended that Marketplace's undercover team use AmazonSmile to fundraise, the charity arm through which the online retailer donates 0.5 per cent of eligible Amazon purchases to whichever registered charity a customer selects. ""It's almost kind of like, 'Ha ha, Amazon,'"" said the participant, referring to Amazon's attempts to remove anti-vaccination books and videos from its site. ""They're trying to restrict â€_ free speech, but you're still donating to my vaccine charity."" As part of its investigation, Marketplace found a number of anti-vaxx non-profits on AmazonSmile to whichÂ customers could donate. When asked about them, Amazon said organizations that support ""intolerance, hate, terrorism, violence, money laundering, or other illegal activities are not eligible."" It said that if there are violations of this agreement, an organization's ""eligibility will be revoked.""Â  While online platforms, and social media, in particular, have become a primary tool in the anti-vaccination fight, companies â€” such as Facebook â€” have begun hiding (but not removing) such content from search results, in part because of pressure from lawmakers. Still, Marketplace found dozens of groups in Canada and the U.S. that purport to advocate for ""health freedom"" and ""informed consent"" but regularly promoted content questioning vaccine safety. Most of the groups, such asÂ the ""Oklahomans for Health and Parental Rights"" or ""Informed Choice Washington,"" were at the top of Facebook's search feeds. Those two groups combined had more than 25,000 followers. Groups such as Vaccine Choice Canada â€” a major Canadian anti-vaccination group â€” were also in the feed. And anti-vaccination leaders, such asÂ Wakefield, Kennedy Jr. and Bigtree, were also searchable. Facebook has also been home to paid anti-vaccination advertising. Several media outlets have reported most of the ads had been purchased by two organizations, including Kennedy Jr.'s non-profit, World Mercury Project, which later became the Children's Health Defense. Though those ads have since been banned, the reach of that misinformation was widespread. Based on Marketplace's analysis, dozens of vaccine-related ads from Kennedy Jr.'s group had one to threeÂ million impressions on Facebook over a two-year period. Kennedy Jr. did not respond to Marketplace's request for comment. Marketplace shared the findings of the investigation with Facebook, including a number of pages that spread misinformation.Â  In response, Facebook told Marketplace it had flagged and reduced distribution for three of the pages for ""spreading vaccine misinformation."" The company also said it disabled a number of other accounts, because they violate Facebook's policies on misrepresentation.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-vaccination-information-wars-social-media-1.5037006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-canada-homeopathy-vaccine-hesitancy-1.5058393,N/A232,Anonymous,2020-01-20T01:58:23.419Z,Troops arrive in N.L. for blizzard cleanup,"Members of the Canadian Armed Forces arrived in Newfoundland and Labrador on Sunday eveningÂ after a blizzard hit the province Friday.

Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball said an emergency operations centre will open to centralize requests for help from residents. Soldiers will be available for residents who need assistance with snow clearing and other support.Â  He said a ""high volume of calls"" is expected. ""We just want to help people now clean up and clear out ... so emergency workers can get to them,"" Ball told CBC's radio special on the storm Sunday afternoon. Watch: For some, all that snow means fun Newfoundlanders are facing a full day of shovelling after Friday's record-setting blizzard, and there isÂ more nasty weather to come. St. John's set a new one-day snowfall record on Friday of 76.2 cm, beating the previous record of 68.4 cm set back on April 5, 1999, according to Environment Canada. Meanwhile, 93 cm fell in Mount Pearl and 91 cm fell in Paradise.Â  Earlier Sunday the federal weather agencyÂ issued weather warnings and statements for much of the island, except for the west coast and northern peninsula. Central Newfoundland isÂ under snowfall warnings and there are winter storm warnings on the south coast. Upwards of 20Â to 25 cm of snow is possible, according to CBC Newfoundland meteorologist Ashley Brauweiler. For eastern Newfoundland, 10Â to 15 cm is likely, with some areas seeing upwards of 20 cm. In the early morning hours Monday, that should change to drizzle for the metro area, but southern areas on the Avalon will see between 5 and 15 mm of rain, she said.Â  Winds could whip up to between 80 and 90 km/h overnight in eastern Newfoundland.Â  ""It's unbelievable when you think about it,"" Ball said of the coming second wave of snow. Municipalities throughout the area have declared states of emergency, which restrict residents' movements to allow snow-clearing operations to carry on unimpeded. Residents who are running low on supplies will have few options in St. John's, where a state of emergency will remain in effect on Monday. The cityÂ said pharmacies are not permitted to open Monday, revising its statement from earlier on Sunday regarding theÂ state of emergency ""given the current weather conditions and the addition anticipated snowfall [Sunday] evening."" Snow-clearing contractors are permitted to carry out their work, and gas stations may open to provide emergency fuel needed for snow removal, the city said in a statement. Garbage and recycling collection will not proceed Monday, the city said.Â  A spokesperson for the city of St. John's said the city expects businessesÂ to honour the state of emergency amid reports some businesses not covered under the exceptions have been opening.Â  She said the city can charge anyone in violation of the state of emergency order, with a penalty of up to $5,000 if convicted. Even with the easing of some restrictions, the city is still advising people to ""stay in and off city streets."" John Haggie, the province's health minister, advised residents needing prescriptions to call their local pharmacy to make sure it's open and that a refill is available. He noted, however, that any pharmacy in the province is able to dispense a prescription no matter which pharmacy it was first brought to.Â  Haggie also advised residents who may be concerned they are having a medical issue to call the 811 health line to get advice before calling 911 or trying to venture to a hospital.Â  ""The roads are not entirely safe,"" he cautioned. The Town of Paradise, 20 kilometres west of St. John's,Â announced Sunday that it will temporarily lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and midnight daily, effective Monday. Starting Monday, ""and until further notice,"" all businesses must close by midnight daily and no vehicles are allowed on roads between midnight and 6 a.m. to allow for snow-clearing operations, a statement from the town said. Only town snow-clearing equipment, emergency vehicles, essential workers getting to work and private snow-clearing contractors are allowed to be on the roads overnight. ""We ask all residents to stay home unless absolutely necessary,"" the statement goes on. The town of Conception Bay South, 36 kilometres west of St. John's,Â lifted its state of emergency at 4 p.m. Watch as neighbours in CBS stay connected through a snow maze Pharmacies in the town will be able to open immediately. A warming centre is also open at the Salvation Army church until 9 p.m. Residents were allowed to travel to pharmacies and to the warming centre before 4 p.m. The Town of TorbayÂ also plans to lift its state of emergency between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. effectiveÂ Monday. Before then, several exceptions are in place, including allowing private snow-clearing operations, the delivery of oil to homes and the movement of essential workers, among other accommodations.Â  Town buildings and facilities will remain closed Monday. Meanwhile, in Portugal Cove-St. Philips, a state of emergency will go back into effect at 9 p.m. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said whileÂ crews have had a lot of success and worked through the night, there's still a lot to be done.Â Â  ""There's a tremendous amount of snow on the ground,"" he told CBC News NetworkÂ on Sunday morning. Watch: Snow piles up in N.L.'s record storm Breen said a series of storms has had snowplow operators working steadily since Christmas Eve and said they are getting help from Corner Brook as well as from other levels of government. Most major thoroughfares have been widened, he said, with many streets at least having ""one cut"" through them.Â  But the goal remains clearing roads for emergency vehicles and allowing private snow-removal contractors to service their clients so businesses can eventually reopen. ""Right now, the streets, we don't feel that they're in a condition that's suitable enough to open up the city tomorrow,"" he told the CBC radio special on Sunday afternoon. Asked about criticism that the city seemed under-prepared for the massive storm, BreenÂ said there are three things to note: the high volume of snow, the rate at which the snow fell and the high winds, which at times reached up to 150 km/h. ""So this was a storm that would have been challenging for any operation,"" he said. The province announced that all government offices in the St. John's metro area will be closed Monday. The province's English school district has announced that all schools on the Avalon Peninsula will be closed Monday as well.Â Several schools on the Bonavista Peninsula will also be closed. Watch: Retired sports host reports on N.L. weather emergency Meanwhile, Memorial University has announced that its St. John's, Marine Institute and Signal Hill campuses will remain closed on Monday ""to facilitate cleanup from Friday's blizzard."" The closure includes all evening classes and activities, and the child-care centre.Â  The closure means access to university buildings is restricted, according to a statement from the university. ""Please do not come to campus,"" the statement said. Noreen Golfman, the university's vice president academic, has encouraged all instructors to beÂ flexible with course work. ""This includes, but is not limited to, deadlines for submission of assignments, papers, etc., as well as attendance in classes and laboratories over the next couple of days,"" said a statement from the university. College of the North Atlantic's Ridge Road campus will also be closed Monday. Around 11:30 a.m.,Â Newfoundland Power was reporting 2,499Â customers without electricity. The utility later reported new power outages,Â mostly in Pleasantville to east end St. John's, Topsail, Kelligrews and Upper Gullies areas. On Saturday, Newfoundland Power reported it had reconnected about 75 per cent of customers impacted by the storm. The federal government has approved the province's request for assistance with the cleanup, including army mobilization. In a tweet, St. John's Airport said its airfield is only available for air ambulance and military aircraftÂ and that commercial flights will not start up until at least Monday at 8 p.m. Update 3: Commercial flight ops will not resume until at least 8pm Monday, Jan. 20th.

After two days of listening to defence arguments, the Crown will try to convince a B.C. Supreme Court judge that the essence of the case against Meng is conduct that is considered criminal in both the U.S. and Canada: fraud. The 47-year-old is accused of bank fraud in relation to an allegation that she put banks at risk by lying about Huawei'sÂ control of a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes must decide whether those allegations can stand up to a test of so-called ""double-criminality"" by determining if Meng's conduct would be an offence on both sides of the border. The Crown will argue that it would. ""The essence of [Meng's] conduct is fraud on a bank,"" the Crown said in written arguments filed ahead of this week's hearing. ""Inducing a bank to extend financial services by lying to it is criminal."" Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei,Â was arrested in Vancouver in December 2018 on a stopover from Hong Kong to Argentina, where she planned to attend a business conference. She was released on $10-million bail and lives under house arrest in one of her two multi-million dollar Vancouver mansions under the constant watch of a team of security guards. In the first two days of the hearing, Meng's lawyers argued that the double-criminality bar could not be met because the offence she is charged with is rooted in U.S. economic sanctions against Iran that Canada has rejected. As a result, the defence team claimed that Canadian banks wouldn't risk loss by dealing with a client who lied about their business dealings in Iran. ""It's all about sanctions,"" defence lawyer Richard Peck told Holmes in his opening statement. ""In the end, we're being asked to impose on Canada an obligation to assist the U.S. in the enforcement of its sanctions â€”Â sanctions that we have expressly rejected."" But the Crown will argue that the defence is ""offence matching"" as opposed to taking the ""conduct-based"" approach to extradition law that Canadian courts require,Â which asks a judge to consider the underlying essence of the allegation. They say Meng's misrepresentation placed HSBCÂ at risk of loss and deprivation through fines, prosecution and reputational damage.Â  And they will also argue that the defence is trying to lead Holmes down the wrong path. ""The fact that Canada may have different sanctions against Iran than the United States should not distract the Court from the necessary inquiry into the essence of the conduct for double-criminality purposes,"" the Crown said in its written arguments. ""Deceit and risk of loss are the heart of the conduct. The nature of the deceit, itsÂ motivation, and its legal consequence in the requesting state, are all matters that do not determine the essence of the offence."" The hearing is expected to wrap up by Friday and Holmes will likely reserve her decision. If the requirement for double criminality is not met, Meng would be free. But if the Crown is successful, a hearing is scheduled for June in which the defence will argue that her rights were violated on her arrest. If that hearing goes ahead, the defence will also argue that Meng is being used as a political pawn by U.S. President Donald Trump who has said he would intervene in her case if it would help get a better trade deal with China. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China last week, with no sign that he had heeded a suggestion from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December that any pact should deal with Meng and two Canadians who were detained in China shortly after her arrest. Entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were later formally arrested and now face accusations of spying in China, where they areÂ incarcerated without access to lawyers or family. China has also cut off Canadian canola and meat imports in the past year, lifting a ban on pork and beef in November.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5435521,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341,N/A234,Frances Willick,2020-01-17T10:00:00.809Z,When donors cross the line: Charitable sector grapples with sexual harassment ,"As Carly Butler got ready to attend another big gala for her job as a major gifts fundraiser, she put on a special dress she'd often wear on such occasions. But for this particular event at a high-end Nova Scotia resort, she took an extra precaution, placing a safety pin at the neckline to be prudent. She'd heard there had been ""bad behaviour"" at the event in the past. As she and her co-workers arrived at the resort, one charity staffer joked to the crew, ""OK, ladies, lock up your vaginas!"" Soon after, Butler had an experience she would later describe as ""a general disrespect"" of herÂ professionalism. Her job as a fundraiser for the IWK Foundation â€” the charitable organization that supports the women and children's hospital in Halifax â€” required her to drum up $1.5 million in donations the year she was employed there. During the event, a potential donor asked her to meet him outside in 10 minutes so they could drive his luxury car down a nearby private runway, even though he was drunk. When she said no, he told her she could drive â€” that there were no police around, and what happened at theÂ resort would stay at theÂ resort. She didn't get in the car that day nearly five years ago. But she worries that younger or more vulnerable women starting out their fundraising career may have. As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across industry after industry, some in the fundraising sector say it's time for their profession to step up efforts to tackle and prevent sexual harassment. Workers in some fundraising roles can be particularly vulnerable to harassment due to the deep power imbalance between fundraisers â€” who are often young women, and whose jobs depend on meeting donation targets â€” and donors, who are often wealthy older men. And events like golf tournaments, galas or auction evenings â€” especially where alcohol is involved â€” are ripe for abuse of that inequality, say industry insiders. CBC News spoke with nearly a dozen women across the country who work in the non-profit sector. Nearly all had experiences of being harassed by donors or other employees, either with unwanted touching, sexual innuendo or inappropriate propositions. One spoke of a former premier grabbing her butt at an event, another of an older donor putting his hand on her knee and offering to ""treat"" her to a night at the iconic Ottawa hotel Chateau Laurier, while another woman told of a men's group of potential donors leaving a photo of a naked woman on the podium where she was about to speak. Jacquie Stoyek, whoÂ worked in marketing at the IWK FoundationÂ for about five years until leaving in 2017, attended the same fundraiser as Butler. She recalled seeingÂ a businessman â€” already intoxicated first thingÂ in the morning â€” making comments about a foundation staff member and pretending behind her back to grab her butt. Stoyek said a senior foundation staff member saw that and gave her a look that said, ""Watch out for this one,""Â and it became an ongoing joke. The IWK Foundation declined to answer any questions about the fundraising event, saying in a two-sentence statement it is ""unable to provide comment on the specific circumstances"" of Butler and Stoyek's allegations. But at the timeÂ â€” afterÂ Butler reported the luxury carÂ incident to her peers and superiorsÂ â€” she was told not to go to future meetings with that donor by herself.Â Butler said the man cancelled a followup meeting with her when he learned she would not be alone. The IWK Foundation said in a statement: ""With respect to the issue of harassment, it is a very important topic in every sector and we continue to work within our organization to foster a culture of openness, respect and safety."" The foundation would not comment on whether the event is still taking place. A survey on sexual harassmentÂ conducted in 2018 by the Harris Poll for the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Chronicle of PhilanthropyÂ found that a quarter of female respondents and seven per cent of male respondents had experienced sexual harassment in the field. The survey involved about 1,000 fundraisers, including about 900 people living in the U.S. and 100 living in Canada. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, a donor was the perpetrator. But less than half of those who were harassed told their organization about the incident. Beth Ann Locke, who until recently served as the chief philanthropy officer for the B.C. Women's Health Foundation, said women are worried about the questions that will be asked â€” ""What did you do to make him do that?Â Did you flirt with him?"" They are also concerned that reporting the incident will hurt their career, say many in the industry. If they no longer work with a major donor who has harassed them, they may not get invited to events, be asked to take on large accounts or meet their donation targets for the year. At small organizations, there often isn't another staffer who can take over an account involving a harasser. Fundraisers are also passionate about the organizations and causes they work for, and are reluctant to do anything that could harm them, say several of the women interviewed by the CBC. Locke is one of the co-founders of Ms. Rupt, a group that aims to spark conversation and action on challenges facing female fundraisers. ""What drives me crazy is that all of us as fundraisers work to help people who have no voice â€” so whether that's the Amazon rainforest or, you know, dogs in Halifax or people with dementia, right? ""And yet we don't stand up for ourselves and we kind of allow this to happen in our own profession."" Locke said she has experienced several incidents of harassment over the course of her career, including someone asking her to be their ""mistress,"" someone stroking her arm and commenting on her skinÂ and an uninvited hand on her knee under the table. She said the most severe instance of harassment occurred years ago while she was working in the U.S., when a superior grabbed her wrist â€” which she promptly wrenched away â€” and then held his erect penis through his clothes, saying, ""This is what you do to me."" Locke said she reported the incident to human resources, which forced the man to take three days off without pay and lectured both parties about ""this kind of stuff going on in our office.""Â  ""It was like a dressing-down you'd get from your parents,"" Locke said. That type of lacklustre response does not appear to be unusual, according to the Harris Poll survey. Of the respondents who had experienced sexual harassment and told their organization about it, 71 per cent said no action had been taken against the perpetrator. Thirty-five per cent of respondents who took steps to deal with the harassment said they experienced a negative impact on their career after reporting it. Locke said organizations within the non-profit sector need to take allegations more seriously. She said she's heard stories of organizations giving donors or other perpetrators a ""pass"" for harassing behaviour: ""'He's sweet.' 'Oh, don't worry about it.' Even kind of a 'he doesn't know what he's doing' thing.â€_Â Or 'they're from a different age when that was allowed.' I've heard that one."" Some smaller non-profits that run on a shoestring budget don't have a separate human resources department to deal with complaints.Â  Lucy White, a Toronto consultant for the non-profit sector, said one of the barriers to change in the industry is that when people do file complaints about harassment, the cases are often settled out of court and out of the public eye,Â often with non-disclosure agreements that forbid them from discussing details. ""So the real problem is no one ever admits publicly that they did anything wrong and we never find out any of the facts,"" White said.Â ""We're left in the dark about how often this kind of thing happens."" That silence also means other organizations and those who sit on their board of directors never learn what kind of financial repercussions can stem from findings of harrassment, and the liabilitiesÂ their own charities could face if allegations emerge. ""What happens is they think it's not a big deal, right?"" White said. There is some movement afoot to help prevent sexual harassment in the fundraising sector. The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), an organization that has 3,500 members across Canada and over 30,000 internationally, has formed the Women's Impact Initiative to address challenges facing women in the sector. The AFP, which helped commission the Harris Poll survey, is following up on the results by interviewing fundraisers about their experiences of job-related harassment. The association already has a donor bill of rights that outlines what donors are entitled to as a result of their donations, but it is now considering developing a similar document outlining a donor's responsibilities when working with fundraisers. Some in the profession say non-profits should take other concrete steps, including implementing and enforcing clear anti-harassment policies, overtly encouraging employees and bystanders to come forward with complaints and improving diversity on boards of directors. But money is often the bottom line for charitable and non-profit organizations. Perhaps accepting donations from harassers is where the buck must stop, said Caroline Riseboro, the president of AFP Toronto, the largest chapter in the world. ""If targets are missed, boards tend to get nervous. But, you know, boards need to understand if targets are missed because of a harassment issue, then that's OK. Better to keep employees safe than to meet the target or the goal."" Riseboro said she believes most boards do take action when they know about instances of harassment, but board members often don't realize the behaviour is going on. For some in the fundraising sector, any impending cultural change has come too late.Â  Butler, the fundraiser who worked for the IWK Foundation,Â left the profession, saying despite the enjoyable aspects of the job, ""there's a whole bunch of distasteful things about it"" â€” including, sometimes, the dynamic between the people who work in fundraising and donors. ""It doesn't feel great after a while.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-violence-harassment-fundraising-1.4945951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,N/A235,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-07-08T18:29:27.210Z,"Mother who watched son burn to death in SUV fire joins calls for answers from Kia, Hyundai ","When Carol Nash heard screams for help, she rushed out of herÂ apartment in her nightgown and found her SUV burning in the parking lot â€”Â but couldn't get close enough to save her son, sitting in the driver's seat. ""I could not do anything except stand there and watch him die,"" Nash toldÂ Go Public. Keith Nash, 48, burned to death on April 19, 2017, in his mother's 2014 Kia Soul while the vehicle was parked outside her low-rise apartment building in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother says Kia has never contacted her to explain what happened. She was devastated when she learnedÂ the company issued a recallÂ for theÂ SUVÂ for a potential fire riskÂ in February â€” two years after her son died. ""I suffer on a daily basis with this because I have no answers,"" she said.Â  Since 2015, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have recalled more than three million vehicles in North AmericaÂ over concerns the engines could fail at high speeds or burst into flames. A Go Public investigation revealed other models weren't on any Canadian recall lists when drivers experienced catastrophic engine failureÂ or fires.Â After theÂ CBCÂ News investigation, bothÂ KiaÂ and Hyundai vastly expanded theÂ number of recalls in Canada. Hyundai is a part-owner of Kia. Automobile safety advocates and vehicle owners accuse the two companies of downplaying fire and engine failure reports and taking too long to roll out recalls, raising questions about when they first knew of the safety issues and whether more vehicles might still pose a risk. ""We now have multiple years of reports of these catastrophic engine failures and the very slow reaction from the companies,"" saidÂ Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The automakers say they are on top of the problems and are working with Transport Canada to address them. The official cause of death for Keith Nash was smoke and gas inhalation. Fire investigators believe the blaze started in the engine area, but weren't able to determine the exact cause.Â  In an email to Go Public, Kia suggests that fentanyl and heroin found in Nash's system may have rendered him unconscious and unable to get out of the burning car. The auto giant also saysÂ Nash may have caused the fire by simultaneously pressing down on the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle was in ""drive"" mode, causing the transmission fluid to igniteÂ â€” an issue unrelated to the recall issued two years later, the company says. Go Public put that to HamiltonÂ mechanic Chris Solodko, who has repaired dozens of Kia and Hyundai vehicles following engine failures. HeÂ says it's very rare for transmission fluid to catch fire. According to Solodko, Nash would have had to apply an enormous amount of pressure to the brake while holding the accelerator down to keep the SUV from moving and causing the transmission fluid to heat up to the point of catching fire. Carol Nash isn't the only one who wants answers.Â  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they've experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires withÂ vehicles that aren't part of any recall.Â  Robert Mitchell recalled getting a panicked phone call from his 30-year-old son Ryan on Aug. 11. Ryan told him he wasÂ driving the family's 2016 Hyundai Elantra down one of the busiest highways in the Toronto area â€” the 403 â€” when the engine seized and started to smokeÂ before bursting into flames.Â  ""I don't think that a car â€” any car â€”Â should blow up and burn like that,"" Robert Mitchell said from the family's home in Mississauga, Ont. Mitchell's insurance company paid for the destroyed car. According to Transport Canada, the fire started in the engine compartment, but the cause is unknown. Another Hyundai Elantra, a 2018 model, is at the centre of a fire investigation in Windsor, N.S. On March 27, an Elantra that had been parked in front of a duplex for hours burst into flames.Â The fire spread to the building, but the families inside escaped unhurt. Video of overnight fire that destroyed century old home in Windsor but two families escape via dramatic rescue.<a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCNS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCNS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/0Rj84mGTtv"">pic.twitter.com/0Rj84mGTtv</a> Hyundai Canada and Transport Canada didn't confirm the cause of the fire. Transport Canada says the investigation is now in the hands of a private insurance company. Kia and Hyundai are now facing a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and at least two in Canada over the engine breakdowns and fires. The recalls issued so far cover certain Hyundai andÂ KiaÂ models produced after 2011, mostly involving a variety of safety concerns around what are called Theta-II engines.Â In some cases, the recalls addressÂ mechanical issuesÂ that could lead to engine failure. In others,Â softwareÂ is installed that gives drivers advance warning of an engine problem.Â  Levine says his organization isÂ seeing other types of engines breaking down or burning. He points out, for example, that Nash'sÂ KiaÂ Soul â€”Â which was recalledÂ in FebruaryÂ â€”Â and the HyundaiÂ ElantraÂ don't have Theta engines. ""It's certainly troubling thatÂ it's going on at least several years ... these non-crash fires across a variety of makes and models, not only the Theta-II,"" he said. Go Public asked both Kia Canada and Hyundai Canada when theyÂ first knew about the engine defects, but neither company answered the question. Hyundai Canada was asked if it had a fix for the engine problems,Â but again,Â it didn't respond to the questionÂ directly. In an email, Hyundai Canada told Go Public that over the past 10Â years, there have been 12 cases of engine fires determined to be a result of an issue with the vehicle itself. ""We stand behind the quality of our products and continuously work to ensure the highest safety standards for our customers,"" spokesperson Bianca Pettinaro wrote. She says the company has issued notices for all the vehicles that could be affected and is keeping an eye on the issues.Â Â  In another email, Kia Canada spokesperson Mark James wrote, ""A vehicle engine failure or fire can occur due to any number of complex factors, including inadequate maintenance, arson, or some other non-vehicle source, all cases must be carefully evaluated by trained technicians to determine its cause."" He says Kia has a strong safety record and promptly reports safety-related defects to Transport Canada. Hyundai and Kia are now being investigated by regulators in several countries â€” including Canada and the U.S. â€” over safety defects that may have led to engine failures and fires not caused by crashes.Â  Nearly 540,000 Hyundai and Kia vehicles are now under recall in Canada due to risk ofÂ engine failure or fire. Transport Canada is investigating whether more models should be part of the recalls after getting approximately 200 complaints about engines since 2014. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. is investigating engine failures and fires in certain model years. As of the end of March, theÂ regulator had received more than 3,000 complaints of fires not related to collisions, including 103 injuries and one death. Those are the kind of answers Carol Nash is looking for â€”Â and thatÂ need to come from the automakers involved, she says.Â  ""I just don't want this ever for any other parent or any other mother to go through what I went through on that day."" Last November, both Kia and Hyundai refused to testify at a congressional hearing that was scheduled to look into the engine fires. That hearing was cancelled after the automakers declined to attend.Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

The 15-year old, who hails from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, shared her dismay at their lack of attention toward the issue while on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Peltier has spent her last eight years putting pressure on politicians to take climate change more seriously, while advocating for clean drinking water in Indigenous communities and serving as the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario. She has urged the United Nations General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet and confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations. While sharing the stage in Davos with fellow teen activists Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Natasha Mwansa from Zambia and Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, she heaped more pressure on politicians back home. ""It is almost like they don't believe climate change is real,"" she said. ""Climate change is a real thing and they are not realizing that."" Her remarks come amid warnings that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and as youth like Peltier are increasingly calling for the globe to band together and address climate change. Peltier said she has received some support from Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Mike Mantha and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, but has found that many of their counterparts are putting their attention elsewhere. ""They are all focused on just money and we need to be more focused on the actual things going on,"" she said. She also revealed that her age plays a role in how seriously she's being taken. ""I personally don't feel that heard from politicians....When it comes to federal government it is really hard to get their attention and be heard by them,"" she said.

To help ease the load on ambulance technicians, the province has beenÂ testing transferring non-urgent calls to 811 instead. It's a second triage, of sorts:Â if the call meets certain criteria, it's transferred to a nurse, who takes over and conducts a more in-depth evaluation on the patientÂ then decides whether an ambulance is necessary. The main job of an ambulance technician is to save lives, says Dr. Ã‰lyse Berger Pelleter, who works for the Health Ministry. But with an aging population and a shortage of ambulance technicians in the province, the situation on the ground is far from ideal â€” putting a lot of pressure on emergency medical services. ""The objective is that ambulance workers respond to cardiac arrest, heart attacks â€”Â people who really need their skills,"" Berger Pelleter said. The Health Ministry wantsÂ to have the new system fully established provincewide by 2022. Berger Pelletier said she hopes eventually, people who call with non-urgent problems will get a doctor's appointment, if need be. ""The client is satisfied.Â It's efficient.Â Everyone is happy. That's where we're headed."" The pilot project is in its third year in four regions: Montreal, Laval,Â ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches and the Eastern Townships. The transferred calls are being handled by a dedicated teamÂ ofÂ Info-SantÃ© nurses in Laval. TheÂ chief of service, Nancy Vachon, says the team isÂ able toÂ handleÂ about 3,000 calls a month. In Montreal and Laval, 23,000 non-urgent calls were transferred to 811 between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. In 20 per cent of those cases â€”Â about 4,800 calls in all â€”Â the Info-SantÃ© nurse determined there was no need for an ambulance. Officials expect the results to be less impressive in the two moreÂ rural regions, because residents living where there is less access to taxis or public transport are more likely to have an ambulance sent to them, Berger Pelletier said. Urgences-SantÃ©, the emergency medical service that coversÂ Montreal and Laval, gets up to 1,300 calls per day, said the agency's director, Vincent Brouillard. He said the pilot project is allowing the agencyÂ to respond to real emergencies, relieving the pressure on paramedics in general.

""In my opinion, he died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck"" consistent with a motor vehicle collision, Dr. Ken Obenson told the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench. The body of Francis, 22, ofÂ Elsipogtog First Nation, was found on Saint-Charles South Road in Saint-Charles on Feb. 24, 2018, at around 9:40 p.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. Obenson, who performed the autopsy at the Saint John Regional HospitalÂ on Feb. 25, 2018, testified he believes Francis was standing at the moment of impact and may have been projected onto the vehicle that struck him. HeÂ wasÂ unable to determine if Francis was struckÂ head-on, from the side, or from behind, he said. Francis was intoxicated at the time, with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.29,Â ObensonÂ found â€” about three-and-a-half times the legal limit. Earlier in the trial, the court heard Francis had been at a diaper partyÂ for a friend who was expecting a baby. HeÂ was seen afterward walking along the road and had called his parents to ask for a ride home. By the time they arrived minutes later, they found theirÂ son's bodyÂ lying face-up on the side of the road. The trial is scheduled to continue on Wednesday morning, when the Crown is expected to call its final witnesses. The defence plans to call four witnesses. It's not yet clear whether Johnson will testifyÂ in his own defence. The court has watchedÂ the videotaped statement Johnson gave to RCMP on March 15, 2018, following his arrest. In the roughly four-hour video, Johnson told police he was drinking Diet Pepsi the night Francis was killed, and didn't consume any alcohol or drugs. Johnson said his wife drank eight beers while they drove around in his pickup truck between around 3:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., tossing the empties along the way, but he was behind the wheelÂ when struck what he initially thought was a deer. Cpl.Â Nicholas PotvinÂ alleged Johnson ""got scared"" the night of the collision and urged him to ""own up."" ""This is your chance to correct the mistake you made by telling the truth,"" Potvin said in French. The officer noted other people reported seeing Francis walking along the road that night and questioned why Johnson did not. He suggested something was affecting his judgment. Johnson repeatedly told the officer he wasn't drinking that day. Although he drank when he was younger, he drinks ""almost never now,"" he said in French. â€‹â€‹â€‹His wife sometimes drinks a bottle of wine on the weekends. ""Me? I stay at home and watch Netflix and drink my coffee."" The last time he drank was about three weeks before the accident, when he bought a case of 12 beers, he said. ""I don't do drugs,"" he added. During the first part of the interview, played for the courtÂ on Monday, Johnson saidÂ he and his wife were talking during their leisure drive andÂ he turned his head to look at her for a moment. When he turned back, there was a deer in front of his truck and he didn't have time to brake, he said. He stopped and looked back, but didn't see anything, so he thought the animal had run off and they kept going, he said.Â ""If I thought it had been a person, I would have stopped."" As the interview continued, PotvinÂ questioned whether Johnson would have been scaredÂ if he had stopped and had police arrived. ""Would they have found anything in your vehicle?"" Johnson said he wouldn't have been scared, and asked the officer about speaking to his lawyer. PotvinÂ told Johnson he had already spoken to hisÂ lawyer and that he was not obliged to answer any more questions. But heÂ said Johnson was the only one who could ""complete the puzzle â€_ of what really happened that night"" and he pressedÂ him to ""do the right thing."" ""You're a good person, Maurice, a hard worker, a family man, a father, a husband,"" he said. ""Give closure to the [Francis] family."" ""I saw what I saw,"" replied Johnson. ""I did not see a person."" Potvin also grilled the accused about being unsure where the collision occurred. JohnsonÂ told a friend it was on Gray Road, while he told an officer the day Francis's body was discovered that it was on Saint-Charles North Road, andÂ PotvinÂ that it was on Saint-Charles South Road. Johnson said he knew he turned off Gray Road and went left and left again and that it was on one of those roads, but he wasn't sure exactly where because ""it was just a deer."" Francis's body was found 1.8 kilometresÂ from Johnson's house, the courtroom heard. Johnson told police he drove home, watched TV and went to bed around 11 p.m. Potvin asked if he noticed the police cars that drove past his house after Francis's body was discovered. JohnsonÂ said he did not. The trial began last week and has heard from 32 witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.

That increase has brought some challenges, including financial ones, as schools try to provide resources for students who haven't acquired the language yet. In a news release following its monthly meeting, the board said it was revising its admission policy to ""better delineate access to non-rights holding parents."" Non-rights holding parents include immigrant parents, and others, who don't have a constitutional right to a French-language education under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Currently, those parents can apply for their children to attend a French-language school on P.E.I. ""Non-rights holders, if they they want to get in a French school, they have to go through an evaluation for that child,"" said Gilles Benoit, chair of the board. ""We are looking at that right now because we want to make sure if we open the door to more non-right holders, that we have the proper tools to evaluate those students to make sure they will have success in a French school."" The parents and students who are non-rights holders are supposed to be interviewed, to see if the parents can support the child and if the child can speak French, but the board said thatÂ wasn't always happening. ""We also have a situation where there's a lot more of immigrant students entering, that want to enter our school,"" Benoit said. ""Because they have the right to choose between French and English, so sometimes they don't have neither one of them and they want to choose French education. So we want to make sure that we will be able to accommodate them."" Benoit said some English students may qualify to attendÂ a French-language school because they went through a daycare centreÂ and can speak French, but he said that's not a very significant number.Â  The board estimated that non-rights holders make up two to three per cent of the current student population. ""If we are to open our schools to non-right holders, they will have to demonstrate that they are able to to communicate, to read and write in French,"" Benoit said. ""Because we want to make sure if we accept some students that they will succeed in their education.Â We don't want to have those students fail."" The board said there will also be changes for rights-holding families who are applying for a French-language school on P.E.I.Â  They will need to provide evidence of their French-language qualifications, proving that either their parents or grandparents are francophone or attended a French-language school. The revised policy will have its third reading during the board's March 10 meeting. The French Language School Board has set a goal of 1,500 students by 2026-27. The president of the FÃ©dÃ©ration des parents de l'Ã_le-du-Prince-Ã‰douard, Melissa MacDonald, said she was a ""bit surprised"" by the news from the board.  She said these are important decisions that need to be discussed with school administrators, and hopes that administrators from every school will be involved in a decision that will affect them all.  The federation is going to discuss the issue at their next meeting on Feb.Â 7.  MacDonald said the federation finds the changes to be positive but wants to make sure they ""consider all the angles.""Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-schools-admission-policy-1.5433306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-school-enrolment-1.5271293 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-french-language-school-board-deficit-1.5321551 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sunday-snow-storm-1.5432928 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-o-leary-house-fire-1.5432656,N/A244,Richard Gleeson,2020-01-20T21:14:49.977Z,"N.W.T. courts' travel policy sets accused up to fail, defence lawyer says","A prominent Yellowknife defence lawyerÂ isÂ protesting a change in the application of a court travel policy that, he says, is going to leave people who have been released on bail either stuck in jail or homeless on the streets of Yellowknife. ""It does seem bizarre that you can get released to live on the streets in Yellowknife, but they're not prepared to ship you back to a community that is a safer place for you to be ... and it's - 40 C,"" said defence lawyer Peter Harte. Harte said, previously, the N.W.T. government would pay the airfare to transport people who have been released on bail to the community they're supposed to be staying in, under their bail conditions. Now, the N.W.T. governmentÂ â€” with the courts setting up the travel arrangementsÂ â€”Â will only pay for airfare to the community where the alleged crime occurred, Harte said. HarteÂ said he became aware of the change last week. For example, Harte said he is representing one man facing charges out of Fort Simpson, N.W.T. The man'sÂ bail was agreed to, on the condition he goes to Hay River. But with the way the policy is being applied,Â the government would only pay for airfare back for Fort Simpson, Harte said, even though it would cost less to fly the man to Hay River. On Friday, after Harte explained the situation his client was in, the warden of the North Slave Correctional Centre agreed to pay the cost of flying the man to Hay River out of theÂ warden'sÂ budget. In another case currently before the courts, a man from the Beaufort Delta region is facing charges being dealt with in court in Inuvik. The court said he could be released on bail,Â on the condition that he goes to Yellowknife. However, the accused man cannot afford the airfare â€”Â approximately $500Â â€” to return to Inuvik from Yellowknife. The courts have, so far, refused to help him, said Harte. If he does not make it back to Inuvik,Â he will likely be charged with failing to attend court and breaching his bail condition to attend court as required. He will end up being kept in jail until his case is concluded, according to Harte. It costs approximately $280 per day to house inmates in the N.W.T.

Leaders from across the region and the North are gathering in the community for a three-dayÂ public ""listening session"" on how to protect three of the territory's caribou herds. The hearing is the first of five tackling different topicsÂ related to caribou management, to be held in each of theÂ SahtÃº's communities. A tentative schedule indicates it might be five years until they're all done. The Bluenose West and Bluenose East barren ground caribou herds were the subject of conservation hearings in 2007Â and 2016 respectively. The Northern Mountain herd, a species of woodland caribou, hasÂ been considered at risk since 2005. This week's hearing is the first time multiple herds will be discussedÂ in a single session, according to Deborah Simmons, the executive director of the SahtÃº Renewable Resources Board (SRRB), which organized the session. ""The board is aware of conservation concerns for all the kinds of caribou that are living in our SahtÃº region,"" she said. ""We've broadened the net."" Simmons says the board is hoping the sessions are less rushed than those in 2016, and allow for a broader range of evidence that better reflects the experience of the communities that rely on the caribou and share a historic relationship withÂ the herds. For Colville Lake Chief Wilbert Kochon, it's all ""one herd"" â€” but one in need of a new, less ""colonial"" approach to conservation. The hearing will open with the presentation of Colville Lake's locally drafted caribou management plan, which follows DeÌÅlÄ±Ì¨neÌ¨'s 2016 plan in basing conservation strategies on traditional Dene law. ""I'm hoping that â€_ people will listen to what we're doing,"" said Kochon. The session is the first organized by the SRRB since 2016, when a hearing on the Bluenose East herd resulted in strict limits on harvests as the herd faced rapid population decline. Colville Lake criticized those limits at the time as ""racist and dangerous,"" arguing the cap wrongly blamed the herd's decline on Indigenous hunting, and ignored other influences like climate change, resource developments, and natural population cycles. That hearing also resulted in an endorsement for DeÌÅlÄ±Ì¨neÌ¨'s local management plan, which enforces traditional hunting methods and educates hunters on the sacred relationship between the community and the herd. Colville Lake's plan echoes DeÌÅlÄ±Ì¨neÌ¨'s in basing conservation controls on a traditional respect for the animals. It calls the existing system of tags and quotas an ""unprecedented colonial system of control and criminalization of Indigenous hunting."" ""For many years, [the Crown] thought that only their laws mattered,"" an advanced copy of Tuesday's presentation on the plan reads. ""Self-regulation in accordance with community conservation plans is a more effective means of conservation than Wildlife Act regulations and enforcement."" Since the 2016 hearing, the estimated size of the Bluenose East herd has dropped by nearly half, and the harvest has been capped at fewer than 200 animals.Â  But Kochon and other leaders have at times criticized the counting methods employed by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.Â The text of Colville Lake's plan suggests the department relies too heavily on population counts for assessing the overall health of the herd, a method it calls ""reactive"" and ""ineffective."" In its place, it proposes ""a more holistic and traditional approach to conservation â€_ [based] on local and ground-based knowledge and advice, with the inclusion of science to fill gaps as deemed helpful."" Both the DeÌÅlÄ±Ì¨neÌ¨ and Colville Lake plans rely primarily on volunteer reporting to measure the health of the herd. That has led some wildlife authorities to criticize local renewable resource councils for the quality of the data they gather on annual harvests. In a submission to the hearing from the Wildlife Management Advisory Council of the N.W.T., Larry Carpenter, the chair, wrote that the council would ""limit their participation"" in the board's hearings until they received better data from the SRRB. Since a 2007 hearing on the Bluenose West herd, ""there have been no noticeable improvements in the sharing of harvest information from communities within the SahtÃº with wildlife co-management partners,"" it reads. Improving how data on the herds and the harvest is shared between the dozen or so parties will be one major focus of the hearings, Simmons said. Colville Lake will not be alone in making the case for local management. They'll be supported by submissions from the Ross River Dena Council, which is fighting the Yukon government to establish a local licensing system for hunting caribou. But not every local authority is in opposition to the government. The session will also include remarks from the Inuvialuit Game Council, which has had a much more positive working history. ""We have a very robust monitoring system here in the [Inuvialuit Settlement Region] where we â€_ abide by the letter of the law,"" said Vernon Amos, the chair of the Inuvialuit Game Council. ""We just want to â€_ really try to reinforce that they should be following that too and abiding with the rules and regulations."" Both the Environment Department and local authorities agree Indigenous knowledge should play a much larger role in guiding conservation efforts. Both see hunter education as crucial to ensuring the traditional respect survives. Ultimately, what the SRRB heard in their listening sessionÂ won't be clear until MarchÂ 31, when it releases its list of resulting decisions. It could be a long time until those decisions have an effect. More than four years on from DeÌÅlÄ±Ì¨neÌ¨'s plan, the Environment Department is still ""consider[ing] the issue"" of amending the Wildlife Act to incorporate the plan, according to a submission to the hearing. ""We do know that there are some urgent decisions that need to be made,"" said Simmons. ""If the process is rushed too much,"" she said,Â ""the risk is that we don't have the evidence needed for decisions.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ross-river-dena-hunting-permits-1.4841907 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nunavut-asks-for-change-bathurst-bluenose-east-caribou-1.5422078 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/conservation-workshop-colville-lake-1.5347681,N/A246,Brooklyn Currie,2020-01-21T15:39:35.262Z,Dartmouth's Prince Andrew High School takes name change discussion to online forum,"Prince Andrew High School in Dartmouth, N.S., is launching an online survey to get community feedback on whether the school should consider a name change. The school, commonly referred to as P.A., was named in 1960 after Prince Andrew of the Royal Family. Late last year, a woman accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her when she was 17. TheÂ controversy forced Andrew to step down from his royal duties on Nov. 20. At a school advisory council meeting on Monday, school principal Brad McGowan explained how the process of gathering feedback online will work. Using an online platform called Thoughtexchange, people can submit their opinions, read other people's opinionsÂ and rate them. The program uses artificial intelligence to group common themes and topics together. ""[It will] haveÂ what I hope are sort ofÂ opportunities to reflectÂ and have this transparent way to say, 'This is what I'm thinking, this is what other people are thinking, this is what's important to me,'"" McGowan said. All users will remain anonymous, but participation in the online forum will be invitation-only. McGowan said that will include current students, staff, faculty, parents/guardians, as well as people in the surrounding community and alumni. ""While I'm very aware that there are passionate voices on either side of this question, the only voice that matters to me as the principal of P.A., is the voice of the people that are part of the greater P.A. community,"" McGowan said. Belinda Oxner, the chair of Prince Andrew's school advisory council, said sheÂ thinks the name should be changed. ""No public establishment should be named after a living individual,"" she said. ""You can't determine what their future actions are going to be â€_ it should be a standard policy."" Despite her personal feelings, Oxner said it's crucial to get public input before making any decisions. ""If we don't engage with the community before we move forward, it will just lead to greater debate at a later date,"" she said. McGowan said there's no deadline for possibly changing the name. ""Nothing is going to happen unless, or until, I can with confidence say, 'This is what the community wants to do,'"" McGowan said.

Go Public has been flooded with messages from some who say when it came time to deliver, the so-called Weight Loss Grants Program wouldn't pay out, or dragged customer claims out for months before cutting a cheque. During our investigation, we heard from dozens of dissatisfied customers unhappy with the program run by a private, for-profit company. SomeÂ thought, because of its name, it was a government-run program issuing ""grants."" The Weight Loss Grants Organization now has a notice on its website that the grants program ""has now concluded.""Â  ""It's good for the consumer,"" saidÂ Richel Prevost, of Calgary, who heard about the program on the radio two years ago. At the time, Prevost, 5'6"", was tipping the scales at over 200 pounds and desperate to lose weight.Â  She thought she'd found the solution â€” a grantÂ program that would give her access to a high-end diet program then reimburse her for up to 80 per cent of the cost when she lost the weight. She was wrong.Â  ""I literally worked my butt off and I just don't feel like their end of the bargain is being held up,"" Prevost said. SheÂ signed up in September 2017 and paid $2,400 up front to the diet clinic the grants company recommended. She saidÂ she was told if she used Dalewood Health ClinicÂ she'd get up to 80 per cent back in a grant, up to 20 per cent if she used a different one.Â  PrevostÂ saidÂ she lost 50 pounds on her own through dietÂ and exercise and reached her weight loss goal five months early. A year later, she is still trying to collect her grant.Â  ""It felt like they were moving the goalposts,"" Prevost said.""Every time that they asked for something different I complied."" Her grant was recently denied based on a rule that didn't exist when she lost the weight.Â  The Weight Loss Grants Organization told Go Public Prevost won't be getting her grant because she recorded her final weight five monthsÂ early instead of on the exact deadline date. That rule was introduced in April, long after Prevost finished the program and submitted her paperwork. ""You can't change the rules like that in the middle and deny me my claim based on something that you implemented after the fact,"" Prevost said.Â  Jenn GrangerÂ from Calgary paid Dalewood $2,100, lost weight, and met all the requirements in October. Her grant was also denied based on the rule that kicked in last month. ""I'm not sure how we would possibly be able to follow such a rule when I submitted [for the grant] six months before they made the change,"" Granger wrote Go Public in an email. The Weight Loss Grants Organization didn't respondÂ when Go Public asked how a new rule can apply to old cases. David Stein, who describes himself as the adjudicator at the Weight Loss Grants Organization, saidÂ Granger's grant was denied because the letter she submitted from the medical clinic to prove her weight lossÂ ""does not appear to be legitimate.""Â  Go Public spoke with some people who say they did get their grants. The Weight Loss Grants Organization's website has a long list of thank-you letters from participants who say the program helped them lose weight.Â  Those letters are a requirement before the company will even consider paying out a grant.Â  Larry Smith saidÂ he wrote a thank-you letter and last August and receivedÂ an email saying his $1,920 grant was approved but after months passed with no payout, Smith contacted Go Public. Stein saidÂ Smith hasn't receivedÂ a cheque because he failed to get a required letter from his doctor. No one from the company told Smith. The Better Business Bureau ofÂ Central OntarioÂ has given the Weight Loss Grants Organization an ""F"" and Dalewood a ""D"" rating due to the high number ofÂ customer complaints. ""Consumers feel like they've achieved the requirements of the grants but for what might be a technical reason, they're not getting the grant at the end,"" said spokesperson Patrick McKeen. Dalewood is now in the process of changing its name to Trillium Weight Loss. It turns out Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are connected. Go Public found the two companiesÂ shared an address for years and have a senior manager who works for both companies. In emails and lettersÂ to clients, George Scodras refers to himself as the director of operations of Dalewood and of the Weight Loss Grants Program. He was also listed as director of operations for Dalewood on its website, until Go Public started asking questions about his connection to both companies.Â  All references to Scodras have since been removed from the DalewoodÂ website, while the Trillium website lists him as a ""managing consultant.""Â  We asked the Weight Loss Grants Organization how much it has paid out in grants since the program started in 2015, and why so many people have complained about not getting money they thought they were due.Â  ""The total number of grants paid out as of April 30th, 2019, is $733,552.71 (according to info given to me),"" Dalewood spokesperson Marissa Mayles wrote in an email to Go Public. That number can't be verified, but Go Public did speak with other former customers who say they gotÂ their full grants after using Dalewood. Clients say they weren't told about any connections betweenÂ the Weight Loss Grants Program and Dalewood when they signed up. In an email to Go Public, Mayles said, ""we do not feel that there is a conflict of interest â€_ Nobody is obligated to sign up with Dalewood and they can go wherever they like to lose their weight."" Mayles didn't give her exact title, but saidÂ she works in the finance and administration departments at Dalewood.Â  She is also the wife of the company's founder, Darren Morgenstern, who also founded Ashley Madison, the adulterous dating site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Morgenstern sold Ashley Madison in 2007.Â  Mayles saidÂ Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are not connectedÂ but, ""the owners are all connected and know each other well and the relationships predate either business."" As for Scodras, she saidÂ he's not an employee of either Dalewood or the Weight Loss Grants Organization butÂ ""a temporary consultant ... an impartial disinterested party that is acting on behalf of all parties, including grant applicants.""Â  Stein saidÂ the Weight Loss Grants Organization will continue to honour ""legitimate grant requests,"" even though the program has been shut down. ""There have been too many problems which began for us late last year when we had to start enforcing our rules and having zero tolerance for improper documents, but we had no choice as there were far too many bogus grant claims,"" he told Go Public. The grants company has posted a reaction to Go Public's story on its website. The DalewoodÂ and Trillium websitesÂ both have postings saying they're no longer acceptingÂ new clients affiliated with the Weight Loss Grants Organization. Prevost saidÂ she plans toÂ file a fraud report with police and may try to take theÂ company to court. ""I am not in a position to lose $2,000,"" she said, ""The reason I did this is because I thought I was going to get my money back ... this is crazy.""Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

He works as an articling student in labour and employment law at Emond Harnden LLP, as well as with numerous organizations in the Ottawa community on issues relating to youth poverty and civic engagement.Â For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. Canadians celebrate Lincoln Alexander Day on Jan. 21, and there is a lot of value in revisiting the indelible mark this remarkable man has left on the country. I first heard of Lincoln Alexander while working on a project in elementary school. At the time, I didn't have the maturity to comprehend his important role in Canada's history, but one thing did register â€“ like me, and many of my friends, he was the son of immigrants. And like many immigrants, Alexander's parents made unimaginable sacrifices so that he could have a better future. Later on during my teenage years, his journey acted as a blueprint. By working hard, pursuing an education, and giving back to the community, he showed how one can honour one's parents' desire to see their child succeed. As Alexander once wrote, ""It is not your duty to be average. It is your duty to set a higher example for others to follow.""  Lincoln Alexander was born on Jan. 21, 1922, to West Indian immigrants living in Toronto. His father was a railway porter and his mother a maid. In a memoir entitled Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy, Alexander recounted the importance his parents placed on education as a good means to building a better life.  Not only did he heed his parents' words, he would do so with an unwavering commitment to excellence. After serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War, he became the first member of his family to attend university, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from McMaster University.Â Thereafter, he attended Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1953.  In 1968 he became the first black member of Parliament, and in 1979, the first black federal cabinet minister. After leaving federal politics, he became the first black Chair of the Worker's Compensation Board in 1980.  Alexander was appointed as the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1985. At the time, no other visible minority in Canada had served in a position of that nature. He would later go on to serve an unprecedented five terms as Chancellor of the University of Guelph from 1991 to 2007. WATCH | The National's tribute to Lincoln Alexander on the day he passed away, Oct. 12, 2012: The many community projects that I've had the chance to work on have galvanized me to share the power of Alexander's example. While assisting in after-school programs in low-income neighbourhoods, I met a number of young people who, like me at their age, had developed a certain level of cynicism because of their circumstances. I would often invoke Alexander when speaking to them, and explain how he inspired me. I emphasized that Alexander did not allow himself to be defined by his circumstances, and that because of his example, my friends and I believed at an early age that we did not have to be defined by ours.  Such is Alexander's impact on the lives of young black men coming from environments in which positive role models are not always easily accessible. These environments often create a sense of powerlessness in the face of difficult socioeconomic forces, a feeling that can lead to poor decision-making. The narrative is a familiar one â€“ young men from low-income neighbourhoods being shepherded along the wrong path as a result of their circumstances. Without basic structures for support, it can be difficult to imagine a better future for oneself; and yet, Alexander's life illustrates that there can be agency in facing these challenges. Gallery |Â Canadians reminisce about Lincoln Alexander after his passing in October 2012: Alexander's inspirational life should not be limited to its impact on black Canadians. Rather, his legacy stands for the broader proposition that Canada is a country in which many things are possible through hard work and perseverance.  In my first summer job as a university student, I had the opportunity to work as a tour guide on Parliament Hill. I can recall one particular tour I gave that included a family of new immigrants. They approached me afterwards to ask questions, and our conversation naturally led to Alexander and his role in Canadian history. To share his story inside the halls of Parliament remains to this day one of my most cherished memories.  While working to help new immigrants adapt to Canada by connecting them to volunteering opportunities, the discussions I've had with them at times revealed a certain anxiety about what type of future their children might have in this strange land. In these moments, I would talk about Alexander and his parents to explain that, despite their difficulties, this is a country in which their kids can ultimately succeed. Alexander's tireless commitment serves as a lesson that optimism should always be the mantra of those seeking to do their part in building a better Canada. However, he also understood that civic excellence is not an exercise in blind praise, but rather a continuous exercise in trying to improve our country by acknowledging its shortcomings. As he once said, ""Canada [is] the greatest country in the world, but it isn't perfect."" In many ways, Alexander exemplifies the brave people that Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of when he alluded to those who ""work while others sleep, who dare while others fly."" Lincoln Alexander Day is a reminder to all Canadians to commit ourselves to setting a high example for others to follow.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-lincoln-alexander-day-1.5426137,[],N/A249,Neil Macdonald,2019-12-17T09:00:00.948Z,Why are photo ops (except Trump's) so brutally boring?: Neil Macdonald,"Any reporter who's ever covered the Middle East can tell you about the Arab leader photo op. It is one of the most curious acts of solipsism ever invented. The beloved leader-for-life, a king or a president, always a man, appears on some hideous filigreed-and-gilded couch or chair, chatting with an important visitor. Maybe sweet tea is served. No questions are allowed. That's it. Lickspittle journalists from the state-controlled media are invited to record the event (usually, no audio is permitted), which is then broadcast at the top of the evening newscast, with gushing narration about the awe and respect and deference shown the leader by his important visitor. I've seen Jordanian television lead its newscast with three identical, consecutive scenes, all on the same royal couch. It's hilarious, and most Western reporters cackle sarcastically when they first see it. I certainly did. In reality, though, photo ops in our democracies aren't much different. Politicians pose and grip and grin, and mouth blandishments, and, like the beloved Arab leaders, are careful to say nothing.Â  The prime photo op directive, it seems, is to say absolutely nothing. The only difference in the West is that leaders don't order journalists to turn off the audio. (I'll bet they would if they could). So reporters scrutinize faces for the slightest flicker of authenticity. Did the Italian PM roll his eyes for a moment? Did Angela Merkel seem to suppress a snicker? Did Melania Trump look exhausted and scared? The exception, of course, is Donald Trump. No need to examine him for tells or tics. Ever since his elevation by the American public he represents so perfectly, he's been barging into photo ops, elbowing his way to the front, running his mouth, looking desperately bored when anyone else is speaking, using other leaders as props, and disrupting everything. I love it. After a lifetime of suffering through photo ops, it's refreshing. Trump might have a mouth like an open sewer, but at least he says something. Watching him crash around NATO's 75th anniversary get-together earlier this month was particularly enjoyable. He turned a photo op with NATO's obsequious secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, into a 52-minute news conference starring himself, bellyaching about Congressional Democrats. He then did the same thing to French president Emmanuel Macron, beside whom he held court for 41 minutes, telling Macron he should take back French citizens who went off to fight for ISIS and are now stranded in detention camps in Syria. ""Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?"" he asked Macron. ""I could give them to you."" Macron sputtered that Trump should be serious, and that foreign fighters are a tiny part of a big problem. It was fascinating: problems normally handled quietly by diplomats, erupting like burst pimples, right out in the open. During Trump's relatively brief 35 minutes with Justin Trudeau, he bluntly asked our prime minister, in front of everybody, why Canada isn't contributing two per cent of GDP to NATO, as required. Actually, asked Trump, ""What are you at? What's your number?"" Trudeau flailed, tried a little boring message track about his government's commitment to raise defence spending (I was sure he was going to start talking about helping the middle class), and finally, after consulting with his retinue, replied 1.4 per cent. Â Well, maybe Canada should be put on a payment plan, gloated Trump. It was those Trump performances that Trudeau and Macron were giggling about at a reception later, when they were caught on camera with the audio turned on. The video went viral, and made headlines, because it was normally scripted leaders caught in a rare moment of honesty. Trump, on the other hand, prefers making fun of people to their faces. A colleague, after watching the NATO coverage for a few days, wrote me asking: ""Why don't more politicians besides an old white racist use these deadly dull canned moments to actually say something?"" Good question. Great question, really. Instead of sniggering at receptions, why don't our leaders stop behaving like wax sculptures of themselves? Wouldn't it have been wonderful, when Trump started bitching about Canada's NATO contribution, if Trudeau had had the bottle to say something like: ""Sure, let's talk about American military leadership. Your country invaded Iraq based on a lie, solved nothing, and caused not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but created ISIS. And now we're learning from your own government correspondence that you had no idea what you were doing in Afghanistan, a mess you actually managed to drag Canada into, and we all spent a lot of blood and treasure for nothing. Great job, Mr. President. Everybody's impressed."" Or, when Trump made his smarty-pants offer to send France some nice ISIS fighters, if Macron had replied: ""Really? Well, let's talk about that. You've been dumping your own prisoners on another country's soil, and holding them indefinitely without due process. Your country has also practised torture as an official policy, and you just pardoned three war criminals. Spare me, Mr. President. Also, and I say this as a Frenchman, your long-tie look is ridiculous."" Instead, the posing and empty statements live on, and will be happening long after Trump lurches off to enjoy the money his resorts have raked in during his presidency. Why does such photo-op mummery persist? Vanity and fear, I'd submit. Some of our leaders, like the Arab potentates, actually think they're so interesting they need only mouth pleasantries to make people listen in fascination. Others take refuge in scripted replies and posed photo ops because they're afraid, probably with good reason, that they'll say something stupid. But Trump has made that all right. Hasn't he? *** Author's Note: A rather doleful column I wrote last September aboutÂ wrestling with a decision on whether to have surgery done onÂ my Border Collie pup Lola, after we discovered she'd been bornÂ with hip dysplasia, generated an awful lot of response fromÂ commiserating dog-owners.Â I can report that we went ahead and basically had her hip jointsÂ removed that month, and that she has recovered brilliantly, andÂ now runs like the wind. She's young and light and flexible and athletic, justÂ like me, and that apparently made all the difference. As did post-op laser therapy and underwater treadmill exercise.

""We're going to comb through it and take out some things that might be a little bit archaic, that aren't necessary anymore,"" said Adams. ""Right now our bylaw is too big. There's too much in it. It states that you'd need to have things that a lot [of companies] currently don't have, and they are operating."" The bylaw, for example, requires a taxi stand with a washroomÂ and has rules about the cleanliness of taxis that the city does not have the resources to enforce. There are three companies in the city, all operating in different ways, Adams said, and the bylaw should reflect what the industry is doing now.

Shaun White, the co-owner of six Domino's franchises around the St. John'sÂ metro region, came through with aboutÂ 2,000 pizzas for the people keeping the city afloat during a state of emergency. ""We figured it was enough to feed 10,000-plus people. We're very proud of the results,"" White told CBC News Tuesday. The idea came together late on Monday, as Shaun White and his wife and fellow co-owner, Melanie, sat home and pondered what they could do to help. The city had been on lockdown since a historic blizzard wreaked havoc on Friday, dumping more than 75Â centimetres of snow across the region. White knew they couldn't open the store in a state of emergency, so he called three levels of government to ask for help. City officials gave the green light, and local MHA Sarah Stoodley even came down and spent the day packing boxes. They called the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary to get a number of how many pizzas they would need, and the police provided an enthusiastic response. They had cars on the road and were willing to deliver. ""The bulk of the pizzas that went to the hospitals yesterday â€” which was in the hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands â€” the RNC volunteered to take those and brought those to the hospitals for us. That was a great help."" Huge thank you to <a href=""https://twitter.com/DominosCanada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@DominosCanada</a> for supplying pizza to first responders during this SOE! Sgt.

Members delivered them to St. Clareâ€™s, RNC locations, and other first responders this afternoon! <a href=""https://t.co/bLyieNzJTR"">pic.twitter.com/bLyieNzJTR</a> To pull everything together, White contacted his staff members, who had been missing shifts since Thursday. They were more than happy to help out, donning the blue, white and red polo shirts and cooking up a tonÂ of product. It's estimated the total value of the giveaways was $30,000. White went along for some of the deliveries, and said he was blown away to see how hardÂ people were working throughout the state of emergency. ""The emergency room at the Health Sciences Centre for example,Â [to see] the staff there, the nurses, the paramedics, the doctors and what they were going through and the burden they were facing.â€_ It was a lot to see,"" he said.Â  ""But to be able to walk in there with something that could brighten their day and see their faces and the responses, that was just fantastic and made everything worth it for sure."" White thanked everyone who helped out, including the national headquarters of Domino's Canada, which provided support for the giveaway. The Gathering Place is also being lauded for its efforts to feed to people in need on Monday and Tuesday. All staff and volunteers within walking distance of the community outreach centre trekked through the snow to provide a hot meal to clients. About 70 people showed up for lunch on Monday.

William Fillier was one of the first people in line Tuesday for a meal. He's been trapped inside since the blizzard, but got out for some much needed socialization and a good meal. ""It's a headache. I've never seen this amount of snow,"" he said. The Gathering Place also had medical staff on site for people needed help. Random boxes also began popping up around St. John's throughout the state of emergency, with people leaving items for others to take. ""Take what you need,"" read a sign placed on a plastic container full of canned goods and baby formula on Seaborn Street. In community Facebook groups, people posted items they had stockpiled in case a nearby resident was in need. Boxes of spaghetti, tomatoes, baby wipes, pampers, formula and more were listed as free for the taking. One person posted that they were in need of dog food and vegan food. Within minutes, one person offered to deliver dog food, while another offered to deliver vegan pea soup.

In March, Health Canada updated its guidelines for the amount of lead and copper allowed in drinking water, cutting the amount of heavy metals permitted. ""The water has not changed, but the limits that we're allowed to have for our staff and students haveÂ changed,"" said Â Prince Rupert School Board chair James Horne. ""Upon the last round ofÂ testing in October, we discovered we no longer met the new standard ofÂ Health Canada for both lead and copper."" This isn't the first time that schools in Prince Rupert have had issues with water. In 2016, the district discovered that the level of lead found in the drinking water did not meet the standardsÂ set by Health Canada. At that point, some of the water fountains were already being replaced, and those ones met the lead standards at the time.Â  However, the older ones tested too high,Â so the district worked closely with the Northern Health Authority to make sure they were in complianceÂ and replaced theÂ taps and the remaining older water fountains in schools.Â  Since then,Â the district has increased the frequency of their water tests from every three years to once a year, added Horne. After finding too much copper and lead during October's test, the district increasedÂ flushing in schools using an automatic flushing system. That lowered theÂ levels of lead in schools to an acceptable level â€” but not copper. ""[Northern Health has]Â told us to now institute a bottled water system in all of our schools, which we've started doing already, until they can confirm that we can meet the copper standard,"" said Horne. ""Our schools are not new. This is an infrastructure issue,"" said the education board chair, adding that the copper is coming from the piping system.Â  The district is looking into several options including either replacing the lines or upgrading the filtration system, or changing the pH of the water. ""Whatever it takes to make the world safe for our staff and our students,"" said Horne. In the interim, there are signs on taps and fountains telling students and staff to use water provided from 20 litre jugs with pumps on them.Â  However, he added that the water itself has not changed, so from that point of view, he is not worried.

This is something that she needs to work on. We need to bring her on the team. The themes in this comic are so much like the themes in the the short film we need to bring her on,' and so that's how I came on,"" Low said.Â  Although Monday's Oscar nominations created a stir for only nominating one actor of colour and no female directors â€”snubbing anticipated nominees like Greta Gerwig, Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Murphy, and films like The Farewell â€”Â Low says a nomination for Hair Love is a win.Â  ""People really crave this kind of storytelling and it benefits everybody,"" she said.Â  ""I really feel like a lot of people might not haveÂ considered, you know, a story about a black family relatable to the masses, but you watch it and you could find yourself in it.""

James Mitchell, a retired air force psychologist and former CIA contractor, testified for the first time in open court at the U.S. navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where five men face a trial next year by military commission for their alleged roles planning and aiding al-Qaeda's attacks against the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. Mitchell and another psychologist, Bruce Jessen, were contracted by the CIA to develop the interrogation program, which included waterboarding, intense sleep deprivation and prolonged shackling in ""stress positions"" and is now widely regarded as torture. Defence lawyers for the five men charged in the attacks have called the contractors, who observed and took part in interrogations at clandestine CIA facilities, as witnesses in an effort to disqualify statements the defendants made to the FBI. Mitchell and Jessen gave depositions in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of three former prisoners, including one who died in custody. The case was settled for undisclosed terms in August 2017 and the two former contractors did not testify in court. Listen: Former Guantanamo guard on CBC Radio's Day 6 in 2015 Their testimony in Guantanamo is an important milestone in the Sept. 11 war crimes proceedings, which have been bogged down in the pretrial phase since the men were arraigned in May 2012. ""This testimony marks a critical moment for reckoning with the torture committed in the American people's name,"" said ACLU staff attorney Dror Ladin. ""Mitchell and Jessen, along with collaborators in the U.S. government, are responsible for shameful cruelty that the CIA is still trying to cover up."" Mitchell was expected to be followed on the stand by Jessen. Their testimony will likely take up much of a pretrial hearing scheduled to last two weeks. The defendants include Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, an al-Qaeda operative who has portrayed himself as the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. All five face the death penalty if convicted of charges that include terrorism and nearly 3,000 counts of murder for their alleged roles planning and providing logistical support to the hijacking plot. Under a 2006 law that set up the military commission, any statements must be voluntary to be admitted into evidence and the government is not seeking to use at the trial anything the men said while in CIA custody. But the prisoners also gave what prosecutors have called ""clean"" statements to the FBI after they arrived at Guantanamo and were placed in military custody in September 2006 after several years at CIA facilities. Lawyers for the five defendants argue that everything the men have said in custody was tainted by the torture they were subjected to while in CIA confinement. James Connell, a lawyer for defendant Ammar al-Baluchi, said he believes the FBI helped guide some of the questioning of the men while they were in CIA custody. ""Our global goal is to have all the statements thrown out,"" Connell said before the hearing. A Senate investigation in 2014 found that the interrogation program designed by Mitchell and Jessen was used on 39 detainees and produced no useful intelligence. They were paid $81 million US for their work, according to the Senate report. Listen: As It Happens, May 2019 Mitchell and Jessen previously worked at the air force survival school at Fairchild Air Force Base outside Spokane, Wash., where they trained pilots to avoid capture and resist interrogation and torture. The CIA hired them to reverse-engineer that training to break terrorism suspects. They defended their work when the lawsuit was settled, arguing that neither contractor condoned or conducted any mistreatment of prisoners and that the overall program was authorized by the government. Jessen said in a statement then that he and Mitchell served their country ""at a time when freedom and safety hung in the balance.""

In addition to homicide charges, Vale S.A. and TÃœV SÃœD, the company responsible for inspecting the dam, were charged with environmental crimes. Prosecutors said theÂ 16 individuals charged had worked for Vale or TÃœV SÃœD, which has its global headquarters in Germany.Â  The charges, which come almost exactly oneÂ year after the collapse of theÂ Vale dam in the state of Minas Gerais, represent a major step forward in Brazilian authorities' attempt to hold individuals criminally responsible for the disaster.

But their new fire suppressant, developed here and patented in Canada and the United States, needs to pass stringent U.S. regulatory hurdles before it can be dropped from planes or helicopters over wildfiresÂ in Australia, California or even here at home. Their Napanee, Ont., startup, FireRein, convinced friends and family to invest in their product, called Eco-Gel, then convinced volunteer fire departments in the area to test their concoction. The companyÂ claims Eco-GelÂ snuffs out flames more effectively and using less water than standard suppressants, and doesn't contain the same toxic cocktail currently used to fight wildfires in Canada and around the world. ""We wanted to make a product that was safeÂ â€” safe enough to eat,"" said Hodgen, FireRein's co-founder and vice-president. The purely plant-based productÂ is made largely of canola oil, cornstarch and other ingredients commonly found in your kitchen pantry. It resembles a thickÂ salad dressing or creamy honey, and is diluted with water to put out fires. Before FireRein, Hodgen worked as an industrial paramedic in the oil patch andÂ battledÂ wildfires in Manitoba, jobs that put him in regular contact with fire suppressing products packed with chemicals. ""I had no idea. We didn't wear gloves around those products,"" he recalled. ""We were told it was safe."" Before Eco-Gel can be used to fight wildfires anywhere, it needs certification from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), considered the industry gold standard. In Canada, everyÂ provinceÂ requires that a fire suppressant be on the USDA's list of qualified products before it's dropped from aircraft. Municipal fire departments don't have the same requirement. ""It does seem a little strange we have to go to the United States to certify our product to have it dropped on Canadian soil,"" HodgenÂ noted. ""But you do need to have products that are plug-and-play with international jurisdictions."" FireRein is now working with Underwriters Laboratory and the USDA to get the designation it needs to drop Eco-GelÂ  from aircraftÂ as well as for use at airports. That lengthy process could cost between $500,000 and $1 million. FireRein is hoping sales of its fire prevention spray gels, along with extra help from investors, will help see the companyÂ through the U.S. certification ordeal, Hodgen said. There are ongoing legal cases in Canada, the U.S. and Australia over soil and water contamination stemming from the use ofÂ fire-suppressing foamÂ near military bases, airports and testing facilities. NearÂ Smiths Falls, Ont., some residents are still dealingÂ with the toxic aftermath of aÂ 2017Â flea market fireÂ after firefighters battling the blaze used chemical-based foam. Fire chiefs involved in the incident later said they'd been told the suppressant they'd sprayed on the flames wasÂ ""environmentally friendly"" and ""biodegradable."" Emmons,Â a volunteer firefighter for more than 20 years, said he began researching better solutions because he didn't believe those claims. ""'Biodegradable' is a common green-washing term,"" Emmons said. The chief of the Drummond/North Elmsley fire service, which battled the 2017 flea market blaze, said his department is now using Eco-Gel in training, and plans to deploy it on future calls due to ""foam issues in the past.""Â Â  University of Guelph scientists have tested the environmental toxicity of several fire-suppressing products on the market. ""Eco-Gel actually turned out to be, in most cases, the least toxic of the six we tested,"" said Ryan Prosser, assistant professor of environmental sciences at the University of Guelph, who received a grant to carry out the research.Â  USDA certification requiresÂ a standardized test using rainbow trout, according to Prosser.Â Eco-Gel passed the trout test ""even at the highest rate of application,"" he said. ""We didn't observe mortality."" Another study by the Applied Science department at St. Lawrence College in Kingston, Ont., looked at how well three different products put out fires. Â  In the controlled evaluation, the researchers determined FireRein's Eco-Gel showed ""comparable, if not better knockdown time and water saving performance than similar, commercially available gel or foam agents used by firefighting agencies.""Â  Jeff Thompson, chief of the Stone Mills volunteer fire department northwest of Kingston, said his crew has used Eco-Gel at three big fires.Â  ""It's worked very well. We're a lot quicker,""Â Thompson said. ""We had a tractor-trailer fire with new cars on it. They were able to stop that from spreading down the trailer into the newer cars.""Â Â  But Thompson said the primary reason his departmentÂ decided to try it is to prevent the contamination of wells, lakes and rivers in their rural territory.Â  The FireRein team is nowÂ talking toÂ the province of Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources regarding a pilot project during the next wildfire season. It's also reaching out to potential partners in Australia in the hopes of licensing and manufacturing their product in that country.

Prosecutors had a 30-day windowÂ to appeal the ruling and Monday was the last day for the Crown to challenge the court's decision. ""I can confirm that the Crown has not filed an appeal in this matter,"" Brian Gray, a spokesmanÂ for Ontario's attorney general, said in an email to CBCÂ News Monday.Â  On Dec. 19,Â Doody ruled there was not proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, to convict Boyle of the 19 charges against him. The charges included assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement. All but two charges involved Boyle's estranged wife, Caitlan Coleman. During his three hour ruling, DoodyÂ said he found Coleman's evidence unreliable due to inconsistencies in her testimony and memory lapses. Coleman testified that she was slapped, confined, tied up and forced to have sex with Boyle after the couple returned to Ottawa having spent five years inÂ captivity in Afghanistan.Â  Boyle, 36, pleaded not guilty to all 19 chargesÂ andÂ took the stand in his defence during the trial. Boyle said he was the victim, and his wife was emotionally and physically abusive to him. But Doody said he also found Boyle unreliable.Â  ""I do not believe her, just as I do not believe Mr. Boyle,"" he said. In October 2012, a Taliban-linked group kidnapped Boyle and Coleman near Kabul during a backpacking trip through Central Asia. Three of the couple's four children were born in captivity.Â  The trial became a test case for Canada's rape shield laws which prevent the defence from using emails, medical records or an alleged victim's past sexual history to prove a pattern of sexual behaviour. The court can make an exceptionÂ if the accused, or their lawyers, demonstrate that including those details areÂ of value. In this case,Â Doody ruledÂ that the defence could introduce evidence that was in the possession of the accused: a medical record from a January 2018 session Coleman had with a psychologist. The psychologist's notes indicate Coleman said her husband began assaulting her in December, 2017. Coleman told police and the courtÂ that the physical and sexual assault began in October, 2017. The judge also allowed evidence about Coleman's sexual history after a section 276.2 application. The defence was able to ask Coleman about the couple's prior sexual activity, includingÂ consensual anal and vaginal intercourse, sexual acts involving ropes and consensual biting acts. Coleman previously testified that Boyle forced her to perform these acts against her will.

Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members. Some medical staff have also been infected, but no number was confirmed.Â  As of Jan. 21, 440Â cases of the newly identified coronavirus have been confirmed in China, most of them in Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization. NineÂ people have died â€” all in China, most of themÂ age 60 or older, including some who had a previous medical condition. There have also been cases reported in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, ThailandÂ and, as of Tuesday, the United States,Â all involving people who had travelled from mainland China. CoronavirusesÂ areÂ a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases â€” such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS was the coronavirus that originated in China in late 2002, and which eventually killed 44 people in Canada and infected more than 400 before the outbreak in China was declared by the WHO to be ""under control"" on Apr. 28, 2004.Â  The WHO's China office was first informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec.31, 2019. The cases were all detected in Wuhan City. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the probable cause by Chinese authorities Jan. 7. The WHO reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan.Â  Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they pass from animals to humans. But some, like this newly identified strain, canÂ pass directly between humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., coronaviruses are most commonly spread by coughing or sneezing;Â close personal contact, such as shaking hands;Â or touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.Â  The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoVÂ are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.Â  According to the WHO, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.Â  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) deems the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan as low. But it has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions, such as avoiding large crowds and high-risk areas such as farms and slaughterhouses, and avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of a coronavirus, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing.Â  There have been no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in Canada, according to Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam. She says threeÂ people in Canada who had travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but results were negative.Â  PHAC says it will introduce measuresÂ in the coming week, including signs at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, advising travellers from affected areas of the world to inform border services staff of any flu-like symptoms.Â  The United States has begun screeningÂ people coming on direct flightsÂ from Wuhan for the newly identified coronavirus at New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person-to-person transmission.Â  - Dr. Jeremy Farrar, infectious disease specialist. We don't know enough to know whether we should be worried â€_ If this is a virus that can sustain itself in humans nowÂ â€” is transmitted from person to person and lives in humansÂ â€” then the Lunar New Year travel will spread it faster in China, no doubt. If this is a virus that is not sustainable in human populations, if it doesn't transmit well enough, then the Lunar New Year means we'll see new cases, it will create a lot of concern, but it won't cause problems.Â  - Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto The one piece of good news we have here is that this is possibly not as virulent a virus as SARS and won't result in as many deaths, but almost all the other news we have at the moment is unfortunately bad news â€_Â FourteenÂ medical staff infected from the first 200 cases is quite a high number. But on the other hand, the medical staff are in very close contact with the patients there, they're in the hospital wards and so on. And therefore, they're at greater risk than the general public.Â  - Dr. Derek Gatherer,Â Lancaster University WATCH:Â Dr. Allison McGeerÂ of Toronto's MountÂ Sinai Hospital speaks to CBC News about the new coronavirus outbreak.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/coronavirus-1.5427310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898,N/A265,Paul Withers,2020-01-21T10:00:00.693Z,Software glitch damages part of new Canadian science vessel,"A software malfunction is being blamed for damaging a critical piece of equipment on board Canada's new offshore fisheries science vessel, Canadian Coast Guard Ship Sir John Franklin. Spooling gear on the starboard trawl winch took off on its own. The winch is used to retrieve heavy gear and nets deployed to gather ocean climate data and fish stocks on board the B.C.-based vessel. The coast guard saidÂ the damaged part will be replaced and the winch repaired when the ship heads into planned maintenance next month. At the time of the malfunction, no personnel was in the vicinity, spokespersonÂ Benoit Mayrand wrote in an email to CBC News. AnÂ officialÂ with the Union of Canadian Transportation EmployeesÂ said the malfunction occurred in the middle of the night during a patrol last November. ""The shipyard is aware of the issue and is taking responsibility and will complete the repairs under warranty,"" Mayrand said. Franklin was the first large ship built under Canada's national shipbuilding strategy and it was delivered last June. Seaspan Shipyard in Vancouver was awarded the contract to build three offshore fisheries science vessels in a $687-million project.Â CCGS Jacques Cartier, which will be based in Halifax,Â was turned over to the coast guard last November. The third vessel,Â the John Cabot, is expected to be delivered this summer and will be based in St. John's. Seaspan said the sophisticated software and systems on its vessels are tested and approved by independent third parties before delivery. ""As with all large, complex systems, it is not uncommon for minor software anomalies to occur. These are addressed in routine maintenance windows. This is a minor issue isolated to the Sir John Franklin,"" spokesperson Amy MacLeodÂ wrote in an email to CBC. Last March, Franklin struck a breakwater as it was returning from its first week of sea trials. To ensure the ship met its June delivery date,Â the rudder and propeller were removed from the third offshore science vessel, the JohnÂ Cabot,Â and installed on Franklin. ""There are no delays to the delivery of the CCGS John Cabot due to the breakwater incident and no financial implications for the Government of Canada,"" Mayrand said. No parts were needed from the Cabot to repair the Franklin starboard trawl winch. In 2018,Â CBC News revealed portions of the Franklin hull were re-welded after an inspectionÂ uncovered a series of defective joints.

Rural Municipalities Alberta said Monday that a survey of its members shows that they are owed a total of $173 million â€” a 114 per cent increase since a similar survey was done last spring. ""Municipalities require property taxes to provide the infrastructure and services that industry relies on to access natural resources,"" association president Al Kemmere said in a release. ""If Alberta's property tax system is not amended to prevent oil and gas companies from refusing to pay property taxes, many rural municipalities will struggle to remain viable."" In Ponoka County, south of Edmonton, Reeve Paul McLauchlin estimates his municipality is owed about $2.6 million out of a total municipal budget of $27 million. Ponoka now has a ""write-down budget"" â€”Â a budget for money owed by failed companies unlikely to ever be paid. The county never had such a budget until recently, McLauchlin said. ""It creates operational constraints, our ability to provide community services. We have non-profits asking for assistance. We say 'no' more and more."" Industry says the way taxes are assessed is driving companies out of business. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, said Ben Brunnen, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""We defend the need for the province to take a look at how assessment works and have it reflective of the market,"" he said. ""A lot of these unpaid taxes are coming in jurisdictions where you've got assets that are older and not as productive or economic. The choice for these types of assets is to shut (them) in or find a way to reduce costs."" Those shut-in wells often end up abandoned and unreclaimed after a bankruptcy, said Brunnen, who suggested some municipalities are going to have to accept less oil and gas revenue. The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled last year that municipalities are unsecured creditors in the case of a bankruptcy, which puts them at the back of the line for tax debt collection on infrastructure such as pipelines. ""Oilpatch property taxes are now voluntary,"" suggested Regan Boychuk, a researcher with the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, which works to understand the impact of old energy infrastructure. Some of the unpaid taxes are assessed to companies that remain in operation. McLauchlin, an oilpatch consultant, said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin said. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs."" Some of that has already occurred. Last year, Alberta's United Conservative government implemented legislation allowing municipalities to cut taxes on certain kinds of wells by up to about one-third. The province initially reimbursed municipalities for the cuts.Â  But the municipalities say that program has ended and they've been left to absorb the loss. Boychuk said mill rates on wells and other facilities haven't changed in years. Oil and gas reserves, however, have declined. ""What industry is really saying is that they've depleted their wells so far they can't cover operating costs. The wells are done and whatever wealth remains needs to be directed to cleanup rather than looted any further before bankruptcy."" The number of wells under care of the Orphan Well Association, an industry-funded group that cleans up abandoned wells, stands at 3,400 â€” an increase of 300 since last January. McLauchlin said industry is important to his county and council is happy to try to work out payment plans. Honouring those debts is one of the two things in life that is supposed to be unavoidable, he said. ""You've got to pay your taxes."" Alberta Municipal Affairs MinisterÂ Kaycee MaduÂ said in a statement to CBC News that his government recognizes the impact this issue is having on rural communities. ""We are working to identify potential tools that may help balance the interests of municipalities with the economic realities facing many employers since the 2014-15 downturn,"" he said.

For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. We are entering the final year of what has been one of the worst decades for children. War, disease and extreme weather events are robbing them of their right to simply be a kid â€“ to have a safe, healthy and carefree childhood. In far too many communities around the world, sounds of youngsters laughing and getting into mischief are being replaced by silence. It doesn't have to be that way. This month, UNICEF launched Humanitarian Action for Children 2020, a report on the world's emergencies. It highlights some of the key challenges children are facing around the world: severe malnutrition, conflict, infectious disease, climate change, and access to education. Children displaced by crises are also vulnerable to increased harm, including gender-based violence, recruitment as soldiers, exploitation, and trafficking. The sheer magnitude of the situation is heartbreaking. The report identifies 59 million children in 64 countries who are living in crisis zones and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 2 million children with disabilities. These are the highest levels since we began keeping records. The projections for the year ahead are just as dire. The main causes are threefold â€“ conflict, climate change and major outbreaks of disease. The number of armed conflicts is at a three-decade high, with many civil wars engulfing entire countries. More than 30 million children are caught in the middle. Yemen has been a battleground for more than four years. Fighting has been going on for six years in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Syria's civil war is now in its ninth year. And these conflicts have no end in sight. Some have lasted so long that many kids are growing up only knowing war. Top priorities in these war-torn regions include providing children with protection, safe water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. And the need is great. In the coming year, for example, UNICEF expects it will need to treat 5.1 million children for acute malnutrition, provide 4.5 million children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, and distribute emergency cash assistance to 1.7 million families to meet their most urgent needs. Immediate responses to crises in the year ahead must also be balanced with the longer-term needs of children, most importantly their education, which is also under attack. During disasters, schools are often used as shelters or distribution centres, since they are usually among the strongest structures. In conflict zones, they are increasingly becoming targets. More than 3,000 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the past three years because of violence and insecurity. Kids are incredibly adaptable, but in any emergency, getting them back into a classroom as quickly as possible is essential. Education to help them reach their potential is obviously important, but letting them be with their friends in a safe space also gives them a return to normalcy. As if wars and conflict weren't enough, millions of children are also threatened by outbreaks of highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Major outbreaks are now hitting the most vulnerable in conflict zones, greatly complicating the ability of aid agencies to respond. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest ever recorded and the first to occur in the middle of a conflict zone. There are 3,000 confirmed cases, including more than 900 children. Measles has also become a threat to children despite safe and affordable vaccines. As with any public health campaign for children, educating the adult decision-makers is the key to eliminating this deadly threat. Climate change is also affecting the most vulnerable. More than 500 million children live in areas that have experienced extreme flooding, while 160 million live in regions that are subject toÂ severe drought. And the number of extreme weather events keeps rising. Mozambique was hit by back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, for example, and rebuilding will take years. Regions like the Sahel in Africa, where livelihoods rely on agriculture, grazing and fishing, are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Solutions demand a long-term commitment. The positive news is that humanitarian organizations have made tremendous progress working with host governments in areas likely to experience extreme weather and flooding, helping to build more resilient communities and better prepare for disasters. Still, the threats children are facing are overwhelming. The amount of funding for emergencies that UNICEF projects it will need in 2020 is $4.2 billion US, a staggering 3.5 times the amount required in 2010, underscoring how frightening the world has become for young people. But as someone who has worked in the international humanitarian sector for going on four decades, I refuse to be discouraged. We cannot give up. The international community, governments and civil society need to come together to protect and defend children's rights. The government of Canada is playing a global leadership role in prioritizing education for children in conflict zones and other protracted humanitarian crises. But as a nation we must do more to help children around the world. People in this country clearly care about children's welfare. I am confident Canadians will rise to the challenge and defend, for every child everywhere, the right to a safe and healthy childhood.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-child-welfare-1.5367654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-war-saudis-houthis-1.5373868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unhcr-refugee-forum-1.5398929 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mali-violence-massacre-children-1.5171664 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/mali-mission-1.5272076 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/violence-against-health-workers-worsening-measles-outbreak-in-congo-1.5377716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107,N/A269,John Last,2020-01-22T12:30:00.793Z,Colville Lake makes pitch for local control on 1st day of Sahtu caribou hearings,"Leaders from Colville Lake, N.W.T., say the government should allow them to lift hunting quotas and replace them with local regulations guided by Dene law.Â  ""We're trying to make sure our way of life is relevant,"" said David Codzi, president of Colville Lake's Ayoni Keh Land Corporation. ""We've been doing this for too long to say that it's wrong."" The community's locally-developed caribou conservation plan was presented as the first act of business at a three-day ""public listening session"" on the caribou harvest, organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board.Â The sessions have brought more than 60 visitors to the small community of about 130 people, and have been well-attended. According to the plan, one goal is to ""avoid intervention"" by the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources to regulate harvest through tags or quota systems,Â which it calls an ""unprecedented colonial system of control."" In their place, the plan proposes a bottom-upÂ management system based on mutual respect for and ""inter-dependence with Ê”É™dÉ™,"" the traditional name for caribou. It also says conservation efforts must be guided by the wisdom of elders and the community's traditional law, or Ê”eÊ”a. Among the Ê”eÊ”a principles, the plan outlines are respect for the land, sharing and a belief ""that all things have a spirit and are interconnected."" Colville Lake's caribou conservation plan proposes the revitalization of the community's traditional lawÂ through the documentation of harvesting customs, the development of new research standards, and educating youth.Â  The plan would significantly empower Colville Lake's local renewable resource council, which it asserts is better placed to assess the conservation needs of the herd. Government departments are too ""siloed"" to take the holistic approach to conservation possible on a local level, according to the plan. It commits Colville Lake's authorities to establish and enforce local guidelines. It would also collect and share harvest numbers with partners in the territorial government. ""Although reporting harvest numbers may be alien to the customs of the Dene, it â€_ may serve to prevent the imposition of unacceptable harvest restrictions,"" the plan reads. If fully accepted, the plan would also obligate the government to consult with the local renewable resource council before permitting any proposed mineral and petroleum exploration on the caribou range. That rangeÂ extends well outside the territory, into Yukon and Nunavut. The plan also asks that the government and exploration companies to consider reportingÂ annually ""what they are doing on the land."" The plan must be approved by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board in its list of decisions produced from the session, due to be released Mar. 31. Then it will head to the territorial government, whichÂ will need to decide if and how to implement it under the territory's Wildlife Act.

The province will allow a provision stating those seeking a medically assisted death must be ""at the end of life'' to simply disappear from its legislation, the ministers said, without making any further amendments to the proposed law. The decision means more people will qualify for a medically assisted death, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said, reminding reporters that patients will still have to meet the law's five other criteria to qualify. ""They have a choice,'' McCann said. ""That's the spirit in which we made the decision â€”Â the self-determination that a human being who has met all those five criteria ... will have a choice.'' Last September, Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and a section the Quebec law that states people must ""be at the end of life,'' which prevented access to medical assistance in dying for some. The case was brought by two Quebec residents â€” Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon â€” who did not meet the criteria and had their requests for assisted death turned down by doctors. Both suffer from incurable degenerative diseases, and lawyers argued the condition that a person's natural death be ''reasonably foreseeable'' before they can receive medical assistance in dying was overly strict. Gladu suffers from post-polio syndrome and medication no longer helps alleviate her pain, the court heard. Doctors gave her about two to three years to live due to her pulmonary condition. Truchon has cerebral palsy. Three of his four limbs were not functional at birth, and he just lost the use of the fourth, but he could continue to live for many more years. The two launched a legal action against the federal and provincial governments, claiming their right to life, liberty and security â€” guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms â€”Â was infringed. Baudouin suspended the application of her judgment until March 11 to give federal and provincial legislators six months to modify the laws, while granting exemptions to Gladu and Truchon to seek medical aid in dying during this period if they satisfied other legal conditions. Neither the federal or provincial governments appealed the decision, although the federal government has not yet announced exactly what it intends to do. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly. The government launched public consultations on the issue. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel said her federal counterpart, David Lametti, is expected to brief provincial ministers this week in Victoria, B.C. ""Theoretically, as long as the federal criteria exists, it applies, so it's in effect until March 12,'' LeBel said, adding it's unclear if the federal government will seek an extension. The chair of the commission that oversees end-of-life care in the province is confident that despite the change in wording, there won't be a flood of people lining up for medical assistance in dying. ""The commission is not afraid that on March 12, the demand will increase tremendously,'' said Dr. Michel Bureau said. ""That's not what we believe.'' But LeBel said the time was right for Quebec to make its announcement, noting the province is about to embark on consultations to broaden the criteria on Jan. 27.

Inspired by the new year, I fall into the same trap every year:Â I buy kale, join a gym, sign up for Dry January. By week two, my lust for wellness hasÂ faded, and I grumpily attend the gym while dreaming of the breweries I plan to visit in the coming months. By week three, I've endured three snowstorms, two credit card bills and one round of influenza. NextÂ comes Blue Monday. The third Monday of January is considered to be the saddest day of the year. It makes perfect sense to me. Afterall, the dark closes in around five and it's a long way until the green grass of spring. And then there's the snow. All the snow. That's the way it's felt, including thisÂ latest blizzard that has struck much of Newfoundland. Now's a good time to embrace hibernation, take a break from the resolutions and â€_ make some comfort food! For me, comfort food is connected to memory and place. Food that makes you feel cozy. My favourite is a grilled cheese. It reminds me of my mom. I remember sitting through math class in Grade 4. It was winter. I had failed a test (division was tough). I was near tears and just wanted my mom. I got off the bus, went upstairs, and was greeted with a hug and a grilled cheese. The whole day was turned around. Comfort food is a concept that exists across cultures. Different vegetation, climates and traditions lend themselves to different types of comfort food, but a particular idea â€” that certain foods make you a bit nostalgic, warm, and safe â€” exists everywhere. I was curious about comfort food in different cultures, so I reached out to some neighbours and friends for recipes. Malin Enstrom tends to make Swedish food and baked goods during Scandinavian holidays, but she'll also whip up treats when she's missing home or feeling disconnected from her own culture. Like here, the idea of comfort food in Sweden is connected to nostalgia and familiarity, but Malin also suggests that comfort food is connected to scent. ""We (Swedes) love cooking and baking with fragrant spices such as nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, star anise, cinnamon, juniper and saffron. The spices used tend to depend on the seasons and those are probably my winter-months spices,"" she told me. ""In the summer months I tend to cook with lighter flavours, such as elderflower, dill, chive, fennel seeds and parsley."" The food she misses most as an adult includes caviar, pickled herring in dill mustard sauce and Swedish meatballs. ""This sounds like a clichÃ©, but Swedish meatballs are fantastic. When you combine the meatballs with garlic-mashed potatoes, partridgeberry sauce, pickled cucumbers and a cream sauce, you get the perfect combination of warmness, tartness and a hint of sweetness,"" she said. ""It is a simple dish to make and I make it fairly often. It probably has a heightened effect here as I have to make it from scratch as I want the spices to be just right. "" I asked Malin for her favourite recipe and boy, did she deliver. Literally, she brought a jar of juniper apple soup to my house for me to sample. The flavour was tart, piney, and smooth. She recommended serving it alongside some braised moose for a Swedish/ Newfoundland fusion dish. I've shared Malin's recipe below. Hailing from Brazil, Fernanda Cedraz Mamede is my favourite baker in town. She makes towering gooey chocolate cakes at the Georgestown Bakery. I'm obsessed with them and I order a piece most Saturdays. Fernanda highlighted that Brazil is an enormous country with an incredibly diverse population. ""In Minas Gerais comfort food would be cheese bread (PÃ£o de queijo),"" she told me. ""In Bahia, comfort food can be a seafood stew with coconut milk, palm oil and cilantro (Moqueca). In Rio Grande do Sul, polenta would be called comfort food. In Amazonas comfort food would be a stew made with some plants found in the Amazon Rainforest (TacacÃ¡)."" When pressed, Fernanda mentioned that rice and beans would probably be something that the whole country would classify as comfort food. ""When a Brazilian thinks about that combination of food, we immediately think about eating this at home with family."" Fernanda is from the northeast of Brazil and her ideal comfort food is 'cuscus.'Â It's a breakfast food made of butter, cheese, eggs, and occasionally sweet coconut milk. It requires a type of corn flour that is impossible to find in St. John's, so she adapted the recipe below for us. Prajwala Dixit is one of my favourite writers in town and I suspected that she'sÂ also a great cook. Like Brazil, India is an enormous and diverse country, so identifying one specific comfort food was a challenge. For Prajwala, a spicy tomato lentil soul eaten with a dollop of ghee is a staple, but there are other dishes she craves. ""Weeks where I have had long days, I crave my mother's anna saaru. The tangy flavours of the saaru intertwine with the earthiness of rice,"" she told me. ""The smell of fresh seasoning of hing (asafoetida) and black mustard coupled with coriander makes the mouth water and the heart melt."" Prajwala's comforting spice mixture is a top secret family recipe, so our third recipe is my own blueberry grilled cheese recipe. Juniper apple soup from Sweden (serves 6-8) Ingredients 1 tbsp juniper berries 2 cardamom pods 2 allspice berries 1 cinnamon stick 2 sprigs fresh tarragon 2 tbsp olive oil 2 apples, peeled, cored and diced 1 shallot, finely chopped 1 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 4 cups chicken stock 2 cups heavy cream Juice from 2 apples or 1 cup apple cider Â_ cup cider vinegar Â_ cup apple brandy Â_ cup port or Madeira Salt and pepper Directions: 1. Wrap the juniper berries, cardamom pods, allspice berries, cinnamon stick and tarragon in a piece of cheesecloth and tie with kitchen twine. 2. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the apples, shallot and ginger and sautÃ© for 2-3 minutes, until the shallots starts to soften. Add the stock, cream, apple juice or cider, stir, then add the spice bundle and bring to a brisk simmer. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, 30-40 minutes. 3. Remove the cheesecloth bundle and blend the soup with a blender, in batches, and purÃ©e. Return the soup to the saucepan. Bring the soup to a boil, stir in the brandy, vinegar and port or Madeira, and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste and remove from heat. Cuscus from Brazil Ingredients 2 cups cornmeal 1 1/2 cups white sugar 1 cup milk 1 cup coconut milk 1 cup all-purpose flour 3 eggs 1/3 cup vegetable oil 1 tsp baking powder Directions: Preheat oven to 340 degrees F (170 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch round cake pan. Blend cornmeal, sugar, milk, coconut milk, flour, eggs, and vegetable oil in a blender until smooth; add baking powder and blend to integrate. Pour the cornmeal mixture into the prepared cake pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centreÂ comes out clean (30 to 40 minutes). Andie'sÂ gussied-up blueberry grilled cheese *Makes one sandwich A grilled cheese is a simple thing, but that means that the quality of ingredients really counts. Always real butter!Â I saw a friend make a grilled cheese using canola oil once and it shook me to my core. Buy the crusty sourdough! Good bread counts here. Don'tÂ skimp on the cheese either. You want an applewood smoked cheddar, shredded Gruyere, good quality cheeses that melt nicely. A little touch of mozza in there is always a good idea. Ingredients 2 tbsp butter, softened, divided 2 slices sourdough, cut on the diagonal 1/3 cup shredded applewood smoked cheddar 1/4 cup Gruyere Small handful of mozzarella, shreddedÂ  1 tbspÂ of quick blueberry jam Directions: Spread a tablespoon of softened butter onto one side of each slice of bread. Do the same with the blueberry jam. Next you're going to build your sandwich. So throw all of that shredded cheese on top. Shredding the cheese is key, otherwise it'll melt at different rates. Heat a skillet over medium heat. I think using a well-seasoned cast iron is important. Next, melt a tablespoon of butter in the pan. Place one of your sandwiches onto the heated surface. Cook twoÂ minutes on each side, or until golden brown and the cheese is melted. Simple and delicious.

They want their historic Pointe-Claire Village to remain free of high-rise condos. For the most part,Â elected officials agree. The city has proposed banning buildings higher than two storey on all but nine lots in the village. The city says those nine lots willÂ be allowed a third floor if that floorÂ is set back from the second and built to promote ""commercial vitality and residential projects."" ThatÂ proposed exemption had citizens furious during a public meeting Tuesday evening as, one by one, theyÂ took the microphone to voice their frustration. So many showed up to the meeting thatÂ some were turned away at the door. ""Our position is that we think the entire village should be kept at two storeys so that we can maintain its character,"" said Andrew Swidzinski, vice president of the Pointe-Claire Heritage Society. Deborah Fairchild said three-storey buildings are unwelcome and the mayor isn't listening. ""The consensus is very, very clear, that people do not want gentrification,"" she said.Â  ""They don't want three-storey buildings. They don't want another downtown. They want to keep the character of the village and preserve it as the beautiful place that it is with the open spaces and to preserve the businesses and economy that are already there."" This discussion has been dragging on for a number of years as the city looks to amend its village code â€” a series of rules aimed at preserving various heritage sites by regulating the appearance of buildings, land subdivisions and new construction. The city has previously suggested setting the cap at six storeys, but residents quickly shot thatÂ down â€” not wanting the quiet, timeworn feel of the village to be overtaken by towering complexes. The newly proposed limit of two storeys on all but nine buildings will affect Lakeshore Drive as well as the properties on Cartier Avenue, south of Lanthier Avenue. Buildings in the area will be limited to 12 metres, no matter if they are two or three storeys.Â  In a city statement issued Tuesday, Mayor John Belvedere saidÂ the proposed changes are intended to make the village ""a destination of choice for all."" After the meeting, he said to keep the village vital, it can't be frozen in time. ""The village did not get to where it is today without change. We need to think of the future and the future is, you know, densification,"" he said. All the buildings would have commercial on the ground floor, he said, meaning there can only be so many residential units on the upper floors given the limited number of storeys. He said the city has been working closely with citizens, ensuring green spaces are preserved while allowing the village to grow economically. ""Right now, the village is busy. We have put a lot of time and energy into the village,"" he said. ""I think anybody is allergic to change. I accept that. I understand that. It's a scary thing, change. But if you don't change, you maintain the status quo, you actually go backward.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/pointe-claire-height-restrictions-village-1.5435666,[],N/A273,Anonymous,2020-01-18T09:00:00.999Z,"Eight years after, Canada's move to close Iranian embassy still controversial","The final act of foreign officer Barbara Martin's career was to oversee the closure of the Canadian embassy in Tehran in 2012 â€” a decision that continues to divide members of this country's Iranian community. Martin was the Department of Foreign Affairs' director general for the Middle East and North Africa when then-minister John Baird announced Canada had suspended diplomatic relations with Iran and expelled Iranian diplomats from Canada. The move came months after Iranian students stormed the British embassy in the Iranian capitalÂ in November 2011 â€” an event which sent a chill through the diplomatic community. ""Watching an event like that happen to a very friendly allied country, we were concerned about the security at our own embassy and whether we could see ourselves facing some sort of similar event,"" Martin said Thursday in an interview with The House. Before closing the embassy, she said, officials destroyed all records and computer equipment to ensure none of it fell into Iranian hands. One of the last tasks performed by embassy staff before they discreetly caught flights back to Canada was to take down the Canadian flag, she said. Now, almost eight years later â€” and in the immediarteÂ aftermath of last week's downing of UIA Flight PS752, which killed all 176 passengers and crew on board, including 57 Canadians â€” some Iranian Canadians would like to see the federal government restore diplomatic ties with Iran and reopen the embassy. ""As Justin Trudeau says, Canada needs to mediate and de-escalate the situation,"" Iranian Canadian Congress spokesperson Pouyan Tabasinejad told The House on Friday. ""We've seen what happens when we don't have anything, we've seen what the politics of isolation and conflict give us. For eight years, we've seen that since Stephen Harper closed the embassy."" But critics of the Iranian government such as lawyer and human rights activist Kaveh Shahrooz say re-opening the embassy would send TehranÂ the wrong message. ""I don't see this argument for diplomatic relations, which really should be thought of as a reward for good behaviour. I don't understand why this argument keeps coming up when the Iranian regime has just killed so many of our civilians,Â  lied about it and is trying to obfuscate and hide the truth,"" he told The House on Friday.  Having an embassy in IranÂ might have helped the federal government respond to the airline disaster,Â but it's not critical, Martin said. ""We would have been on the ground faster. We would have been able to get in to meet with officials within the (Iranian) Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate consideration for speedy issuance of visas. We would have been able to get information more quickly from both Iranians and our allies,"" said Martin, now an adjunct professor at the School of Policy Studies at Queen's UniversityÂ and a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. ""That said, you can overcome those limitations and I think the government has been very effective in doing so.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/eight-years-after-canada-s-move-to-close-iranian-embassy-still-controversial-1.5429624,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/plane-crash-champagne-oman-meeting-1.5430504 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/flight-ps752-mansour-pourjam-1.5431001,N/A274,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:35:27.902Z,"Mexico begins flying, busing migrants back to Honduras","Hundreds of Central American migrants who entered southern Mexico in recent days have either been pushed back into Guatemala by Mexican troops, shipped to detention centres or returned to Honduras, officials said Tuesday. An unknown number slipped past Mexican authorities and continued north. The latest migrant caravan provided a public platform for Mexico to show the U.S. government and migrants thinking of making the trip that it has refined its strategy and produced its desired result: This caravan will not advance past its southern border. What remained unclear was the treatment of the migrants who already find themselves on their way back to the countries they fled last week. ""Mexico doesn't have the capacity to process so many people in such a simple way in a couple of days,"" said Guadalupe Correa Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University studying how the caravans form. The caravan of thousands had set out from Honduras last week in hopes Mexico would grant them passage, posing a fresh test for U.S. President Donald Trump's effort to reduce the flow of migrants arriving at the U.S. border by pressuring other governments to stop them. Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said 2,400 of the migrants entered Mexico legally over the weekend. About 1,000 of them requested Mexico's help in returning to their countries. The rest were being held in immigration centres while they start legal processes that would allow them to seek refuge in Mexico or obtain temporary work permits that would confine them to southern Mexico. On Tuesday afternoon, Jesus, a young father from Honduras who offered only his first name, rested in a shelter in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, with his wife and their baby, unsure of what to do next. ""No country's policy sustains us,"" he said in response to hearing Ebrard's comments about the situation. ""If we don't work, we don't eat. [He] doesn't feed us, doesn't care for our children."" Honduran officials said more than 600 of its citizens were expected to arrive in that country Tuesday by plane and bus and more would follow in the coming days. Of an additional 1,000 had tried to enter illegally MondayÂ by wading across the SuchiateÂ River,Â most were either forced back or detained later by immigration agents, according to Mexican officials.Â Most of the hundreds stranded in the no man's land on the Mexican side of the river returned to Guatemala overnight in search of water, food and a place to sleep. Alejandro Rendon, head of Mexico's federal social welfare department, said his colleagues were distributing water to those who turned themselves in or who were caught by immigration agents, but were not doing the same along the river because it was not safe for workers to do so. ""It isn't prudent to come here because we can't put the safety of the colleagues at risk,"" he said. MexicanÂ President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ_pez Obrador said Tuesday the government is trying to protect the migrants from harm by preventing them from traveling illegally through the country. He said they need to respect Mexican laws. ""If we don't take care of them, if we don't know who they are, if we don't have a register, they pass and get to the north, and the criminal gangs grab them and assault them, because that's how it was before,"" he said. ""They disappeared them."" Mexican Interior Minister Olga SÃ¡nchez Cordero commended the National Guard for its restraint, saying: ""In no way has there been an act that we could call repression and not even annoyance."" But Honduras's ambassador to Mexico said there had been instances of excessive force on the part of the National Guard. ""We made a complaint before the Mexican government,"" Alden Rivera said in an interview with HCH Noticias without offering details. He also conceded migrants had thrown rocks at Mexican authorities. An Associated Press photograph of a Mexican National Guard soldierÂ holding a migrant in a headlock was sent via Twitter by acting U.S. Homeland Security secretary Ken Cuccinelli with the message: ""We appreciate Mexico doing more than they did last year to interdict caravans attempting to move illegally north to our southern border."" The National Guard had no business being placed at the border to handle immigration because they weren't trained for it, said Correa Cabrera, the George Mason professor. The government ""is sending a group that doesn't know how to and can't protect human rights because they're trained to do other kinds of things."" ""[The Americans] absolutely must be satisfied with [Mexico's]Â actions because in reality it's their plan,"" said Correa Cabrera. ""They're congratulating themselves, because in reality it wasn't Lopez Obrador's plan."" Mexico announced last June that it was deploying the newly formed National Guard to assist in immigration enforcement to avoid tariffs that Trump threatened on Mexican imports. Darlin Rene Romero, 25, and his wife were among the few who spent the night pinned between the river and Mexican authorities. Rumours had circulated through the night that ""anything could happen, that being there was very dangerous,"" Romero said. But the couple from Copan, Honduras, spread a blanket on the ground and passed the night 20 yards from a line of National Guard troops forming a wall with their riot shields. They remained confident that Mexico would allow them to pass through and were trying to make it to the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, where his sister lives. They said a return home to impoverished and gang-plagued Honduras, where most of the migrants are from, was unthinkable.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-mexico-1.5435129,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-crosses-into-mexico-1.5433707 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-us-border-detainees-1.5402767,N/A275,Anonymous,2020-01-21T00:20:22.347Z,"Young francophones trafficked outside Quebec more vulnerable to exploitation, says MNA","Given the frequent language barrier, young francophone Quebecers are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation when trafficked outside the province, the co-chair of a provincial commission examining the sexual exploitation of minors said Monday. Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec MNA Ian LafreniÃ¨re, aÂ former Montreal police commander, said when police in other provinces break up sex-trafficking rings, they often findÂ underage victims from Quebec. ""You take a kid from Montreal:Â she's 14;Â she's not speaking fluently English. You bring her to Calgary. Well, you know what? She's going to be more vulnerable. It's going to be hard for her to get help because of the language barrier,"" LafreniÃ¨re said at a news conference in the lead-up toÂ the Montreal hearings.Â  The commission was launched last November in an attempt to get a handle on what police say is a growing problem in the province. A preliminary report released at the time said four out of ten Quebec victims of sexual exploitation are minors.Â  More than 300 establishments in Montreal and 630 across the province offer sexual services, the report said. But it also noted girls and young women from Quebec are frequently trafficked out of province, whereÂ they are less likely to speak the language of the majority, have a social network or know where to go for help.Â  Last October, police arrested 31 people as part of a sweepingÂ investigationÂ into an Ontario-basedÂ human trafficking and organized crime ring that operated around Canada. The majority of the women came from Quebec, police said at the time.Â  The commission held a first round of hearings in Quebec City in November. It will head to Val-d'Or, in the Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue region,Â later this week.Â  In Montreal, the commission will hear from local police and prevention workers, along with representatives from the hotel industry and the Grand Prix. Liberal MNA Christine St-Pierre, also aÂ co-chair of the commission, said it's important to hear from a variety of perspectives. ""Montreal is very attractive for these events and also the hotels. It is very important to talk to them and to say to them that they have to be involved in this situation, and they have to be aware that they have to be partners,"" she said. The Longueuil police service (SPAL), which launched a team to support victims of sexual exploitation last year, recommended Monday that police keep better tabs on what's going on â€” reaching out to teachers or parents of teenagersÂ even if a crime has yet to be committed. ""Sometimes it's not criminal, but we have something to do anyway, and we should do something,"" said SPAL spokesperson GhyslainÂ Vallieres. ""Also, we want police officers to be more human in the way they're seeing those victims."" He said Longueuil police are working with a Montreal group that's fighting sexual exploitation, theÂ Concertation des luttes contre l'exploitation sexuelle (CLES), to ""open the eyes of the police officers on our territory"" so they can better understand what victimsÂ go through. ThoseÂ victims are sometimes as young as 12, andÂ they often don'tÂ see their abuser as a pimp, butÂ as a lover,"" he said. They often don't want to press charges when the police intervene. SPAL's new team provides social and psychological support, rather than focusing immediatelyÂ on criminality, he said.Â This approach has helped lead to convictions, even if the victim at first didn't want to press charges. ""We have to be creative. We have think outside of the box, and that's what we are doing at the SPAL,""Â VallieresÂ said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-sexual-exploitation-commission-1.5433656,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-police-survivors-expand-indigenous-outreach-1.5392992,N/A276,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:10:15.073Z,Police chief calls woman's arrest at a Halifax Walmart 'unfortunate',"Halifax's police chief says he's referred the ""disappointing"" case of a 23-year-old woman who was arrested while shopping at a Halifax Walmart last week to the province's police watchdog, which is now deciding whether it will launch an investigation. Santina Rao spoke publicly about her experiences to several media outlets last week and said she was approached by police officers while shopping with her two young children inside the Mumford Road store on Jan. 15. She said police believed she was concealing items and that when she became upset they cuffed her without explaining why she was being arrested. A video posted by the Halifax Examiner to YouTube shows part of the altercation, including Rao swearing at a police officer to get off of her before one officer physically brought her to the ground and they struggled. Two officers appeared to restrain Rao while there were staff members in the background. Calling it racial profiling, Rao wrote on Facebook that she had attempted to show her receipts and told police they could search her stroller. She said the encounterÂ broke her wrist, gave her a concussion and left her with bruising around her eyes, arms and back. She also said she scratched one of the officers. Police charged her with causing a disturbance, assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest. They sent out a release the following day stating a woman ""became verbally abusive and was behaving aggressively"" when they tried to arrest her. Rao is not facing any theft-related charges. Rao has no previous criminal record. CBC has contacted for Rao for comment, but hasn't heard back yet. ""Certainly anything like this happens, it's disappointing. We take all of these matters very seriously,"" said police Chief Dan Kinsella while speaking to reporters after a meeting of the board of police commissioners Monday afternoon. Pat Curran, the interim director of SIRT, said they're determining whether the incident fits within the agency's mandate. He said they haven't decided if there will be an investigation. Meanwhile, Kinsella said he's waiting until SIRT makes a decision to take any further action. He said the two officers involved are still working and continuing with their regular duties. He wouldn't comment on whether the officers responded appropriately after Walmart called asking for assistance with an alleged theft investigation. ""Whenever an incident like this occurs, it is unfortunate,"" he said. ""We need to wait, we need to respect the process, we need to make an informed decision based on the appropriate investigation."" A manager at the Mumford Road Walmart declined an interviewÂ and said he couldn't comment since it was a police investigation. He referred questionsÂ to the company's headquarters in Ontario. A statement from Felicia Feder, manager of Walmart Canada's corporate affairs, said all inquires would have to be directed to police. Earlier at the police commission meeting, activist El Jones, who also wrote about Rao's arrest for the Halifax Examiner, addressed the case during a presentation about the force's budget and said it reflects the police force's poor relationship with Halifax's black community. ""As a black woman, I cannot in good conscience stand before you without advocating for this poor black woman, who because she is poor, is racially profiled in a Walmart while we talk about giving [$700,000] more to the police force who beat her,"" she said. Jones said police askingÂ for Rao's ID wasÂ effectively a street check even though it happened in a store. ""When she was questioned about her address, she asked the police why they needed this information. We are being told repeatedly we have the right to refuse a street check and if we are asked to show our information we can refuse, but we see here the consequence is what happened to Santina Rao,"" Jones said. Last October,Â Nova Scotia's justice minister announced he wouldÂ permanently ban street checks after a legal opinion co-authored by a former top judge found the Halifax police practice, which disproportionatelyÂ targeted black males,Â is illegal.

""We were crying,"" Ropati said. ""We realized we finally had positive representation."" Molly of DenaliÂ is the first cartoon series with an Alaska Native character as the lead. It premiered in the U.S. on PBS Kids in July. For many, it is more than a cartoon. ""Watching the show is a way for my Native friends and I to bond,"" said 18-year-old Ropati, who'sÂ Yup'ik. She had just moved to New York City from Anchorage and was feeling homesick when the pilot aired. ""PBS did such a good job. It is like my siblings, Native youth and myself can see ourselves in it."" The series, in its first season, has Indigenous input at all levels of production, Indian Country Today reported. It includes 38 episodes, a podcast series and a collection of paperback books. The series, a co-production with CBC Kids, premiered on CBCÂ in September 2019. People can watch Molly of Denali on Saturdays on CBC TV and CBC Gem, andÂ on-demand via Gem.Â  Dorothea Gillim is the series' executive producer, a position she also held on Curious George.Â After working in the industry for many years, she says this program is special. ""I've never worked on a show where people tear up on a regular basis,"" Gillim said. Gillim says she recently heard about a non-Native family who wanted to make a trip to Alaska after watching the show. They called the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce to learn more about Alaska Native languages to prepare for their trip. Her job as executive producer is multifaceted;Â she raises money for the show while leading a close-knit team. And she was also involved at the earliest moments of the show to choose writers, producers, animators, and voice actors. One of the talents she gathered was Princess Johnson who isÂ Neets'aii Gwich'in. Johnson is the creative producer of Molly of Denali. Part of Johnson's job is to advocate for Indigenous representation at every level of the creative process. This means making sure things are done ""right"" in every episode, interstitial (a short-program shown between episodes that features Alaska Native children), online tools, games and podcast. She also ensures Alaska Natives are included as writers, actors and producers. A job like this didn't always exist. There are serious implications to many non-Native people creating media about Native people, a 2018 IllumiNative report says. ""The story they adopt is overwhelmingly one of deficit and disparity,"" the report states. ""This narrative can undermine relationships with other communities of colour."" Many say Molly of DenaliÂ challenges that. The series was developed with a group of over 60 established Alaska Native or Indigenous participants, who took on adviser, writer, producer, voice talent and musician roles. The participantsÂ are from every region of Alaska where the show takes place. For every character that is Native, their voice actor is Native too. Beyond this, there is also a fellowship program for Alaska Native writers. Atomic Cartoons, the lead animation company of the series, holds internships for Alaska Natives. Vera Starbard, who is Tlingit and Dena'ina, is a writer for Molly. She says she has worked on many artistic projects that involve Alaska Native people. ""I've never experienced this level of dedication to getting it right,"" she said. ""Usually my job comes with emotional labour of having to educate others,"" Starbard said. ""This time ... my job is just to write."" Starbard says something surprising is how much work happens behind the scenes. Here's a little bit of how the process works: Writers think of a potential story they pitch to a producer. If their pitch is accepted, they work through many rounds of edits. Writers must decide who the characters are, where the story takes place and what informational text will go into an episode. They have to write every word that a character speaks, including where they chuckle or show forms of expression. After a script is approved and ""polished,"" it is sent to directors and animators. ""And then I don't see the story again until it airs,"" Starbard said. This entire process takes a while. Starbard's first episode took 18 months before it aired. Because the show is in its first season, animators are tasked with creating entire new towns, characters and worlds. Starbard has written four episodes so far. She says her life experiences inspire her story ideas. When writing ""New Nivagi,"" an 11-minute story that follows MollyÂ while she gathers items to make her grandpa's secret ice cream recipe, she says it reflected an experience she knows. Starbard grew up in Alaska and says she had to be ""pretty creative"" to make recipes because sometimes it is hard to find ingredients. So she wrote an entire episode where MollyÂ does the same. Producers of the show use other liberties to showcase Alaska's diversity. One of Molly'sÂ best friends is Tooey Ookami, a 10-year-old boy who is Koyukon, Yup'ik and Japanese. The other is Trini Mumford, a 7-year-old African American girl. ""We wanted to reflect the true diversity of Alaska and the public media,"" said Johnson. Alaska is home to 229 tribes. Johnson says it is especially heartwarming to hear about people's reaction to the show. Johnson remembers being in Anchorage when a young girl's mother approached her to say they recently went to aÂ MollyÂ screening. After it was over, her daughter was looking through her closet to find her kuspuk (a hooded shirt with large front pockets) because Molly wore her kuspuk in the show. Another time Johnson remembers being at a children's museum when a mother said her son was showing interest in his Inupiaq culture because of the show. ""That is the ultimate goal,"" saidÂ Johnson. ""It is a joy to see that sort of reaction."" And the reactions are from non-Native people too. Johnson heard a story from a friend's son who watched the show and asked what an ancestor was. ""When I go back to the beginning when I first heard of the show I knew the potential impact that the show could have,"" said Johnson. She says it has been worth it because of that. During Halloween, the show released a graphic informing viewers how to dress like Molly.Â They were especially cognizant of not telling people to wear her traditional regalia. Instead they encouraged viewers to wear a brown coat and boots, blue jeans and pink mittens. The graphic received traction on social media. It was liked more than a thousand times on Twitter. If you would like to dress up like Molly for Halloween, here is how you can do so respectfully. We do ask that people refrain from wearing Molly's traditional Native dress (Regalia) as a costume.

A statement from a group, whichÂ did not identify itself, said the demonstration is in support of Wet'suwet'enÂ members opposing the Coastal GasLink pipeline in northern B.C. The terminal reopened as the protest endedÂ aroundÂ 9 a.m., and traffic started flowing again. BC Ferries said all sailings leaving Swartz Bay would be delayed until traffic on Highway 17 has cleared. BC Ferries spokesperson Deborah Marshall said the protest blocked the inbound lanes to the Swartz Bay terminal, but there wasÂ also ""concern"" that kayaks might have beenÂ in the water. Passengers driving to get to the fare booths ahead of the sailings were stuck in gridlocked traffic.Â Sidney RCMPÂ were also on scene. Anne RobergeÂ had a reservation for the 7 a.m. sailing and couldn't get close to the terminal. ""At one point we said, 'Oh boy. That doesn't look good,'"" she said, speaking by phone from her spot inÂ traffic. Coastal GasLink is building aÂ 670-kilometre pipeline from northeast B.C. to Kitimat on the coast. The project runs throughÂ Wet'suwet'enÂ traditional territory. The company has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nation councils along its path, but five hereditaryÂ chiefs say the project has no authority without their consent. Last week, RCMP blocked access to Wet'suwet'en territory, heightening tensions between government officials and hereditary chiefs.Â The MountiesÂ have increased their presence in the area, setting up a checkpoint and restricting access along a service road that leads to three sites where the Wet'suwet'en are maintaining a presence.Â  Kolin Sutherland-Wilson, a spokesperson for the Swartz Bay demonstration,Â said the grassroots protest was comprised of young people, students and Indigenous allies from across the province. ""I hope it makes a statement because what's happening up north is dishearteningÂ ... our way of life isÂ being criminalized by the province,"" said Sutherland-Wilson, a UVicÂ student who is from theÂ Gitxsan First Nation â€” a neighbouring nation and ally to the Wet'suwet'enÂ Nation.

The campaign is called She is Indigenous. Funded by the Province of Ontario, the campaign is led by Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak, the national organization representing MÃ©tis women, and supported by a number of provincial and national Indigenous organizations. ""We really want to re-write that narrative that Indigenous women are vulnerable and at-risk individuals. Instead, we see Indigenous women as profoundly kind, ambitious, and inspirational,"" said Tamsin Fitzgerald, senior policy analyst at Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak. Close to 100 women have been featured since the campaign launched in June 2019 online with the goal of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls. It launched the same month as the release of the final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.Â Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak issued its own report in the fall. With She is Indigenous, Les Femmes Michif OtipemisiwakÂ wanted to work toward the same goalÂ of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls but from a different approach.Â  Fitzgerald said the campaign challenges negative stereotypes, educates Canadians about First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis issues, and supports Indigenous women by honouring their unique strengths and accomplishments. ""The main goal is to support everyday Indigenous women and highlight their contributions,"" she said. One of those women is Celeste Beauchamp. The 20-year-old Kanien'kehÃ¡:ka (Mohawk) from Kahnawake works as a youth reconciliation initiative co-ordinator at Canadian Roots Exchange in Ottawa. She said she likes that the campaign focuses on theÂ inherent strengths of Indigenous women. ""We're empowered in just being women,"" said Beauchamp.Â  ""We get really caught up in our resilience, constantly fighting for our community, constantly fighting for our landÂ and our languages, that we forgot that we're whole in ourselves. We have to take care of ourselves and honour our own power."" Tenille Campbell, the Dene/MÃ©tis poet of #IndianLovePoems and photographer behind Sweetmoon Photography, is another woman profiled in the campaign.Â  ""I really like the idea of visually taking up space,"" she said. Every other day, She is Indigenous posts a profile of an Indigenous woman on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The plan is to continue indefinitely, and encourage others to participate by nominating themselves or an Indigenous woman in their life. ""So often, one of the main narratives about us is our struggle, which is important, but there's also joy, strength, intelligence, and kinship. There's so many other aspects of being an Indigenous woman other than just surviving,"" said Campbell.

That was a video game streamer's first thought on Dec. 16, when he spotted a video on social mediaÂ â€” the disturbingÂ videoÂ that would lead the Canadian to spendÂ the next 24 hours tracking down evidence and providing it to police. It resulted in a Calgary woman being charged for allegedlyÂ assaulting a child. CBC News has agreed not to name the sleuthing streamer, so his employment won't be affected. TheÂ video was originally posted to Twitch, a live-streaming platform for gamers. It shows a woman playing the game Fortnite as she repeatedly slaps and then bites a screaming toddler, seemingly frustrated with the child for distracting her from the game. The video then cutsÂ to a few hours later,Â showing her roughly handling an infant before throwing the child onto the bed that she's sitting on while playing the game. The streamer said he immediately sent the video to a contact at TwitchÂ and then he searched on the user's social media for herÂ locationÂ â€” it turned out to be Calgary â€”Â before calling the localÂ police. But he still felt like he hadn't done enough. SoÂ he decided to scour the site, downloading evidence just in case it vanished.Â  ""I would say probably within 60 minutes of my bringing it to the attention of TwitchÂ staff,Â they had suspended this person's account,"" he said. He wasn't the only one dismayed by what he'd seen. CBC News was contacted by concerned gaming fans, as far away as the United Kingdom, who said they had reported the videoÂ to Crime Stoppers or police.Â  Police said that within two hours of first receiving tips aboutÂ the video,Â officersÂ were able to track theÂ online gamerÂ to a Calgary home, where officers found a woman, manÂ and two children.Â Â  CBCÂ News is not naming the woman or her account username to protect the identity of the children. The woman has been charged with one count of assault, and the children were taken away. Possibly more charges relating to other videos are on the way, police said. Staff Sgt. Peter Siegenthaler, with the Calgary Police Service's child abuse unit, said police rely on tips from the public in cases like this. ""It's hard, because sometimes [online] videos haveÂ been circulated for years, and it's hard to determine the origin and time these videos are produced."" As the sleuthing streamer dug through the videos to download evidence, he discovered a different user who had also posted hours of concerning videos with aÂ child. The videos showed the person loudlyÂ berating the child while using expletives, at one point coughingÂ into the child's eye andÂ threatening to withhold medication if the child didn't stop interrupting her game. CBC News has seen those videos. As with the first user's video, some of the time-stamps were as recent as mid-December. The streamer reported those videos to police as well. That user has since deleted all of the videos from her channel. Police in the U.S. city where that user lives initially said they were not investigatingÂ but have since saidÂ they have reached out to the streamer who saw the videos for more information. The streamer who reported the videos to police said that while the internet can be a nasty placeÂ and vigilantism doesn't always pan out, he's extremely proud of how quickly the Twitch community ralliedÂ to help the children in the videos. ""People, in general, are a lot more inherently good than we tend to give them credit for.â€_Â I wouldn't have been able to live with myself had I simply let this go,"" he said.Â  Nicole Letourneauâ€‹â€‹â€‹, chair of parent-infant mental health at Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation,Â said everyone should take direction from how the online community quickly took action in responseÂ to the videos. ""I think members of the public are ethically obligated to protect children of parents who don't protect children.â€_ It just needs to be reported,"" she said.Â  She said this situation holds lessons for parents, too. LetourneauÂ studies how toxic stress can undermine the relationships between parents and children, and how different factors like mental illness or addiction can undermine a parent's ability to be attentive, responsive or nurturing to their child. ""A parent who is mentally well or doesn't have an addiction gets rewards from their children,"" Letourneau said.Â  But in a situation where a parent isn't well, she said, that reward system isn't functioning properly, and the child becomes an interference â€” blocking the parent from enjoying gambling, substances, video games or browsing social media on theirÂ cellphone.Â  ""The early years for children are fleeting â€_ everything seems to be tied in to positive early nurturing environments,"" Letourneau said. ""If you're someone who's finding that your kids are annoying youÂ and you're playing a game, it might be a red flag that things aren't quite as they should be.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-child-abuse-investigation-1.5410011,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-fortnite-video-1.5400324 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/twitch-fortnite-video-charges-1.5400971,N/A281,Anonymous,2020-01-17T23:00:00.271Z,'Stop this investigation': Jean Charest's lawyer says former premier steered clear of corruption,"Jean Charest's lawyer says the former Liberal premier isÂ innocent of any wrongdoing when it comes to political financing â€”Â and it is high time for Quebec's anti-corruption squad to end aÂ six-year investigation that has not led to charges against Charest's friend, Marc Bibeau, or anyone else. Michel Massicotte told Radio-Canada that aside from the fact his client is a friend of Bibeau's â€” something Charest has never disavowed â€” nothing in newly released documents pertaining to that UPAC investigation call into question Charest's integrity. Massicotte's comments come a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a request for a publication ban filed by lawyers forÂ Bibeau, a one-time top fundraiser for the Quebec Liberal Party. As a result ofÂ the Supreme Court's decision,Â a trove of information from the investigation, known asÂ Operation MÃ¢churer, is now public. The documents include general warrants and witness statements, and they detailÂ why, in 2016,Â UPAC wanted to conduct secret searches of the offices of companies owned by Bibeau. The revelations come just as Charest is mulling over making a bid to lead the Conservative Party of Canada, and the former premier wants to clear the air. ""We discussed it, and given what's been out there in the public sphere â€” not just yesterday, but for a very long time â€” it looked to us to be necessary to address this issue,"" Massicotte told Radio-Canada's Isabelle Richer in an interview Friday. Even though Charest was head of the Liberal party, he had nothing to doÂ withÂ Bibeau'sÂ fundraising practices, Massicotte said.Â  Massicotte said if some companies contributed illegally to election funds, Charest was not aware of it. ""To support a practice, you have to be aware that practice exists,"" said Massicotte. He said CharestÂ knew BibeauÂ was involved in the PLQ's so-called ""sectoral funding"" Â â€” a term used to describe soliciting companies to ask staff to make political contributions. Massicotte conceded that it's been demonstrated companies did, in fact, contribute illegally to the Liberal Party's electoral coffers â€” but he maintained that had nothing to do with howÂ sectoral funding actually worked. ""It wasn't up to the firmÂ to give money, it wasÂ upÂ to each person individually,"" he explained. ""There was no twisting of arms, either."" In any event, even if businesses did make illegal political contributions to the PLQ, ""Mr. Charest knew nothing about it,"" he said. Operation MÃ¢churer's goal was to establish a link between illegal political financing and the awarding of public contracts by Charest's Liberal government. ""We have always said,Â to whoever wanted to hear it, that we are innocent as far as any of this goes,"" Massicotte said. He pointed out that Charest has already explained all this, in great detail, in a 300-page declaration to lawyers for theÂ Charbonneau commission, who interviewed him in 2014. The former premier also spoke to UPAC investigators on two separate occasions, before OperationÂ MÃ¢churer was even launched, more than five years ago. OperationÂ MÃ¢churerÂ has found nothing new, he said. ""Stop this investigation,"" he said. ""Stop saying we are hiding something, or whatever. We have offered our full co-operation, but this co-operation does not seem to have been reciprocated."" Massicotte said he believes investigatorsÂ leaked the now-public documentsÂ out of frustration, in an effort to createÂ a ""trial by media"" scenario because there is no evidence of any crime.Â  However, opposition parties are not ready to let Charest off the hook. ""If OperationÂ MÃ¢churerÂ is not over, it's because Mr. Charest's friend dragged the proceedings all the way to the Supreme Court,"" said Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, the co-spokesperson for QuÃ©bec Solidaire, in a news release, accusing the former provincial Liberal leader of showing contempt for the public. ""Now that Mr. Charest wants to run for the Conservative Party leadership, he's complaining about how long it's taking and he wants it to stop?"" ""The Charbonneau commission exposed the illegal financing schemes of the Liberals during the Charest era. He is the prime suspect in this case, "" said Nadeau-Dubois. ""Just because Jean Charest's lawyer asks that an investigation be stopped does not mean we should listen to him,"" said the acting head of the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois, Pascal BÃ©rubÃ©. He said there are still many unanswered questions. ""Several individuals and companies claimed that they had been asked for large amounts of money,"" BÃ©rubÃ© said.

This week: In cold Canadian winters, many of us burn voluminous amounts of fossil fuels to keep warm. A majority of heating systems in this country are either forced-air furnaces or boilers with hot water or steam radiators â€” most of which burn natural gas â€” and nearly 70 per cent of residential energy use comes from fossil fuels. Experts say decarbonizing heating through electrification is key to reducing our country's carbon emissions. But for many of us, giving up our furnaces and boilers is a huge step that we may not be quite ready to take. Fortunately, there are a number of smaller measures that can cut carbon emissions from our homes. David Turnbull, a former home builder and current manager at Enerspec Energy Consulting and Home Inspections in Edmonton, suggests addressing heating the way we approach waste: first, reduce the demand; then reuse whatever you can; and then tackle full decarbonization. Reduce Turnbull, who is also a board member of Built Green Canada, which focuses on improving sustainability in the residential building sector, recommends first stopping heat from leaving your home by improving the building envelope.Â  ""That's where you get pretty much the biggest bang for your buck up to a point,"" he said. This can be done by: Sealing gaps and air leaks with things like caulking and weather stripping. Improving insulation in the walls, basement and attic. Installing airtight, well-insulated windows. Turnbull said the best options for decarbonizing your heating system, such as heat pumps, either won't meet the home's needs or won't be cost-effective unless you've already reduced heat loss. A few other options to reduce demand include: Setting your thermostat lower, especially when you're away from home or sleeping. (Turnbull said the latter can save three to six per cent of your energy use.) Depending on your system, you may be able to do ""zoning,"" where you heat parts of the house you're in more than parts of the house that are unoccupied (such as the basement). Choosing a smaller home. Low-flow fixtures such as shower heads or tankless water heaters reduce the need to heat water. Reuse There are a couple of devices that can help you reuse ""waste"" heat: Heat recovery ventilators. Once your house is air sealed and insulated, you'll need some ventilation. Heat recovery ventilators provide this while transferring heat from the stale air leaving the house to the fresh air coming in. Drain water recovery units. Turnbull said that when you typically take a hot shower, ""you use that heat for truthfully a second â€” maybe less â€” and then all that heat goes down the drain."" This device recovers that heat and puts it back into your home. Decarbonize All done with those? The next step is looking to replace fossil fuels with efficient electric heating options such as heat pumps. (We'll have more on this next week.) â€” Emily Chung In last week's issue, we reported on the surprising rise in popularity of e-bikes, and how that might influence transportation in a low-carbon economy. A number of readers offered thoughtful reflections on this. That included Joseph Gore, who offered this wide-ranging analysis: ""The idea of an electric bike looks fine until you realize that in Canada for about five months of the year bikes are simply impractical. Here we need an electrical vehicle with four tires on the ground that can go through snow and not go out of control on ice. ""Canada is not the Netherlands, despite what city mayors who are frantically building bike lanes want us to believe,"" Gore said. ""The big problem with North American cities and culture is that they are built for travel by cars â€_ and many of us live in suburbs where everyone has and needs a car. ""For decades, we have been talking about high-speed trains between Montreal and Toronto. Now that we need trains, we don't have them. Japan, China, France and even Morocco have high-speed trains, and the trains in Switzerland are amazingly reliable in summer and winter.Â Â  ""If we are serious about transitioning to a low-GHG-emission country we need an alternative to cars and planes for medium- and long-distance travel, for people and goods."" Great Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, which was largely powered by coal. This fossil fuel not only contributed to the Great Smog of 1952, which is estimated to have killed 12,000 Londoners, but it has spewed untold amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In the last few decades, however, the country has diversified its energy mix, adding significant amounts of renewable sources (wind, hydro and solar), natural gas, biomass and nuclear, as well as importing power from other countries (which could have been generated any number of ways). The overall result has been a significant reduction in carbon pollution, to the point where Britain's per capita emissions are now below 1860 (yes, 1860) levels. BlackRock, considered the world's most powerful investor (with about $7 trillion US under management), announced it is making sustainability a ""core goal"" of its investing strategy. In his annual letter to chief executives, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized that ""climate risk is investment risk."" The New York Times said BlackRock's move could ""reshape how corporate America does business and put pressure on other large money managers to follow suit."" Â  Lithium, a vital component in electric vehicle batteries, is a growing market, expected to near $100 billion US, by some estimates, in the next decade. Mining the metal can come at a high environmental cost, so some Alberta companies are developing greener extraction methods by partnering with an unlikely ally â€” the oil and gas industry. ""Working with the oil and gas industry, we can take advantage of the infrastructure already existing in Alberta,"" said Amanda Hall, president of Summit Nanotech. The infrastructure isn't the only advantage. The Leduc Formation, the source of Alberta's first big oil boom, is also a rich lithium deposit. According to the Canadian Lithium Association, there are about 3.6 million tonnes of lithium in the province.Â  Hall's company uses nanotechnology, which works with materials at the molecular or atomic level, to selectively filter lithium out of the wasted saltwater brine used in oil wells. ""Lithium demand is going up in the near future because of electric vehicles â€_ so the demand for our technology is also growing,"" Hall said. Her company hopes to test the tech on oilfield sites by the end of this year, and once they're up and running, will set up modular units near well heads to filter out the metal and provide it to whoever owns the land's mineral rights â€” for a fee. Daniel Alessi, an associate professor at the University of Alberta, said other companies, like E3 Metals, are also working to develop different extraction methods.Â  Alessi said while any resource extraction technology will have some negative footprint, there are options to utilize wasted natural gas or even geothermal energy to power the extraction.Â  ""The big question these days is whether it's going to be economically feasible,"" Alessi said. But with companies like Tesla increasing their output of electric vehicles, demand is a sure thing.Â  ""Unless somebody comes with a magic new battery technology, the outlook for this region, the lithium extraction, the lithium industry, is pretty promising."" â€” Sarah Rieger Are there issues you'd like us to cover?

Energy prices in December were up 5.5 per cent compared with a year ago, while gasoline prices were up 7.4 per cent compared with December 2018 when crude oil prices fell amid a global oversupply. Excluding gasoline, the consumer price index was up 2.0 per cent, the smallest increase since November 2018. The year-over-year growth in fresh vegetable prices slowed to 1.5 per cent in December compared with an increase of 7.1 per cent in November.

Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and predatory sexual assault against two women. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Fitzgerald said the defence may employ aÂ tactic commonly used in sexÂ assault cases: turning the focus from the accused to the accuser and playing onÂ misconceptions about victims. One line of defence in such cases is to suggest the rape didn't really happen or that it wasn't really rape. ""They are going to try and capitalize on myths,"" Fitzgerald said. One of the accusers in the trial, who hasn't been identified, alleged Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in 2013. On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers announced they want to use friendly emailsÂ the accuser sent to the former producer after the alleged assaultÂ in a bid to convince jurors that any contact was consensual. ""There's direct communications between Harvey and women, always friendly, sometimes romantic, that would lead, I think, any reasonable person to think that the claims are untrue,"" Weinstein's lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno,Â told ABC News. Fitzgerald, who has written about rape myths and workplace sexual harassment, said there are decades of studies detailing how women behave in certain situations after being sexually assaulted, and the reasons behind that. ""Lots of people remain in contact with their abuser for a whole variety of reasons,"" she said. ""In some cases, because he has a lot of power and he can hurt you."" Trauma psychologist Joan Cook said it's disheartening to already see indications fromÂ Weinstein's team that it will beÂ relying on an outdated understanding of how victims of sexual assault behave.Â  ""There's a lot of ways that men and women who have been sexually violated respond, and it's not the way we think,"" Cook said. ""Most don't go to the police;Â most don't confront their abuser; and many don't disconnect for various reasons.""Â  Watch: Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, talks about the defence's strategy Many survivors are in shock or numb after the assault, so they stay silent, Cook said, because what happened to them may not register right away or because they're afraid of the personal and professional consequences of cutting off contact. ""It's not surprising to me at all that people would have kept in touch with [Weinstein],"" said Cook.Â ""He owned Hollywood, so if you wanted to function there, weren't you going to still try and maintain a connection?"" That was among the reasons Dominique HuettÂ said she stayedÂ in touch with Weinstein, even after she alleged he sexually assaulted her in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2010. She was the first Weinstein accuser to file a civil claim against him. ""I emailed him after the assault happened, but that doesn't mean the assault didn't happen,"" Huett told CBCÂ News. ""It just means I was trying to regain some sense of control back over what he did."" Huett's allegation falls within the statute of limitations, and she hopes charges canÂ still be filed in California for her case. ""I think the old rhetoric of blaming the victim is very outdated at this stage,"" said Huett. ""I think the #MeToo movement kind of exposed how women are not, you know, liars."" Huett is a member of the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers who have come together to amplify the experiences of sexual assault survivors. In addition to questioning the motivation and actions of the accusers, Weinstein's defence is expected to call two experts to testify about memory. The judge, however, limited the scope of their testimony and deniedÂ a defence request to have them testify about a phenomenon called ""unwanted voluntary sex."" Cook said the understanding among researchers used to be that memory was fixed and unchanging, but today, it's recognized that the fact that an assault victim's recollectionsÂ may change over time isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. ""The truth is, memory is much more fluid, and memories can change, and they can be altered over time,"" Cook said. The prosecution will be calling Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist atÂ Temple University in Philadelphia who is an expert on rape and sexual assault trauma. The Manhattan district attorney's office is hoping ZivÂ can counter someÂ of the myths around sexual assault, including why victims often wait to disclose their assault. Ziv gave suchÂ testimony in the second trial of Bill Cosby, who was convictedÂ on three counts of aggravated indecent assault forÂ drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, aÂ Canadian woman who met Cosby while working at his alma mater, Temple University, in the early 2000s. The prosecution also hopes the four additional women who will be allowed to testify even though theirÂ allegations against Weinstein haven't resulted in charges will help establish a patternÂ of behaviour similar to how the testimony of other women did in the Cosby retrial. The question of how deeply the message of the #MeToo movement has permeated society was anÂ undercurrent during the contentious two weeks of jury selection. Judge James M. Burke cautioned jurors that the case was not a referendum on the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment or women's rights. In narrowing down the jury pool, the prosecution accused the defence of ""systematically eliminating"" younger white women, who are more likely to be aware of #MeToo and possibly sympathize with Weinstein's accusers. In the end, seven men and five women were chosen. Six of the men and two of the women are white.Â  How educated the jury is in rape myths will be crucial in determining the outcome, Fitzgerald said. ""That's always what's critical in rape cases â€” the jury has to be willing and able to see through these things,"" Fitzgerald said. The flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, whichÂ followedÂ a New York Times exposÃ© in October 2017 that sparked the #MeToo movement, ignited an internationalÂ conversation about women's experiences. But Fitzgerald says she doesn't think public awareness has progressed as far as people want to believe it has. Fitzgerald worked as a psychological consultant for Anita Hill and her legal team in 1991, when Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. FitzgeraldÂ called that moment the first great awakening for American society in the debate over sexual misconduct. She said after that, however, society forgot the lessons learned about women's experiences, and the issue fell out of the national conversation. But with high-profile stars now speaking out, she hopes there will be a more permanent reckoning with the issue on national scale. ""I think it's going to be more powerful this time, and it's going to be more widespread and more lasting.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,N/A285,Anonymous,2020-01-22T16:17:57.677Z,"The struggle is real for parents as city, schools shut down after blizzard","Deanne Burton Snow knew her daughters were getting desperate when they traded the iPad for books.Â  ""You can only watch iPads for so longÂ  â€”Â because I fight with them to read books â€” and today I found them reading books.

AndreÂ Larocque, 8, and his youngerÂ brother, Joshua, 6, have cystic fibrosis. Â  The relatively rare disease leads to the destruction of the lungs and an early deathÂ for most people who haveÂ it. There is no cure. Once lung function is lost, there is no way to get it back. ""When I put them to bed at night, I hear Andre go to sleep peacefully and then I hear Josh laying awake in his bed coughing himself to sleep,"" motherÂ Sasha Haughian said during an interview from the family's home in the small Ontario town of New Tecumseth. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling of listening to that and knowing it's just gonnaÂ get worse."" Andre is onÂ a medication called Symdeko through a drug trial, but Joshua wasn't selected for theÂ trial and has no accessÂ to two similar Health Canada-approved medications. That's becauseÂ the Ontario government doesn't fund the drugs for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients and his parents can't afford to pay out of pocket. ""It's a progressive, fatal disease ... we haveÂ medication right now that more than half the population [with cystic fibrosis] could benefit from, and we're not getting access to it,"" Haughian said. About 4,200 CanadiansÂ have cystic fibrosis. There are three gene-modifying drugs available â€” Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi â€” that are believed to slow downÂ lung damage caused by the disease.Â Other treatments only easeÂ symptoms. Access to all three medications is severely limited.Â  Unlike many other countries, Canada does not have a special process for evaluating drugs for rare diseases. Clinical trials for such drugs are limited by their small pool of potential participants. This makes proving a drug's effectiveness more difficultÂ â€” which makes convincing provincial governments and private insurers to cover the cost for patients more unlikely, health advocates say. ""It's a heartbreaking situation ... These are symptoms of a larger issue, which is essentially our system was not built to evaluate and fairly assess drugs for rare diseases,"" saidÂ Kim Steele,Â director of government and community relationsÂ forÂ Cystic Fibrosis Canada.Â  Haughian and her husband, Jamie Larocque, say Symdeko has been a life-changer for Andre since he startedÂ taking it in January 2018. While he can run around and play hockey with his friends, his younger brother's condition is deteriorating.Â  ""When we first found out Andre was accepted for the trial, we were so excited,"" Larocque said. ""And then after a couple days, I realized, 'Oh wait, Josh has nothing.' Now that it's been over a year, we're really starting to see Andre just shoot ahead and Josh falling behind, and that's tough."" The family and their doctor believe Orkambi would change that. But the familyÂ can't afford the annual cost of $250,000. Their private health-care plan won't pay for it either. They are desperate for Ontario to cover the medication for their younger son. They sayÂ the criteria forÂ who qualifies for coverage are too strict.Â  The medication is only funded for children between the ages of sixÂ and 17 who are really sick for a long time â€” it's called the ""exceptional cases"" criteria. To qualify, a patient must show that they lostÂ 20 per cent of their lung function for a six-week period over the course of six months. That's the standardÂ in three provinces â€” Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario.Â The other provinces and territories don't cover the drug at all and no province funds the drug for adults. Under the rules, less than two per centÂ of children with cystic fibrosis qualify for Orkambi coverage in Ontario, according toÂ Cystic FibrosisÂ Canada. And Joshua isn't one of them.Â  The Ontario Health MinistryÂ says itÂ has not received any requests for coverage since the introduction of the exceptional casesÂ criteriaÂ onÂ Feb.Â 20. The board that recommends whether medications should beÂ publicly funded is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). It's made up of representatives fromÂ the health-care system, academiaÂ and the public. It decided there wasn't enough evidence of therapeutic value to recommend governments cover Orkambi, but provinces aren't bound by CADTH's decisions.Â  Steele says a lot of good medications are rejected for coverage because the testing criteria areÂ designed for drugs that treat more common diseases and can be evaluated inÂ large clinical trials. ""We can't do that in small populations. And so, often when our evidence goes to the table for government to look at, they say there's not enough evidence. And our problem is there's not enough people to give you the evidence that you want."" Then there is the cost.Â  ""It's expensive,"" Steele said. ""I'm not going to shy away from saying price is definitely a concern. However, it's very hard to put a price on life."" The three cystic fibrosis drugs are priced at about $250,000 a year in Canada. But Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society,Â which advocates that patients with the disease should have access to any medicationÂ their doctor prescribes,Â says that doesn't reflect what the real cost would be if Canada did a better job negotiating with drug companies. He points toÂ otherÂ countries where the drugs are available for less than half that price.Â  The problem, he says, is Canada does not negotiate prices with drug companies until the end of the CADTH review, so many drugs end up being rejected for coverage because of cost. In some cases, provinces won't negotiate at all, or they go it alone instead of negotiating on a national scale and buying in bulk to lower the cost. ""Canada is an outlier. We're the only developed country that either doesn't have a deal, or isn't negotiating a deal,"" MacLeod said ofÂ Orkambi. ""Quite frankly, I think it's bureaucrats that have become so baked in the system that they've lost perspective."" Meanwhile, Canadians like Joshua LarocqueÂ go without the medications they need, he said. ""It's shameful. Absolutely shameful."" MacLeod is also a lawyer and is heading up a class action lawsuit against the B.C. government, federal government,Â CADTH and others over the lack of funding for Orkambi. The suit claims governments areÂ ""denying access to lifesaving drugs in a very non-transparent, non-evidence-based manner."" None of the allegations has been proven in court. In an email to Go Public, B.C.'s Ministry of Health saidÂ CADTH recommended Orkambi not be funded due to a lack of evidence on two separate occasions.Â  ""These recommendations are based on clinical and cost factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""And with Vertex setting the cost of Orkambi at $250,000 a year per patient, its cost is unsustainable for public and private drug plans."" In an emailÂ to Go Public, a CADTH spokesperson said that over the past five years, the agency has taken steps to clarify and enhance processes to address the unique challenges of evaluating drugs for rare diseases.Â  Andre and Joshua's parents have repeatedly reached out to OntarioÂ Health MinisterÂ Christine Elliott.Â  In October, the family asked for a meeting with Elliott. They said theyÂ were told by her office it would happen. They're still waiting to hear when, and their followup messages have gone unanswered.Â  As opposition health critic, ElliottÂ criticized the government at the time for not funding Kalydeco, one of the three gene-modifying cystic fibrosis medications.Â The drug was later added to the coverage list inÂ Ontario, but few patients qualify. It's aÂ similar story with Orkambi. In February, Ontario agreed to fund the drug on a case-by-case basis under what's called the Exceptional Access Program.Â So far, not one cystic fibrosis patient hasÂ qualifiedÂ for provincial coverage under theÂ program's criteria, said MacLeod.Â Â  Watch: Elliott challenged the LiberalÂ government to cover KalydecoÂ several years agoÂ when she was Opposition health critic. The minister turned down a request for an interview with Go PublicÂ and didn't respond to specific questions we sent about Joshua and Andre's situationÂ and about access to the cystic fibrosis medications,Â providing insteadÂ a general statement from a spokesperson.Â  ""Young Ontarians with rare diseases deserve every opportunity to enjoy healthy and happy childhoods,""Â spokesperson Hayley Chazan wrote in an email to Go Public.Â  ""Orkambi, which helps treat pediatric cystic fibrosis, is currently considered for funding in Ontario in exceptional cases â€_ consistent with clinical evidence."" Joshua and Andre's parents are stillÂ hopeful the federal government will deliver on a 2019 federal budget promise to implement a rare disease strategy that could help people like Joshua. The family believes Andre will continue to get access to Symdeko indefinitely. The trial is to test the medication on younger children and track it as they grow. It's already approved by Health Canada for children ages 12 and older. Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes both OrkambiÂ and Symdeko. It tells Go Public it has no plans to ask CADTH to reviewÂ Symdeko for provincial funding, saying the present system for assessing drug coverage in Canada ""has challenges.""Â  When asked why the cost of Orkambi is so high, Vertex didn't answer, but Cystic Fibrosis Canada says developing medications for rare disease is expensive because the market forÂ them is so small. ""That leaves Symdeko and the other drugs coming down the pipeline completely inaccessible,""Â Haughian said.Â ""Without a proper rare disease strategy for evaluating drugs in place, there is not much incentive for drug companies to even try to develop drugs for rare diseases."" She and her husband worry their younger son will never get the medication he needs. ""I fear Joshua will spend his childhood getting sicker, living in and out of the hospital, needing more and more treatments, and ultimately dying young,"" Haughian told Go Public in an email after the interview, because she didn't want her sons to hear about her fears. ""While Andre is out playing hockey and hanging with friends â€_ and as he gets older and understands more and more, the 'survivor's guilt' he could potentially feel is a dangerous thing.""Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Protesters later chased down President Emmanuel Macron at an evening theatre performance in northern Paris. Video showed protesters chanting and some entering a door as surprised police tried to hold them back. A black car reportedly carrying Macron then sped away under a hail of boos. An edgy tension marked the day as small but determined groups of protesters moved into action to make their complaints against pension changes heard. It was the 44th day of strikes aimed at overturning the plan. The protesters at the Louvre, who included some museum employees, staged the demonstration against Macron's proposals after several hard-left trade unions appealed for public actions to oppose a planÂ that they said would ""lower everyone's pensions."" The museum's Leonardo da Vinci exhibit marking the 500th anniversary of the Italian master's death was included in the closure. Some protesters chanted, ""Mona Lisa isÂ on strike, Leonardo is on strike."" It is the first time since railway strikes and protests against the pension overhaul began on Dec. 5 that the Louvre and its da Vinci exhibit were fully shut down. About 30,000 people visit the museum every day. Some videos on social media showed angry visitors booing at museum protesters to express their disappointment. Some of those shut out of the Louvre were upset, while a few interviewed expressed solidarity with the strikers. ""I think it's fine if they want to protest but they shouldn't block the plans of the people who have flown over here to see an exhibition of Leonardo,"" said Ben Garrett of Dallas. Gerhard Jehle of Germany, who had bought his ticket in advance, shared that view, and said he was ""badly informed about the extent of the strike."" ""I don't understand how this happens,"" Jehle said. ""Public transport doesn't function. The unions have to be controlled with an iron hand."" Argentinian Marcelo Campano, who also had a ticket, said that he understands workers' bid to confront a government they perceive as ""neo-liberal ... So we'll show our solidarity and come back another day."" The action at the Louvre was one of several signs of mounting tensions among strikers. Several dozen people on Friday invaded the headquarters of the CFDT union, which is favourable to a point system Macron wants to put in place to determine retirement benefits. The invaders were seen on video singing and mocking the union's leader. Macron condemned the action as violent, unacceptable and ""shameful for our democracy."" In a more playful bid for attention, dozens of lawyers opposing the president's proposed pension reforms put on a dance show in Versailles wearing their black robes. Unions have called for a seventh round of street marches next Friday, when the contested pension plan is to be presented to the cabinet. The weeks of strikes and protests have hobbled public transportation and disrupted schools, hospitals, courthouses and even opera houses and the Eiffel Tower. Major French retailers Fnac Darty and Casino said that business in France has been badly affected by the strikes, especially during the holiday season. Fnac Darty said the strikes cost it around 70 million euros ($101Â million Cdn) in lost revenue. Casino cut its forecast for earnings growth in France, where it does more than half its business, to fiveÂ per centÂ in 2019, from a previous 10 per cent. The company estimates that the strikes in December cost it about 80 million eurosÂ ($116 million Cdn) in lost revenue. Shares in both companies were down by more than five per cent. The prime minister's office said earlier this week that the SNCF train authority and the RATP, which runs public transport, had lost over a billion euros since the start of the strike. Trains have suffered most, so far losing some 850 million eurosÂ ($1.2 billion Cdn). While the number of striking workers has diminished since the movement, the country's trains and the Paris subway were still disrupted Friday.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/pension-protests-shut-down-louvre-1.5432132,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/40-days-of-strikes-show-french-fondness-for-revolution-over-reform-1.5430839 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-strike-1.5399580,N/A288,Meera Bains,2020-01-22T04:19:25.186Z,Vancouver police adopt new 'street checks' policy ,"The Vancouver Police Department hasÂ approved a new formalÂ policy forÂ police street checks and stops to comply with new provincial standards that went into effect on Jan.Â 15. During a street check or police stop, a person is asked for their identification and their personal information is recorded. Police consider it an important, proactive tool, but theÂ practice has alsoÂ  been under scrutiny across Canada and the United States due to allegations of racial bias. A report outlining the new policy is on the agenda at aÂ Vancouver Police Board at a public meeting on Thursday.Â  A formal complaint led the Vancouver Police Department to improve its procedures by adding more training, furthering community relationships, adding an Indigenous Liaison Protocol Officer, and release street check data annually. In 2018, the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs and the B.C. Civil Liberties Association asked the province's police complaints commissioner to investigate a racial disparity in the VPD's use of street checks. The groups said Indigenous and black people wereÂ over-represented in the police practice and pointed to data released under a Freedom of Information request. That data showed 15 per cent of all police checks between 2008 and 2017 were on Indigenous people, who make up just two per cent of the Vancouver population. Likewise,Â four per cent of people carded were black even though thatÂ population in Vancouver makes up less than one per cent. VPD Chief Constable Adam Palmer defended the force's record at the time and said checks are often the result of a member of the public calling to report suspicious activity, or a police officer coming across something suspicious during a patrol. The formalized policy which was approved on Jan. 7 addresses areas of concern including bias and a person's rights during a street check. Officers cannot make random stops, or stop someone on the sole basis of an identity factor, and officers need a ""justifiable reason"" to demand or request identifying information.Â  Also an officer must take steps to ensure a person is aware of their rights during a street check and have a specific public safety purpose to ask for identifying information and tell the person of that reason. Even so, Vancouver policeÂ said in a statement that ""street checks are a valuable proactive tool for police"" and play an important role in crime prevention and ensuring public safety. For example, in its policy report, an incident is described during whichÂ police officers asked a man if he lived at a nearby home after they observed him looking into vehicles at 5 a.m. in theÂ Kitsilano neighbourhood.Â  ItÂ turnedÂ out there was a warrant for his arrestÂ and he had an extensive criminal record. According to VPD, a front-line officer uses an average of one street check per month.

These types of temperature milestones are the norm now; every month it seems another record is set, and every year we reach another global warming milestone.Â  In fact, the hottest years on record have all occurred since 2005, according to the report.Â  But scientists say rising heat is about more than just numbers;Â behind those statistics are consequences for people, their livelihoods and our delicate ecosystems. Climate change is costing cities as they try to adapt and mitigate.Â Farmers are facing increasing challenges, which can leadÂ to consumers paying more for food.Â Extreme weather disasters are on the rise in Canada and costing insurance companies, leadingÂ to higher premiums.Â People are dying in heat waves which are set to become more frequent as the planet warms; and hurricanes are stalling, meaning more people are in danger for longer periods of time.Â  ""In my line of work, we do track the numbers and we do try to quantify the behaviour of the climate system, but ultimately what really matters is where it intersects and impacts with the people we love and the things we do,"" said Deke Arndt, chief of the global monitoring branch of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). In our normal, day-to-day lives, the effects of a warming planet may not be so evident to most Canadians. But to some, it's all too real. The most dramatic changes areÂ found in the north. The region is warming almost three times faster than the planet as a whole, resulting in record-low sea ice levelsÂ in the Arctic and melting permafrost. These occurrences haveÂ consequences. They're taking aÂ toll on ecosystems â€” and on the people who have called the cold, icy area home for centuries. Inuit are losing their homes. They are losing their way of life. They are falling through the rapidly thinning ice while hunting. The warming is also affecting the mental health of peopleÂ who had cherished longer winters and persistent cold. To people who have long relied on the consistency of the cold north, the change is all too real. Farmers are alsoÂ particularly vulnerable to climate change. ""Some people who work in weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture â€_ are seeing [climate change] on an annual basis, and they're seeing [it] through greater extremes, and they're also seeing it in the greater variability, the wild swings,"" said Dave Phillips, senior climatologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.Â  Phillips' annual list of Canada's top ten weather stories cited the terrible farming season in the Prairies in 2019. The weather went from dry before the planting season even began for many, to too wet from June to August, followed by an early snowfall at the start of harvest timeÂ in September. This meant a lot of crops remained unharvested. John Guelly, chair of the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said the 2019 growing season was ""the harvest from hell.""Â  Guelly, who has been a farmer for the past 30 years just northwest of Edmonton, plants canola, wheat and barley, with 1,000 acres of crops.Â  ""In our particular region, where I farm, it's actually been the fourth really lousy harvest season we've had in a row,"" he said. ""It's definitely taking its toll on people."" But not all the challenges have been the same. In 2018, smoke from the B.C. fires reduced sunlight, for example. And with climate change forecast to create drier conditions in some regions, this may be a sign of things toÂ come. ""If you'd asked a farmer before Christmas what they wanted for Christmas, it was 'Can the growing season be normal next year?'"" Guelly said. "" What's normal anymore? We're not sure."" The fires raging in Australia areÂ just a recent example of the challenges a continuously warming Earth will present. To date, 28Â people have died, including two firemen, and millions of animals are thought to have perished.Â  Then there are hurricanes. In 2019, Hurricane Dorian sat almost immovable above Abaco Island in the Bahamas for more almost 24 hours, killing at least 70 people. Heat waves killed an estimated 1,500 people in France in 2019. The good news is this is far below the 2003 heat wave that killed an estimated 30,000 across Europe, with 14,000 in France alone. And here at home, a heat wave killed 66 people in Montreal in 2018. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), an international humanitarian medicalÂ organization, believes places like South Asia and the Pacific region, the Middle East, the Sahelian Belt, and Southern Africa are particularly at risk. Carol Devine, a humanitarian advisor at MSF focusingÂ on human health and climate change, said she's concerned about what the future holds.Â  ""Vulnerable people tend to become more vulnerable, and climate change exacerbates health issues,"" she said.Â  ""Climate-sensitive diseases â€” that concerns us,"" said added. ""All these pieces interconnect somehow: climate-sensitive diseases, water and food insecurity, malnutrition related to drought or micronutrients or salinity coming into crops."" She's seen certain diseases move into areas that hadn't faced them before, leaving some local doctors unable to adequately treatÂ patients. ""There are already so many vulnerabilities, so what's to come?"" she said. While not all weather events are a result of climate change, climate change can exacerbate them.Â It upsets a delicately balanced Earth system. And scientists are getting better at teasing out weather from the changing climate, improving attribution.Â  But, without curbing greenhouse gas emissions, the future containsÂ a lot of upheaval and big impacts on people's lives.

Canada, Ukraine and other nations who had citizens on the flight in which all 176 people aboard were killed when it was accidentally shot down on Jan. 8, have asked Iran to send the flight data and voice recorders to experts abroad for analysis. Tehran has given mixed signals about whether they would be handed over. Canada, which had 57 citizens on the flight, has said France would be the best place to send the black boxes because it was one of the few nations with the ability to read them. Iran's reluctance to hand over the black boxes may frustrate nations with citizens on the flight, many of whom were Iranians with dual nationality. Tehran already faces demands for compensation and a full investigation into the shooting down. Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said in its second report on the disaster that it did not have the equipment needed to download data from the model of recorders installed on the U.S.-built Boeing 737. The plane was brought down by Iranian air defences when the nation was on alert after tit-for-tat military strikes between the United States and Iran. The aviation body said Iran had asked for equipment from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France's accident agency BEA, but said Tehran had not received a positive response.

At a council meeting on Monday night, the elected members voted unanimously to limit the number of rooms landlords can rent to four, but there are some exceptions. ""Over the last few years,Â we've been getting quite a few complaints from our residents,"" said Mayor Laurie Boucher. ""We were asked by the community to try to do something about it. And what we decided on as a council is, 'Can we limit the number of rooms that are being rented?'"" The answer is both yes and no. The new lodging home bylaw only applies to new home or ""lodging"" construction. Landlords who already own homes and rent out to multiple tenants will be unaffected. There are more than 90 old Victorian-style homes,Â with multiple units inside,Â in the downtown area of Antigonish that will be ""grandfathered in,"" or listed as legal/non-conforming. Boucher saidÂ those landlords will continue to be allowed to rent as they choose, butÂ the new bylaw will require they be registered with the town, which will trigger a fire and safety inspection. Boucher saidÂ that should address the concerns of students who have complained in the past of living in unsafe buildings. As forÂ neighbours who complain about party houses, Boucher saidÂ council is trying to balance their concerns with those of landlords and students.

Last week, officers arrested Santina Rao while she was shopping with her baby and toddler. She suffered a broken wrist and numerous bruises and is now facing charges of causing a disturbance, assaulting a peace officer and resisting arrest. ""I just went into this deep sense of 'OhÂ my heavens, we are gone back 100 years,"" Francis told CBC Nova Scotia's Information Morning. Francis servedÂ as lieutenant-governor from 2006 to 2012 â€” theÂ only black Nova Scotian to hold the position â€” and has spoken out before about racial profiling she said she faces in retail stores in the province. She said a video clip showing police on top of RaoÂ ""scared"" her and brought to mind Viola Desmond, the black woman who was dragged from a New Glasgow, N.S., movie theatre in 1946 for sitting in the whites-only section. Rao has said she paid for electronics in one section of the store and stopped in a toy aisle on her way to ring in some produce that couldn't be weighed at the checkout where she made her first purchase. She said police believed she was concealing items and that when she became upset they cuffed her without explaining why she was being arrested. She was not charged with theft. Chief Dan Kinsella on Monday called the situation ""disappointing"" and said he has referred the case to Nova Scotia's police watchdog. OnÂ Tuesday afternoon, the Serious Incident Response Team announced it will be investigating the incident. The Halifax Examiner has posted a video of part of the arrest. The incident has left Francis thinking about what would have happened if she had been accused of shoplifting. ""What if they called and the police came and surrounded me?Â Would my fear cause me to do something that I would not normally do? Would I show IDÂ if they asked me to? I don't know,"" she said. Francis said the incident's timing is particularly bad because it makes people question Halifax Regional Police's recent apology for street checks, a now outlawed practice thatÂ disproportionately targeted black men. Being followed through stores is something with which Francis said she's all too familiar. As a black woman, she said she doesn't have the option of putting things in reusable bags because she has no doubt a staff member would pull her aside. She employs her own strategy of keeping her hands out of her pockets and avoiding opening her bags. ""I just do all of that so that I don't add to the suspicion of being a black woman, which is very stressful,"" she said. ""I'm treated like 'Why are you in this store? You're not welcome.'"" Recently, Francis said she couldn't avoid taking something out of her bag but she did so reluctantly.Â  ""I just said a little quick prayer and I pulled the backpack off,"" she said. ""So this is what I go through because I don't want to go through what happened at Walmart. ""Look at our own backyard. Canada, Nova Scotia. Racism is alive and well.""

The 65-year-old ended up homeless, she says, after she wasÂ given two hours to pack what she could carry and get out of an apartment operated by a government-run mental health program. In March, according to Trask, staffÂ sent herÂ onto the street to fend for herself, handing her only a ""street survival guide"" to get by: a brochure that lists the locations of soup kitchens, 24-hour washrooms and homeless shelters. According to the eviction letter, Trask was kicked out of the mental health treatment facility after staff decided the program wasn't working for her, saying the senior was verbally aggressive and threatening toward staff. ""I mean my God, they think you're just human cattle,"" said Trask, who says she suffers from suicidal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Trask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. She was sent there from another facilityÂ in the Comox Valley, more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria, after that program underwentÂ cutbacks, she said. The senior has no IDÂ â€” it was stolenÂ â€”andÂ no family that can help. She often doesn't take theÂ mood-stabilizing medications she needs.Â  She's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria publicÂ parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring. While VancouverÂ Island Health's motto is, ""ExcellentÂ health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,"" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham toldÂ Go PublicÂ the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency sheltersÂ ""as a last resort."" She said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database trackingÂ exact numbers. Bloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but saidÂ Island HealthÂ ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services. Trask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay. Trask is part ofÂ a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilitiesÂ that can resultÂ in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges. ""Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,"" he said. ThatÂ addsÂ pressure onÂ overburdened emergency services across the country. Trask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela â€” a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre â€” after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent. ""It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her bodyÂ when I found her,"" said Tudela.Â Â  Tudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification. TraskÂ ended up going back to her tent that night. ""What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,"" Tudela told Go Public.Â ""That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that â€_ with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'"" In September,Â Â police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors ofÂ homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.Â  She says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a parkÂ in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated. Tudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask. She says no one responded. Although the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is ""a very frail woman."" ""She's all about 110 pounds,""Â Tudela said. ""She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm."" Mental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in CanadaÂ on any given nightÂ â€”Â and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness. ""There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,"" saidÂ Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg. He says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues. He worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings. The AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, MontrealÂ and Moncton, N.B. It found that the most importantÂ requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. The study, publishedÂ Oct.Â 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind usingÂ the Housing FirstÂ model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term. WATCH | Judy TraskÂ showsÂ housing advocateÂ  CarolinaÂ Tudela her tent in a Victoria park: Without stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for. ""Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,"" Distasio told Go Public. Go PublicÂ put Trask's situation to Canada's firstÂ provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken. ""For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,"" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. ""Our government is working to change this."" Darcy says the B.C. government plans toÂ buildÂ 2,200 affordable housing units and expandÂ access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit. As for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street. ""You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,"" says Tudela. ""The system is broken â€_ I don't understand the coldness of it all.""

But Air Canada said the answer is simple â€” she was using the U.S. site, where the charges are clearly shown in American dollars and there's a small U.S. flag at the top of the home page. The airline stressed she paid the same fare as she would have on the Canadian site, once the currency conversion was taken into account. But Wasson thought she was paying in Canadian dollarsÂ and got a shock when the exchange rate kicked in. ""When you booked online there, was no indication that you were paying in American dollars,"" she said. ""There was none at all."" In August, Wasson sat down at her home computer in Minto, N.B., and booked a September round-tripÂ flight on Air Canada's website,Â www.aircanada.com, for her husband to fly from Fredericton to Kelowna, B.C., with stopovers in Toronto on both legs. The cost was $801.14.Â It wasn't until she received her credit card statement in September that she saw Air Canada charged her $1,063.55Â for the ticket â€” an additional $262.41. She contacted the Air Canada call centre, but said the customer service rep was as mystified by the charge as she was. Wasson was advised to file a complaint, which she did. She also called her credit card company to dispute the charge. It was removed. However, Air Canada maintained she owed the full amount, so the $262.41 charge was placed back on her account. Wasson received an acknowledgement of her complaint from Air Canada, followed by a generic response in November that didn't address the issue, but offered her a 15 per cent discount on another flight within the next year. She said she has subsequently booked other Air Canada flights and was charged in Canadian dollars. ""As soon as I learned through my credit card [that I was charged in American dollars], I went back ... but I haven't been able to duplicate the American charge,"" she said. She also doesn't understand why there was a U.S. flight segment tax and a U.S. transportation tax applied to the ticket for flights that were only in Canada. This isn't the first time an Air Canada passenger has been charged in U.S. dollars. In December 2018, B.C. resident Doreen Hucal said she was billed in U.S. dollarsÂ when she booked her flights on the Air Canada app. At the time, Air Canada said Hucal was using its American website, even though Hucal insisted she was using the app. In July 2017, the Competition Bureau issued a news releaseÂ urging people to double-check the type of currency being used by companies online. It referenced purchases including furniture, clothes, jewelry and travel packages. It said some websites don't clearly identify which currency they are using, and that the dollar symbol could represent either Canadian or American dollars. ""Ensuring that you are shopping on the company's Canadian website (with an address ending in "".ca""), or selecting Canada as your country of origin can help, but it does not guarantee that the price shown is in CAD,"" said the news release. CBC News contacted the Competition Bureau to ask whether it has received complaints about airlines charging Canadians in U.S. dollars, how many complaints it's receivedÂ and which airlines were involved. But the Competition Bureau said it wouldn't answer those questions because it's required by law to conduct its work confidentially. In an email to CBC News, an Air Canada spokesperson said as an international carrier, the airline sells tickets to people around the world and flights can be purchased in several currencies. ""Aircanada.com has pop-ups asking customers to confirm their country the first time they visit it or if users have not visited the site in a while,"" Pascale Dery wrote, adding customers should always check to ensure they are on their preferred site. Dery said the country is clear because of the flag at the top of the page,Â and changing countries and currency can be done by simply clicking on a tab. ""Customers are advised several times during the booking process of the currency they are purchasing in, including prior to completing their purchase,"" Dery added. CBC Halifax used the U.S. site to start booking a trip and it did clearly show the charges in U.S. dollars. CBC then cleared the cache of the computer and attempted to book again on the following day, whichÂ yielded a pop-up message that said,Â ""You are about to open the aircanada.com edition for UNITED STATES, but it looks like you're located in or your previous selection was CANADA."" Dery said that message isn't a new feature, but Wasson insisted there was no pop-up on her reservation. Meanwhile, Dery said all tickets are fully refundable within 24 hours of purchase, so customers should check the itinerary receipts sent to them at the time of booking to ensure everything is OK. Air Canada said it'sÂ willing to refund the $16.80 US flight segment tax to Wasson andÂ has provided a link for her to submit her claim.

Marlene Jennings, the Quebec government-appointed trustee of the English Montreal School Board, said she hadÂ no choice, given declining enrolment at the schools.Â  The deeds of John Paul IÂ Junior High,Â St. Dorothy and General Vanier elementary schools will be revoked at the end of June. She began a special meeting Monday evening saying that like a plant that mustÂ be pruned to keep it healthy, so the EMSB's network must be trimmed if it is to survive. ""A major school change process can be very challenging â€”Â even stressful â€” especially when a school near and dear to your heart is involved,"" said Jennings. ""I want you to know that I recognize that and so do the members ofÂ the long-range planning committee."" Jennings was appointed to take over the powers and functions of the EMSB's commissioners last fall after a scathing report found serious irregularities in how the board was run. In Saint-LÃ©onard,Â Laurier Macdonald High School and John Paul I Junior High have been sharing the high school building since the start of the school year. The province's education minister handed the junior high school's building over to the Commission scolaire de la Pointe-de-l'Ã_le (CSPI) last summer, despite protests from the English-speaking community, in order to ease the desperate space shortage at the neighbouring French-language board. The junior highÂ will be merged into the high school to allow a more efficient use of educational resources and materials, Jennings said. The merger will be made final July 1, when John Paul I will cease to exist. General VanierÂ elementaryÂ school's building was also given to the CSPI last year. Students have been sharing the space with Pierre de CoubertinÂ SchoolÂ since the start of the school year. General Vanier's deed will be revoked at the end of June and the student populationÂ will then be divided betweenÂ Dante School on de Lachenaie StreetÂ and Pierre de CoubertinÂ School onÂ LavoisieÂ Boulevard. ""This is the end for General Vanier, which is bittersweet after 20 years,"" said Jason Trudeau, whose kids attend the school.Â  ""This is [the school's]Â 20th anniversary and it will be our last one.""Â  New school boundaries have been drawn and bus routes planned, though some students now at Pierre de Coubertin will be allowed to stay there during a two-year transition period, to prevent students from having to move schools a second time in the space of two years. St. Dorothy Elementary School in Villerayâ€“Saint-Michelâ€“Parc-Extension will be merged into Our Lady of Pompei Elementary School in Ahuntsic in July. St. DorothyÂ presently has 115 students, while nearby Our Lady of Pompei Elementary SchoolÂ has an enrolment of 167. Both are operating more than 50 per cent below capacity. Carlo Rossi, a parent from Our Lady of Pompei Elementary School, said he is relieved his own school will stay open, but is sympathetic to those affected. ""We're devastated for them,"" Rossi said. ""It's a terrible day for the English community."" St. Dorothy andÂ Our Lady of Pompei Â are in two different boroughs, but only 1.2 kilometres apart, and each is able to accommodate all the English-languageÂ students in the area, Jennings said. Of the two buildings, Our Lady of Pompei Elementary School is inÂ better shape, she said.

Like when the temperature hits triple digits â€” below-zero digits. ""With the windchill, it was -100 degrees in Labrador City last night,"" The National's Knowlton Nash told viewers on Jan. 19, 1982. Nash said Labrador City hadÂ been hit with the worst blizzard in its history and the provincial government had declared it to be in a state of emergency. The storm prevented The National from transmitting any pictures from Labrador City, leaving reporter Kathryn Wright to describe the scene to viewers. ""Labrador City and Wabush has been bombarded with freezing temperatures and winds of more than 100 km/h,"" Wright told The National via telephone.Â  The powerful winds had knocked down trees, which in turn brought power lines down with them. That left many without power, including the 2,000 people living at a local trailer park that had to be evacuated by emergency crews. Wright said it was believed the storm could last another two days. Cold weather was also making news in Prince Edward Island, where the temperature had hit -30 C the previous day. AsÂ Brian Milburn reported on The National, that mercury drop was part of ""the coldest cold snap that anybody can remember,"" also saying the dip to -30 C was ""the lowest temperature on Prince Edward Island in 105 years."" And like in Labrador City, harsh winds were blowing snow all over island roads and highways. There were also power failures that left some Islanders in need of somewhere else to stay. Milburn said the snow was making it hard to reach some of the people who were stranded in rural areas. ""The Red Cross has been sending convoys of trucks led by snowplows to pick them up and take them to emergency accommodation,"" said Milburn. ""But even the plows are finding it tough going.""",https://www.cbc.ca/archives/when-extremely-cold-weather-was-making-news-in-atlantic-canada-in-1982-1.5426329,[],N/A299,Alyssa Leippi,2020-01-22T10:00:00.296Z,My genes are stacked against me; it's made me a fighter,"Growing up, cancer for me was something that old people got. I lost my maternal grandmother before I even got a chance to meet her, my paternal grandfather by the time I was six and my paternal grandmother at 13.Â  It wasn't until my mother was diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 48 that it became real: this disease doesn't just hit elderly people. My mother's cancer was a rare one: hemangiopericytoma, a type that can be dormant for long periods of time. She went through brain surgery, radiation andÂ lost the vision in her left eye. She ultimately kicked that cancer in the butt.Â  But it wasn't long after that my mother's cousins were diagnosed with cancers of their own â€” all three before turning 55. All of their mothers had died from cancers similar to the ones they were now diagnosed with. The similarities were too much for one of my cousins who worked in the healthcare field. With the help of her doctor, they figured out that Lynch Syndrome runs in my family. Join CBC Saskatchewan's Sam Maciag for the January edition of The Novel Idea Society book club. This month, we'll be readingÂ Daughter of Family G: A Memoir of Cancer Genes, Love and FateÂ by Ami McKay, which deals with the topic of Lynch Syndrome. Lynch Syndrome gives the carrier a genetic predisposition to a laundry list of different cancers, meaning there's a mutation in their genes that makes them more likely to become ill. And it's hereditary.Â  Lynch Syndrome can be identified through the same genetic testing process as the breast cancer BRCA gene test, which has surged in popularity since Angelina Jolie came out about her genetic history.Â  It wasn'tÂ helpful that my entire family is in Ontario, where the high population causes more roadblocks to testing.Â  Here in Saskatchewan, it starts with your family doctor, then testing in Saskatoon. When you start genetic testing, you have a counselling session to prepare you for the information you could find out. I feel like my attitude of ""it's not 'if,' it's 'when'"" prepared me for this meeting. Since my mom was diagnosed the first time I truly believed that it was an ""I will get cancer in my lifetime"" situation.Â  I also had made the decision early in my life that children were not for me, so having a hysterectomy or mastectomy wasn't a major concern. These are preventative surgeries that you can have if you are positive about your genetic makeup, to help you with your chances of avoiding the cancers that affect these organs.Â  I've taken a different approach, though. At the same time my cousins and motherÂ were going through their genetic testing, I stumbled into an online test group with a health and fitness professional, which led me to understand more about how diet could play a role in my health and my fight against cancer.Â Â  My mother was diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer during this time of discovery. This was a hard one. The accessibility to information that the Internet provided wasn't always a benefit to her mentally during this fight. It provided her with a black hole of information, very little of which wasÂ positive. I was also an adult this time around, which gave me more insight into what was going on. Seeing her struggle through the fight the second time really pushed me to start researching ways to make my body somewhere cancer doesn't want to grow. Knowing what is in my family history has given me two options: either cause me to live in fear or push me to educate myself on what I can do to give me the best chance to live a long life. I personally have chosen option two and used it as a way to help others succeed in their lives. This column is part of CBC'sÂ OpinionÂ section.

For more information, please read ourÂ FAQ.Â Â  To some, ""feminist""Â is a label that every empowered woman and progressive man should wear proudly. It is not controversialÂ â€” it stands for the idea that every woman is a complete human being. Women are not less than men. Women deserve equal pay, equal say and equal rights in any society.Â  To others, ""feminist"" is a problematic term because of the biases and expectations that accompanyÂ it. Within the world of women, a feminist can be rejected as such for notÂ following certain rules or can find herselfÂ scrutinized for failing the movement â€” because a feministÂ is expected toÂ lookÂ a certain way, speakÂ a certain wayÂ and liveÂ a certain way. Here are two conflicting views of what feminism means today, as told in this point-counterpoint byÂ one Montreal mother and her teenage daughter.Â  I don't think expecting my daughter not to post sexed-up selfies amounts to 'slut-shaming': Jennifer Morrow Last summer, I stumbled onto my teenage daughter's social media account. What I found confirmed my worst fear: I had failed to raise a feminist.Â  There, among the pouty-faced selfies, was a photo of her posing, Sports Illustrated-style, on a jet ski in her bikini, brandishing her middle finger at the camera with a smirk on her face. My heart sank.Â  ""Who is this person?"" I asked myself. All her life, I've tried to model feminism: taking her on marches for women's rights, reading to her from books like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should all be FeministsÂ and surrounding her with a community of strong, independent female friends.Â  I realize now that the wisdom of my mother's ""Women's Lib"" generation doesn't cover the challenges of raising a feminist daughter in the 21st century.Â  Indeed, most young women seem so put off by the identity politics that come with calling themselves feminists that they're rejecting the label altogether.Â  ""What's the big deal?""Â Clara asked me when I confronted her about the offending photo. ""It's just a picture."" Where do I start?Â  As I write this, 14 beacons of light are shining in the night sky over Montreal, in memory of the women killed in the Polytechnique shooting.Â  They are stark reminders that our daughters are still vulnerable to violent men who will do whatever it takes to keep women silent and subservient.Â  Feminism seeks to create a new world where that isn't the reality they face.Â  My daughter believes a photo of herself sitting on a jet ski in her bikini represents girl power. But it actually just looks like the media has poisoned that message entirely and usedÂ it to perpetuate the status quo.Â  We want our girls to grow up brave, confident and assertive.Â  But they are drip-fed gender-conforming, sexualized images to the point where they think it's perfectly normal to strive to meet male-defined expectations of them â€” the more performative and sexy the better.Â  What is the point of these images? The question answers itself, and I find the porny subtext deeply disturbing.Â  Girls like my daughter can afford to be ambivalent about feminism. They live in a society that is relatively safe for girls, especially if they are privileged and white. As far as she is concerned, my pontificating about the need to fight gender stereotypes is just an old-fashioned demand to cover up her body â€” also known as slut-shaming. What is a mother to do? Ever since I first held her in my arms, all I wanted was for her to be happy and safe. This thing called feminism is a complicated gift.Â  One day, when she's out of the house and I can't hold her daily, I hope she will unwrap this complicated giftÂ and find what she needs inside â€” the tools to navigate an even more complicated world while staying true to herself. 'Would a boy be punished for looking too sexy?' asks Clara Morrow-Coffrant When my mother confronted me with the pictures on my Instagram, I thought ""What's the issue? It's not that big a deal.""Â  I told her that everyone posts photos like this. Also, it's not like this is anything new to our society. For example, Barbie is a hypersexualized children's toy that is given to girls as a sort of role model. Yes, she now comes in more shapes and colours, but we still think of her as having a perfect body and perfect blond hair. My mother thinks I'm too young to be putting this sort of image online, but I am not ashamed of it. What I, as a young woman of 15, post on social media doesn't define me. It is not the whole of who I am.Â  Am I a feminist? I don't know. The fact is that feminism today is much too difficult to define because everybody has a different perspective on what it means.Â  Of course, I believe in equality, but you are putting all the burden on me to police my self-expression in the interest of feminism â€” something I don't completely understand and can't get a real definition of.Â  Would a boy sitting on a jet ski be punished for looking too sexy?Â  Anyway, statistics show that my personal safety doesn't depend on what I wear. I also think that people are much too quick to judge a girl based on how she looks. You can judge me if you want to, I really don't care. My posts are for me and my friends.Â They are meant to be funny and ironic. It's not that deep. It's not political.Â  Instagram is just for fun. I'm still young, and I am allowed to make a few mistakes as I figure out who I want to be. This point-counterpoint is part ofÂ CBC's Opinion coverage.

""We want to play a role, and we did start to play a role,"" said FranÃ§ois Dumontier after testifying before a provincial commission examining the sexual exploitation of minors.Â  ""We want to be part of the solution."" Dumontier described the three-day event held every June in Montreal as the ""most important tourism event in Canada.""Â  He stressed, however, that the Grand Prix organizationÂ doesn't control everything that happens over the course of the event, which takes over much of downtown. Many of the events, he said, aren't organized byÂ the Grand Prix itself.Â  ""There's so many things going on in the city that we don't know about. We learn those events sometimes at the last minute and most of the time I would say that it's not the image that we want to the Grand Prix to have to or to receive,"" he said. Still, DumontierÂ said he recognized the race must play a role in raising awareness among patrons and working with police to prevent sexual violence.Â  Before last year's Grand Prix, police asked taxi drivers and hotel workers to contact authorities if they spotted a possible case of sexual exploitation. The program is called RADARÂ â€” a French-language acronym meaning ""identify, act, denounce, help and restore."" Eve ParÃ©, the director of the Association des hÃ´tels du Grand MontrÃ©al, said her industry, too, is taking steps to address sexual exploitation. Hotel staff have been instructed to look for signs of trafficking and prostitution, she told MNAsÂ at Tuesday's hearing. Such signs might include a young girl accompanied by a much older man, clients who insist on paying cash, and clients who repeatedly ask for their linens to be cleaned. ""It's all about trainingÂ and making sure they are on alert at all times,"" ParÃ©Â said.Â  Groups advocating for sex workersÂ have argued such initiativesÂ will render sex workers more vulnerable by driving the industry further underground. The head of Stella,Â a Montreal-based sex worker organization, delivered that message once again Tuesday. Sandra Wesley, Stella's director, called into question the purpose of the commission itself and questioned what she said were the assumptionsÂ that sex workers are helpless, abused by men and unable to make their own choices. She also said that, in her own group's experience, the vast majority of sex workers are over 18.Â  A preliminary report released by the commission last year cited a study that foundÂ four out of ten Quebec victims of sexual exploitation are minors.Â  The commission held a first round of hearings in Quebec City in November. It will next head to Val-d'Or, in the Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue region.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-sexual-exploitation-commission-grand-prix-1.5434932,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-grand-prix-sexual-exploitation-hotels-1.4148051 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stella-sex-work-grand-prix-exploitation-1.3631636,N/A302,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-19T10:00:00.694Z,Late fee to renew medical licence in N.S. frustrates doctor,"A physician who is licensed in Nova Scotia says the timelines and late fees for licence renewals are another barrier to recruiting doctors to the province. Dr. Ajiri Ikede, aÂ Dalhousie University graduate whoÂ works in Ottawa, maintains a licence in Nova Scotia to keep his options open.Â It's common for physicians to have licences in multiple provinces. Licences for Nova Scotia doctors expire each year on Dec. 31 and the annualÂ fee is $1,950.Â IkedeÂ incurred a late fee of $487 for paying his fee after Nov. 30, but before the end of the year. ""I said, 'How can I be late on something that hasn't expired yet?'Â And they said, 'Well, that's our policy as long as you don't meet our renewal window,'"" he said. Ikede comparedÂ it to home or auto insurance, and saidÂ it would be unacceptable to charge late fees early. It's up to each province's medical college to set rates and renewal rules. In New Brunswick, a licence is $600, but the late fee is $200. Ontario also charges a 25 per cent late fee, but that kicks in after the licence expires.Â Newfoundland and Labrador is the only other jurisdiction that charges a late fee before a licence expires. Ikede admits he was repeatedly warned by email that his fees were due. He's been licensed in the province since 2010 and never missed the deadline before. ""Imagine if you got an email the first week ofÂ November knowing that your licence is good till the end of the year,"" he said.Â ""That's not going to be on the top of your priority list of the other 150 emails you get that day."" Ikede isn't alone. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia said about 100 other physicians were issued a late fee this year.Â It said the late feesÂ addÂ a layer of protection for patients. ""Our legislation requires that a physician's licence is suspended if not renewed by year end,"" it said in a statement. ""When this happens, the first week of January may have cancelled surgeries or closed clinics or emergency departments."" Last year, more than 500 physicians renewed on the last day before the late fee took effect, the college said, while the remaining 100 were charged the $487 fee. ""These 100 physicians would have had their licences suspended by force of law, and patient care would have been interrupted dramatically,"" the statement read. Ikede saidÂ he understands the necessity for deadlines, but said the 25 per cent fine is extreme. He saidÂ it took five minutes to renew his licence online. ""The college is getting almost $50,000Â every year just from late fees collected in the month of December,"" he said.Â ""That seems like a lot of money to me to be collecting and when you consider that the removal process is pretty much automated."" Ikede saidÂ he's so frustrated thatÂ he plans to stop renewing his licence in Nova Scotia. The college saidÂ it will waive Ikede's late fee and review the ways it communicates with physicians in the future.

He's rounded up a museum-worthy haul of Zellers memorabiliaÂ in his dining room, spilling into his kitchen.Â There's flashy branded buttons, bathroom key chains, even a fire extinguisher from one of theÂ doomed departmentÂ stores.Â  His wife calls it hoarding. He calls itÂ collecting. Hall spent 35 years employed byÂ Zellers, workingÂ at 11 differentÂ stores. Today, he relies on his memorabilia to reminisce. ""Every segment of my life, I think back of what store I was in,"" he said.Â ""It's weirdÂ but it's kind of a measurement of time."" The last two Zellers locationsÂ in Etobicoke, Ont., and OttawaÂ will close on Jan.Â 26, according to Hudson'sÂ Bay Co., the retailer'sÂ parent company. Hall's memorabilia spans hisÂ entire dining room.Â He'sÂ got signed hockey sticks, limited editionÂ bottles of Hudson's Bay Co. scotches, multiple copies of the same Zellers flyersÂ â€” all in mintÂ condition.Â  And this is after he purged the collection. Perhaps his most prized possessionÂ is a gift he was given: AÂ framed copy of a newspaper from 1945, just after the Second World War ended, containing an ad from the original Zellers location in London, Ont.Â The page celebrates the ""glorious day of victory,""Â while also being dominated by a lengthy spread on Adolf Hitler's ""mad career,""Â complete with swastika imagery. ""This isn't about Hitler. This is about the Zellers,"" he assures. ""I point that out to everyone that I show:Â I say, 'No,Â I'm not a Hitler fan. I'm a Zellers fan.'"" Hall started at Zellers when he was 15, working his way up to general manager of marketing,Â where he ended his career inÂ 2013. That's when most Zellers were closing down or converting to now-defunct Canadian Target locations. Along the way, he met his wife. She was working at another department store, Towers, when Zellers took it over. ""I was asked to take the assistant manager from Towers under my wing, and so I did.Â And we've been married 28 years,"" he said. ""I took the instructions literally."" Maria Hall remembersÂ how Richard relentlessly tried to woo her. She worked at Store No. 64, so he sent her 64 balloons, 64 roses â€” and then a limo to the store. ""Isn't that crazy? The store was like, 'What is going on, Maria? Like, what is going on with this guy?',"" she recalled.â€‹â€‹ Zellers stores, she said, startedÂ many relationships. When TargetÂ came in, Richard and Maria HallÂ both lost their jobs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Richard kept the letter employees receivedÂ when ZellersÂ made the announcement that the U.S. retailerÂ was taking over. Target spent about $1.8 billion acquiringÂ leases for 189Â Zellers locations across Canada in 2011, though the move north of the borderÂ turned out to be a disaster: The last Canadian Target store closed its doors in 2015 and the company lost billions. ""Our lives are much better and it was a good thing,"" HallÂ said of losing his job. ""It was a catalyst to go do something different after being in the same company for so long."" A handful of ZellersÂ stores remained open,Â ultimately outlastingÂ Target. That includes the Etobicoke location, in Toronto's west end, which has seen hours-long lineups over the past few weeks, with shoppers snaking around the store, hungryÂ for sales. The final two locations are a bit different than other, traditionalÂ ZellersÂ that Canadians may remember, Hall said.Â They instead liquidate the Bay's leftover inventory. But theÂ closing at the end of the month still means the Zellers name will be officially gone. ""I think only us employees that have worked there can actually understand that, 'cause it's hard to articulate how important it was to people,"" he said. Many people are active on a Facebook group called ""If you ever worked for Zellers,"" where store and corporate employees fromÂ around the country reminisce. News of the last two closings has spurred a flurry of memories. The group was started in 2013 by Brenda Scott, who worked at a Zellers store in Huntsville, in Ontario's Muskoka region. She wanted a way to stay in touch with colleagues as the stores were first closingÂ and said the group has filled that void. More than 4,500 employees have joined her group since. ""You work for a Zellers, it's like working for family,"" she said. Scott, who now lives in Barrie, Ont., travelled down to the Etobicoke location earlier this month, wanting to say goodbye to the chain.Â She watched as crowds lined up in front of the store, waiting to get in before it had even opened. She said it made her feel upsetÂ â€” and longing for a Canadian company to shop at. ""I'm pretty sure Walter [P. Zeller] is looking down, watching everybody, and saying, 'This isn't necessary,'"" she said.Â  ""It's the end of an era. It really is. Being the end of an era makes a lot of people who worked there sad.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/zellers-closing-memorabilia-1.5425471,[],N/A304,Anonymous,2020-01-20T22:42:53.240Z,A 2-month wait to fix his 2 front teeth: The problem with the Ontario seniors dental program ,"A 73-year-old Windsorite is worried he might lose some of his teeth while he waits to be seen by a government-funded dentist. The Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (OSDCP) allows low-income seniors to visit a dentist for free, but the paperwork and few approved dentists mean there's a lengthy wait. The program was announced in June 2019Â but only launched the application system at the end of November. For RogersÂ Villeford, he's already spent six months with bleeding gums â€” and just last week another filling fell out.Â  ""I've had this for about six months ... every day I bleed,"" said Villeford. ""I take mouthwash and keep it in there awhile and swish it ... every morning I spit out blood.""Â  Villeford's income is about $18,000 a year. He was accepted into the OSDCP, but the appointment he was given is nearly two months away.Â  ""What good are [the dentists] if you have to wait?"" said Villeford. Locally the OSDCP is run by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. According to the director of health promotion, dentists under the program started seeing patients two weeks ago.Â  ""Our first senior seen under the program was Jan. 6,"" said Nicole Dupuis.Â  Dupuis said so far the program has seen about 15 patients, with another 46 appointments already booked. Appointment bookings are as far away as March. According to Dupuis it takes about one month between filling out the application to receiving a card that gives you access to the program. After the card comes in, seniors can book an appointment â€” but the first appointment is typically just a consultation.Â  ""We'll have more appointment times going forward,"" said Dupuis. ""We have had a wait list in our clinics ... a month is actually not too bad. We hope it won't get too much longer beyond that time frame."" Villeford decided he can't wait that long, so he made an appointment with a dentist â€” but he'll have to pay out of pocket for his treatment.Â  ""I don't want to lose my two front teeth,"" said Villeford, who expects to spend about $500 on the visit.Â ""It's a sham."" Similar to the Healthy Smiles Ontario program, there is an emergency service that might be available for people who need immediate treatment. To get emergency dental care, seniors would have to fill out a form signed by their medical provider that states they need treatment right away.Â  VillefordÂ said the WECHU gave him an emergency appointment for Tuesday, but it won't include any work like fillings.

The city told peopleÂ to get enough food to last 48 hours, suggesting the state of emergency will continue as crews clean up afterÂ a record-smashing blizzard on Friday. Pictures from inside a different Dominion location showÂ a picked-over dairy aisle. In the snack section, the chipsÂ had been mostly reduced to Cheetos and corn chips. Donna Robbins described the lineup as ""madness,"" and said you couldn't even force your way around the store. ""You just had to stay behind and wait until you got your turn to get your hands into the cooler to pull out something,"" she said.Â ""Basically it's just grab and go."" Joe White was at Bidgoods, a small groceryÂ store in the Goulds neighbourhood of St. John's, with his wife before the store opened. He figured it would be past 11 a.m. before they got inside. ""By the end of the day there won't be anything left [in] any of the stores anywhere in St. John's,"" White told CBC Radio from the parking lot. Before the doors opened at Costco, about 200 people were already in line. David Hurst, who works for a hotel in downtown St. John's, wasÂ on the hunt to feed both the hotel guests and staff.Â  ""Milk for cereal, bread for sandwiches â€_ and some supplies to make a nice pot of soup,"" he said, laughing. As residents piled onto narrow, snowy streets, the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary pleaded with people to carpool and find ways to limit traffic on the roads. ""We want to avoid having a gridlock occur,"" said Const. James Cadigan. ""The roads are still very much in the process of snow removal."" At least seven cab companies in St. John's did their part to curb the amount of traffic on the road, offering to drive people back and forth to the store for free. The City of St. John's said they are all on standby for seniors and people with mobility issues after the city lifted a ban on taxis during the state of emergency. Blackmarsh Road Dominion is on wheels... oh boy. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/snowmegeddon2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#snowmegeddon2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/JwWzHX8Uys"">pic.twitter.com/JwWzHX8Uys</a> Mayor Danny Breen stressed it was only for people who couldn't otherwise get to the store. Tom Lambe, manager of City Wide and Bugden, said the cab companies were happy to help. ""This is for people that don't have a vehicle or people, like the elderly, who need to get out and get groceries and a bit of medical supplies, or drugs, medication. They can give us a call,"" Lambe said. Stores around the city prepared for a hectic day, in some cases placing limits on products, such as Coleman's rule of two loaves of bread per person. At a Sobeys on Merrymeeting Road, hundreds of people were ready to file into the store before it opened. Milk, eggs and bread were at the top of most grocery lists.

Fresh produce might become an issue as its shelf-life is shorter than other items. There also might be a shortage of chicken, as the stores' primary source is St. John's-based Country Ribbon, which has been closed for the last few days. Sobeys had two of its three distribution centres open and were scrambling to restock shelves as fast as possible ahead of Tuesday morning. ""A big problem, obviously, is the amount of snow in our loading docks and loading bays, so we have been working with our dedicated snow removal team to get those cleared,"" said Sobeys spokesperson Violet MacLeod. Coleman's also had staff at its locations on Monday night in anticipation of the influx of traffic in the morning. Convenience stores and pharmacies were also permitted to open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Bars, restaurants and fast-food chains remained closed.

Born in Brockville, Ont., DeBloisÂ is the writer, director, and executive producer ofÂ How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.Â The third instalment of the trilogy has been nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature. The DreamWorksÂ Animation film stars Montreal's Jay BaruchelÂ as a now grown-up Viking named Hiccup, who embarks on yet another adventure with his dragon, Toothless. The star-studded cast includes the voices of Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill. The villain GrimmelÂ is voiced by F. Murray Abraham. This isn'tÂ DeBlois's first rodeo, nor his first Oscar nod. He was also nominated for each of the first two instalments of How to Train Your Dragon, and heÂ co-wrote and co-directed the Oscar-nominated Disney film Lilo and StitchÂ in 2002. So far, he hasn't brought home the hardware. ""I kind of know the drill a little bit, and I also know the disappointment of losing, so it's a measured excitement,"" DeBloisÂ told CBC's Ottawa Morning. ""These next couple of weeks will be aÂ lot of fun. For a while, we all get to be winners, and then the inevitable night comes where four out the five of us will go home empty handed."" DeBlois, whose father was a butcher, recalls having a steady supply of paper to doodle on in his childhood in western Gatineau's community of Aylmer. ""He would bring home these rolls of butcher paper which hung in a closet beneath the stairs, and I would just pull out sheets of it and draw all over.Â I was encouraged from an early start by my parents."" As he developed his skill, DuBlois said hisÂ main inspiration was a cartoon barbarian. ""I learned to draw from studying Conan. The anatomy was so ripped."" DeBloisÂ studied animation at a summer program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. During the rest of the year, he worked at Ottawa's now-defunct Hinton Animation Studios,Â honingÂ his craft on the TV showÂ The Raccoons.Â  He moved to Ireland in 1990 to work as a story boardÂ assistant on A Troll in Central Park and Thumbelina, then got his big break in 1994, when he moved to California for a job with Disney Feature Animation in Burbank. DeBloisÂ said he's taken his mother to every Academy Awards ceremony he's attended.

""Alex has not let go of it since,"" said his mother, Terri Taylor. The crash left the 18-year-old with a serious brain injury, and he spentÂ daysÂ fighting for his life. ""I just keep trying to remind myself of the little bits of light through all this darkness,"" Taylor said. Although TaylorÂ wishes she could go back in time and change what happened that day, she wouldn't take back meeting the Bordage family. The near-fatal crash on Jan. 8 sparked an unlikely friendship between the two Fredericton families, who otherwise might never have met. The families have supported each other in Facebook messages, a jointÂ visitÂ to the hospitalÂ where Alex is stayingÂ and aÂ handwritten noteÂ about forgiveness. ""We're going to get through this together,"" Taylor said. Over the past two weeks, Taylor has used Facebook posts to keep family and friends updated on Alex's recovery from the crash. One of the posts asked readers to pray for the driver who hit him. That's whenÂ HannaÂ decided to reach out to Alex's family. She sent a Facebook message to Julia, Alex's 16-year-old sister. HannaÂ introduced herself and asked how Alex was making out in hospital and apologized over and over again for strikingÂ him.Â  ""She didn't mean to hurt him,"" Taylor said. The two families decided to finallyÂ meet in person. Hanna, her mom, aunt and grandmother met over the weekend at the hospital in Saint John.Â  ""You don't know what to say,"" said Hanna's mother, Joemana Bordage. ""You just knowÂ you have to be there."" Hanna sat outside while her mother went into Alex's hospital room. She wasn't ready to meet him face to face just yet.Â  Both mothers understood. When Alex's mother told him Hanna's mother had come to visit, he reached out and squeezed Bordage's hand.Â  Weak and unable to speak clearly, he whispered into his own mother'sÂ ear. He asked about Hanna. ""He is fighting for his life in a hospital bed and he is concerned about Hanna,"" said Bordage, who held back tears at the time. Then Bordage gave him Hanna's rosary beads, which she'd received after her baptism at six months old. He weaved the beads throughÂ his fingers. ""That's how we get through things,"" said Bordage. ""We pray.""' Hanna, a Grade 11 student atÂ Ã‰cole Sainte-Anne in Fredericton, was driving home from school in a snowstorm on that day in early January. The newly licensed driver knew the roads were poor. And Hanna's father cautioned her to be careful and drive slowlyÂ â€”Â even if it angered other drivers. The teen even turned the music off inside her car to concentrate. The avid soccer player and straight-A student said she was driving 20 kilometres below the speed limit when she spotted a pedestrian walking in the same direction onÂ the side of the road. There aren't any sidewalks in that area. She swerved into the median of Prospect StreetÂ â€”Â putting herself in dangerÂ â€” while trying to dodge the pedestrian, who was Alex.Â  But it was too late. Her car hit Alex and sent himÂ into the ditch. Hanna immediately called 911.Â When paramedics arrived, Alex'sÂ face was swollen and covered in dirt.Â  There was blood everywhere. Just before the crash,Â Alex told his mom he was going for a walk to Tim Hortons.Â  The Grade 12 Fredericton High School studentÂ battlesÂ anxiety and depression, so walking was a way to clear his head. ""The last thing I said to him was, 'Be careful and I love you,'"" said Taylor. About 20 minutes later, she heard sirens about 100 metres from her home. She didn't think anything of it and drove her daughter, Julia, to work at the north-side Dairy Queen. When she returned home, Taylor noticed her son's black Sorel boots weren't in the doorway. ""I had this sickening feeling consume me."" Instinctively, Taylor ran out of the house,Â in her navy snowflake pyjamas and white slippers,Â to the accident scene, where police confirmed it was her son who had been hit. Alex was immediately sent to the Saint John Regional Hospital. He hadÂ surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The surgeryÂ lasted just over an hour, but ""felt like a million years,"" Taylor said.Â  ""We were just moments away from losing him."" Taylor is adamant the crash wasn't Hanna's fault. In fact, she believes the teen'sÂ quick reaction is what kept Alex from suffering more serious injury. ""She is as damaged emotionally as my son is physically,"" Taylor said. There haven't been any criminal charges following the crash. Alex will be staying at the hospital for several months and will move to theÂ Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation in Fredericton after that. Taylor and Bordage have been texting and talking over the phone â€”Â especially on the bad days. They share jokes, laugh and cry together. ""We'll forever be family now,"" Taylor said. Alex has broken bones on the right side of his skull and his maxillary sinuses are shattered. He is relearning how to walk and eat on his own. The right side of his face is paralyzed.Â  In the future, Alex could struggle to walk andÂ talk â€”Â he could even lose his memory and cognitive ability. Doctors still don't know whether he'll be the same person he was before the crash.

Indigenous leaders call on federal government to kill Teck Frontier mine project","Indigenous leaders from British Columbia and Alberta who oppose Teck's Frontier mine say its impact will be felt by First Nations well beyond the site of the massive oilsands project. Members of Indigenous Climate Action, the Tiny House Warriors and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs were among those who gathered Monday in North Vancouver outside the office of Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson calling on him to stop the project. The Teck Frontier mine north of Fort McMurray, Alta., would produce 260,000 barrels of oil a day and about four million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year, for more than 40 years. The federal government must make a decision on the project by the end of February under the Environmental Assessment Act. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for swift approval of the $20.6-billion project, warning that rejection would send a signal that Canada's oil-and-gas sector has no future, but the mine also poses a significant obstacle toward the Liberals' goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs called the project irresponsible and reckless, saying Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should ""walk the walk"" of transitioning to a green economy. ""There were commitments made during the last election that the Trudeau government would make decisive moves toward renewable energy and this is an opportunity to follow through on those promises,"" he said. Indigenous Leaders and activists deliver an open letter to the office of Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Jonathan Wilkinson, calling on Minister Wilkinson to Reject the Teck Frontier Mine <a href=""https://t.co/oNuHYYcfER"">pic.twitter.com/oNuHYYcfER</a> Teck Resources Ltd. said in a statement that it has spent more than a decade on community engagement, including signing agreements with all 14 Indigenous communities in the project area. The agreements set out a framework for co-operation in areas like environmental stewardship and economic opportunities, it said. ""Teck is committed to developing the Frontier Project in a way that is environmentally responsible, respectful of Indigenous communities, and creates meaningful benefits for the people of the region,"" it said. Kanahus Manuel of the Tiny House Warriors and Secwepemc Nation said product from the Frontier mine would be transported via the Trans Mountain pipeline, which crosses 518 kilometres of Secwepemc territory. ""This Teck mine will impact our community although it's hundreds of miles away,"" she said. Wilkinson was not available for an interview but his department said in a statement that the project is under active consideration. ""The government will consider a range of factors when they make a decision, including our commitments to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, to creating good paying middle-class jobs, and to growing the economy,"" the statement said. A joint review panel submitted its report in July containing its conclusions and recommendations for the Teck Frontier project to the minister and the chief executive officer of the Alberta Energy Regulator. The panel determined Frontier would be in the public interest, even though it would likely cause harm to the environment and Indigenous people. It's expected to create $12 billion in tax revenues for Ottawa and $55 billion in tax and royalty revenues for Alberta over its 41-year life. About 7,000 jobs would be created in building the mine and 2,500 workers would be needed to operate it. Chief Gerry Cheezie of Smith's Landing First Nation, a community in the Northwest TerritoriesÂ that has not signed an agreement and is downstream from the project, said he has seen significant environmental decline in his lifetime. He said he can no longer fish or drink the water directly from Slave River and has watched moose, migratory birds and other species disappear or decline.

Sisak,2020-01-17T20:45:50.416Z,Jury selected for Harvey Weinstein rape trial,"A jury of seven men and five women was selected Friday for Harvey Weinstein's rape trial after an arduous two-week process, setting the stage for testimony to begin in the next week. The final tally mostly erased a gender imbalance that, just hours earlier, led to complaints by prosecutors that the defence was deliberately trying to keep young women off the panel. ""They are systematically eliminating a class of people from this jury,"" prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said.Â  The defence said it wasn't specifically targeting young women, but didn't want jurors who were too young to understand the way men and women interacted in the early 1990s. ""That was a different time in New York and on planet Earth,"" Weinstein attorney Arthur Aidala said. Weinstein, 67, ambling out of the courthouse, didn't comment when asked his thoughts on jury selection. ""Ask Donna!"" he said, referring to lawyer Donna Rotunno. Three alternate jurors â€”Â one man and two women â€”Â were also chosen. They will sit through the trial and take the place of any jurors on the main panel who can't make it through to deliberations.Â  Weinstein, the former studio boss behind such Oscar-winners as Pulp FictionÂ and Shakespeare in Love,Â is charged with raping a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulting another woman in 2006. He has pleaded not guilty and said any sexual activity was consensual. If convicted, he could face life in prison.Â  The tussle over juror gender comes amid a selection process that has been far from easy.Â  Weinstein's case has attracted widespread public attention and catalyzed the #MeToo movement, as dozens of women have come forward over the last two years with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. That's made it tough for Weinstein's lawyers, prosecutors and Burke to find a fair and impartial jury.Â  Each day for nearly a week, whenever Judge James Burke introduced Weinstein to a new batch of potential jurors and asked if they couldn't be impartial, dozens of hands shot up.Â  Weinstein's lawyers have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to move the trial out New York City, arguing that the media hub where celebrities and ordinary people often intersect can't possibly give Weinstein a fair trial. Cognizant of the media attention and the weight some people are putting on the case, Burke has cautioned potential jurors: ""This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement."" Of more than 600 people summoned as potential jurors in Weinstein's case, some have marked themselves for disqualification by admitting they knew one of Weinstein's many accusers, had personal experience with sexual abuse or read Catch and Kill,Â a book by Ronan Farrow, one of the first reporters to bring the allegations against Weinstein to light.Â  There were others like supermodel Gigi Hadid, who reported for jury duty and wound up in the Weinstein pool, who even said they had met the defendant. One man's wife starred on a show that Weinstein's studio produced and said he couldn't be impartial. One woman said she couldn't be impartial because she has a ""close friend who had an encounter with the defendant in his hotel room.""Â  Another man was scratched for saying he couldn't be fair-minded because he had often spotted Weinstein in Tribeca, the lower Manhattan neighborhood that hosts an annual film festival. ""On several occasions I've seen him on the phone screaming at someone,"" he said of Weinstein. In the end, the jury includes the author of a upcoming novel that she describes as involving young women dealing with predatory older men. The defence, out of challenges, argued against including her on the jury, but Burke said she could serve. The defence then asked for a mistrial over her inclusion on the jury, but was denied. Weinstein lawyer Rotunno said the woman had lied on her jury questionnaire, but prosecutors noted she disclosed on the form that she was a novelist. That so many people in the running to be on the jury have had experiences involving Weinstein or his accusers speaks to the breadth of his alleged abuse, as well as the ubiquitous nature of celebrity in New York, where stars are frequently spotted by paparazzi and the public alike riding the subway, shopping for groceries and walking their pets. Then there have been other issues, including at least one instance of what jury consultants call ""stealth jurors"" â€”Â people eager to serve, especially on a high-profile case, because they hope to make a pointÂ or a profit.Â  On Thursday, Burke threatened to hold a potential juror in contempt of court for asking his followers on Twitter ""how a person might hypothetically leverage serving on the jury of a high-profile case to promote their new novel.""Â  Opening statements are expected next Wednesday. The trial could last about six weeks.Â  During the phase of jury selection called voir dire, where lawyers attempt to size up people who have assured the judge they could be fair and impartial jurors, the lawyers' concerns were in evidence. Addressing a pool of prospective jurors Thursday, prosecutor Meghan Hast signaled concerns that the sight of Weinstein, who's been using a walker since back surgery last month, could influence their attitudes about him. ""Is there anything about Harvey Weinstein, looking at him today, that makes you feel that there's no way that man's a rapist?"" she asked. No one responded. Defence lawyer Damon Cheronis told the panel that they would hear testimony from Weinstein accusers who might get emotional and cry on the witness stand. He also asked the potential jurors whether they were familiar with the concept of ""victim shaming."" Another one of his questions: ""Does anybody think an individual could have sex with someone that they may not find attractive for reasons other than love?"" No one responded. Prosecutors plan to call at least four women to the witness stand who have accused Weinstein of violating them, but whose allegations weren't the basis for the New York charges.Â As jury selection was getting underway last week, California prosecutors charged Weinstein with sexually assaulting two women there, one of whom who is expected to testify in the New York case.Â  Burke ruled Friday that if Weinstein testifies on his own behalf, prosecutors can't question him about that accuser on cross examination.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-hadid-1.5426418 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-recusal-rejected-1.5420656,N/A310,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-21T20:24:18.942Z,Over-representation of Indigenous people in federal prisons reaches 'disturbing' historic high,"The over-representation of Indigenous people in federal custody has reached a newÂ historic high,Â according to a statementÂ released Tuesday by the Office of the Correctional Investigator.Â  In the statement, Correctional Investigator of Canada Ivan ZingerÂ describedÂ theÂ continuing trend of the increasing number and proportion of Indigenous people in federal prisons as ""disturbing""Â and calledÂ for bold and urgent actions from corrections and government.Â  Indigenous people account for roughly five per cent of the population in Canada,Â but when it comes to federal custody Zinger said they now account for more than 30 per cent of the federal inmate population, up from 25 per cent four years ago.Â  Indigenous women now account for 42 per cent of women in federal custody.Â  Zinger said despite the findings of royal commissions andÂ national inquiries, court interventions andÂ political promises, over the last three decades,Â ""no government of any stripe has managed to reverse the trend of Indigenous over-representation in Canadian jails and prisons."" ""The Indigenization of Canada's prison population is nothing short of a national travesty,"" he wrote.Â Â  There are many layers of historical and contemporary factors at play when it comes to understanding why Indigenous people may be more likely to be criminalized, according to Zinger.Â  But once an individual comes into the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), he saidÂ the service needs to accept its share of responsibility in the overrepresentation instead of recusing itself from responsibility.Â  Zinger said, for example, that Indigenous people are more likely than others to be placed in maximum security institutions, serve higher proportions of their sentences behind bars before getting out on parole and are also returned to custody at much higher rates that non-Indigenous people.Â  ""In failing to close the outcomes gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders, the federal correctional system makes its own unique and measureable contribution to the problem of over-representation,"" said Zinger in the release.Â  ZingerÂ saidÂ overall there's been a decline in the number of people in prisons but that since April 2010 the Indigenous population in prisons has increased by 43.4 per cent. In comparison, the non-Indigenous prison population has declined in that same time period by 13.7 per cent.Â  Zinger is now calling on CSC to make ""dramatic changes"" to help reduce the over-representation and for the federal government to take a leadership role in directing those changes.Â  CBC reached out to CSC for comment, and was passed on toÂ Public Safety Canada. Jordan Crosby, director of parliamentary affairs for the ministry, said in an emailed statement, ""we know there's much more work to do."" ""The overrepresentation of Indigenous people in correctional institutions is an unacceptable situation that we are working very hard to address."" Crosby said several actions have been taken by government in the past four years to address the situationÂ including legislative changes that are meant to streamline the bail system, investments to support reintegration of previously-incarcerated Indigenous people and the opening of a new healing lodge in Winnipeg.Â  He also mentioned government commitments to expand diversion programs and the plan to introduce legislation to implement the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Â  Patricia Barkaskas, director of the Indigenous Community Legal Clinic in Vancouver, said theÂ continued trend of increasing over-representation is not surprising.Â  In her view, Zinger's newly released figures are evidence that ""the Canadian state continues to ignore its role in criminalizing Indigenous Peoples and creating this situation and not addressing it. ""Indigenous people aren't the problem, it's the system. It's Canada's colonial system,"" she said. She saidÂ government and institutions often point to theÂ GladueÂ rulingÂ as a way to remedy over-representation by takingÂ into consideration the influence of things such as residential schools, the Sixties Scoop or child welfare system on Indigenous offenders, but saidÂ it's not being implemented properly and in some casesÂ isn't being applied at all.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indigenous-overrepresentation-prison-oci-statement-1.5434712,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5434678/soaring-rates-of-indigenous-people-in-prison-unacceptable-says-federal-watchdog-1.5434693 https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/locked-up-at-12,N/A311,Dan Ralph,2020-01-22T01:56:19.376Z,Canadian Laurent Duvernay-Tardif didn't need long to get into Super Bowl mode,"It didn't take Canadian Laurent Duvernay-Tardif long to get into Super Bowl mode. On Sunday, the offensive lineman and the Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl with a 35-24 AFC championship win over the visiting Tennessee Titans. That secured the franchise its first berth in the NFL title game in 50 years. Duvernay-Tardif, from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Que., will be playing for a championship for the first time as a football player on Feb. 2 against the San Francisco 49ers in Miami. But that didn't take away from his focus during all the on-field chaos and celebrations on Sunday. ""I just went back home, grabbed dinner with family and friends and went to bed,'' Duvernay-Tardif, 28, said during a conference call Tuesday. ""I think that's the way you have to approach it because the next day I was back in the gym getting ready for the week of practice that started [Tuesday]. ""I celebrated the moment on the field, went back home grabbed a nice dinner and the next morning when I woke up I was already in a Super Bowl mindset,"" he said. The Chiefs' veteran right guard is a converted defensive lineman who played collegiately at McGill University in Montreal. The towering six-foot-five, 321-pound Canadian will become just the second player in school history to play in the Super Bowl. Linebacker/long-snapper J.P. Darche, a Montreal native, was the first. The former Toronto Argonaut played for Seattle in its 21-10 Super Bowl loss to Pittsburgh in 2006 in Detroit. Darche played nine pro seasons with the Argos (1999), Seahawks (2000-06) and Chiefs (2007-08). Duvernay-Tardif and Darche will both make the trip to Miami with Kansas City. Darche, 44, is currently one of the Chiefs' team doctors. Ironically, Duvernay-Tardif graduated from McGill with his doctorate in medicine in May 2018. That made him the first active NFL player to hold a medical degree although he must still complete his residency. After missing most of last season with a broken leg, Duvernay-Tardif will complete his sixth NFL campaign â€”Â all with Kansas City â€” playing in the Super Bowl. The Chiefs selected Duvernay-Tardif in the sixth round, No. 200 overall, in the 2014 NFL draft. In March 2017, Duvernay-Tardif signed a five-year extension with the Chiefs. The deal was reportedly worth $41.25-million US, with $20 million guaranteed. Kansas City's Andy Reid is just the seventh NFL head coach to lead two teams to the Super Bowl. But Reid lost in his only other appearance, that being Feb. 6, 2006 when the New England Patriots edged the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21. ""Coach Reid is more than a coach, he's also a mentor for me and the team,'' said Duvernay-Tardif. ""The team he's put together the last five years is really talented and I think we owe him to go all the way this year. Personally, he's kind of the one who understood what I was trying to do with medical school and football and gave me the opportunity to combine both at the highest level. If it wasn't for him, I don't think I would've been able to do it so I'm really grateful.'' The Chiefs will chase a second Super Bowl title â€”Â they downed Minnesota 23-7 in Super Bowl IV â€”Â after mounting consecutive comebacks this year. After spotting Houston a 24-0 advantage, Kansas City rallied for the 51-31 victory before reeling off 28 straight points against Tennessee to erase a 10-0 deficit. ""We're going to have to address that . . . because the further you get along in the playoffs the better the teams are and you can't really allow yourself to be behind,'' he said. ""But I feel like no matter what happened those last two weeks were really good learning opportunities and as a team I think we all showed character because were able to stick together. If we're able to fix it and have that kind of confidence going into the big game I think it will help us.'' Of course, having Patrick Mahomes at quarterback certainly helps. Duvernay-Tardif admits Chiefs players are routinely amazed by Mahomes' play. Kansas City had its way with a Titans defence that had allowed 13 points to New England and 12 versus Baltimore previously. But with Mahomes under centre, the Chiefs amassed 27 first downs and 404 yards of total offence. Duvernay-Tardif said Mahomes gives the Chiefs a huge edge heading into the Super Bowl. ""I think Pat is the greatest quarterback right now playing in the league,'' he said. ""Sometimes we look at the jumbotron and it's, 'Oh my God, how does he do that?' It's almost not human the amount of things he's able to process at the same time.'' Duvernay-Tardif admits being so close to a first-ever football championship can be a little nerve-wracking. ""I feel like after every season I've played football . . . you go to the playoffs and you always finish out the season losing,'' he said. ""This is the only time so far in my career that I have an opportunity to finish a season winning and after that there's nothing else, you've reached the top. That gives me goosebumps thinking about it.'' Especially when thoughts of a Super Bowl title were so very distant when Duvernay-Tardif was playing at McGill. ""For me throughout my whole career, it's been kind of a one step at a time approach,'' he said. ""It was only once I started being a consistent starter for the Kansas City Chiefs that I began having that vision of going all the way to the top and winning the Super Bowl.''",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/laurent-duvernay-tardif-superbowl-1.5435592,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/laurent-duvernay-tardif-kansas-city-chiefs-mcgill-1.4002410 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/laurent-duvernay-tardif-ranked-no-1-for-2014-cfl-draft-1.2496189,N/A312,Anonymous,2020-01-22T02:41:07.922Z,U.S. officials confirm first U.S. case of China coronavirus,"AÂ resident of Washington state who returnedÂ from aÂ trip to ChinaÂ last week has been diagnosed withÂ the newÂ coronavirusÂ that has sickened hundreds in China, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Tuesday. The man returned to the Seattle area in the middle of last week after travelling to Wuhan in central China, where the outbreak began. The Snohomish County resident is in his 30s and was in good condition Tuesday at a hospital in Everett, outside Seattle. He's not considered a threat to medical staff or the public, health officials told reporters on a conference call. ""This is certainly not a moment of panic or high anxiety,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said later at a news conference. Officials are now tracing the man's movements and contacts in China and the U.S. HeÂ has told health officials he did not visit any of the markets in Wuhan that are implicated in the outbreak and did not know anyone who was sick.Â  ""We are still in the early days of this investigation, both domestically and abroad,""Â Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC'sÂ National CenterÂ for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told the conference call. The man did not have symptoms when he arrived at Seattle-Tacoma airport last Wednesday, but contacted health officials on Sunday when he began to feel ill, officials said. Samples were sent to the CDC overnight Sunday, and the man's diagnosis was confirmed on Monday. ""The risk to the public is very low,"" Messonnier said. The CDC later said it will add Atlanta's international airport and Chicago O'HareÂ to the list of three airports already screening for the illness â€”Â New York's Kennedy International, Los Angeles and San Francisco.Â What's more, officials also will begin forcing all passengers from Wuhan to go to one of those five airports if they wish to enter the U.S. The agency also said it expects more U.S. cases of the coronavirus. More than 1,200 travellers have been screened so far, and none has been referred for testing. The CDCÂ had previously saidÂ it has developed a test to diagnose the new coronavirus that it plans to share with domestic and international partners. The virus, which can cause coughing, fever, difficulty breathing and pneumonia,Â has infectedÂ 440Â people in 13 Chinese provinces, according to China's National Health Commission Wednesday morning. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to nine. Separately, China's eastern Zhejiang provincial health authority said a total of five cases of the new coronavirus were confirmed as of noon Tuesday local time. Chongqing city also confirmed five cases of infection, the city's health authority said on Tuesday. As the death toll from theÂ mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed andÂ new cases surged, authorities fretted about the added risk from millions ofÂ Chinese travelling for the Lunar New Year holiday.Â  The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Tuesday that the new coronavirus was likely to spread. ""More cases should be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days,"" said WHO spokespersonÂ Tarik Jasarevic. WATCH:Â Â Hong Kong scientists warn about containing coronavirus promptly Based on current information, an animal seems to be the most likely primary source of the outbreak.Â JasarevicÂ said. ""Reports suggest that infection can cause mild to severe disease and be fatal in some. Based on current data, some new cases seem to experience milder diseases which is within the milder end of the spectrum of symptoms caused by respiratory illnesses."" The WHO tweeted that it will hold an emergency committeeÂ on Wednesday toÂ determineÂ whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concernÂ and what recommendations should be made to manage it. So far in China, the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although isolated cases have also been reported in Shanghai and Beijing. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan and now the U.S.Â  Taiwan, the self-ruled island that China claims as its own, also confirmed its first case, a woman who had returned from working in Wuhan, on Tuesday. Taiwan, which has close economic and people-to-people links with China despite political tensions, on Monday set up an epidemic response command centreÂ to co-ordinate the island's response to the virus. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further. Countries in Asia and around the globe have begun body temperature checks at airports, railway stations and along highways in hopes of catching people carrying the virus. The measures are part of a widening effort aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, another coronavirus that started in China and killed nearly 800 people, paralyzed transport and damaged Asian economies.Â In Canada, 44 people died, many of them health-care workers. China's often secretive Communist government was blamed for making SARS far worse by initially hiding information and blocking the work ofÂ WHO. This time, China'sÂ leaderÂ Xi Jinping has led calls for tough measures, ordering that ""party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first."" At the airport in Wuhan, the temperatures of departing passengers were being checked. Virtually anyone in a public role, from traffic policemen to bank tellers, along with many riding public transport have donned protective masks. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, toldÂ reporters Monday that there are no reported casesÂ in Canada and the agency is not aware of any cases involving Canadians overseas. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> There were three travellers from Wuhan who were investigated and ruled out over the last week, Tam said. She would not say where in Canada they were screened. Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) told CBC News on Sunday that ""the overall risk of disease spread to Canada is considered low.""Â  Canada has no direct flights from Wuhan, and the volume of travellers arriving indirectly from Wuhan is low, PHAC said. PHAC said it will be ""implementing additional measures"" in the coming week, including warning signs in English, French and simplified Chinese at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal. On the kiosks where people fill in questions, they'll be asked if they've been in an area affected by the outbreak within the past 14 days.Â Â  A spokesperson for the Vancouver Airport Authority said Tuesday the new measures have not yet been implemented.Â  If an ill passenger is referred for quarantine, their temperature could be taken as part of the assessment. Â  One case has been detected in Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has urged officials to step up quarantine checks at airports and other entry points, with many visitors from China expected to arrive during the holidays. The number of Chinese tourists has risen steadily in recent years, with more than nineÂ million visiting last year. Japan will require visitors arriving from Wuhan to fill in health forms, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said. WATCH:Â Coronavirus could spread during Lunar New Year travel rush, WHO warns Japan confirmed its first patient last week, a man in his 30s who tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from Wuhan. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said it has tracked down 41 people who had contacts with the patient and is monitoring them. It says none has developed pneumonia symptoms. Brendan Murphy, Australia's chief medical officer, said flights from Wuhan are being met by biosecurity staff and by state health officials in New South Wales who are distributing pamphlets in English and Chinese to all passengers describing the symptoms of the disease and asking them to identify themselves if they have any. Australian health officials said a man was placed in isolation in Brisbane after developing a respiratory illness after traveling to Wuhan but has now recovered. Russian airports have stepped up screening of travelers arriving from China too, airport officials said on Tuesday. At least four Russian airports - Sheremetyevo and Vnukovo in Moscow, as well as airports in Yekaterinburg and Irkutsk - have introduced screening measures to try to identify infected passengers, Russian airport officials said. The virus was a threat to Russia, deputy health minister Sergei Kraevoi was cited as saying by the RIA news agency. Russia's consumer health regulator, Rospotrebnadzor, advised Russian tourists who planned to go to China to refrain from visiting Wuhan and to steer clear of zoos and of markets selling animals and seafood. The regulator said it could not rule out the possibility of the infection spreading to Russia, but evaluated the risk of a widespread outbreak in Russia as low, the Interfax news agency reported. It was also cited as saying that a testing system to diagnose the new coronavirus had been developed in Russia and that laboratories would start receiving it by the end of the week. Regional authorities have already been briefed on measures they need to take to reduce the risks of an epidemic.

Bud Chafe, 83, died suddenly SaturdayÂ after shovelling out his home. Rupert Crocker also died over the weekend, reportedly following his own shoveling attempt. It's not clear whether their deaths are related to exertion from snow clearing. Mayor Don CoombsÂ said he knew both of them well. It's a ""hard weekend for everybody,"" Coombs said. ""Two great men left great legacies."" CoombsÂ said fire crews responded to Crocker on snowmobiles, butÂ the causes of death aren'tÂ yet known and Coombs couldn't say whether the deaths were connected to shoveling out after Friday's blizzard. He described the men as fixtures of Harbour Grace, which has a population of about 3,000.Â  ""Bud was a legacy in the town. He was bigger than life,"" Coombs said. He added most people would be familiar with Chafe through his contributions to the Harbour Grace Regatta â€”Â and if not, they may have seen his name emblazoned on the regatta boathouse. Chafe was also a stalwart of the province's minor hockey scene, and had a major hand in cultivating a girls' hockey presence on the Avalon. Chafe also served two terms on town council.Â Coombs recalls his dedication to the community, like the time he saved a historic one-room schoolhouse, rolling it up on logs to another site rather than leavingÂ it to rot where it stood. ""He was about family, he was about commitment, he was about kids in the region â€_ and wanting things for the children,"" the mayor said. ""The things he did will go on for a long, long while."" Chafe's familyÂ asked in his obituaryÂ that donations in his memory may be made to the Harbour Grace Regatta. Rupert, also known as ""Rocket,"" was well-known as an entertainer. He gained local notoriety from his role in Terra Nova Shoes commercials. ""The town of Harbour Grace is a better place because of Bud Chafe and Rupert Crocker,"" Coombs said.Â  The blizzard that brought eastern Newfoundland to its knees hasn't been confirmed to have claimed any lives. A number of house fires broke out in the days following the storm, with all inhabitants accounted for. A 26-year-old fromÂ Roaches Line remains missing after he ventured out during the storm.

Yukon Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell announced the initiative in Vancouver on Sunday, on behalf of MÃ©lanie Joly, federal minister of economic development and official languages.  The Yukon Mining Alliance will use the funding to showcase the opportunities in the North at the annual Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference for the next three years.  Bagnell says the conference is the largest of its kind with over 1,000 exhibitors and 25,000 attendees from around the world, and this year's event will take place in Toronto in March.   He says theÂ alliance will establish a key presence at the conference including a media centre, an all-day forum with information on the North and a networking event.  It's part of the Invest Canada North initiative which aims to promote the territories as attractive investment destinations and create jobs for Indigenous and northern residents.

There were roughly 82 cases of syphilis in the province in 2019, up from 50 cases in 2018, an increase of 60 per cent. But unlike an earlier provincial outbreak between 2009 and 2013 that was concentrated in the Halifax area, the disease is now occurring provincewide. ""We're not really saying that any region of the province is particularly spared, which is different again than the 2013 outbreak that was largely in the city,"" Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, Nova Scotia's deputy chief medical officer of health, said Monday. ""We're now seeing this is something that's occurring across Nova Scotia."" Syphilis is transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, oral and anal sex. Initial symptoms occur within a few weeks to a few months after infection. They include a sore at the point of infection, a mild fever, and a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.Â  But those symptoms are easy to miss. ""The problem is the sore is actually painless, so they may miss it. Particularly if they can't see it, if it's in a region that they can't see,"" Watson-Creed said. Problems can arise when someone carries the disease for yearsÂ and it begins to damage the heart and the brain. ""Historically, in medicine it's been called the great imitator because it can look like so many things and and often look like almost nothing at all,"" Watson-Creed said. Watson-Creed saidÂ cases of all sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are on the rise across Canada. She said the last Nova Scotia outbreak of syphilis was contained through practising safer sex and especially through regular syphilis testing by people who had unprotected sex with multiple sexual partners. ""Even if you identify it late, it's not too late to treat and so it is a very treatable disease,"" she said. Syphilis tests are accessible through sexual health clinics and family doctors, including walk-in clinics. Treatment consists of a single injection of penicillin. Watson-Creed believes that fatigue around safe-sex messages may be part of the reason syphilis is making a return. ""Those messages can get old for people quite quickly, particularly if they're not regularly certainly reminded of themÂ and if they don't think that they're at risk,"" she said. While the previous syphilis outbreak in Halifax primarily affected men having sex with men, the disease is now affecting more women. For this reason, all pregnant women will now be offered two syphilis tests during their pregnancies, instead of just one. ""We're looking now to see if we can detect any of those cases early. So again, we can have those babies in treatment,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-outbreak-province-sexually-transmitted-infection-1.5433651,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/syphilis-cases-on-the-rise-in-halifax-1.1237435 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/police-say-missing-truro-man-was-killed-1.5433206 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/public-will-get-more-time-to-file-formal-complaints-against-police-1.5433413 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/saint-john-man-identified-after-body-found-digby-county-1.5433163 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/shaw-wilderness-park-williams-lake-area-land-sale-1.5433325,N/A317,Anonymous,2020-01-20T20:00:00.732Z,"5,000 volunteers needed for 2023 Canada Winter Games on P.E.I.","The co-chair of the 2023 Canada Winter Games says about 5,000 volunteers will be needed to pull off the Island-wide celebration of sport.

Snow is typically blown up onto lawns in residential areas, but with towering snow banks and limited space, it now has to be loaded into dump trucks and taken away. Breen addressed complaints that people trying to call the St. John's city services hotline 311 to get help could not get through, saying call volume is high and recommending that people just keep trying. ""You're not being forgotten,"" BreenÂ said. He defended the ongoing state of emergency, saying that it's ultimately short-term pain for long-term gain.Â  ""This is a very serious situation here â€_ we don't want any cars on the road,"" Breen said. ""[People driving] is only delaying the process â€” we have to clean up the city."" WATCH: Mayor outlines plan to get city moving again after major storm The four hours of strong winds and snow set back some of this weekend's efforts to clear streets. That setback also applies to cleanup efforts on the highways on the Avalon, said Transportation Minister Steve Crocker.Â  While the highways are open, except Witless Bay Line, ""they are snow covered, slushy in places after last night's snow,"" Crocker said. The message is straightforward: If you don't need to be on the highways, don't try it. Crews need space to widen the roads, as parts are seeing drifts again and one lane in each direction is the norm. He said people are going to need to adjust their highway driving for months to come, noting that any new snow or high winds could fill in areas that were previously cleared. He urged people to give highway crews extra space, as workers have said people are coming dangerously close to the heavy equipmentÂ as they widen the roads. Municipal Affairs Minister Derrick Bragg said Happy Valley-Goose Bay offered to send 14 heavy equipment operators and mechanics from Labrador to the island to assist in the cleanup. Bragg said the municipalities affected by the storm appreciated the offer, but decided to handle it on their own. ""Right now, the cities feel and the towns feel they are managing.Â They have sufficient staff to do it,"" Bragg said.Â ""So we're not facing burnout yet, but if we get any more snow, we will be facing burnout, I'm sure of that."" Troops from CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick arrived in St. John's Sunday, before the latest storm set in. About 450 troops from across Canada are being mobilized in a federal response that was authorized Saturday. ""Our troops will be there as long as needed,"" said Defence Minister HarjitÂ SajjanÂ at a news conference in Winnipeg. ""We'll make sure we don't leave until the job is done."" Some of the top priorities forÂ the troops are to clear roads, attend to elderly and sick residents and ensure that people who need medical care get to hospitals and clinics.Â  People in need can call a hotline atÂ 709-729-3703 to request help. The forces members are armed with shovels and snowblowers and have started digging people out, but the city says help is limited to vulnerable populations.

Ball said the military will also help dig out fire hydrants and transport essential workers. The Canadian Red Cross will also be on hand to help, he said. Troops will work out of an emergency operations centre headquartered at the MCP building on Major's Path. ThatÂ hubÂ will co-ordinate what needs to be done based on calls made to various municipalities. ""We hear lots of examples of people right now are just not able to get out of their homes, and this creates another fear and stress on individuals given the fact that if they were in an emergency, someone would have to get there,"" the premier told CBC Monday morning. ""So we need a place to co-ordinate and have this call centre set up."" For troops on the ground, they're there to follow orders as directed, and have a long list of properties to dig out ahead of them, according toÂ Sgt. Noel Gibbons of the 37th Combat Engineers. ""That's all designated through our command centre which is obviously in liaison with the public, the town council, the city and various municipalities,"" Gibbons said. ""We're basically told where we need to go, and we go and do that tasks."" Military troops are also helping first responders, who have struggled with snow-covered streetsÂ and two different bouts of blizzard conditions since Friday.Â  ""We as Newfoundlanders, we come together, we help each other out,"" said Roger Hounsell, a deputy platoon chief with the St. John's Regional Fire Department.Â  ""Everything is starting to get a little bit normal again, if that's possible after such a large amount of snow.""Â  On Monday morning, Breen said police will start enforcing the rules of the state of emergency â€” up to a $5,000 fineÂ for people and stores who disobey it â€”Â if needed. ""We're focused on getting the streets open and getting the residents back to their normal routinesÂ ...Â not in penalizing people. That said, we can't let it get out of control because we really need the streets to be open and available to the snow-clearing equipment and our operators."" After initially saying no fines had yet to be issued, James Cadigan, a spokesperson for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary said penalties had in fact been levied. He did not know how many tickets officers wrote, but said he would look into getting more information.Â  Blue skies on Sunday called to St. John's residents running low on supplies and eager for exercise. As snow removal progressed, pedestrians filled the streets, with many walking dogs and looking for convenience storesÂ flouting the city'sÂ order to remain closed. Power has been restored to most of the more than 20,000 who lost electricity during the storm, however some customers in the Bonavista area are still without power.Â  Those needing information or assistance can call the following numbers: Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/blizzard-cleanup-monday-1.5432919,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-news-you-can-use-1.5432713 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,N/A320,Chad Pawson,2020-01-20T02:00:43.897Z,"Canadian painter Gordon Smith, a beloved master, has died at 100","Gordon Smith, aÂ Canadian painter known for his large-scaleÂ abstract work and influence on other artists, died on Saturday, Jan 18, 2020. He was 100. Smith was born in East Brighton, England in 1919 and came to Winnipeg in 1933 where he enrolled at the Winnipeg School of Art. His career as a painter and teacher spanned right up until his death. ""A key figure in Canadian art, Smith lived his life with a generosity and grace that was a gift to the world,"" said Vancouver's Equinox Gallery in a statement. Most of Smith's work reflected the landscape and natural world around him. His piecesÂ are often a sweeping tangle of form and colour. He hadÂ his first professional exhibition in 1938.Â Â HisÂ artistic career included two major retrospectives at the Vancouver Art Gallery, more thanÂ 25 solo exhibitions at Equinox Gallery, participation in biennial exhibitions in Canada and Brazil, as well as significant commissions including the design of the Canadian Pavilion for Expo '70 in Osaka, in collaboration with Arthur Erickson. He also produced and major works for public buildings in Washington, D.C. and London, U.K. In 1941 he married Marion Fleming and their marriage spannedÂ 70 years.Â Fleming died in 2009, but together they founded the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation for Young Artists whichÂ supports art education for young students. Robert Heffel, the vice president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, began selling Smith's work in 1995. Heffel and his wife, along with his brother David and his wife,became close with the Smiths. ""Gordon Smith is probably the most loved artist, the most loved you'll ever know, everybody that met him, loved him."" said Heffel. ""He was just such a warm, genuine person."" Heffel said every day, right up until the end of his life we went to his studio. ""Everyday he painted, that was his life, that's what he lived for."" Smith taught at the Vancouver School of Art and at UBC from 1956 to 1982 when he retired from teaching to focusÂ on painting full time. In 2017, he created an exhibition called ""Black Paintings,"" which reflected his time as an Intelligence Officer in the Canadian Infantry. In the past decade his works became more sought after as buyers around the world paid record amounts forÂ Canadian works from artists such as Emily Carr,Â Jean-Paul Riopelle and The Group of Seven painters. In 2013, Smith's 1965 abstract Red Beach was featured on the cover of Heffel Fine Art Auction House'sÂ contemporary catalogue and ended up fetching $93,600, three times the high-end of its presale estimate. ""It's fair to say that when you put his great paintings beside other great paintings, he stands out as one of the greats, for sure,"" said Heffel. Smith received many accolades over the course of his career including the Order of Canada inÂ 1996, the Order of British Columbia inÂ 2000, the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2009Â and the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts in 2007.

The justices turned away Tuesday two appeals by the city and state and local officials of a lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit to move forward. The lower court had rejected a demand for immunity by the officials, finding that they violated the residents' right to ""bodily integrity"" under the U.S. Constitution by providing the tainted water after switching water sources in a cost-cutting move in 2014. The justices' action comes as similar class-action cases are currently on appeal at the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Flint switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to reduce costs during a financial crisis. The corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning can stunt children's cognitive development. No level of exposure is considered safe. The city switched back to Lake Huron water the next year. The contaminated river water also triggered an outbreak of bacteria-caused Legionnaires' disease, which killed 12 people and sickened dozens of others Lawsuits over Flint's water have proliferated in recent years. The number of people who have reported being harmed through exposure to contaminants in Flint, including lead and bacteria, or who experienced ailments such as rashes and hair loss, has reached more than 25,000, including more than 5,000 children under 12, according to court records. The cases centreÂ on the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of due process under the law, which can protect people from government-induced harm to their personal security or health, a legal principle known as ""bodily integrity."" Courts have previously enforced the right to confront abuses of power in cases of direct physical intrusion, such as non-consensual medical procedures or forced drug administration. The defendants argued that the lower courts have dangerously expanded that right by applying it to policy decisions that result in public exposure to environmental toxins. They also argued they are protected from the claims through a legal doctrine known as ""qualified immunity"" because they could not have known they could be held liable for ""doing the best they could in difficult circumstances with limited information."" The case before the justices was filed in 2016 by two Flint residents including Shari Guertin, who said that she and her child were exposed to high levels of lead. Calling the water crisis a ""government-created environmental disaster"" in a 2019 ruling, the 6th Circuit greenlighted the constitutional claims and rejected immunity for the officials.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/u-s-supreme-court-flint-residents-sue-water-contamination-1.5434430,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/i-feel-like-i-m-in-another-country-inside-america-s-latest-lead-water-crisis-1.5250175 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/flint-water-health-chief-charged-1.4159883,N/A322,Aly Thomson,2020-01-21T19:33:32.917Z,N.S. declined to seize insurance money granted to mentally ill man who killed wife,"Nova Scotia's Justice Department twice told the province's Supreme Court it would not apply to seize life insurance money granted to a Cape Breton man found not criminally responsible for killing his wife. The detail is noted by Justice Frank Edwards in followup comments to his ruling last week that Richard Maidment is entitled to his wife's life insurance, which totals $200,000 plus interest. Maidment, 42, who also uses the surname McNeil, killed Sarabeth Forbes on April 18, 2017, in the home they shared in Gardiner Mines, N.S. He was found not criminally responsible in December 2017. Two years earlier, Forbes named Maidment as beneficiary to her life insurance and her son as a contingent. In granting the money to Maidment â€” and not to the couple's 12-year-old son, who is now being raised by his grandmotherÂ â€” Edwards noted Maidment doesn't benefit from a crime because he didn't commit a crime and is not a criminal. Last week, a law professor noted there is precedent for provincial governments to intervene in such cases, under the province'sÂ Civil Forfeiture Act. In additional written comments released Monday, Edwards noted the court notified the province's attorney general of the claim for the life insurance, made by Maidment's mother on his behalf. Edwards said in a letter dated Aug. 6, 2019, a solicitor of the civil forfeiture unit of the Justice Department wrote thatÂ ""the province of Nova Scotia will not be participating in this matter."" After the unit was advised that Forbes's mother, Emeline Forbes, had filed an counter application for the insurance money on behalf of the couple's son, a lawyer for the department advised the court that it ""does not have an interest in the proceedings."" Edward noted that because the province did not intervene in the case, ""My decision did not deal with provisions of theÂ Civil Forfeiture Act."" The Justice Department declined an interview request. But in a statement, spokesperson BarbaraÂ MacLean noted theÂ Civil Forfeiture Act only allows for forfeiture of propertyÂ â€” including moneyÂ â€”Â to the province, and not to third parties.Â  ""To clarify, this means when applying the act under any circumstances, forfeited money would go into the general revenue of the province, and would not be able to be given to a third party.""

Dr. Kami Kandola said her office is monitoring the situation and that right now, the majority of reported cases globally are related to exposure in Wuhan, the city in mainland China where the virus was first reported. There are no direct flights to Canada from Wuhan, said Kandola, and Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports are screening travellers who are at risk.Â Â Â Â  ""It's just important that the initial ports of entry won't be through Yellowknife, Northwest TerritoriesÂ â€” it will be through these larger cities,"" she said. The coronavirus belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging in severity; from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), says the Public Health Agency of Canada. Coronavirus is not currently as serious as SARS, said Kandola, but it's likely the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases. As of Jan. 20, 282 cases of the virus were confirmed, and six people had died, according to the World Health Organization. Cases have also been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the United States, and all are linked to people who had travelled from mainland China.Â Â  ""The situation right now, from the Public Health Agency of Canada is that the risk is extremely low,"" said Kandola. However, she added, that can change with the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, when millions of people travel around China and abroad.Â  ""We don't know what the situation is going to be after that,"" she said.Â  Kandola urges people travelling between Canada and China to look at travel advice issued by the Canadian government. At the Nova Hotel in Yellowknife on Tuesday, tourists expressed mixed feelings about theÂ coronavirus outbreak.Â  Sandy Lee, a traveller from San Francisco with roots in Hong Kong, said she's ""getting nervous.""Â  ""Hopefully we can prepare,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I don't know, because now Chinese New Year is coming up [and] people will be going back to their own region to visit their relatives.""

""Our friends in China,Â they still travel,"" he said. The symptoms of coronavirus mimic other common viruses, such as a fever, coughing and shortness of breath, said Kandola.Â  She said people can protect themselves and others by washing their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds, and by coughing and sneezing into a tissue or their elbow. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.Â  While the risk of catching the new virus is low, other viruses, such as influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are circulating around the territory. Kandola said people with cold- and flu-like symptoms should stay home, and if their symptoms are severe, they should go to the emergency room.

The Toyota recall affects about 3.4 million vehicles globally and is being done because the air bags may not inflate in a crash. The cars have air bag control computers made by ZF-TRW that are vulnerable to electrical interference and may not signal the bags to inflate. The problem could affect as many as 12.3 million vehicles in the U.S. made by six companies. It's possible that as many as eight people were killed when air bags didn't inflate. U.S. safety regulators are investigating. Honda's recall covers about 2.7 million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada with Takata air bag inflators. But they're a different version than the ones blamed for 25 deaths worldwide. Still, it's possible the air bags could blow apart a metal canister and hurl shrapnel at drivers and passengers. Both recalls were announced on Tuesday. In a statement, Toyota said the computer may not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can happen in crashes, such as when the vehicle runs under a different vehicle. The problem can cause incomplete opening of the air bags, or they may not open at all. Devices that prepare seat belts for a collision also may not work. In most cases Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control computer and a wiring harness. But in some vehicles dealers will inspect the computer to determine if it needs the filter. Owners will be notified by mid-March. The recall covers certain 2011-19 Corollas, the 2011 to 2013 Matrix, the 2012 through 2018 Avalon and the 2013 to 2018 Avalon Hybrid in the U.S. Toyota wouldn't say if it will offer loaner cars to people who fear their air bags might not protect them. A spokeswoman suggested that owners call its customer hotline to discuss their issue at (800) 333-4331. In March of 2017, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating problems with ZF-TRW air bag computers. The probe was expanded in April of last year to 12.3 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Fiat Chrysler from the 2010 through 2019 model years. Toyota joins Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler in issuing recalls for the problem. Four deaths that may have been caused by the problem were reported in Hyundai-Kia vehicles and three in Fiat Chrysler automobiles. The investigation was upgraded after investigators found two serious crashes involving 2018 and 2019 Toyota Corollas in which the air bags did not inflate. One person was killed. Toyota said it's cooperating in the probe, which is continuing. NHTSA is evaluation how susceptible the air bag control units are to electrical signals as well as other factors that could stop air bags from inflating. In documents, the agency said that it didn't find any other cases of electrical interference in Hyundai, Kia or Fiat Chrysler vehicles that used the ZF-TRW system but were not recalled. The Honda recall, also announced Friday, covers certain Honda and Acura vehicles from the 1996 to 2003 model years. Honda vehicles included are the 1998 to 2000 Accord Coupe and Sedan, the 1996 to 2000 Civic coupe and sedan, the 1997 to 2001 CR-V, the 1998 to 2001 Odyssey and the 1997 and 1998 EV Plus. Acura vehicles covered are the 1997 and 1998 2.2CL, the 1997 to 1999 3.0CL, the 1998 and 1999 2.3CL, the 2001 and 2002 3.2CL, the 2001 and 2002 MDX, the 1998 to 2003 3.5RL, and the 1999 to 2001 3.2TL. The front driver's inflators being recalled are part of a recall announced by Takata in November covering at least 1.4 million vehicles from five automakers. Honda said it's recalling a larger number of vehicles to make sure it gets all of the bad inflators. In this case, the inflators don't contain ammonium nitrate, which is blamed for previous Takata problems that have killed 25 people and injured hundreds worldwide. But three of the newly recalled inflators exploded and hurled shrapnel, two in Japan and one in Texas that injured a driver, Honda said in a statement. The company said in all three cases, the inflators were exposed to excessive moisture. In Texas, the car had a salvage title with a date that coincided with a major flood, while the two cases in Japan were in salvage yards where the windows are typically left open, the company said. ""Honda believes that the risk of improper air bag deployment in its vehicles remains very low at this time, but we cannot absolutely guarantee the performance of any recalled part,"" the company said in a statement. Owners will be notified in mid-March, but replacement parts won't be available for another year, Honda said.

Today, Chimiugak lives atÂ an outpost on the Bering Sea calledÂ Toksook Bay. At 90, she is considered an elder, and she is about to become the most well-known woman in her tiny town: She will be the first person counted in the 2020 U.S. census,Â taken every 10 years to apportion representation in Congress and federal money. ""Elders that were before me, if they didn't die too early, I wouldn't have been the first person counted,"" Chimiugak said, speaking Yup'ik language of Yugtun, with family members serving as interpreters. ""Right now, they're considering me as an elder, and they're asking me questions I'm trying my best to give answers to, or to talk about what it means to be an elder."" The decennial U.S. census has started in rural Alaska, out of tradition and necessity, ever since the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. The ground is still frozen, which allows easier access before the spring melt makes many areas inaccessible to travel and residents scatter to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. The mail service is spotty in rural Alaska and the internet connectivity unreliable, which makes door-to-door surveying important. The rest of the nation, including more urban areas of Alaska, begin the census in mid-March. On Tuesday, Steven Dillingham, director of the census bureau, will conduct the first interview. Because of federal privacy laws, the bureau won't confirm Chimiugak will be the first person counted, even though it's the worst kept secret in her hometown. After the count, a celebration is planned at Nelson Island School. It will feature local Alaska Native dancers and traditional food, which could include seal, walrus, muskox and moose. Robert Pitka, tribal administrator for Nunakauyak Traditional Council, hopes the takeaway message for the rest of the nation is of Yup'ik pride. ""We are Yup'ik people and that the world will see that we are very strong in our culture and our traditions and that our Yup'ik language is very strong."" For Chimiugak, she has concerns about climate change and what it might do to future generations of subsistence hunters and fishers in the community, as well as the fish and animals. She plans to talk about it with others at the celebration. ""She's sad about the future,"" her eldest son Paul said. Chimiugak was born just after the start of the Great Depression inÂ western Alaska, her daughter Katie Schwartz of Springfield, Missouri, said. Chimiugak was one of 10 siblings born to parentsÂ who lived a nomadic lifestyle and traveled with two or three other families that would migrate together, her son said. Chimiugak and her 101-year-old sister from Nightmute, Alaska, are still living. In 1947 Chimiugak married George Chimiugak, and they eventually settled in Toksook Bay after the town was founded in 1964 by residents of nearby Nightmute. There are five surviving children. George worked maintenance at the airport and she did janitorial work at the old medical clinic and babysat. Like other wives, she cleaned fish, tanned hides and rendered seal oil after her husband came home from fishing or hunting. Her husband died about 30 years ago. Chimiugak is also a woman of strong Catholic faith, and told her son that she saved his life by praying over him after he contracted polio. ForÂ hobbies, she weavesÂ baskets from grass and remains a member of the Alaska Native dance group, whichÂ will perform Tuesday. Chimiugak will be dancing in her wheelchair. She taught children manners and responsibility and continued the oral tradition of telling them stories with a story knife. Chimiugak used a knife in the mud to illustrate her stories to school children. She drew figures for people or homes. At the end of the story, she'd use the knife to wipe away the pictures and start the next story with a clean slate of mud.

To get in, she presses an automatic button on a remote to extend a five-footÂ ramp out of the drivers side. The wheelchair itself is around three-feet wide.Â  ""[Any parking space] needs to have an extra, I say, 12 feet beside of it for me to park in,"" she said. And those spots are hard to come by. Leer tries to park next to empty spots, but if she returns to find someone has parked in it, she has to find that person, so that they can move their car. This week, Leer met with the South Fraser Active Living group in Vancouver. The group has already petitioned local municipalities about changing their parking space bylaws.Â  Leer has already reached out to the provincial and federal governments.Â  B.C.'s Social Development and Poverty Reduction Minister Shane Simpson said Leer's experience highlights the need to make the province more inclusive and accessible.Â  ""We're developing the province's first accessibility legislation, which will be informed by the ideas, experiences and feedback we heard from people like Kristen,"" Simpson said. ""We know there's more to be done, but our government is making accessibility a priority."" His ministryÂ says one aim of theÂ legislation would be to create accessibility standards.Â  Leer said she'll be reaching out to her mayor and council next.Â  ""When you can't get around in your area, there's no point in being anywhere and people are staying home because of it,"" Leer said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessibility-fort-nelson-1.5430035,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/housebound-by-snow-disability-advocate-pleads-shovel-your-sidewalks-1.5427600 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wheelchair-accessible-taxis-vancouver-1.5234791 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/the-curious-case-of-the-misplaced-curb-1.5002770,N/A327,Sara Minogue,2020-01-21T20:23:24.880Z,Giant Mine's remediation team still has a to-do list,"The Giant Mine remediation team opened public hearings in Yellowknife on Monday with some big promises.Â  ""The project will provide value to residents, and return a site that is greatly improved,"" said project director Chris MacInnis.Â  MacInnis also laid out the stakes of any delays to the cleanup: anywhere from $15 to $20 million in extra costs to the taxpayer for every year the cleanup is delayed.Â  The team is presenting its final closure and remediation plan to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board this week in the hopeÂ of obtaining a 20-year water licence and a five-year land use permit. It's the last major hurdle before the $1-billion cleanup finally begins.Â  But MacInnis made it clear that the final closure plan may not be completely final.Â  ""It is only with the confidence of an approved final closure and reclamation plan that the project can complete the final detailed design,"" MacInnis said. ""We have proposed a phased approach to submissions that will present these detailed designs to the board for approval to allow active remediation work at the Giant Mine site to start in 2021."" In other remarks, Natalie Plato, the remediation team's deputy director, explained that the team had yet to file a quantitativeÂ risk assessment, ordered by the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board. She promised that would be done by February, before the water licence is issued.Â  She also said a planned stress study, part of the team's health effects monitoring, had yet to take place. The study is expected to look at how stress related to the possibility of arsenic exposure may affect human health. Plato said they don't believe this should be a condition of the water licence, as it will not affect project design, but rather, how the project engages with the public. The board will hold four more days of hearings â€” on top of months of presentations â€” to determine whether that phased approach can satisfy all parties who want to see the work done right. More than 100 people attended Monday's session. At least one interested person is confident the project is going in the right direction. Ed Sangris, Dettah chief for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, opened his remarks by saying that Giant Mine ""significantly and fundamentally changed the people of the Yellowknives Dene.""Â  And while Sangris said it was a little strange to be holding hearings after so much important work at the site had already happened, such as the dismantling of the roasting complex and the removal of the headframe (both deemed safety priorities), he's optimistic about the process.Â  ""Giant Mine has never benefited the Yellowknives Dene. We were not consulted and we did not receive any compensation from Giant,"" he said.Â  ""With this process, we have the opportunity â€_ to return to what was taken from us, the opportunity to reconcile with the past, the opportunity to change.""

But it's unclear what legal recourse the royal couple will have to keep news photographersÂ away from their family. David Fraser, a Halifax-based privacy lawyer, says, when it comes to privacy claims in Canada, he hasn't found any related to celebrities and paparazzi. The lawsuits here that relate to invasions of privacy, most recently, deal with large-scale business data breaches, or hidden cameras, he said. ""So this is relativelyÂ new grounds that we're looking at, maybe because we don't have the same sort of paparazzi culture or the same sort of celebrity culture in Canada. But so far, a claim like this has not been made or at least hasn't gone to a published decision,"" he said.Â  ""It's not something that's really been tested a whole lot in Canada. We don't have a paparazzi culture."" Buckingham Palace announced Saturday that the prince and his wife will give up public funding and try to become financially independent. The coupleÂ is expected to spend most of their time in Canada while maintaining a home in England near Windsor Castle in an attempt to build a more peaceful life.Â  Video from Sky News showedÂ Harry landing at Victoria's airport late Monday. The prince, Meghan and their eight-month-old son Archie were reportedly staying at aÂ mansion on the island.Â  Lawyers for the couple sent aÂ letter to British new outlets, accusing photographers of ""harassment,"" and claimingÂ that paparazzi have permanently camped outside their Vancouver Island residence, attemptingÂ to photograph them at home using long-range lenses. They also allege that picturesÂ of Meghan â€” on a hike with Archie and her two dogs, trailed by her security detail, on Vancouver Island on Monday â€”Â were taken byÂ photographers hiding in the bushes.Â  ""There are serious safety concerns about how the paparazzi are driving and the risk to life they pose,"" the letter read. When it comes to privacy issues in Canada, there are a few ways Canadians can take action, says IainÂ MacKinnon, a Toronto-based lawyer.Â  One can argueÂ ""intentionalÂ infliction of mental stress""Â in which the conduct of the defendant has to be proven to be flagrantÂ andÂ outrageous; calculated to produce harm,Â andÂ results in visible and provable illness, he said. There's also what's known as ""intrusion upon seclusion"" in which the defendant's conduct must be intentional or reckless and have invadedÂ the plaintiff's private affairs ""without lawful reason."" Also, aÂ ""reasonable person would regard the invasion as highly offensive causing distress, humiliation or anguish,"" MacKinnon said. And there's public disclosure of private facts, when one publicizes an aspect of another's private lifeÂ â€”Â without consent â€” thatÂ would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. The publication also would not be of legitimate concern to the public. ""And Meghan Markle walking her dog in a public space â€_ would not fall under any of those,"" MacKinnon said. They may seek recourse under theÂ B.C.Â Privacy Act which specifically says it's a violation for somebody to willfully and without a legal basis violate the privacy of someone else, and allows for someone to sue the alleged perpetrator. InÂ making that determination, a judge is required to take into account the circumstances of the situation, the relationships between the parties and other people's rights and interests. There is an exemption, however, for journalistic publications and if the matter is of public interest.Â  ""Up until now, certainly when they've been part of the Royal Family and are highly public figures and are paid, their whole and entire lifestyle is paid for by public funds, then that's certainly one justification for arguing that what they do is a matter of public interest,"" MacKinnon said. ""AsÂ they may recede from public life and become more private citizens, that argument may be more difficult to make. But certainly today, this is headline news, them leaving England, leaving the Royal Family, moving to Canada. It's tough to say that this is not a matter of public interest."" Most people won't consider it to be highly offensive that someone took a picture of Meghan in public park because there isn't a reasonable expectation of privacy,Â MacKinnon said. ""Now, if they're shooting with telephoto lenses into a house where Harry and Megan are staying and they're photographing them in their private lives inside a house, that might be a different story."" Fraser says, under the act, an invasion of privacy can also include surveillance. ""It's really going to depend upon the exact circumstances of what's alleged. But it certainly sounds like a group of photographers, paparazzi following them aroundÂ might fit into the category of surveillance,"" he said. Fraser said even if one is in a public place, there's still an expectationÂ of privacy. Being in a public park, there's aÂ significantly reduced expectation of privacy.Â But when it comes to a photographer hiding in a bush, a court might say it'sÂ arguable that oneÂ has an expectation of privacy if they are in a place,Â looking around, not seeing other observers and somebody has hidden themselves, Fraser said. ""There would also probably be an element of kind of additional intrusion based on the fact that the person has hidden themselves and is covertly trying to surveil somebody,"" Fraser said. The Charter of Rights and Freedoms doesn't give anybody a particular privacyÂ interest among individuals â€” only against the state.Â It does, however, provide a right for freedom of expression, which would be the right that the photographers have, Fraser said. ""So any court considering these issues would have to balance those interests which includes the rights of journalists to collect information,Â to disseminate that information, against a particular privacy interest."" Still, Fraser believes Harry and MeghanÂ could find a ""level of sympathy"" in the courtsÂ  ""Given that, it seems that they're moving from the United Kingdom to Canada,Â least part time, in order to get away from this glare and get away from these invasions of privacy,"" he said.Â  It's unlikely that the royalsÂ would see a big cash windfall in the event their legal claims were successful.Â Privacy damages are relatively low or modest in Canada, Fraser said.Â  ""But I would expect that an injunction so a court order requiring the paparazzi to stay away might be something that they would seek as well."" And asÂ MacKinnon noted, Harry and Meghan, through their lawyers, are probably attempting to set new ground rules. ""My guess is that they're trying to draw a new line in the sand here with both the Canadian media [and], more likely, the Fleet Street tabloids.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/prince-harry-meghan-privacy-laws-1.5435154,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-privacy-laws-harry-meghan-1.5434741 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-her-majesty-prince-harry-meghan-security-costs-canada-1.5434579 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harry-meghan-lose-royal-titles-1.5432208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-canada-jobs-1.5429202 https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-harry-victoria-meghan-archie-1.5434247,N/A329,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-20T11:43:26.238Z,Province cancels deer-cull program for needy families ,"A pilot project to allow hunters in Saint AndrewsÂ to harvest nuisance deer meat andÂ feedÂ dozens of low-incomeÂ families in the area was cancelled just before it was supposed to launch.Â  This past fall, the Department of of Natural Resources and Energy DevelopmentÂ announced thatÂ deerÂ meat would be donated to the Volunteer Centre of Charlotte County Inc. But the initiative was quietly cancelled to allow the New Brunswick's Department of Health time to assess whether there are any risks to food safety. ""If you don't have something and you didn't get it, it's not as bad as having it taken away from you,"" said Donna Linton, a co-ordinator for the non-profit organization.Â  Linton said about 30 families in Charlotte County expressed interest in the deer meat to eat over the winter. This would've fed at least 56 children in the area.Â  The Town of Saint Andrews, which is trying to cope with a growing deer population,Â said it would pay to have the meat processed inÂ the St. Stephen area, and it wouldÂ eventually be donated through the volunteer centreÂ to families in need.Â  Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, said her office started looking into operational and food licence requirements that could support the project. But it will need more time.Â  ""We will be conducting a cross-jurisdictional scan to see if other provinces have food safety programs in place for similar initiatives and if there are ways to implement control measures to help reduce risks and allow this kind of donation,"" Russell said in an emailed statement to CBC News. Instead of the 40 pounds of deer meat per family, they're being offered hot dogs and hamburger meat through the local food bank. ""They have a food insecurity issue and specifically protein,"" LintonÂ said.Â ""They were just hoping they could secure some food to get them through the winter."" While most of the families told Linton they had never hunted, they do have experience with deer meat. ""All of the families have had experience cooking it and were aware of the different seasoning flavours that you can do,"" she said. ""It's just kind of sad."" The poverty line in that area of Charlotte County is about $24,000 a year, but many people try to get by on half that amount. Many families who would've benefited from the pilot project either lost a job or are living on disability. ""When there's grandchildren living in the home, often they're living on the grandparents' pension.""Â  But Linton is hopeful the project will be able to go ahead next year. ""We're not letting it go."" Brad Henderson, deputy mayor of Saint Andrews, said the project would also decrease the town's deer population. In August, residents of the town took out a full-page newspaper ad calling on the province and the town to do something. Henderson said he was told by Natural ResourcesÂ and Energy Development Minister MikeÂ HollandÂ thatÂ the project would go ahead sometime this year.

The most significant delay for riders occurred around 6:30 p.m. SaturdayÂ â€” only a few hours after the snow began falling â€” when track switches were ""disturbed"" at the eastern end of the Confederation Line, triggering replacement bus service for two hours. OC Transpo tweeted about the delay at the time, and on Sunday morning emailed CBCÂ News a statement explaining that ""snow interfered with the normal operation of a switch at Blair station."" The email, attributed to transit operations directorÂ Troy Charter, explained safety sensorsÂ that are supposed to detect whether people are on the tracks were being activated by snow, and could cause trains to come to a sudden halt. To get around this problem, train operators were instructed to move slowly, which would have contributed to the delays for customers. Another switch issue caused the Confederation Line to shut down on Sunday evening, again between Hurdman and Blair. This time, according to OC Transpo's Twitter feed, replacement bus service lastedÂ 40 minutes. Switch problems are amongÂ the four main issues that haveÂ been plaguing the LRT system, along with jamming doors and two separate computer problems. City officials have known about the potential problem posed by snow on the switches for some time. Fibreglass switch covers installed by Rideau Transit Group (RTG) to prevent snow buildupÂ have actually caused some recent delays, and have since been removedÂ along the line.Â The city has urged RTG to post extra staff on the ground this winter, especially at those switches. According to Charter, the maintenance arm of RTGÂ ""did have staff at various points,"" but that the oversight didn't appear to be enough to prevent the switch issues. There were other issues on the Confederation Line this weekend that were not made public, CBC has learned. On Sunday morning, a train was disabled at Tunney's Pasture station, shutting down service for a while. Around midday, the doors on a train at Hurdman station failed to open, and customers were unable to board orÂ exit the train. It's unclear how long this problem lasted. Far more concerning was the presenceÂ of smoke on the line. According to social media, smoke filled part of the tunnel shortly after 10 a.m. on Sunday. An internal incident report shown toÂ CBC indicated the smoke and a burning smell were caused byÂ a ""wheel flat""Â â€” a wheel that has ceasedÂ turning and is grinding against the track. Charter confirmed reports of the smoke to CBC, and said the issue is being investigated. According to a CBC source, another train was removed from Blair station Monday morning after reports of a burning smell and ""train slippage."" OC TranspoÂ said in a statement on Monday afternoon that the Confederation Line is down to 10 trains from ""the required 13"" because of a series of mechanical issues, including the problems with air compressors and wheel issues. As well, the train that pulled down 80 metres of electric cable last Thursday is being inspected to try to figure out the cause of the alarming incident.

Photographs of Meghan's life on the island â€” taking a seaplane to Vancouver,Â going to a yoga class, picking up a friend from the airport â€” have all been published. On Tuesday, media outlets likeÂ the GuardianÂ said the couple had issued ""a stern warning"" against photographers in Canada after ""unauthorized"" pictures of Meghan walking with eight-month-old Archie in a park with the family's two dogs were published in a number of British tabloids.Â  The couple, who have long had a difficult relationship with the tabloid press, areÂ involved in a number of lawsuits with U.K. tabloids over invasion of privacy â€” but their latest Canadian warning could mean a test for this country's privacy laws.Â  Privacy is governed by both federal and provincial statutes in Canada, explains privacy lawyer David Fraser, who works for the firm McInnes Cooper, and runs theÂ Canadian Privacy Law Blog.Â  Most Canadian privacy law is similar to U.K. law, he says, but what is different in British Columbia is the implementation of the provincialÂ Privacy Act.Â  InÂ  B.C., theÂ Privacy ActÂ is what allows individuals to sue other people for invasions of privacy where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy.Â The act also saysÂ privacy may be violated by eavesdropping or surveillance, whether or not accomplished by physical trespass. ""So, the act of the paparazzi of continually following around a person â€” in this case the duchess â€” probably could be surveillance for the purposes of this act, which could lead to a lawsuit,"" Fraser explained.Â  A successful lawsuit wouldn't bring substantial monetary damages, he says, but could grant the privacy-seekingÂ couple something more important â€” an injunction against that kind of repeat surveillance from photographers. The major caveat, however, is that the law hasn't really been tested with these types of ""celebrity"" cases.Â  ""It's all relatively untested when it comes to these sorts of circumstances [because]Â we don't have in Canada the same sort of paparazzi culture,"" Fraser said. ""Most of the cases that we've seen under this statute ... principally relate to voyeurism,Â to a landlord putting a hidden camera in an apartment [or]Â harassment and things like that."" As Vancouver Island continues to bear the gaze of the international tabloid press, Fraser says pure economics rather than the law might be the blunt instrument of choice that eventually wins the young family their peace.Â  ""If you're a freelance paparazzi photographer in Los Angeles or Monaco or London, that's a pretty target rich environment,"" Fraser said. ""On Vancouver Island, there will be one or two celebrities and one baby that you'll be looking toÂ try to earn your living from.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-privacy-laws-harry-meghan-1.5434741,https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-harry-victoria-meghan-archie-1.5434247 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-her-majesty-prince-harry-meghan-security-costs-canada-1.5434579,N/A335,Jason Warick,2020-01-22T12:00:00.202Z,Sask oil project generates controversy,"A proposed oil project in northwest Saskatchewan is fueling controversy. Calgary-based Serafina Energy plans to extract 8,000 barrels of oil per day nearÂ Glenbogie, which is near the town of St. WalburgÂ about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. The Serafina Glenbogie SAGD projectÂ will require nearly fiveÂ million litres of water per day from the North Saskatchewan River. The provincial government saidÂ the project does not require an environmental impact assessment, according to a Ministry of Environment document. That's not sitting well withÂ Makwa SahgaiehcanÂ First Nation Chief Ron Mitsuing. He saidÂ the project must not go ahead until their questions are answered around water use, waste water and other issues. ""Not right now, until all the concerns are met. For sure, the water and how it's going to affect our lakes. Everything that happens there is going to flow directly to our lakes,"" Mitsuing said. Grant Ferguson, an associate professorÂ at the University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security, saidÂ more testing should be done before resource projects such as Serafina's are approved. He said there also needs to be a broader public debate over the best uses for Saskatchewan'sÂ finite fresh water supplies. The government document saidÂ the water taken representsÂ 0.03 per cent of the river's total flow. Ferguson noted that amount will be taken out of the water cycle daily for 20 yearsÂ and that while the Serafina project is large, it's one of many oil and gas projects removing fresh water from the system. ""At the end of the day, that water is not going back into the hydrological cycle,"" he said. The proposed project will extract oil through a relatively new but increasingly popular method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). It's used for solid bitumen deposits which can't easily be pumped to the surface through previous cold water methods. With SAGD, steam is injected hundreds of metres underground and let out through pipes running horizontally through the desired layer of bitumen rock. The bitumen melts and seepsÂ into another pipe, and is then pumped to the surface for processing. The waste water will be injected into the ground. That's a common method, butÂ in the Estevan region and other jurisdictions the water is released much deeper. Many of the regulations are federal and provincial, but some of the approvals were granted at the local level. The rural municipality of Frenchman Butte approved Serafina'sÂ water intake proposal and its plan to construct a thermal plant, subject to a number of conditions. When asked if the RM supports the overall project, RM Reeve Bonnie Mills Midgley said the approval process ""speaks for itself."" Mills Midgley said she and her council may have more detailed comments following a meeting later this week. Serafina spokesman Chris Bartole said a small initial drill is underway and will be reclaimed immediately afteward. Bartole said the regulatory process is continuing and they continue to engage with Indigenous communities. ""Our objective has always been to respond meaningfully to any concerns brought to Serafina's attention by First Nation and MÃ©tis communities. He said there's no set date for construction of the main project. The work done on the Glenbogie project is ""the most comprehensive assessment ever conducted for this type of development in Saskatchewan."" He said much of the land selected has been recently harvested by the forestry industry or approved for future harvest, and they've taken special precautions to protect groundwater. CBC News also requested interviews with officials from the provincial government and the town ofÂ St. Walburg. Neither requestÂ wasÂ granted. Ferguson said the oil and gas industry has a long history in the province and has provided many jobs.Â That's made government regulators comfortable, even ""complacent,"" about the environmental effects, he said. ""We've gone forward with these things without ever really going through the rigorous environmental assessments done in other places,"" he said. ""We do need better baseline information."" The drilling area includes several plant species deemed ""extremely rare,"" such as Michigan moonwort, white bog adder's mouth and smooth wild rose, according to the Ministry of Environment document. To minimize impact, Serafina is promising to start construction outside of growing seasonÂ and to preserve topsoil for replanting. Part of the project is located on pasture or crop land, and the rest is within the Bronson Provincial Forest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/oil-project-generates-controverst-1.5434928,[],N/A336,Ben Mussett,2020-01-22T03:00:00.936Z,Local performing arts festival strives for greater audience accessibility ,"Organizers of the PuSh International Performing Arts Festival will offer a host of accessibility-related resources and initiatives to ensure people with special needs can still enjoy the performing arts.Â  ""It basicallyÂ means that we try to take away some barriers,"" Anika Vervecken, PuSh's accessibility co-ordinator, told Stephen Quinn, the host of CBC's The Early Edition.Â  The theatre, music and multimedia festival kicked off it's 16th year on Jan. 21. Performances will run until Feb. 9.Â  For deaf audience members, certain performances will feature ASL-interpretation, captions and so-called surtitles. For blind attendees, the festival has worked with VocalEye, a Canadian live descriptive arts service, to develop audio descriptions of some visual-heavy shows. Can You See Us Vancouver? Art exhibition presented for people using wheelchairs And then there are ""Relaxed Performances"" intended to cater to the needs of people who might not feel comfortable at a typical theatre or visual performance.Â  For instance, some Relaxed Performances will take place with the house lights on to accommodate those who become distressed by sitting in the dark. Other times, artists may be asked to exclude extreme visual simulation, like strobe lights, that could disturb audience members who suffer from sensory sensitivities.Â  In some cases, Relaxed Performances may even include spoilers. ""For somebody with autism, just the experience of going into a new space can be so overwhelming,"" said Vervecken. ""So, we actually give them a visual story that says everything that's going to happen."" Vancouver passes a culture plan for the next decade â€” with no major increase in funding People living with Tourette's and verbal tics or folks who struggle to sit still and would prefer not to stay in their chairs are all welcome, added Vervecken.Â  ""That's all OK,"" she said. ""I always say the only thing that's not allowed in a Relaxed Performance is shushing. If you want to do that, then please come to an 'uptight performance.'"" According to the festival, some of the most accessible performances this year include FRONTERA, Cuckoo and Old Stock: A Refugee Love Story. PuSh Festival is not the first Vancouver performing arts group to promote greater audience accessibility. The Cultch, Bard on the Beach and the Arts Club Theatre Company have all featured VocalEye, Relaxed Performances and other resources. But how do the artists feel about adjusting their work or accommodating what would typically be seen as unwanted audience disruptions? Vervecken said the response has been positive. Â ""One of the shifts that I'm seeing that I'm really happy about is that people are starting to consider [accessibility] earlier and earlier in their process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/push-festival-2020-accessibility-1.5435508,[],N/A337,Sara Fraser,2020-01-18T12:00:00.708Z,8 reasons to try cross-country skiing this winter,"Now that there's plenty of snow on the ground, P.E.I. is looking like a winter wonderland â€” perfect for making tracks with cross-country skis.Â  Whether you prefer to head out on ungroomed areas, or enjoy a machine-groomed track, there are plenty of places to ski on P.E.I.Â  CBC asked a couple of seasoned skiers why it's their absolute favourite thing to do in winter, and how it can benefit just about anyone.Â  Strap on your own skis and blaze your own trail through the snow. It's best, when possible, to ask property owners if it's OK to use their property. Or, several places across P.E.I. offer groomed trails for free or for a fee.Â  Mark Arendz Provincial Ski Park at Brookvale has 24.5 kilometres of groomed recreational trails, 7.5 kilometres of competitive trails and a biathlon trail, plus ski rentals. The recreational trails are for all skill levels through beautiful countryside, and there is a nordic lodge to change.Â  The non-profit Souris Striders Ski Club on the Souris Line Road inÂ Souris may be P.E.I.'s best-keptÂ secret, with 21 kilometres of scenic groomed trails on 40 hectares of land â€” three kilometres of the trails are lit until 10 p.m. every night â€” and a lodge for changing and rentals. There are four trails: groomed, classic, skate, and snowshoe.Â  In Summerside, Heather Moyse Park and Rotary Friendship Park both have trails groomed for free cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Charlottetown maintains groomed ski trails at Victoria Park and Belvedere Golf Course for free public use. Ski trail maps are available at the parks and recreation department at city hall. And Mill River Resort at Mill River in western P.E.I. has three trails including more than eightÂ kilometres of groomed trails and ski rentals, and one of the trails is lit until 9 p.m.Â  Cross-country skiing puts you on a trail through nature. You could see birds, bunnies, foxes and more as you whoosh quietly through the woods and fields.Â  ""It's a great way to just detach from the world and kind of recharge,"" saidÂ Sarah Flynn, the event co-ordinator for the Souris Striders. She said on an outing last week she was struck by the peaceful beauty of ""trees and beautiful white snow and birds chirping, woodpeckers pecking on trees â€” it was just lovely.""Â  ""The air is so crisp and clean,"" saidÂ Albert Flavell, 50, an avid cross-country skier and fatbikerÂ from Summerside. He's also in charge of grooming trails in the parks in Summerside.Â  Even on stormy days, wooded trails can be quiet and peaceful, he said.Â  ""Whether it's the birds or the squirrels or just the smell of the spruce, it's a great place to be,"" Flavell said. ""Being outside definitely plays a huge role in my mental health, for sure."" ""It's an excellent workout,"" saidÂ Flynn. ""Cross-country skiers actually have some of the higher levels of physical fitness, and it's a great way to improve your cardiovascular health.""Â  Flavell straps on his skis three or four times a week.Â  ""If you want to push the pace, you can really get your heart rate up and have a great workout,"" he said. For a tougher workout, he hits the competitive trails at Brookvale (it also has easy and intermediate trails). Those looking for a flat, easy trail can try Rotary Friendship Park in Summerside, he suggests.Â  Skiing can be a mild orÂ strenuous workout, depending on the pace the skier wants to set.Â  If you enjoy speed, skate-skiing rather than the classic old-school in-track skiing can be quite fast and exhilarating, Flavell said. Â  Flynn and Flavell said cross-country skiing can be a very social activity. Even if you arrive alone, you can find others on the trail to have a chat if you like.Â  The Souris club is starting a new night-skiing activity TuesdaysÂ from 7 to 8, and everyone is welcome.Â  ""Sometimes people don't have time during the daylight hours to go but they want to go in the evenings, but it's a little bit scary to go in the dark,"" saidÂ Flynn. They'll use the club's three kilometres of lighted trails. Flavell enjoys going with a group of skiers, who often strap on headlights at night for a moonlight ski and share potluck snacks.Â  Because cross-country skiing is for all abilities and fitness levels, it can be great for families of all ages.Â  ""My mum starting taking me out when I was about five years old and we're still skiing together in the evenings, and this is 20 years later,"" saidÂ Flynn. ""It's a great way to bond with your children and teach them something new and teach them how to take care of their bodies."" A day pass for the Souris Striders trails is $5, or pay $10 for a year-round pass. Rentals are $5Â per day, and there are plenty. Organizers said they only run out of skis one day a year: Islander Day, which this year falls on Feb. 17.Â The club keeps the fees low by fundraising. Mill River's fees start at $5 for a day pass to $35 for a family day pass with rentals, and season passes for trail use starting at $50 for students/seniors to $125 for a family.Â  The trails in Charlottetown and Summerside are free to the public. Tickets to use the trail at Brookvale are $10 to $12.50 for a day pass, or $98 to $126.50 for a season pass. Rentals are available from $9 to $14 per day.Â  ""For the enjoyment you get, it's pretty cheap,"" said Flavell. ""It definitely is a cheap sport.""Â  To purchase a good entry-level ski package of bindings, boots and poles should start at about $200, while a high-end carbon set can run to several thousand dollars, said Flavell â€” but either could last you a lifetime with only minor maintenance.Â  Cross-country skiing is probably one of the safer winter sports, saidÂ Flynn, compared to alpine skiing or hockey.Â  Flavell said he used to be a runner, but saidÂ skiing is much easier on his joints, so he is less prone to injury.Â  Cross-country skiing can change your mind from hating winter to looking forward to seeing the snow coming down steadily, asserts Flynn. ""I know a lot of people struggle with how long the winters can seem or how cold and frigid they are,"" Flynn said.Â  ""It's different when you have something you enjoy ... it makes the winters go by so much faster, it actually feels short because it's just so much fun to get out there!""Â  Looking for more information? There's a Facebook group called P.E.I. XC SKI where cross-country skiers on P.E.I. share information on trail conditions, plan socials, advertise skiing lessons and more.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cross-country-skiing-benefits-1.5424928,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outdoor-rinks-1.5424651 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-7-tips-for-winter-blues-1.4973390 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/outdoor-exercise-mental-physical-benefits-1.4958302 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-winter-fun-1.5009455 https://www.cbc.ca/life/culture/how-to-build-your-own-backyard-skating-rink-1.5421107 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-kensington-snowmobile-1.5422883,N/A338,Keith Boag,2020-01-22T10:34:41.585Z,Trump's defenders emboldened by their certainty of a win: Keith Boag,"""Why should this trial be different than any other trial?"" asked U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff as he opened the Democrats' case for convicting the president and removing him from office. ""The short answer is, it shouldn't."" But of course Schiff knows that politics assures the impeachment trial will be different, and in the most important ways. The Republican Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, drafted rules for the trial that allowed the possibility there might be no witnesses heard and no evidence presented even from the House investigation that produced the articles of impeachment that form the basis for the prosecution.Â  Watch: Rep. Adam SchiffÂ makes his argument against the proposed trial rules On Tuesday, on the first day of the trial, Republicans rejected three Democratic efforts to obtain documents and evidence.Â  A trial without witnesses and evidence is not a trial, the Democrats complain â€” a seemingly compelling argument on the face of it. But the Senate is not a courtroom, and McConnell is proud to say the majority of his ""jurors"" are in lockstep with the White House to assure an acquittal. And that's the crucial distinction between any other trial and the Senate's trial of Donald Trump. The verdict is effectively already in: Democrats need 67 votes to convict and they don't have them â€” they're 20 short. Republicans believe they can't lose. So the battle over the rules governing evidence, witnesses and so on isn't really about the case Republicans and Democrats can make to the Senate so much as it's about the case they can make to the TV viewing audience.Â  That's a battle about whether the public will perceive the seemingly inevitable acquittal of Trump as justice or a sham. It's about what Americans are allowed to see and to hear to help them make up their own minds about whether to remove the president from office when they have that chance in November's election. With no easily imagined way to lose the case, Trump's defenders seem emboldened to embrace some brazen tactics, like using the platform of the trial to spread demonstrably false, easily discredited claims. ""The president has done nothing wrong,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone assured everyone in his opening statement for the president's defence Tuesday. ""There is absolutely no case,"" he said. That's certainly the president's position. But Cipollone knows that it's officially untrue that the president did nothing wrong.Â  A report last week from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan congressional watchdog, said the president flat out broke the law. It said he violated the Impoundment Control Act when he directed a freeze on nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved â€” the exact thing at the very heart of the impeachment case. Cipillone also repeated a false characterization of the House intelligence committee's investigation of Trump when he said Democrats held secret meetings in a basement office on Capitol Hill.Â  It's true neither the public nor the media were invited to those meetings, but that hardly makes them secret. Some 48 Republican members of Congress had access to the meetings and were allowed to ask questions, nine of them sitting on the committee itself. The testimony and evidence they all saw and heard â€” the Republicans included â€” they all kept secret, as they are routinely required to do in those circumstances. There was one truly secret detail about the House investigation: The ranking Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, was apparently personally involved in the Ukraine scandal and didn't tell anybody. It seems he and a member of his staff were secretly active players in what Nunes nevertheless publicly dismissed as nothing but a ""hoax"" while he sat on the committee hearings about it.Â  That inconvenient little bombshell was alleged by Lev Parnas, a small-time operator and indicted (for campaign finance schemes) former associate of the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Parnas unexpectedly started blabbing to the media in lengthy interviews last week, and he had a lot to say. If the Trump team hadn't been so sure that the Senate trial was a lock, they might have worked harder to get to the bottom of the story so they'd be better prepared to contain the blast when the former Giuliani conniver turned against them.Â  Parnas â€” until recently a supporter of TrumpÂ â€” described a broad conspiracy to lean on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and extort political favours from him to help re-elect Trump in November. He tied the conspiracy directly to Trump, Attorney General William Barr, and Nunes, among others, and he produced documentary evidence.Â  Both the president and Nunes have said they hardly know Parnas. But photographs of Parnas with the president, and the fact Parnas seems to have Nunes's cellphone number, argue otherwise. The White House brushed it all asideÂ with a comment about Parnas's criminal indictment and a suggestion he can't be trusted to tell the truth. But this is the risk of Trump, and Republicans have known it since the beginning: They have no idea from one day to the next what they might be called upon to defend.Â  Â  Now, and with the spotlight on them, there really is no telling what they might be asked to swallow in this unique trial that Trump and his team believe they can't possibly lose, no matter the evidence.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-clinton-impeachments-1.5397458 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A339,Katie Toth,2020-01-20T23:00:51.099Z,Workshop to train N.W.T. health-care workers about vaccine-hesitant parents,"In the midst of a whooping cough outbreak in the Northwest Territories, theÂ territory's chief public health officer is addressing one factor in the spread of the disease: families who hesitate to vaccinate their children.Â  On Wednesday, chief public health officer Kami KandolaÂ said there were 20 lab-confirmed cases of whooping cough, also called pertussis, in Yellowknife, Behchoko and Whati. Four other people are believed to have the infection based on a mix of symptoms and epidemiological links. Eleven of the 24 people who got whooping cough were unvaccinated, according to the territorial health department. In a press conference on Thursday, Kandola said this was partially because of ""vaccine-hesitant parents, absolutely."" Canada sets targets for ideal vaccine uptake, Kandola toldÂ CBCÂ News on Monday. For the vaccine that responds to pertussis, Canada has a target of 95 per cent uptake. But in the Northwest Territories, as of 2017, only 80 per cent of two year oldsÂ had received the vaccine. ""We are below the target, and I'm hoping that with ... spreading the word we can get more and more parents to make sure that the children are up-to-date on their vaccines,"" said Kandola. Kandola was speaking outside a workshop that was organized months before the pertussis outbreak. The Canadian Pediatric Society was training front-line health workers on how to deal with parental hesitancy to vaccines.Â According to the the Northwest Territories' health department,Â 52 people in the N.W.T. and Yukon took part in the workshop.Â  Dr. Sam Wong, the president-elect of the Canadian Pediatric Society, chairedÂ the event. He has a message for front-line workers who deal with vaccine hesitancy: keep the lines of communication open and stay patient. Wong, who also works as a consulting pediatrician in the Northwest Territories, says it's important for health care providers to listen to parents' questions and concerns so they can offer evidence-based answers.Â  ""We always hear about the 'anti-vaccine people,'"" Wong said to CBCÂ News, adding it's much more common for parents to be unsure about vaccines than opposed outright. ""If their concerns are addressed thenÂ they may actually be interested in actually having their child vaccinated.Â  ""Sometimes it takes a little bit of communication to find out what the concerns are."" Wong says there have been times where he had three or four conversations and doctor's visits before a parent became interested in immunizing their child against diseases like pertussis or measles, mumps and rubella.Â  The Canadian Pediatric Society suggests providers ask patients and their parents about what the fears are so they can be addressed, and focus on the issues on the parents' minds. For example, if pain is the concern, Wong would let a parent know babies under three months â€”Â who haven't yet experienced the world of solid food â€”Â can be distracted from it with a few drops of sugar water. ""Babies are not exposed to a lot of flavours ... it's kind of mind blowing for their taste buds. They're like, 'Whoa,Â what is this that's in my mouth?' They don't actually feel the pain."" Hesitancy to vaccines is not the only reason people fall behindÂ on their shots.Â SometimesÂ other commitments result in families postponingÂ immunization appointments.Â  Kandola also wants people to stay on top of any booster shots they may need.Â In the case ofÂ thisÂ pertussisÂ outbreak,Â five of the people who contracted whooping cough had been vaccinated in the past, but didn't have their shots up to date.Â Some vaccines require multiple doses to remain robust, and no vaccine is 100 per cent effective.Â  She says even families who are vaccinated should call their public health office if they have pertussis-like symptoms.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nwt-vaccine-hesitation-workshop-1.5433106,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/marketplace-cheat-sheet-1.5431394 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/whooping-cough-pertussis-nwt-confirmed-1.5396024,N/A340,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old startedÂ Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago andÂ since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, coveringÂ a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.Â  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.Â  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When BurkeÂ was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died asÂ the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaningÂ off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into theÂ driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. HeÂ was a mess and heÂ got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.Â  ""Like 'How can I help?Â How can I move this forward?Â Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke â€” no relation to Matt â€”Â was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years,Â from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.Â  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his lifeÂ and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month agoÂ and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.Â  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing onÂ the podcastÂ was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example â€”Â that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died MattÂ was inÂ shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said.Â ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does,Â is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at aÂ time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said.Â ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person,Â ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recentÂ guestÂ on the podcast. McPhee said listening toÂ MattÂ and hisÂ guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence toÂ take his turn at the microphone. When McPheeÂ was younger heÂ struggledÂ with his mental health,Â and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they canÂ be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizingÂ a traumatic story, toÂ ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listenersÂ walk away with is thatÂ mental health issuesÂ are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, MattÂ does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

Here are some scenes, below, of conditions in the provincial capital, where Mayor Danny BreenÂ said businesses wereÂ to remain closed on Saturday and all vehicles are prohibited from using city streets, except emergency vehicles. Snow wasÂ piled high over and around vehicles in the city's Battery neighbourhood. Even those who managed to leave their homes had no way of travelling far. At the peak of the storm on Friday,Â even snowplows were halted due to near-zero visibility. This dog had to navigate around growing snowdrifts. Snow surrounded the entrance to thisÂ basement apartment in theÂ Airport Heights neighbourhood. Here's aÂ doorway that wasÂ previously blockedÂ due to snow and high winds that hitÂ 157 km/h at the storm's peak. Some ventured out on Saturday to carveÂ pathways around homes in the city.Â  TheÂ door of this shed blew open in theÂ KibrideÂ neighbourhood of St. John's.Â  Blizzards are common in Newfoundland, but this storm was set apart by very strong winds and for breaking aÂ single-day snowfall record, which was set in 1999. Despite a state of emergency in St. John's that ordered business to close, people were seen lining up outside Walsh's Store on St. Clare Avenue on Saturday evening. The queues continued on Sunday. The state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's left many businesses closed â€” with the exception of pharmacies and service stations that provide fuel for snow removal. Snow removal efforts ramped up on Sunday. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan said up to 300Â Canadian Armed Forces membersÂ are on their way. But it wasn't all work in the capital. While the city pleaded for everyone to stay off the streets, someÂ snowboarders found the fresh powder irresistible. There was also a new arrival at the height of the blizzard on FridayÂ â€” an aptly named one too.Â Levi Jacob Snow was born at the Health Sciences Centre; his father, Kyle Snow, posted a photo on a local storm information page asking for help shovelling out their home, and people answered the call.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-blizzard-photos-1.5432138,[],N/A343,Doug Harrison,2020-01-21T20:57:33.186Z,"Canada's Rachel Cliff proud of consistency after half marathon, marathon records fall","Rachel Cliff could have relaxed Monday, dwelled on a race she didn't win and questioned why she's no longer the Canadian-record holder for women in the half marathon and marathon. Instead, the determined distance runner happily boarded a plane to attend a second altitude training camp in two months in Flagstaff, Ariz., as part of her 2020 Olympic pursuit. ""I'm excited. I was also here for six weeks in November and December,"" Cliff told CBC Sports. ""It's been nice to have the opportunity to utilize altitude training."" The 31-year-old raced in Houston on Sunday and in a matter of hours watched fellow Vancouver resident Natasha Wodak and Malindi Elmore of Kelowna, B.C., break her national records. Wodak, 38, crossed the finish line in one hour nine minutes 41 seconds to become the first Canadian woman to eclipse the 70-minute mark for the half marathon. Last month, Cliff clocked 1:10:06 at theÂ Sanyo Ladies' Half-Marathon in Okayama, Japan, beating her previous record of 1:10:08 she achieved in March 2018Â in Woodlands, Texas. While it wasn't the breakthrough performance Cliff was hoping for, she and her coach were impressed by a fourth consistent half marathon in two years after clocking 1:10:08, 1:10:28 and 1:10:06. ""Usually, that [type of range] is a good sign that an athlete is ready to jump to a new level,"" Richard Lee of BC Endurance Project said. ""Hopefully the results by others [on the weekend] will be a wake-up call [for Cliff] and three to four weeks at altitude will get her over the hump."" Wodak is confident Cliff isn't finished setting records in the half marathon and marathon. ""Rachel was so kind and gracious after [the race],"" Wodak told Postmedia. ""It was a tough day for her, to see both of her records be broken. We had lunch after. She's handling it very well."" Wodak is coming off a sensational 2019, winning the Canadian 10K and 10,000-metre championships along with a Pan Am gold medal at Peru in August and running a 5K PB of 15:36 on March 16, 2019 in Vancouver. She's also a threat on the track in the 10,000 after finishing ninth in her Commonwealth Games debut in April 2018 and posting a 31:54.88 PB at the Payton Jordan Invitation last May in Palo Alto, Calif. Cliff later earned Pan Am bronze in the 10,000 and failed to qualify for the 5,000 final at the world championships in Doha, Qatar, as a late addition to Team Canada. Elmore all but booked her spot on the 2020 Canadian Olympic squad by running 2:24:50 on Sunday, a full two minutes faster than Cliff's record. Not bad for the former 1,500 runner, 2004 Olympian and triathlete who debuted in the marathon a year ago at the same Houston race in a time of 2:32.15. ""Malindi's story and athletic background is truly inspirational,"" Cliff said. ""She's always been an athlete I look up to and someone who's very kind and supportive towards other Canadian runners. ""It's really exciting to see Canadian running moving forward at such a fast rate. We had some strong performances on the men's side as well.""

The theft occurredÂ after Anne Hoover of Peterborough, Ont.,Â e-transferred moneyÂ from her RBC account to her friendÂ Fran Fearnley, only to have a fraudster intercept the transaction and divert the money to his own account at another bank. ""I always use e-transfer,"" saysÂ Hoover. ""I thought it was a safe way to send money."" An RBCÂ manager saysÂ an internal investigation indicated that Fearnley's email account had been hacked, andÂ when Hoover sent the e-transfer, the fraudsterÂ figured out the answer for the security question necessary to deposit the money, and then redirected it to a different bank account. An expert in online privacy protection and security says financial institutions have opted for convenience over security, which makes strong email passwords and equally strong e-transfer questions and passwords essential. ""How you manage those passwords is very important,"" says Claudiu Popa, author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook and a cybersecurity expert who advises government and companies. ""Banks and financial institutions have made it very easy to transfer money via email. Unfortunately, with convenienceÂ comes lack of security."" Hoover andÂ Fearnley had just returned from a trip to Mexico on March 18, when Hoover went online and used her bank's Interac e-transfer system to reimburse her palÂ for trip expenses. But when Fearnley opened the email and tried to accept the payment, she got a message saying the e-transfer had already been deposited. The women called RBC's fraud department and a bank employee provided the name of the fraudster, his email, and saidÂ he'd transferred the money to aÂ TD Bank account. ""This is clearly a complete stranger,"" saysÂ Fearnley. ""How could that possibly have happened?"" The two friends headed to their local RBC branch, where they are both customers â€”Â Hoover, for more than 30 years. The bank blamedÂ the theft onÂ Fearnley's email security. Hoover's security question to her friend was:Â ""Who is my favourite Beatle?"" TheÂ fraudsterÂ would have had a one in four chance of getting it right â€” John, Paul, George or Ringo.Â In a test of RBC's Interac system, Go Public was givenÂ four chances to answer the security question correctly. ""The manager continued to insist ... that it wasn't really their problem. It was now our problem,"" Hoover says. Eventually, the manager offered Hoover half the missing fundsÂ as a ""gesture of goodwill."" Hoover filed a reportÂ with PeterboroughÂ police, butÂ an officer told her that it's difficult to clamp down on online fraudÂ and her fight to recoup the money could take ages and would likely be fruitless. Hoover says she feels misled by the bank's website. A webpage about RBC's digital security tells customers they're ""fully protected"" and will be reimbursed ""for any unauthorized transactions."" But when Hoover pointed that out to bank officials, she was told customers aren't protected if they use weak passwords when transferring funds online. RBC declined an interview request from Go Public. In aÂ statement, AJÂ Goodman, RBC's director of external communications, wrote:Â ""As part of our electronic access agreement, clients commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" That information is on the bank's website, but only if a customer reading RBC's ""Security Guarantee"" clicks on a few different links to get to a clauseÂ in the fine print of a section called ""Security."" Interac makes the same security promises online as RBC, telling customers in bold print that they are ""protected from fraud losses."" No one from Interac would agree to an interview with Go Public, directing questions to RBC. In a statement, the company's senior manager of external communications, Adrienne Vaughan, wrote that Canadians must ""protect their email and passwords so they do not fall victim to cybercrime and they can safely transact online."" In another, similar case, Dr. Sylvia Veith of Prince Albert, Sask.,Â lost $7,000 when she used Interac to e-transfer money to her son's hockey league in June 2017. That money was interceptedÂ and her bank â€”Â RBC â€”Â blamed a weak password to aÂ security questionÂ and told theÂ physician there was nothing that could be done. RBC would not comment on Veith's case, except to reiterate the importance ofÂ strong passwords. Police sayÂ an investigation is ongoing. ""This idea of transferring money by email is much more risky than people realize,"" saysÂ Popa. ""Companies don't report [incidents] because they don't want an investigation from the privacy commissioner, from other regulatory bodies."" Popa says people have been desensitized to the risk of email transfers ""very quickly, almost too quickly"" because they use email all the time, so they figure it's safe. What banks and other financial institutions have done, he says, is sacrifice security to get a high number of people using the system. Last year in Canada, there were more than 371 million e-transfersÂ worth more than $132 billion,Â according to Interac Corp., the biggest online funds transfer service in the country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud CentreÂ told Go Public that it received 163 reports in 2018 involving e-transfers that were compromised, resulting in money being transferred to fraudsters. Popa did a quick search of Fearnley's email on www.haveibeenpwned.com, a website that tracks data breaches and reports almost eight billion occasions when personal accountsÂ haveÂ been exposed. The same email address could be acquired from several different sources. PopaÂ found her email was compromised on two sitesÂ when hackers attacked LinkedIn and Verification.io ""That means people have found those e-mail lists. They have sold them to others,"" saysÂ Popa. ""Different people have taken what they've needed from those lists, and that's how they got compromised, very likely."" The cybersecurity expert says financial institutions and Interac need to require something called ""two-factor authentication"" to better protect people's accounts. ""Every time you log into an account you need to use a second factor,"" explains Popa. ""A code that arrives as a text message or as a separate email to a different email addressÂ that is only valid for a few seconds or a few minutes after it's received."" He says the financial industry knows more security is needed, but is more concerned about getting customers to use the e-transfer system. Some financial institutions offer two-factor authentication as an option, not a requirement. Go Public asked RBC and Interac why they don't require two-factor authentication. Both declined to address the question. Hoover says she's learned the hard way that strong security questions and passwords are crucial. She's escalating her case to the RBC Ombudsman,Â hoping to prompt the bank to better warn customers they could be liable for losses even if they're victims of fraud. She's also closing her business account at RBC, after decades of loyalty. ""How can I feel confident [in RBC]Â when, in fact, I've had money stolen from me â€”Â clearly stolen,"" saysÂ Hoover. ""This isn't secure, and people need to know."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

British tabloid outlets have reported that Trudeau has agreed already that Canada would pay for the couple's security. The London-based Evening Standard reported that Trudeau has ""privately assured the Queen"" that Canada would shoulder the costs of protecting Harry and Meghan. However, Trudeau said Tuesday the Canadian government has not yet brokered such a deal. ""I have not spoken to Her Majesty directly. Discussions continue to be ongoing and I have no updates at this moment,"" Trudeau said. Speaking at the federal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg today, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair saidÂ the government has not yet conducted a security ""assessment"" to learn what might be required to protect the two while they're living in Canada. He said Harry and Meghan are not receiving protection from Canadian security personnel. Canada is not paying for the guards spotted alongside the twoÂ in B.C., Blair said. The Daily Mail, citing unnamed security sources, reported Tuesday that Meghan is being protected by officers from the LondonÂ Metropolitan Police with support from theÂ RCMP. But Blair, the minister responsible for the RCMP,Â said that ""right now,"" RCMP officersÂ ""are not engaged in providing those security services."" Under Canadian law, foreign security officersÂ protecting dignitaries are forbidden from bringing firearms into the country without the ""express written authorization"" of the RCMP. A spokesperson for the RCMP said the national police force would not comment on the security arrangements. Blair said certain individuals, such as heads of state and royal family members, are considered ""internationally protected persons (IPP)"" under the UNÂ Protection of Diplomats Convention, which obliges Canada to provide a certain level of security. The definition of an IPP, according toÂ the Criminal Code,Â is limited to the Queen and other members of the Royal Family who ""[accompany] that person in a state other than the state in which that person holds that position or office."" But because Harry and Meghan essentially have renounced their royal titles, Blair said their status is in question. ""Their position as internationally protected persons has therefore changed. There is an assessmentÂ done by our officials who have a responsibility to maintain safety for people who are vulnerable within our society. And so, that work is ongoing but that has not yet been resolved,"" Blair told reporters Tuesday. Harry was reunited with his wife and his sonÂ Archie in B.C. overnightÂ after nearly two weeks apart. Harry negotiated a separation agreement of sorts with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William last week, an agreement that included a promise to give up most of the trappings of royal life in exchange for Buckingham Palace's permission to live most of the time in Canada. During a Saturday speech, Harry said it was with ""great sadness"" that the two were separating themselves from the Royal Family and its home baseÂ in the U.K. He said he andÂ MeghanÂ had ""no other option""Â but to cutÂ ties in the hopes of achieving a more peaceful life. The prince, who has agreed to stop using the His Royal HighnessÂ title, flew on a commercial airline to Canada accompanied by protection officers. Photographers captured Harry leaving a WestJet aircraft on the tarmac of Victoria International Airport. The couple have agreed to stop receiving British taxpayer funds â€” money allocated to the couple through the Sovereign Grant â€”Â but the question of who will pay for their security remains unresolved. The estimated price tag forÂ that sort of security varies widely, with some experts pegging the cost at $1.7 million a year and others suggesting it could be many times that amount. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has circulated a petition demanding Ottawa refuse allÂ requests for public funds to support Harry and Meghan while they're in Canada. The petition has been signed by 80,000 people in less than a week, according the federation, a lobbyÂ group that calls for lower taxes and smaller government. ""Canadians are pleased to welcome the Duke and Duchess to Canada â€” but have made it crystal clear that taxpayers should not be forced to support them while they are living here,"" said Aaron Wudrick, the group's federal director. ""All Canadians wish them well as they realize their ambition of financial independence."" The paparazzi have been a source of some frustration for the couple. Meghan has been photographed almost constantly on Vancouver Island since her arrival there following the initial bombshell announcement earlier this month that she and HarryÂ were moving to Canada. Meghan was photographed carrying baby Archie while walking two dogs in a Victoria-area park. Sky News, a British broadcasting outlet, reported Tuesday that lawyers for the couple have issued warnings to would-be paparazzi. Lawyers have said photographs of Meghan, published in British outlets like the Daily Mail and the Sun, were taken without her consent. The lawyers alleged the photographers have used long-range lenses to take pictures of Meghan inside her home, a $14-million mansion located just north of Victoria. Photographers have set up a camp of sorts near the driveway of the mansion.

The Municipality of the District of Argyle, which includes communities such asÂ Pubnico, Tusket and Wedgeport, has identifiedÂ 19 ocean sites it hopes toÂ lease toÂ companies interested in farming oysters. This ""business park on the sea"" is one of the first aquaculture developments of itsÂ kind in Canada, according to the municipality.Â  ""There's a large body of water that is quite warm and oysters grow there naturally,"" Charlene LeBlanc, the municipality's community development officer, told CBC's Information Morning. AÂ handful of farms have operated in the waters off theÂ Municipality of the District of ArgyleÂ for about 20 years, but LeBlanc said it's not easy to get the necessary permits. ""There's a lot of red tape into getting a lease, so we thought that we'd make it easier for investors to get into business for the shellfish,"" LeBlanc said. As part of that, the municipalityÂ has gatheredÂ oceanographic data on currents and tides, as well as biophysical data. ""We've been doing the legwork making it to able to get to lease a lot faster,"" she said. In 2017, the Municipality of the District of Argyle received provincial funding and started working with the province to testÂ water quality at several sites. ""What we need to grow oysters is good pH, nice warm temperature, which we have, salinity and phytoplankton. And it's the perfect recipe in our waters,"" LeBlanc said. She said municipal staff also needed to make sureÂ the currents were ideal andÂ the sitesÂ didn't impedeÂ the view of homeowners or getÂ in the way of lobster fishermen. BecauseÂ oysters are suspended in the water in black mesh bags, they canÂ cast a shadow on species below, including eelgrass. ""We certainly are not going to pick any sites that are going to be on top of eelgrass,"" LeBlanc said. Sarah Stewart-Clark, an associate professor of shellfish biology at Dalhousie University, said determining where to set up a farm has a lot to do with how much phytoplanktonÂ is there for the oystersÂ to eat. ""You would never take the entire surface of a bay and float oyster cages in it,"" she said. ""It''sÂ always in mind, how do we farm these filter feeders in a way that's not going to harm the environment?"" Stewart-Clark said oyster farming doesn't share the same reputation as open-pen salmon farms, which have been criticized for their use of pesticides, antibiotics and the waste that's produced. She said when the oysters eat tiny phytoplankton, theyÂ also filter the water. ""The farmers are simply adding oysters to the estuary,"" Stewart-Clark said. ""All of the food, all of the oxygen, everything that's required for the oysters to grow, comes from the natural ecosystem."" Nova Scotia can't keep up with the demand for oysters, she said. ""Sometimes on an oyster farm, oysters that are two years away from maturityÂ are already sold, so the market is there,"" she said. The province produces aboutÂ $3 million worth of farmed oysters a year, according to Stewart-Clark, while Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick produce $13 million and $12 million, respectively. ""We really play up our seafood productionÂ and when it comes to shellfish, we're not keeping up with the other Maritime provinces,"" she said.

This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questionsÂ about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy â€” conditions thatÂ are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.Â  Forecast:Â No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains.Â U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.Â Â  Forecast:Â Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019.Â Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend toÂ be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared â€” markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.Â  Forecast:Â Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities. Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring,Â I believe that other international factors such asÂ U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a goodÂ time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments thatÂ are more defensive.Â As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.Â  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio.Â Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions. Forecast:Â Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets.

Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring,Â I believe that other international factors such asÂ U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a goodÂ time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments thatÂ are more defensive.Â As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.Â  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio.Â Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions. Forecast:Â Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets. Overall, I'm expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and I believe that stocks will outperform bonds. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

Trump, marking his second meeting of global political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum (WEF), also told a packed auditorium that trade deals struck this month with China and Mexico represented a model for the 21st Century. ""The Fed raised rates too quickly and has lowered them too slowly,"" Trump said, taking aim at the central bank's policy decisions. In a wide-ranging address pitched to appeal to the Davos crowd, touting the achievements of his administration despite his unorthodox approach, Trump picked up on some of the themes he voiced when he first addressed the WEF two years ago. He thanked overseas companies for investing in America and said the U.S. was on far better economic standing than he had imagined when he took office three years ago. WATCH:Â Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg offer differing views on climate at Davos ""The time for skepticism is over,"" Trump said as he invited more foreign money. ""To every business looking for a place to succeed...there is no better place than the U.S.,"" he added. At a conference in which the main theme is the environment, and in which climate activist Greta Thunberg is a star guest, Trump spoke about the economic importance of oil and gas. Thunberg was in the audience throughout Trump's speech. As she walked out, flanked by security and chased by cameras, she did not speak to reporters, but looked down. Trump said the U.S. would join the one trillion tree initiative being launched at the WEF annual meeting, but called activists ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers."" ""I'm a very big believer in the environment. I want the cleanest water and the cleanest air,"" he added. ThunbergÂ later responded by referring to ""empty words and promises"" by world leaders. ""You say children shouldn't worry... don't be so pessimistic and then, nothing, silence."" Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz said the strongest thing about Trump's speech was that it was scheduled between sessions on climate change. He criticized Trump's swipe at climate pessimists. ""As if what we are seeing with our eyes are not there,"" Stiglitz said. ""It's astounding."" In Washington, the impeachment trial begins in earnest in the U.S. Senate after the Republican president was formally charged by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives in December with ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" Trump, who is expected to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, says he is innocent of the charges. Thunberg doubled down on her criticism that world and business leaders aren't taking the threat of climate change seriously. She dismissed some of the measures bandied about by governments and companies, such as setting long-term targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and planting billions of new trees to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. She told a panel of the WEF thatÂ ""planting trees is good of course but it's nowhere near enough."" ""It cannot replace mitigation,"" she said, referring to efforts to drastically cut emissions in the near term. Thunberg accused leaders of ""cheating and fiddling around with numbers"" by talking about cutting emissions to 'net zero' â€” emitting no more carbon than is absorbed by the planet or technical means â€” by 2050. Responding to those who have accused her of doom-mongering, Thunberg said her message was simply based on scientific facts, not irrational fears. ""My generation will not give up without a fight,"" she said. Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told reporters at the WEF on Tuesday that the world needs to prepare for potentially millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change. His comments came after theÂ UNÂ Human Rights Committee (UNHCR) made a landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, including in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate, meaning richer countries may become a rising source of refugees. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Pope Francis also hadÂ a message for the high-powered participants at the economic forum in Davos: people, not profit, must be at the core of public policy. Francis issued written greetings to remind delegates of the ""moral obligation"" to place ""the human person, rather than the mere pursuit of power or profit, at the very centreÂ of public policy."" He says the forum provides an arena where ""political will and mutual cooperation can be guided and strengthened in overcoming the isolationism, individualism and ideological colonization that sadly characterizes too much contemporary debate."" Francis is also encouraging the forum's deliberations to boost solidarity with those suffering ""social and economic injustice and whose very existence is even threatened."" A Vatican cardinal is representing the pope at the gathering, which started Tuesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-davos-investment-impeachment-1.5434306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-senate-impeachment-trial-1.5434264 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/oil-and-gas-industry-climate-change-international-energy-agency-1.5433475 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/rich-poor-oxfam-report-divide-1.5432930,N/A350,Laurie Fagan,2020-01-22T09:00:00.994Z,CHEO bursting at the seams,"Ottawa's children's hospital, CHEO, operated over capacityÂ two out of every three days during the first half of 2019, more than than any other acute-care hospital in the city.Â Â  ThatÂ startling statistic comes from data obtained from Ontario's Ministry of Health through an access to information request by CBC. From January to June, CHEOÂ took in more patients than it had room for on 121 of 181 days, or 66 per cent of the time. On seven of those days, the children's hospital was operating at over 120 per cent capacity. By comparison, Toronto's Sick Kids was only over capacity 41 days during the first six months of the year. The data comes as the provincial government promisesÂ health reforms it vows will put an end toÂ ""hallway medicine""Â â€”Â when hospitals become so crowded patients have to be assessed and treated in corridors because there are no beds. Dr. Lindy Samson, chief of staff at CHEO, said the reasons are many: a busy flu season, a growing population and the hospital's status as the only one in the region dedicated to children. ""When you're the only facility, it really impacts us significantly,"" she said. An increase in the number of young people seeking care for mental health issues also put a strain on the hospital's emergency department, Samson said. The pressure on the hospital's pediatric intensive care unit is hitting some of the hospital's sickest children especially hard, Samson said. ""When those most critically ill children need care and if it's full, weÂ have no choice but to send them out of the region,"" she said. ""It's the solution of last resort."" Elective surgeries â€” everything from tonsillectomies to spinal and even heart surgeries â€” are also being postponed as a result of the overcrowding. ""These aren't just things that can wait for months and months,"" SamsonÂ said.Â ""It is so hard, and our hearts go out to the children and their families, and we never take it lightly and we work hard to try and reschedule it.""Â  Rose Anne Devlin,Â a professor of economics at the University of Ottawa whose research has focused on health care in Ontario, believes the province could ease the pressure on hospitals by creating more family health teamsÂ â€”Â doctors, nurses and nurse practitionersÂ who work together to provide primary care to patients outside the hospital setting, typically in the evenings. The province created 184 of the teams between 2005 and 2012, and added another three last year. Devlin is calling for more to ease the strain on overcrowded hospitals. ""Something has to happen,"" she said. ""A hospital is a very expensive place to treat conditions that primary doctors could provide."" In anticipation of this year's flu season, CHEO has used a one-time, $1.5-million bailout from the province to open nine more beds, but the funding runs out at the end of March. In an attempt to boost efficiency, the hospital has also hired a ""flow coordinator"" to oversee admission and discharge.Â Since December, department heads have been convening for a morning huddleÂ in a newly created command centre where they, too, try to manage admissions and coordinate tests so patients can be discharged as quickly as possible at the other end. It's led to fewer cancelled surgeries and faster admissions, Samson said. ""This year felt like the year we had to try something differently,"" she said.Â ""Coming together as a command centre was the best way, and we're seeing some early positive results.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005,[],N/A351,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-07T18:30:27.851Z,'A slap in the face': Little-known rule says airline can keep your money without delivering what you pay for,"A Calgary-area couple is fuming after paying Air Canada hundreds of dollars for an upgraded flight package, then being told a little-known rule allows the airline to keep their money without delivering on what it advertised. Instead, the airline offered Linda and Rick BorsatoÂ 20 per cent off a flight within the next year. ""You're treated like you're an afterthought,"" said Linda. ""'We have your money and sorry you weren't happy. Maybe we'll do better next time. Here's a discount.' That's a slap in the face."" Aviation experts say airlines can upsell passengers without being obligated to deliver or to pay compensation â€” because the industry's regulator lets them make their own rulesÂ outliningÂ their obligations to passengersÂ during a flight. ""It's not really fair,"" says Prof. John Gradek, who lectures about aviation management at McGill University in Montreal.Â  ""Unfortunately, that's the conditions by which the Canadian Transportation Agency has allowed the airlines to promote their fares."" Go Public found WestJet, and some U.S. airlines like American Airlines and Delta have similar rules as Air Canada. Air Canada and WestJet both say they deal with such situations on a case-by-case basis.Â  On a trip to Hawaii in April, the Borsatos paid $519 extra to upgrade from the airline's ""basic"" economy fare to ""comfort"" economy, which includes advance seat selection.Â That was the selling point for Rick, who is six feet, four inches tallÂ and wanted more legroom. Air Canada changed their itinerary three times after the Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March.Â  But it wasn't until the Borsatos arrived at the airport on April 13, that they discovered they'd be getting fewer than half of the extras they bought. The airline didn't deliver on the advance seating, the early boarding or the complimentary alcoholic beverage â€” though theÂ couple was able to check their first bag for free and got extra travel points. The Borsatos sayÂ an Air Canada agent told them they could get a refund when they returned home. But their refund claim was rejected based on a set of rules that Air Canada wrote itself, and which passengers automatically agree to when they book. The airline's Rule 30 says services that are part of a fare package, like the one the Borsatos purchased, are ""not guaranteed,"" and ""no compensation will be offered for their unavailability."" ""I just can't wrap my head around how that happens,"" Rick said. ""We've paid them for a service and didn't get it, but they've written [this rule] in such a way that they don't owe us anything. What other industry can do that?"" The airline won't disclose how often passengers don't get the services they pay for under the various fare packages. In an email to Go Public, spokesperson Angela Mah says Air Canada ""always makes every effort to ensure that services are provided to the best of its abilities."" She added thatÂ the ""no compensation"" clause was included in the rules ""for additional clarity."" Compensation is handled on a ""case-by-case basis,"" she said.Â  After the couple escalated their complaint to Air Canada management, the airline upped its offer by adding a $200 couponÂ to the 20 per centÂ discount. They declined that offer. ""We don't want to travel with Air Canada knowing that we can pay for a service that they don't have to provide us and that they don't have to refund our money,"" Linda said. The BorsatosÂ complainedÂ on May 27 to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the industry regulator which decides whether an airline's rules are reasonable, and has the authority to force airlines to drop or amend rules. The Borsatos' complaint is amongÂ 33 filedÂ over Air Canada's Rule 30Â since the CTA began tracking disputes related to the rule two years ago. In its nine-page response to the Borsatos' complaint, Air Canada says Rule 30 is ""reasonable,"" and that the complaintÂ should be dismissed because the grounding of the 737 Max planes was out of Air Canada's control. The Borsatos say they understand operational issues come up, but say Air Canada shouldn't be able to keep the money if the purchased services can't be provided. After Go Public contacted the airline, it agreed to issue a full refund, but only if the Borsatos signed a confidentiality agreement and dropÂ their complaint with the CTA. The couple refused. Mah, the spokesperson,Â saidÂ ""such agreements are common in business during dispute resolutions.""Â  It's common for airlines to advertise certain perks but not deliver on some or any of them without compensating passengers, according to Prof.Â Brent BowenÂ from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.Â  ""Most of the travelling public is not aware of it,"" said Bowden,Â who has been running an online study on airline qualityÂ for years.Â  ""This is how the airlines have gone from rags to riches in the past decade â€_ they unbundle everything and don't really reduce the ticket cost toÂ you."" He says occasional travellers should be wary of booking bundled fares that promise â€” but don't guarantee â€” extras, because they'll rarely get their money's worth. Air Canada started offering bundled fare packagesÂ in 2003 and it expanded and renamed the packages last year.Â  Fare packagesÂ aren't addressed under Canada's new Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which kicked in July 15. But they should be, according toÂ Ian Jack of the Canadian Automobile Association, who had input into the new regulations through the government's various consultations with stakeholders.Â  The new regulations are ""not perfect"" and fare packages are ""one area for future improvement"" Jack said.Â  Officials should improve ""the way that various fare classes are advertised andâ€_ [how] carriers to make clear what you're getting."" In the meantime, the Borsatos hope the CTA will force Air Canada to drop or modify Rule 30, and want their refund with no strings attached. Their case is still under review.Â  ""How many people aren't getting what they're paying for?"" Linda Borsato asks. ""That's why we pursued this and are following through on itâ€_ either way we have nothing to lose now.""Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-rule-30-fare-classes-1.5304450,[],N/A352,Morgan Modjeski,2020-01-21T14:59:38.655Z,Sask. researchers aiming to develop a vaccine for coronavirus outbreak in China,"Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are aiming to developÂ a vaccine that could help address an outbreak of coronavirus that has killed sixÂ people in China.Â  On Monday, Chinese health officials on the frontline of the outbreak confirmed to state media that human-to-human transmission of the virus has occurred and the number of cases has more than tripled, according to the Associated Press. The outbreak is believed to have started in a seafood market in the central-Chinese city of Wuhan, but it has since spread to Beijing and Guangdong. WuhanÂ Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state television that 258 cases had been confirmed in the city, with six deaths. The outbreak has since spread to Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The virus is linked to the same family of viruses asÂ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed dozens of Canadians in 2002 and 2003. Now, researchers from the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization -Â International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) have requested to work with the virus through the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.Â  ""In house now we're designing strategies of how we can vaccinate for the disease and how we could test such a vaccine,"" said Volker Gerdts, executive director and CEO of VIDO-InterVac. Gerdts said researchers at VIDO-InterVac have extensive experience with coronavirus, as the first vaccine for the virus in cattle was developed at the lab, with research around the virus continuing today. However, Gerdts said they're now looking to develop a vaccine specifically for the virus affecting China, which has come to be known as the Wuhan strain. Since the sequence of the virus was just released last week, they're still in the very early stages of research. ""It's really driving innovation, driving technology, but it's not something that can happen overnight,"" he said. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, screening measures have been implemented at ports of entry in some neighbouring countries for passengers arriving from Wuhan. ""The Public Health Agency of Canada is actively monitoring the situation and working with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners to gather additional information,"" said the agency on its website.Â  It's also initiated new screening measures at Canadian airports in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto, which will remind residents travelling from WuhanÂ to inform a border service officer if they experience flu-like symptoms. An extra health question will also be added to electronic immigration kiosks. Gerdts said right now, the risk to Canadians is low, but noted if you develop flu-like symptoms, after flying to the affected areas, you should contact a public health office. ""There are a number of steps that we'll take from there, but really the chances are very, very low and so there's no reason at the moment to panic.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-coronavirus-1.5434143,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/thailand-china-coronavirus-1.5430898 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477,N/A353,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:41:49.657Z,"Netflix snags 125,000 new Canadian subscribers as streaming competition heats up","Netflix recruited more Canadian subscribers in the final months of last year as it responded to an onslaught of new competition from Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus with an array of buzzworthy TV series and Oscar-calibre movies. The global streaming company attracted 125,000 paid sign-ups in Canada during the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 2019, helped by popular TV series The WitcherÂ and acclaimed films Marriage StoryÂ and The Irishman. Yet, while the results were an improvement over the 96,000 Canadian subscribers who joined in the third quarter, the company's subscriber growth was down from the 218,000 new members who joined during the last three months a year prior. Part of that slowdown could be attributed to the arrival of both Apple and Disney which launched their hyped streaming services within days of each other. Disney Plus, in particular, left a solid impact on pop culture when its Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian sparked an obsession with viewers over the so-called Baby Yoda character on social media. Netflix says despite the widespread attention both new streaming platforms attracted, there was a ""more muted impact from competitive launches"" outside the U.S., including in Canada. Reed Hastings, the company's chief executive, downplayed the arrival of Apple and Disney, saying in a call with investors that before they showed up a formidable competitor for viewership already existed in global powerhouse YouTube. Spencer Wang, the company's vice-president of finance, suggested the notion of the streaming wars is overplayed by outsiders. ""I know it's exciting for folks to talk about â€” you know the clash of the titans and all that kind of stuff â€” but really the big thing that's going on is a transition from linear entertainment to streaming on demand entertainment, which is really, really big,"" he said. ""It's very similar to the transition the industry went through from broadcast to cable."" The latest Canadian figures were outlined as part of a broader commitment to provide its investors with a more extensive quarterly report that fleshed out data on growth in key countries. More detailed breakdowns of its regional membership numbers and revenue cover four regions â€” Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East & Africa; and U.S. and Canada. The North American region was the lowest membership growth area for the streaming company, which it attributed in its financial report to ""recent price changes and to U.S. competitive launches."" Canadian revenues were higher at $241 million US in the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2019, marking an increase from nearly $164.9 million in the same period a year earlier when the company was phasing in a price increase with users across the country. Overall, Netflix added 8.8 million worldwide subscribers during its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations. Netflix had said it expected to add 7.6 million subscribers, and analysts thought the service would fare even better. The increase pales slightly next to the 8.9 million subscribers the service added in the fourth quarter of 2018. A report released Tuesday by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on the state of the country's communications industry offered further insight into the popularity of Netflix in Canada. The 2019 Communications Monitoring Report outlines that subscription-based video-on-demand services â€” which include Netflix, Crave and Quebec-based Club Illico â€” generated $2.5 billion Cdn of revenue for the entirety of 2018.

""It's the closest feeling to flying that you can get,"" Logan LaTulippe, 23, told CBC'sÂ Information Morning Cape Breton. He became a viral sensation in the summer of 2017 when he did a back flip off the Seal Island Bridge in Victoria County.Â A video of that jump posted to Facebook has almost 150,000 views. LaTulippeÂ said that video made him take his hobby more seriously. His pursuit of more and higher jumps has since taken him to Costa Rica, Bermuda and various locations around Canada and the United States. His most mind-blowing leap to date was a triple front flip with a half twist from a height of 31 metres at Abiqua Falls in Oregon. LaTulippe got his start doing what many Cape Breton kids do for a summertime thrill â€” jumping off the relatively low-altitude Mira Gut and Albert Bridges. But it was watching cliff-jumping videos online that inspired his Seal Island stunt. As part of the cliff-jumping community, LaTulippe gets invited to travel to group jumps. He saves up his earnings from his day job doing commercial photo and video work, and travels on the cheap. A trip to Costa Rica was largely paid for by a tour company that wanted LaTulippe and his friends to jump off waterfalls for the entertainment of tourists, and then teach the tourists how to do it safely. He said he's learned safety from his fellow jumpers. The basic checklist includes the water depth, the solidity of the take-off spotÂ and the absence of obstacles in the jump path. ""As long as you land safe enough, with your feet and not your face, you should be all right,""Â LaTulippeÂ said. While he'sÂ avoided broken bones so far, his body has taken some abuse. Times where he's accidentally done belly or back flops or landed on his butt have left him sore for a few days. His most serious injury to date was a burst eardrum. Given the risks, LaTulippe said he always jumps with a partner, who can retrieve him from the water if necessary â€” aÂ precaution recommended by RCMP spokesperson Corporal Jennifer Clarke. ""We would like [people]Â to consider their personal safety and hope that they've made a contingency plan to prepare for any type of emergency that might come up as a result of their activities,"" she said, noting jumpers are also responsible for ensuringÂ they're not breaking any laws, such as trespassing. At the time of his Seal Island Bridge stunt, RCMP issued a similar warning to discourage potential imitators.Â Â  LaTulippe'sÂ next scheduled event will take him to Arizona in May. He also has his sights set on Mexico, Slovenia and possiblyÂ Chile. ""I've met all kinds of great people. I've gotten to see all kinds of really cool places that I don't think I would have gotten to see otherwise,"" he said. ""And the adrenaline rush, you just can't beat it ... it really makes me feel alive.""

All three were arrestedÂ last week.Â  It also reveals the lengths Mathews, Brian Mark Lemley Jr., and 19-year-old William Garfield Bilbrough IV planned violence similar to what was seen at a rally in Charlottesville, Va.,Â in 2017, in which one person was killed and dozens others injured. ""We can't let Virginia go to waste, we just can't â€_ Virginia will be our day,""Â Mathews stated, according to the detention memo.Â  The conversations were captured in December and January on a hidden camera and microphone installed by law enforcement in the apartment where Mathews and Lemley, a 33-year-old former U.S. army cavalry scout,Â were living. They were installed after a Dec. 13 secretÂ search of the apartment, in which officers found flyers promoting The Base, communication devices, empty rifle cases and ""go bags""Â â€”Â with ready-to-eat meals, knivesÂ and the items needed to build an assault rifle. They also found videos of Mathews talking about his journey into the United States, using violent anti-Semitic and racist language.Â  In the video, in which Mathews wears a gas mask and has hisÂ voice distorted,Â Mathews says: ""The time for talk has ended â€_ If you think politics is a solution, you are a damn fool â€_ It is the system that is fomenting violent revolution, not us, and now they shall reap what they have sown.""

""Derail some f-cking trains, kill some people and poison some water suppliesÂ â€_ If you want the white race to survive, you're going to have to do your f-cking part."" At one point, MathewsÂ says he wishes he had set explosive devices for the RCMP team thatÂ raided his home and took his guns in August. ""In all honesty, I could really wish they f-cking all started searching my place, accidentally trip a pin, and, boom, and the whole house goes boom. Boy, wouldn't that be terrible, a bunch of f-cking RCMP search experts got f-cking exploded,"" he said, according to court documents.Â  Mathews and Lemley are facing a number of charges, including transporting a firearm to commit a felony. Bilbrough is charged with ""transporting and harbouring aliens."" They were all scheduled to appear in court Wednesday for detention hearings, but Lemley has since waived his right for a detention hearing.Â  Mathews' lawyer would not comment when asked if he was proceeding with the hearing. Bilbrough's lawyer said they intendÂ to proceed as planned. The latest document fills in some of the blanks of Mathews' allegedÂ activities since he disappeared from his home in Beausejour, Man., at the end of August 2019, shortly after he was first accused, by a reporter with the Winnipeg Free Press, of being aÂ recruiter for The Base. The documentÂ says after illegally crossing the border near Piney, Man., Mathews met Lemley and Bilbrough in southern Michigan. Police followed their movements using Google location data, cell phone location dataÂ and recorded calls.Â  In mid-September, Lemley drove Mathews to the property of a Base member in Georgia, identified by an undercover FBI agent as a headquarters and training camp for the group.Â  Tuesday's document does not name the house's owner, but previous court filings state that a man presumed to be Mathews stayed at Luke Austin Lane's property for months last year. Lane was among three Georgia men arrested last week, charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being part of a criminal gang. During his time in Georgia, Mathews said he ""only exists for the white revolution now,"" according to the document.Â He wanted to remain a ""ghost""Â and oversee safe houses for other Base members and, when there were enough of them, start committing attacks.Â  Mathews also searched the internetÂ for information about Atomwaffen Division, another neo-Nazi group;Â building AR-15 assault rifles; and stories about himself, prosecutors allege.Â  Between Oct. 30 andÂ Nov. 2, he was joined at the Georgia location by Lemley, Bilbrough, and other alleged BaseÂ members. Lemley and Bilbrough had bought about 1,500 rounds of ammunition while they were in Georgia. Separate affidavits have described about a dozen members of the group â€” including an undercover FBI agent â€”Â attended this meeting, which included firearms training, medical training and a pagan ritual with the sacrifice of a goat.Â  At the end of that gathering, the trio returned to Maryland. Lemley and Mathews rented an apartment in Newark, N.J. One day before their arrests, Lemley told Mathews that ""there cannot be no trust among a group of murderers,"" court documents say.Â  ""I cannot trust you to keep my murdering secrets. Not under threat of 30 years in jail and torture. Why should I trust you?"" Lemley asked. Monday's rally in Richmond, Va., attracted tens of thousands of people and, although there was some tension between different groups, ended without violence. Mathews was released from the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) at the end of August. The Department of National Defence says it can't comment on specific cases, but said in a statement that as of Dec.Â 5, 2019, investigations involving 15 CAF members have resulted in measures ranging from counselling, warnings and probationÂ to other disciplinary measures. Twenty-one members are no longer serving in the CAF; three were releasedÂ because ofÂ hateful conduct. Other investigations are ongoing. The military ombudsman is currently reviewing racism and white supremacy in the CAF. Defence MinisterÂ Harjit Sajjan said Tuesday he's hoping for an update on that review soon. ""The vast majority of Canadian Armed Forces personnel are absolute professionals â€_ who want to make sure that the organization that they join, the uniform that they wear, upholds those values,"" he said. ""They're not going to allow the few to take that away from them."" Sajjan andÂ Public Safety Minister Bill BlairÂ were in Winnipeg for Liberal cabinet meetings.Â Blair declined to say if Canadian authorities are also investigating The Base.

Early Wednesday, St. John's International Airport opened for the first time since a record-smashing blizzardÂ brought daily life in eastern Newfoundland to a standstillÂ with hurricane-force winds that kept equipment off roads and highways during critical hours of theÂ storm. ""We're getting there,"" St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said Wednesday, as crews directed their efforts toward feeder streets. Main thoroughfares are now open, Breen said.Â  Taxis are also back on the road Wednesday, and most medical clinics have been given the go-ahead to open.Â  Supermarkets â€” the sites of frantic shopping Tuesday, as thousands of people poured through the doors to buy milk, bread and other items for the first time since last week â€” will be allowed to open again for an eight-hour period. Exemptions to the state of emergency, which was put in placeÂ Friday, have also been made for pharmacies, convenience stores and gas stations.Â  BreenÂ saidÂ understood that some residents were wondering why the city didn't let people know that certain stores would be open again Wednesday, potentially avoiding long waits in lineups. ""It's a good question. We didn't know they would be open today,"" he said Wednesday. Breen said it's still too early to speculate ifÂ businesses exempted from the state of emergency mandatory closures will be open Thursday.Â  Schools, though, will remain closed for the rest of the week, and many streets are still so choked with snow that they can't accommodate Metrobus vehicles. Breen said Metrobus managers are working on a plan to get the streets ""to a point where we can get them back.""Â  Breen urged caution for residents who are anxious to get back to normal.Â  The airport is up and running. So far itâ€™s pretty darn quiet. And guess what? Timâ€™s is open lol. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Snowmageddon2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Snowmageddon2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ab5BsdL5ea"">pic.twitter.com/ab5BsdL5ea</a> ""I think it's manageable there now, but we do want peopleÂ â€” if they don't have to go out, [unless] it's something essential they have to do in those places â€” that they stay off the roads,"" he said.Â  PremierÂ Dwight Ball saidÂ the priority Wednesday is widening the roads in preparation for the next snowfall. ""It is January,"" he said.Â  Government offices remain closed, and the state of emergency means many businesses cannot legally open. Nearby Mount PearlÂ is open for business, but recreational facilities remain closed. Nonetheless,Â Mayor Dave Aker is asking people to stay home unless necessary. ""Be patient. Only go out if you have to,"" Aker said.Â He added the city is struggling to move snow out of the way and now has to remove it with dump trucks. ""It's becoming extremely difficult now to pile snow,"" he said. Family doctor and specialist clinics can open today in St. John'sÂ to lessen the pressure on emergency rooms, but Eastern Health says it's still offering only emergency services at its hospitals. Meanwhile, if you're expecting a package in the mail, don't hold your breath. Canada Post saidÂ it's holding off on deliveries until the state of emergency is lifted, and afterward people can expect ""significant delivery delays"" as the agency plays catchup. Heating oil deliveries, however, resume Wednesday. Chris Forward of Harvey's Home Heating saidÂ although the companyÂ has oil in stock, the company and the city both agreedÂ streets were too narrow until WednesdayÂ to make deliveries. ""These are bigÂ trucks. They're loaded with 11,000 to 18,000 litres of diesel fuel,"" Forward said. The City of St. John's is still requesting people stay off the streets as much as possible to facilitate snow removal. Breen saidÂ the nearly week-long state of emergency order means both businesses and the municipal budget will take a hit, calling the loss of income ""significant.""Â  Ball said his government will work with municipalities to figure out the full costs of the emergency and discuss disaster relief.Â  ""It'll take some time to get this all calculated,"" he said.

Kate Rogers, the only woman on council, noted last night that several of the city's standing committees are made up entirely of men. Rogers began raising the issue publicly last summer when a committee to look into development at the New Brunswick Exhibition grounds lacked any female representation from the city.Â  ""It was difficult to go and speak publicly about colleagues â€”Â very well intentioned, good people â€”Â and to have to speak publicly,"" she said. ""But it amplified the discussion and it brought it out into the public and that's what was required so that we could move forward. I feel we've come a long way in a few months."" The resolutions from the Ad Hoc Committee on Gender Diversity, which was struck after Rogers brought her concerns forward, include: Adopt the Fredericton Council Code of Conduct by-law and policy Provide on-going professional development for Councillors and Committee members Require the completion of the GBA+ (Gender-based Analysis Plus) online training course for all chairs of committees. Other members of council have expressed interest in taking this course as well. Amend the Administrative report to include GBA+ lens, among others The committee was made up of Rogers and Coun. Greg Ericson, as well as city staff representative Michele Cronin, Joanne Wright, the dean of Arts and Professor of Political Science at the University of New Brunswick and Margot Cragg, the Executive Director of the Union of the Municipalities of New Brunswick. There are no women on the finance committee, public safety committee orÂ land development committee, Rogers said. ""If you have more diverse voices there â€_ it just makes for a richer more meaningful discussion."" Committee members are appointed by the mayor and approved by council. The recently passed resolutions will not change that process. Several people,Â mostly women, came to watch the council-in-committee meeting on Monday night. Committee meetings don't typically attract an audience.Â  ""We wanted to come here for solidarity,"" said Marg Milburn, who came to support the resolutions. ""And also, I just can't believe we had to come to this meeting, like, I'm just â€”Â it's 2020.""Â  Councillors echoed their support for the resolutions, and some even asked why they didn't go further.Â  ""I think we should be appointing a commission to look into all of the various issues that are associated with gender equity and gender representation â€_ in order to facilitate more women in government,"" said Coun. Stephen Chase.Â  Coun. Eric Megarity suggested it was time the city had a representative from St. Mary's First Nation.Â  ""We both inhabit the same piece of territory, we're on their land and it goes back many many many years and it's time to work together and move our city forward,"" MegarityÂ said.Â Â  Increasing gender diversity is a first step, Rogers said in an interview with Information Morning Fredericton. ""We need to become more diverse in many ways around the council table and in our working committees. We identified gender and thought that we would start with gender ... and then we can address many of the other identities.""Â  Rogers said the positive discussion and unanimous vote is encouraging. ""That made me feel like we've come a very long way,"" she said. But there's still work to be done, said Coun. GregÂ Ericson. Some details still need to be hammered out, like how the city could go about appointing voting community members to standing committees.Â  ""It's in a bylaw already, but none of the specifics are worked out. Do they get a vote? What kind of speaking privileges do they have? What's the process for how we'd go about selecting these members from the community?""Â Â Â  For now, Rogers expects the recommendations will make councillors and committee members more aware of sexist and misogynistic behaviour.Â  ""Part of this training will make people more aware that it exists and their part in it,"" Rogers said. ""I would say both at the staff and the council level we haven't talked about it and when we have talked about it, there's been denial that it's existed or that it's too overwhelming to address.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-council-gender-1.5434177,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-city-council-female-councillor-1.5206326 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-council-diversity-concerns-1.5204768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-approves-all-male-1.5221187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/councillor-kate-rogers-gender-committee-1.5244945,N/A360,Anonymous,2020-01-21T22:39:27.691Z,"St. John's airport to resume operations early Wednesday, state of emergency remains in effect","Planes will soon begin flying again to and from St. John's International Airport, although Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Dwight Ball says it could be weeks before the region returns to normal after a record-smashing blizzard. The City of St. John'sÂ announced Tuesday afternoon that the airport, which has been shut down since Friday's punishing storm, can resume commercial operations as of 5 a.m. NT Wednesday. Airport employees will be allowed to travel to work earlier than that. The state of emergency will remain in effect for St. John's on Wednesday, but the city is easing its restrictions when it comes to certain activities: St. John's Mayor Danny Breen told CBC Radio shortly after the city announced its continuation of the state of emergency that he has been in contact with city food banks, but most are having trouble opening due to snow blockages. ""[We're] just working on that this evening to see when they can open up. So, that's an ongoing thing that we're working on, and hopefully we'll have something more on that soon,"" Breen said. Peter Avery, CEO of the St. John's Airport Authority, told CBC Radio that the airport is prepared to open on Wednesday and get back to business as usual. ""We're in pretty good shape right now. All of our main facilities, and our airfields, parking lots and roadways are cleared. So, we're ready for the go-ahead tomorrow morning,"" Avery said. ""There's no question about the ability for our airfield to accept the aircraft.""Â  Avery said St. John's International Airport is expecting at least 2,000 passengers inbound on Wednesday, with the same amount looking to fly out.Â  He said Air Canada has added additional flights for Wednesday's run, and will be potentially upgradingÂ to larger aircraft to fit more passengers. WestJet has followed suit, Avery said. ""It'll be a busy day. We ask people to exercise caution and also to carpool and take taxis where you can,"" he said.Â  Residents were getting a hint Tuesday of what life was like before the blizzard, as some businesses opened their doors for the first time since the city was slammed by a massive snowstorm. Gas stations, pharmacies and grocery storesÂ opened at 10 a.m. with city officialsÂ urging residents to stock up for at least two days â€” but also to remain civil and drive slowly. As community food sharing groups pop up online and supplies inside homes dwindle, grocery stores were overwhelmed as thousands of customers showed up to shop.Â  At least one supermarket issued a pre-emptive limit of two loaves of bread per customer. Some supermarkets had to close their doors for periods of time to let long queues run through the checkouts.Â  Outside, cleanup efforts continued.Â  ""We have never seen it like this before,""Â Ball said on Power and Politics Monday night, describing the volume of snow the city has to remove or push aside in order to allow vehicles through the streets. Cleanup efforts are expected to take so long that all metro-area schools are closed for the rest of the week. ""This is a student-first decision around safety,"" saidÂ Tony Stack, chief executive of the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD).Â  ""Having that volume of students on the roads in the condition that they're in â€_ would be problematic."" Stack said the goal was to give people enough notice so they could make other plans. Breen said there was at least one cut through the ""vast majority"" of streets in the city. As for clearing sidewalks, Breen said it's something that will be happening, but it won't be immediate. Transportation Minister Steve Crocker said that outside the city, cleanup of provincial roads is going well. Crocker said there are still challenges with highway off-ramps in the metro-area, but he was hopeful that Witless Bay Line on the Southern Shore would be opened soon. ""We had one truck through there now, and we're widening it. It's still not opened but we're hoping to have it opened laterÂ today or early tomorrow,"" he said. ""Most of our main arteries right now are in fair, winter driving conditions.""Â  There has been widespread praise for estimated 450 military troops who are helping with theÂ post-storm recovery. Personnel and equipment landed on the island Sunday night and will likely remain until at least the end of the week.Â  Members of the Canadian Armed Forces spent much of Monday digging trenches from front doors to streets. ""Yesterday was a busy day,"" said Maj. Kerry Sears ofÂ 37 Service Battalion. ""There's a lot of handshaking, a lot of hugging the soldiers.""

The First Nations LNG Alliance has issued open letters to the B.C. human rights commissioner and the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination over statements they made about the pipeline. The commissioner and committee bothÂ called for the project to be stopped in the face of opposition from Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, who say the project has no authority without their consent. Both said the free, prior and informed consent of all affected Indigenous groups should be granted before any project is allowed to proceed. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline's 670-kilometre path but the Wet'suwet'en chiefs say within their territory, those councils only administer small reserves and it's the hereditary chiefs who hold jurisdiction over a broader area covering 22,000 square kilometres. Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, says in the letter to human rights commissioner Kasari Govender that the pipeline was approved through a democratic process that Indigenous people participated in freely, and neither the committee nor commissioner consulted supportive Indigenous groups before taking a position. No one could be reached for comment at the UN committee and Govender was not available for an interview Tuesday. ""It is disheartening to see that the input from 20 First Nations, who participated extensively during five years of consultation on the pipeline, and have successfully negotiated agreements with Coastal GasLink, is so easily dismissed by the B.C. Human Rights Commission,""Â Ogen-Toews says in one of the open letters. Ogen-Toews was elected chief of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation, representing 255 members on and off reserve lands, for six years. The Wet'suwet'en First Nation covers a smaller area than the Wet'suwet'en Nation, over which the hereditary clan chiefs claim authority. The letter accuses Govender of ignoring the social and economic benefits already realized by workers and communities from the project. More than one-third of work on the project has been completed by Indigenous people and Coastal GasLink has earmarked $620 million in contracting opportunities for First Nations in the province, it says. The letter also accuses both the provincial commission and the UN committee of issuing public statements without talking to supportive First Nations. ""Both groups know nothing about the importance we place on finding a way out of endlessly trying to manage poverty, and finding the kind of opportunities for our First Nations people that non-Indigenous people have enjoyed for centuries,""Â the letter says. The UN committee also called on the federal government to stop two other major resource projects, the Site C dam and Trans Mountain pipeline expansions. Na'moks, a spokesman for the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, has said they will never consent to the project. The chiefs issued an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink after the B.C. Supreme Court extended an injunction on Dec. 31 to the company. The RCMP has established a checkpoint along a logging road that leads to a pipeline work site, as well as two camps and a small settlement established by supporters of the hereditary chiefs.

Alberta's Northern Cree takes another shot at Grammy gold,"Even the biggest pop stars might want to clear the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday when Northern Cree arrive dressed to impress. It's the ninth time Alberta's Indigenous singing group is nominated at music industry's biggest night, and co-founder Steve Wood says he's planning a few surprises. Among them, expect members of the 17-person act to sport traditional Cree designs that could easily overshadow the edgy threads worn by Shawn Mendes and Lil Nas X. ""Even if you're famous, you don't want to be next to us on the red carpet,"" Wood says with a chuckle on the phone from Maskwacis, Alta. ""Taking nothing away from any of the artists, what I'm saying is that people are always looking for something they haven't seen before."" Since the group's first nomination in 2001, the 58-year-old leader of Northern Cree has become somewhat of an expert in grabbing attention on the red carpet. A couple years ago, the act wowed onlookers when they pulled up wearing vibrant beaded vests, a sharp break from the steady flow of black tuxedos and designer looks on the carpet. Northern Cree didn't win the Grammy that year, but they had everyone talking. This year, they're nominated in the best regional roots category with their 40th album, When It's Cold - Cree Round Dance Songs,Â a collection of tracks that acknowledge the good times (The Hippity Hoppity) and the hardships (To All MMIW)Â a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women). Their Grammy category is stacked with other favourite contenders, including six-time Hawaiian nominee Amy Hanaiali'i and Rebirth Brass Band, a past winner from New Orleans. Northern Cree carries a longer history with the Recording Academy than the rest of them, but the singing group is running zero for eight on Grammy wins. While leaving empty-handed for so many years would've left many artists feeling slighted, Wood insists his fellow members are nothing less than auspicious winners even without a golden statuette to their name. ""If you look at the positives, it's giving us an opportunity to get recognition for our music,"" he explains. ""We're representing First Nations people across North America, but we are also representing the Canadian public. That's why we're going to do the best that we can, always."" Wood created Northern Cree with his brothers Randy and Earl in 1982. The group originates from the Saddle Lake Cree Nation in northern Alberta, but includes members from the Treaty 6 area, including the Frog Lake Cree Nation, Onion Lake Cree Nation, Samson Cree Nation, Louis Bull Cree Nation and the Poundmaker Cree Nation. They've performed on global stages, which included an opening spot for the Tragically Hip during a Canada Day concert at London's Trafalgar Square. Most of the group's members juggle career jobs outside of music, several of them school teachers. Wood is an education administrator at an Alberta junior and senior high school on top of balancing the group's schedule. That's one of the reasons the Grammy Awards offers Northern Cree a platform they can't find anywhere else. Not only are international audiences watching the big event, but the auditorium is packed with fellow musicians, which can lead to new opportunities. Several years ago, rapper M.I.A. and singer Santigold picked a Northern Cree sample for their own original song, while more recently Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy docuseries Who is America?Â used a pounding electronic track by producer DJ Shub, featuring Northern Cree, as its title music. And when Northern Cree was nominated in 2017, the Grammy organizers asked the group to play as part of the pre-telecast awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The performance shook the room, even before Mexican singer Carla Morrison joined them on stage. Wood says it's those pure Grammy moments that mean the most. ""I like to get the music out in its original form,"" he says. ""When we hit those mainstream stages, the audience is in a little bit of awe until they can feel it.

And it's creating headaches for advocates and policy-makers who want to know if laws and enforcement measures are working as they should. ""It's appalling,"" saidÂ Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada. ""We're almost [in] 2020 and we're still working off 2014 [numbers]. We've had historical events in this country, like the legalization of recreational cannabis, with the big issue and debate around driving and what effect it's going to have, and we've got nothing. Nothing."" The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA), an interprovincial body that deals with highway safety, traditionally releases its annual Alcohol and Drug Crash Problem report each January. Drawing on police, insurance, coroner and medical examiner data from across the country, it's the definitive source on what has gone wrong on the country's roads. But the last CCMTA report came out almost three years agoÂ in January 2017. And it was based on 2014 data â€” orÂ in the case of British Columbia,Â extrapolated 2010 numbers.Â  The Ottawa-basedÂ Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF), an independent non-profit that gathers and analyzes the data for the CCMTA report, says it has been having difficulty prying numbers out of the BCÂ Coroners Service for years. ""We've been trying to get that data because it represents anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of the population,"" said Steve Brown, who oversees TIRF's national fatality databaseÂ and co-authors the Alcohol and Drug Crash report. ""We're doing everything at our end. We've filled out all the research agreements and that type of thing."" Earlier this year, the BC Coroners Service finally provided its 2011 and 2012 figures. But the holdup continues for the province's moreÂ recent years;Â that's in contrast to other Canadian jurisdictions, which have all provided their road death numbers through at least 2016. ""You think, in the information age, that it would be easier to get data, but that's not always the case,"" saidÂ Brown. ""We're â€_ just trying to be as patient as we can with this."" B.C.'s death disclosure problems have also affected an annual report on water fatalities across the country.Â This past summer, the Drowning Prevention Research Centre released its 2019 findings â€” based on 2016 data â€” noting that absence of definitive numbers from Canada's third most populous province. ""They weren't ready and we just made the call that says, better to have three territories and nine provinces with their data, and let B.C. catch up by next year,"" said Doug Ferguson, CEO of Drowning Prevention Research Centre. Ferguson saidÂ his centre was still able to glean partial B.C. drowning death information from police and media reports, but it's likely that they missed some cases. He worries that the incomplete report might hamper municipalities or other water safety agencies as they try to fine-tune and target their public awareness campaigns.Â  ""You're not flying blind, but you're using old data,"" said Ferguson. ""There is no other source as valid as a coroner's office."" Andy Watson, a spokespersonÂ for the BCÂ Coroners Service, attributes the delays to the surge in deaths caused by the opioid crisisÂ and the declaration of a provincial public health emergency in AprilÂ 2016. ""One of the challenges that we were faced with a couple of years ago, really, it was the illicit drug crisis was expanding, and hitting British Columbia, I think, disproportionately harder than other provinces,"" saidÂ Watson. ""It was a reprioritization of resources at the time."" But given that the timely sharing of B.C. data was a problem well before the spike in fentanyl and carfentanil overdose deaths, other issues appear to be at play. In a followup response, Watson allowed that the BC Coroners Service has been slowed by ""a myriad of factors,"" including privacy concerns, revamped research agreements, the creation of a new electronic data management system and turnover in staff. Regardless, the agencyÂ is promising to do better and says it will hand over its 2013 through 2017 road death information to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation at some point next year. ""The best I can tell you at this stage is that we are working on thatÂ and catching up on that now,"" saidÂ Watson. ""We recognize the importance of that data and that's why we're making it a priority at this stage."" For safety groups like MADD Canada, however, the promise rings hollow. Murie says his organization has been looking for alternative data sources so it can analyze trends and critique government policy without having to wait for the various federal and provincial agencies to get their act together. ""To be honest with you, in the last year or so, I have just kind of given up,"" he said. ""BecauseÂ even if they were to put out data for tomorrow and it's [for] 2015,Â what does it tell us?"" It's all in sharp contrast to the coroner-based processÂ in the United States, which produces updated national numbers each spring via the federally fundedÂ Fatality Analysis Reporting System. ""That's great that B.C. is going to get caught up,"" saidÂ Murie. ""But, you know, the Americans have already produced their 2018 data, and next year, in April, they'll do 2019. ""They can do trend data. We can't.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/death-data-information-gap-1.5384278,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fire-truck-stolen-winnipeg-arrest-1.5379840 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drunk-driving-twice-quebec-breathalyzer-for-life-1.5369145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/great-lakes-drownings-2019-1.5231362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-crisis-vancouver-election-1.5284444,N/A366,Jessica Wong,2020-01-22T14:13:59.531Z,"Canada Reads 2020 short list, panellists revealed","Country singer George Canyon and actor Amanda BrugelÂ from The Handmaid's Tale are the latest prominent Canadians brushing off their debate skills for Canada Reads, CBC'sÂ battle of the books.

The Second World WarÂ veteran lives by himself in Eastport, N.L.,Â does his own cleaning and cooking, and loves a good game on the VLTs at his local legion,Â a building he was instrumental in establishing decades ago â€” just one of his many achievements during a century of life. Today, Jan. 20, he turns 100. Good genes, he says. ""My father was 92. And my grandfather was 98. And my brother died [when]Â he was 99 and three months. And I've outdone the whole works,"" said Bull. Born to George Henry and Suzanna Bull, ChesleyÂ Bull says he started working on his father's vessel, the Magic, as a boy. ""I was in Grade 8 then. I went on to Labrador when I was 13 years old. And I spent seven summers out there. And I had a man's pay when I was 15,"" he said. ""When the war broke I tried to join up in St. John's and I had to come back in my own district to join."" He signed up for the navy in Glovertown on March 18, 1941, and was called for duty July 1 of that same year. ""We joined the ship and went across the Atlantic. Pretty near 200 ships in the convoy with 46 days going across the Atlantic. Landed in Liverpool. Then we joined the train and went down to the Ganges. We did our training there."" Bull says the memories of his war days are vivid in his mind â€” like the time he was bitten by a barracuda, or when there was an bomb attack outside his boarding house. ""They dropped a bomb and glass went all over me."" After 5Â_ years overseas, he returned to Eastport on Christmas Eve 1946. He began working at Terra Nova National Park, then moved on to become postmaster of Eastport, and also served as the first mayor of the town. After retiring from the post office, he went back to the water at age 60. He bought a boat engine and five gill nets and went fishing for the next seven or eight years, he said.Â  ""Made more money in one day than a month [as postmaster],"" said Bull. Bull was married for 67 years to wife Viola, who died in 2017. The couple had one daughter, Marion. These days, the centenarian brags about his 20/20 vision and loves to crack off-colourÂ jokes every now and then. He still drives in the daytime, and most recentlyÂ made the near 300-kilometre trek to St. John's last fall. And he loves to fish and hunt when he can, with hopes to get a moose licence next season. He makes his own wine, beer, and coffee liqueur, giving more of it away than he consumes. He says he'd rather have his nightly drink of scotch whisky instead.

The city has laid out theÂ details ofÂ its action plan, which will require spendingÂ $300,000 this year simply for testing for leadÂ and another $1 million to begin replacingÂ the lead pipes. The city's executive committee said it is taking ""a proactive approach"" by making lead testing mandatory on all buildings built before 1980. Last fall, theÂ Quebec government announced it would introduce new standards to fall in line with the federal guidelines on lead levels in drinking water. In March, Health Canada cut theÂ acceptable concentration of leadÂ from 10 micrograms per litre to five micrograms per litre. Quebec City estimates there are around 80,000 households on its territory that were built before 1980, when the province's building regulations banned the use of lead pipes. ""We suspect that 9.5 per cent of water intakes could contain lead,"" said the city's chemist, Christine Beaulieu. She said the water testing will take place between July 1Â and Sept.Â 30, whenÂ water temperatures reachÂ 15 C, and lead is easily detectable. Buildings that date back to theÂ period between 1945 and 1955 will be the priority, as that's whenÂ lead was commonly used in water systems. Coun. Suzanne Verreault, the city's executive committee member in charge of waterworks, said she expects around 1,000 ""interventions"" will be carried outÂ in 2020. ""It will be a year that will guide us to know how we have to proceed moving forward,"" Verreault said. Mayor RÃ©gis Labeaume said co-ordinating the work willÂ beÂ ""a massive undertaking,""Â and will cost the city between $50 and $60 million over the next ten years. The city will foot the bill for lead testing in both private and public buildings and will absorb the cost of replacing pipes that are on public land. If lead pipes are discovered on private property, however, homeowners will have to pay for the costs of replacing them. Labeaume said the price tagÂ can range between $5,000 andÂ $15,000. Since the city will be doing the work regardless, residents will be given the option of paying back the city over 10- to 15-year period. The city said ifÂ lead is found is high concentrations, it will help households find temporary solutions to their tainted water while the replacement work is done. Depending on the situation, that can range from letting the waterÂ run several minutes or installing filters to remove the lead.Â Â  Montreal, which presentedÂ its own action plan last October, estimates it will cost approximatelyÂ $557 million to replace more than 48,000 lead pipes by 2030.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-plan-lead-pipe-replacement-1.5434787,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lead-water-quebec-1.5331743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lead-water-pipes-contamination-homes-schools-daycares-1.5332116,N/A369,Tony Seskus,2020-01-22T04:02:22.991Z,"Cash-strapped rural Alberta 'can't wring money' from struggling oil and gas firms, premier says","Premier Jason KenneyÂ urgedÂ rural municipalities to work with the province to help struggling oil and gas companies Tuesday, adding they can't get ""money from a stone."" He made the commentsÂ followingÂ a survey that said the oil and gas sector owes $173Â millionÂ in unpaid taxes to rural municipalitiesÂ â€” more than double since a similar reportÂ was done last spring. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, KenneyÂ said the sector hasÂ seen a few bankruptcies in the past year whileÂ other companies are barely hanging on. ""You can't wring money from a stone,"" KenneyÂ said, suggesting that could be the case forÂ a number of smaller natural gas producers who are having troubleÂ right now. ""The best solution, in our view, is to create a future for those companies that are struggling."" Rural Municipalities Alberta (RMA) distributedÂ a survey of its members Monday that showed the amount of unpaid taxes from oil and gas companies had grown by 114 per centÂ since aÂ similar survey last March. Years of low oil prices have left many small producers in dire straitsÂ but rural communities say those unpaid taxes are leaving significant holes in their budgets. The RMAÂ saidÂ legislative gaps make it difficult to recover lost taxes from energy companies. When an oil and gas company goes bust, municipalities rank below regulators as creditors, the association said. Al Kemmere, president of the RMA, told CBC News Tuesday he will meet with the provincial minister of municipal affairs next month to discuss the situation. Asked about the premier's comments, Kemmere agreed there needs to be discussion about solutions, but cautioned rural municipalities only have so much flexibility under the Municipal Government Act. ""We are also in a very limited scope of what we can do,Â too, because [while]Â other levels of government can â€_Â build a deficit into their budget,Â we cannot,"" Kemmere said. ""That limits us again on what we can do and how we can find solutions. We either balance a budget every year or we are in contempt of our own act."" Kenney said rural municipalities have the legal ability toÂ take action when taxes go unpaid. But Kemmere maintained theyÂ don't have that authority other than through the civil courtsÂ â€” something he said could be ""really messy"" and putsÂ risk on taxpayers. On Tuesday, Kenney was asked how the province would find a balance between the rural municipalities and the industry. He said he didn't view themÂ as competing prioritiesÂ butÂ competing realities.Â  ""On the one part, theÂ municipalities need the revenue and they have every right to assess it and and to seek to collect itÂ â€” they have the legal right to collect it,"" KenneyÂ said.Â  ""But for companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, they have no cash and very little in the way of assets.Â There's not a lot to go after. ""So I would just say with the municipalities, you know, work with us to try to create the best conditions to turn that economic situation around."" The industry is seeking reforms to howÂ taxes are assessed on oil and gas companies. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, Ben Brunnen, vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Monday. ""What we're seeing is a need to update the way our assets are valued inside municipalities,"" he told CBC News. ""If we do that, we'll find a way for companies to then â€_Â perhaps invest more because the economics are better over the long term and our industry will come out stronger."" On Monday, Ponoka County Reeve Paul McLauchlinÂ said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin told Canadian Press. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs.""

He says people can still bring in their Arctic Cat machines for repair after then. Ireland says in his personal view, ""the recreational dollars in Canada, but Yellowknife especially, have really shrunk ... you only have so much money to spend."" He also says that the company's focus is on vehicles. ""That's what we want to focus on, to give customers the best experience."" Aurora Dodge leaving the market leaves Polar Tech Recreation, which sells Ski-Doo products, as the only place in town to buy new snow machines.

""We fill one dumpster a week,"" said Steven Stewart. ""That could go to three when it all gets going."" The city will have a new screening facility up and running in a couple of weeks to help deal with the gunk.Â It's part ofÂ $12 million in upgrades undertaken to handle increased waste at the Charlottetown plant. The new screening facility will be housed in a separate building on the plant's waterfront property on Riverside Drive. The new, finer screen will replace a decades-old machine that currently sifts all manner of items out of the sewage that flows from the homes of Charlottetown residents. ""This looks like somebody's Calvin Kleins,"" said Stewart, as he used a pitch fork and gloved hands to pick through a knotted wad of cloth and elastic that turned up in the pipes in recent days.Â The name of the designer-label undergarmentÂ was clearly visible. Over the years, staff have removed many curious items: an animal horn, bones, children's toys, cash.Â A pair of crinkled $5 bills are kept in the plant as examples of what can turn up.Â One worker told CBC he once found a $50 bill.Â  And a set of dentures.Â  Staff estimate they remove a ""five gallon bucket"" of untreatable items from pumping equipment every day. It takes valuable time, and puts staff at risk, according toÂ Stewart. ""You get syringes. Sometimes we have razor blades,"" said Stewart.

""This large corporation, which profits almost entirely off northern First Nations, is letting our First Nations down,"" Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak wrote in a statement late Monday night. MKOÂ represents 26 northern Manitoba First Nations, including Shamattawa. The flight from Thompson to ShamattawaÂ landed around 5 p.m. Sunday, butÂ while taxiing to the airport, veered off the runway and ran into a snowbank, snapping one of the plane's propellers. The 11 passengers and two crew members were not injured. The turbo prop plane, built in 1987, suffered minor damage, Transport Canada said. The Transportation Safety Board has been notified. ""It has really affected a lot of the passengers psychologically,"" Shamattawa Chief Eric Redhead said. Redhead said his First Nation and others in the north have had longstanding issues with Perimeter, and he feelsÂ the airline is not taking this latest eventÂ seriously.Â  ""What does it take for Perimeter to step up?Â We don't want anyone to get hurt for them to take action,"" Redhead said. Redhead said First Nation leadership met with Perimeter's vice-president of operations for an hour and half on Monday. ""We've met with Perimeter [on] numerous occasions to address capacity issues and safety issues, and that was the same thing. It was the same spiel that they gave us every other meeting,"" he said. ""It didn't seem like a meaningful conversation. It didn't seem like things were going to get done, as usual. We were very disappointed inÂ Perimeter and their management."" TheÂ company plans to meet with leadership again in the future, Carlos Castillo, Perimeter's VP of commercial operations, said in an emailed statement. ""We have been serving Manitoba's northern communities for 60 years and take our commitment to them very seriously and are very proud of our track record,"" Castillo wrote. Shamattawa is currently in a 10-year exclusive contract with Perimeter, signed by the First Nation's previous leadership, Redhead said. ThatÂ means ShamattawaÂ can only use Perimeter at its airportÂ until 2027. Redhead said ShamattawaÂ and sixÂ other First Nations are looking to break similar contracts, and he's in discussions with other carriers. ""They have a monopoly on air transport in the north,"" he said. ""When you have a monopoly, you don't have to provide adequate service. You don't have to provide low fares, you don't have to be on time. Perimeter is notorious for being late. They're notorious forÂ treating our people as second-class citizens, and that needs to stop,"" he said.Â  Castillo said by email if Shamattawa's leadershipÂ ""would like to revisit the agreement, we would be pleased to do so."" Communities like Shamattawa, which is 750 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, rely heavily on the one flight a day in and out of their community. The planes not only transportÂ people, but also food, suppliesÂ and the mailÂ when the fly-in communityÂ is notÂ accessible byÂ winter ice road. A round trip ticket between Winnipeg and Shamattawa costs close to $900, the airline's website says. The majority of Perimeter'sÂ clients are in isolated communities, the company'sÂ websiteÂ says. The airline, operated out of Winnipeg, provides passenger airline service, medevac operations and cargo services to locations in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.

Over the last two years, the military's Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security program has awarded nearly $5 million in contracts to Canadian companies and university researchers to find ways to identify some of the millions of pieces of junk orbiting the Earth. Now it is preparing to award more contracts hoping to find a way to get rid of the junk once it has been identified. The European Space Agency estimates more than 129 million pieces of space junk are circling our planet, most of them smaller than a raisin. The junk, often remnants of space vehicles and other debris from human- or remotely-controlled trips into space, travel at speeds of up to 28,000 kilometres per hour and pose significant risks to working space craft and satellites.

Allan Hubley, is laying blame for the train shortage that's wreaking havoc on morning and afternoon commutes squarely on the maintenance company hired to keep them in working order. Riders endured more unreliable LRT service Monday and Tuesday, when there were as few as eight double trainsÂ in circulation. OC Transpo normally deploys 13 trains during rush hour. Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM), an offshoot of Confederation Line builderÂ Rideau Transit Group (RTG), has been tasked with a host of responsibilitiesÂ necessary to keep the trains â€” and the rest of the systemÂ â€” running smoothly. But that work isn't getting done, and that's what's causing the problems, Hubley said in an interview with CBCÂ on Tuesday.Â  ""If they do the maintenance ... we wouldn't be having these issues,"" he said. One of RTM's task is making sure ""wheel flats""Â â€” when train wheels lose their perfect roundness, causing them to grind on the tracksÂ â€” don't occur. It hasn't been doing that to satisfaction, Hubley said. ""They're always supposed to be looking at [the wheels], grinding them,"" Hubley said.Â ""They're supposed to be checking it and it looks to us at this point that they haven't been doing that."" OC Transpo employees can't do the maintenance work themselves, Hubley explained, leaving the city to rely on RTM. Ottawa LRT running with only 10 trains Because of the numerous and ongoing maintenance issues, the city has been withholding payments to RTM since September's Confederation Line launch, an amount that fluctuates between aboutÂ $4 million and $5 millionÂ per month.Â  Ottawa is locked in a contract with the company for the next 30 years. ""I'd rather they do their job,"" Hubley said. ""We'll pay them their money, everybody will be happier on the trains."" Out on the platforms, passengers have just about had it. Claudia Desnoyers said she had high hopes forÂ LRT, but after Tuesday's trip to work, her patience with the system has evaporated.Â  ""It was very terrible,"" Denoyers said.Â ""[It] took me 15 minutes to just be able to board the train and it was jam-packed again. I had to let one through because there was no place on it, and the second one wasn't really any better."" David Jeanes of transit advocacy group Transport Action Canada said it seems like a new problem creeps up every day.Â  ""We need better maintenance,Â we need those trains in service,Â we need the trains to be properly cleaned,"" Jeanes said.Â ""We need to solve these problems with brakes seizing and causing flat wheels."" Hubley said he's fully aware of the frustration boiling over among passengers, and assured them he's feeling it himself. ""I don't know the word but I'm going to have to invent one because there is really no good description of how upset I am about this,"" he said. Hubley added he's cautiously optimistic all the trains will be up and running soon. ""I'm hoping that today, tomorrow at the latest, and things will be better. But I can't promise you that,"" he said. A meeting of the transit commission has been hastily called for Thursday, when representatives from RTM will be expected to provide some answers.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/lrt-maintance-hubley-1.5434955,[],N/A376,Adam Miller,2020-01-18T09:00:00.516Z,Why flu season could make it harder for doctors to diagnose vaping-related illness,"A 20-year-old man shows up in a U.S. emergency room with flu-like symptoms.Â  He's hospitalized for four days before leaving, against medical advice, only to return to the ER with chest pain, fever and shortness of breath.Â  By this point he's lost almost 20 pounds. Doctors are stumped. They test him for strep throat, hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases, all of which turn up negative.Â  It's only when a camera is inserted into his airway and a CT scan is done to examine his lungs that it's confirmed he has vaping-related illness. The case, published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency PhysiciansÂ this week, highlights the challenges in diagnosing vaping-related illness â€”Â especially during flu season. Canada is currently facing an early start to flu season, with both influenza A and B strains circulating at the same time.Â  So far, there have been nearly 12,500 confirmed cases of flu across the country and 10 deaths.Â  Dr. Tereza Martinu, a lung transplant respirologist with Toronto General Hospital who treated an Ontario teen with vaping-related illness last year, said diagnosing it can be difficult for doctors at this time of year. ""It always looks like something else,"" she said, adding that pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and the flu have similar symptoms. ""I think doctors don't think about it, and therefore often don't diagnose it.""Â  Martinu said it's important for doctors to be aware of vaping-related illness, particularly during flu season, and to ask patients about their exposure to vaping in order to rule it out. ""I think it's important to increase our awareness of it,"" she said. ""You need to then at least think about it and ask the right questions such as: Does the patient have exposure to vaping?""Â  Dr. Atul Kapur, an Ottawa-based emergency room doctor and co-chair of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians'Â public affairs committee, says it adds another layer of difficulty for diagnosis.Â  ""Having this as another potential cause of lung problems makes things busier and more difficult in the emergency department,"" he said. ""From our point of view, that's a big problem.""Â  There have been 2,668 reported cases of vaping-related illness in the U.S. and 60 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Â  Canada has had just 16 cases and no deaths in the same time period, a disproportionately low number even with our smaller population. Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s chief medical officer andÂ chair of the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health, said she's surprised by the lower number of cases in Canada.Â  She says it may have something to do with the differences in the availability of legal and illegal products, or how it's diagnosed.Â  The CDC reports that 82 per cent of cases in the U.S. reported using any cannabis vapes, while 57 per cent said they usedÂ any nicotine e-cigarettes. Of those, 33 per cent reported exclusively using cannabis vapes, while 14 per cent said they had only vaped nicotine.Â  In Canada, nine of the 16 cases reported vaping nicotine exclusively. Three said they had vaped cannabis and nicotine, and another three reported vaping cannabis only.Â  An additive called vitamin E acetate has been identified as a ""chemical of concern"" by the CDC in the outbreak of the illness, but has not officially been confirmed as the culprit.Â Â  ""I think it's way too early to identify a clear pattern,"" says Dr. Martin Kolb, director of the respirology division at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. ""I think what that clearly shows us is that these products are not harmless in a way that it was shown and continues to be described by the industry."" ""It absolutely is under-reported,"" said Henry. ""We are going to absolutely miss some and it's a challenge â€”Â it's a diagnostic challenge for clinicians that we face all the time."" She said the difficulty is that the diagnosis relies on a doctor asking questions specifically about vaping and patients being upfront about their use.Â  Kapur, with the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, says it can also take time for a team of experts to identify the illness. ""There is going to be a bit of a delay before people are making the link and ruling out other causes,"" he said. ""The problem with this, of course, is that they get worse fairly quickly.""Â  Kapur said patients will often quit vaping when symptoms persist, adding another challenge, which is what happened in the U.S. case study.Â  ""Because the symptoms are of breathing, a lot of patients are probably stopping on their own,"" KapurÂ said.Â ""And so there may be some milder cases that aren't connected at all. SoÂ that would account for some under-reporting in both countries."" That decision to quit vaping during treatment could also lead to a misdiagnosis, Martinu said.Â  ""If the patient stops using it and improves, then we may have diagnosed some of those problems as something that is much more common,"" she said.Â  Henry said there may be people with milder, undiagnosed cases in the community that are unknown to health officials who couldÂ be at risk of severe influenza or other viral illnesses circulating this time of year.Â  ""I have no doubt that there are some people hospitalized and it is likely either exacerbated or related to their vaping that we don't know about,"" said Henry.Â  ""That's why it's so important to get these messages out, particularly for young people about the issues that can come up with vaping and why it's not a good thing to do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illnesses-1.5386125 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-vitamin-e-1.5404858 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-liquid-tests-1.5381363 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/vaping-lung-transplant-1.5359105,N/A377,Dan Taekema,2019-12-13T22:38:54.610Z,Murder charge withdrawn against 18-year-old in stabbing death of student Devan Selvey,"A first-degree murder charge against the 18-year-old accused in the stabbing death of Hamilton high school student Devan SelveyÂ has been withdrawn, and he'sÂ insteadÂ facing assault charges.

""I didn't want to let him go just like that,"" Tiwari said. That answer was supposed to emerge during a wrongful death lawsuitÂ againstÂ the William Osler Health System's Brampton Civic Hospital. The family filed the $12.5 million suit in 2015Â and has been waiting for its day in court ever since. But now, Tiwari will have to wait even longer to bid his son goodbye. The reason: there isn't a single courtroom available in the Toronto area to hear Prashant Tiwari's case. It's a problem Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General acknowledges outright, saying it is working with its legal partners to find ways to address the delays and backlogs within the province's justice system. A recent report by provincial Auditor General Bonnie LysykÂ found Ontario courtrooms operated for only 2.8 hours on an average businesses day, with nearly three-quarters of all courthouses reporting ""above-average"" delays. Tiwari can still remember the day Prashant came to him, self-inflicted wounds all over his neck and chest, telling his father he needed help. It was June 16, 2014. TiwariÂ did the one thing he thought he was supposed to do in that moment: take his son to the hospital. Ten days later, Prashant was deadÂ â€” according to the lawsuit, the 20-year-old had hangedÂ himself in the hospital's bathroom. HeÂ was allegedly left unattended for two hours and 40 minutes before staff found his body. Tiwari believed staff were supposed to check on his son every 15 minutes.Â  After his death, the statement of claim alleges, 12 people accessed Prashant's medical records without proper authorization for unknown reasons. None of the allegations has been proven in court. William Osler Health System, the organization that runs the hospital, has previously said, ""While we do not comment on an individual patient case, we have and continue to express our sincere condolences for the family's loss."" Just how a young man could have died by suicide when he was supposed to be under the watchful eye of hospital staff is the question that haunts Prashant's family.Â  On Jan. 8, 2020, they thought they would be able to begin answering that question. ""We were at the steps of the courthouse, we were ready to start the trial and frankly the hospital was ready,"" the family's lawyerÂ Michael SmitiuchÂ told CBC News. But once inside the courthouse, they learned there were no courtroomsÂ â€” not in Brampton, Toronto, Milton, Kitchener or OrangevilleÂ â€” to hear the case until 2021. ""There's a saying, justice delayed is justice denied, and that's the case here,"" Smitiuch said. To prepare for the case, Tiwari and his other son,Â GautamÂ Tiwari, had to undertake the painful process of gathering all of Prashant'sÂ paperwork: photos, medical records, letters, all windows into the pain he was living through. ""So we're very vividly reliving the trauma,"" said Gautam. ""Then, when we're told we have to delay, it's like now we're going to have to go through all of this all over again a year from now."" Their lawyer acknowledges court staff and judges are doing their best under the constraints, but saysÂ much more funding needs to be allocated toward the justice system for it toÂ deliver justice. ""Funding is crucial from the Ontario government,"" saidÂ Smitiuch. ""They need to throw more resources at the court system. We also need more judgesÂ â€” there's no doubt that there is a need for the federal appointment of judges."" As part of its efforts to help cut down on the backlog, the Ministry of the Attorney General says it has expanded access to a ""Simplified Procedure"" process. Starting Jan. 1, 2020, Ontarians with civil court claims up to $200,000 can use that expedited process, which the ministry hopes will result in reduced wait times. The Small Claims Court limit has also been increased to $35,000, which should see many civil cases diverted fromÂ the Superior Court, freeing up resources for other cases. ""With respect to criminal court delay, the right to be tried within a reasonable time is a fundamental part of our justice system,"" ministry spokesperson Brian Gray said in a statement. But while the auditor general flagged the delaysÂ in access to justice inÂ her 2019 report, she also highlightedÂ a lack of data that would have provided a clearer picture of just how deep the problem runs. ""During our audit, we experienced significant scope limitations in our access to key information related to court scheduling ... As a result, we were unable to assess whether public resources, such as courtrooms, are scheduled and used optimally to help reduce delays,"" the report said. This year, whenÂ Prashant should have turned 27, Tiwari is left wondering if he'll ever see justice for his son. Not only does he feel let down by the medical system, but by the court system too. ""It's delay after delay,"" he said. ""I'm losing hope inside my head and my heart. ""How many more lives have to be lost?""

Although her body has never been found,Â Greg Fertuck was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in late June 2019. Sheree's disappearance is the focus of a seven-part CBC investigative podcast called The Pit, the culmination of a year-long effort to uncover new information about the case. Now, as he sits behind bars in Saskatoon, charged with first-degree murder, Greg Fertuck is proclaiming his innocence. He said he lied about getting rid of Sheree because he was scared and intimidated by the undercover officers, who he says he believed were criminals. ""I made it up, and we went out supposedly looking for the body. Well, there is no body, so we just drove around to these different places, because it was all BS,"" said Fertuck in an interview with CBC News. ""I didn't kill her and there was no body out there."" Fertuck's claim goes straight to the heart of the controversy over the Mr. Big technique. Critics say it can violate the principles of confession law by creating a culture of fear, and may heighten the risk of false confessions. There have also been accusations it preysÂ on the vulnerabilities of suspects with financial problems or addictions.Â Â  But for families of victims whose cases have gone cold, Mr. Big stings can be the only way to see charges laid and justice for their loved ones.Â  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, is happy to see progress on the case.Â  ""I think because they are controversial I'm really crossing my fingers and hoping that [the RCMP] did it all the right ways, and did it legally â€_ so that it can be admissible in court,"" she said.Â  ""You get one kick at the cat, right? So I really think that they know what they are doing.""Â  The playing field for Mr. Big stings is evolving under new guidelines outlined by a Supreme Court decision in 2014.Â Â  Still, questions remain about how the courts should balance the rights of the accused with the need for police to have the tools to catch violent criminals. CBC contacted the Saskatchewan RCMP but spokesperson Rob King said the police service will not discuss the technique or address criticisms of the method, because it is still being used.Â  Mr. Big stings have been carried out hundreds of times in Canada since they were developed by the RCMP in the 1990s, often in elaborate operationsÂ â€” some haveÂ cost more than $300,000 to run.Â  The tactic is not used in the U.S. or Britain, but it has been used to produceÂ charges in Australia. In the stings,Â officers befriend a suspect while pretending to be members of a fictitious crime organization.Â  The goal is to build trust with the target and potentially draw out new information to use as evidence. This could include a confession to a crime, a description of how the crime occurred, or the location of the victim's body or the murder weapon.Â  The method is often used in cold cases, where the policeÂ have a suspect but lack the evidence to prosecute.Â  Saskatoon defence lawyer Brian Pfefferle has represented three people charged with separate serious crimes after a Mr. Big sting.Â  He said the technique is highly successful in landing convictions.Â  ""I've never been able to convince a jury that there was a false confession made. And I think my results are consistent with other people's results around the country,"" said Pfefferle.Â  ""There's a smattering of cases that have led to acquittals or convictions on lower offences but for the most part they're getting convicted of the offence they're facing when they're giving these types of confessions, so it's very significant evidence."" Each of the operations follows a similar script: the undercover agents insert themselves into the target's lives through a ""chance"" meeting, and bring them further into the ""organization"" through a chain of scenarios.Â  In an interview at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre in July, Fertuck shared details of the operation with CBC.Â  He said an undercover officer offered him paid jobs transporting vehicles from one town to another. Paid work is regularly offered to Mr. Big suspects during the course of the sting, and Fertuck said he trusted the men. It's common for the suspect to feel a strong kinship with the undercover officers in the stings, says Pfefferle. ""They become real friends,"" he said.Â  ""I've had situations where the people 'fall in love,' essentially, with the various charactersÂ â€”Â not in a romantic sense but in a friendship sense, where ... oftentimes the best friends they've ever had in their life are these fictitious friends."" Fertuck also described another hallmark of the Mr. Big method: a scenario known as ""the violent incident.""Â  He said he met with a man who appeared to have committed a killing â€” and another man who said he would clean it up. ""This one guy [said he] killed his girlfriend, and I know he had blood all over him, scratches on his face,"" said Fertuck.Â  ""And this guy from Vancouver ...Â come in and got rid of everything, sort of the clean-up guy."" Some type of simulated violence is part of most Mr. Big stings. DuringÂ aÂ 2015Â appeal of a first-degree murder conviction,Â the officer who directed an undercover operation involving murder suspect Jesse WestÂ explained the reason for choosing to simulate violence against a woman as part of the sting: ""It was directly to show Mr. West that violence against women was accepted in our organization. The investigation was a homicide on a female and we wanted to show him that women â€” to conduct violence on women is not a big deal."" In that case, the judge denied the defence claim that the violent incident was an abuse of process, and the appeal of West's conviction was dismissed. In the case of Abiram Subramaniam, who wasÂ convicted in 2016 of second-degree murder in Quebec, the ""criminals"" told the suspect they had information that police were coming after him.Â  The details are part of a written decision by Justice Marc-Andre Blanchard.Â  ""The Boss was willing to â€_ help him get out of this situation related to the victim,"" Justice Blanchard wrote. ""Without his help, it was made clear that Subramaniam would in all likelihood be going to jail for 25 years."" Pfefferle said he considers confession evidence such as that from Mr. Big stingsÂ even more damning for the accused than video evidence. His main concerns about the technique relate to confession law, which states that a confession must be made of free will and without any threats or promises made to the accused.Â  ""The problem with Mr. Bigs, at their core, is that they are based on exactly those things â€” not necessarily direct threats, but there is this subtle threat of this organization being pretty bad."" There are also promises, Pfefferle said. ""Oftentimes it's promises for a long-term job with the criminal organization, and many times these particular accused persons will have difficulty with employment."" He said Mr. Big stings are also different from traditional police investigations because most of the interactions are not recorded.Â  Usually when a person is arrested, all of their interactions with police in the interview room are recorded. In Mr. Big stings, usually only the final interview, or a handful of meetings, are taped. But Pfefferle also sees broader issues with the way the stings operate. Although there is evidence that false confessions have occurred, he said society has a tendency to believe an admission of guilt.Â  ""If you've confessed to something, especially something that is embarrassing or it's going to get you in trouble, most people believe you did it,"" said Pfefferle.Â  ""I think that's one of the problems with Mr. Bigs because the evidence at the end of the day is so strong in the minds of the average juror that they're going to say 'he wouldn't have confessed if he didn't do it.'"" People have been cleared of committing crimes they confessed to during a Mr. Big sting.Â  Kyle Unger spent 14 years in jail for the murder of Brigitte Grenier in Manitoba in 1990.Â  He was convicted based largely on his confession, testimony from jailhouse informants and a single piece of forensic evidence â€” a hair found on the victim's clothing.Â  But DNA testing later proved the hair did not belong to Unger. And although he gotÂ key facts wrong about the killing in his confession to undercover officers,Â it was still used against him.Â  He later told reporters he'd lied because he wasÂ young, naive and desperate for money. Unger was acquittedÂ in 2009.Â  Al Haslett, a retired RCMP officer and one of the creators of the Mr. Big sting, previously defended the technique in an interview with CBC's The Fifth Estate in 2015. ""[We] seek the truth. We don't go there, we don't wake up in the morning and say 'we're going to get confessions,'"" Haslett said in an interview with Bob McKeown.Â Â  ""This is not a bunch of cowboy cops going out and doing this. This is planned, the scenarios are planned, thought out, and we go to seek the truth."" Haslett was not available to be interviewed by CBC for this story. However, ""things can go off the rails and people can, because of fear, say and do things that might not otherwise be true, or that they might not otherwise have done,"" said Neil Boyd,Â the director of the school of criminology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. But heÂ pointed to the case of Doug HoltamÂ as an example of a case where a Mr. Big sting led to a conviction that was warranted.Â  HoltamÂ was convicted of the 1997 murder ofÂ his wife Leonora and six-year-old daughter with a hammer. He was also found guilty of the attempted murder of his son, who survived the attack. Police had DNA evidence of his children's blood on his shirt and shoe before the Mr. Big sting led to a confession.Â  ""His conviction was entirely warranted, so I don't take the position that just because the police have engaged in this kind of activity that it's necessarily suspect,"" said Boyd.Â  It is up to the courts to decide if a case has gone ""off the rails"" or not, he said. That's what the Supreme Court did in 2014, when theÂ case of Nelson Hart in Newfoundland led to stricter rules for Mr. Big stings. The court concluded the conduct of policeÂ in that case was ""egregious"" and ""troubling."" Justice Michael Moldaver wrote that the law at that time didn't offer enough protection to people who confessed to crimes during Mr. Bigs.Â  He said while these types of stings can produce valuable evidence and are not necessarily abusive, they canÂ become abusive and produce unreliable confessions. He ruled police should be allowed to keep using the tactic, butÂ under stricter rules.Â  Mr. Big confessions are now automatically considered inadmissible unless the Crown can prove their value as evidence outweighs their capacity to prejudice the outcome of trial. ProsecutorsÂ have successfully done so in several cases since 2014.Â  The 2014 Supreme Court decision also offered clearer guidelines for judges deciding if Mr. Big evidence should be admissible, and to help them decide what counts as police misconduct.Â  The Public Prosecution Service of Canada wrote about the impact of the case against Hart in a 2018 report titled Innocence at Stake: The Need for Continued Vigilance to Prevent Wrongful Convictions in Canada. The report predicted the courts will likely be more restrictive about what types of violent incidents can be simulated in Mr. Big stingsÂ in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. It offered recommendations for prosecution services, urging them to make sureÂ they do not exploit the target's vulnerabilities, and to take further care to ensure the violent incident does not directly or indirectly threaten the suspect.Â  Juries at Mr. Big trials are also now instructed that people have falsely confessed in the past.Â Â  Brian Pfefferle said the legitimacy of the confession will likely beÂ at the heart of the Crown'sÂ case against Greg Fertuck.Â  ""The strength of that confession is really going to be the focus for the jury, as it always is,"" said Pfefferle.Â  ""What can be corroborated through the forensic evidence?""Â  Another factor in the Fertuck case will be the fact that Sheree's body has not been found. It is unusual for police to lay charges without finding the victim.Â  Greg Fertuck said he led the undercover officersÂ toÂ a country road outside Saskatoon. In the days after his June arrest, police were seen searching an area not far from the gravel pit where Sheree's truck was found,Â but they did not find her remains.Â  RCMP Insp. Diane Cockle saysÂ searching for human remains that have been left outside for four years is an incredibly difficult task.Â  ""What happens to the remains is they get weathered, they change colour, they get bleached by the sun or they get stained by the soil,"" said Cockle, whoÂ has a PhD in forensic anthropology and worked as a forensic crime scene investigator for 19 years. She now works in major crimes.Â  ""The vegetation gets deposited on top of the area over time so they end up being buried. And it becomes less and less visible every year."" Scavengers including domestic dogs, coyotes and birds can move parts of a body up to about 400-500 metres from where the body was dumped, she said. ""But if these guys [in Saskatchewan] were searching in a systematic matter looking for things like small bone fragments and they knew what they were looking for, chances are they would have found what they were looking for."" On June 25, the day after Greg Fertuck'sÂ arrest, the search for Sheree Fertuck was still ongoing when RCMP Supt. Derek Williams announced the charges.Â  ""Although it's unusual, there have been successful prosecutions before without a body being found,"" said Williams.Â  A preliminary hearing will be held in January to decide if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. The hearing is likely to be subject to a publication ban.Â  To date, Greg Fertuck has been represented by Saskatoon criminal defence lawyer Morris Bodnar.Â  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, hopes to attend the upcoming court proceedings, although she fears the evidence will be difficult to hear. Regardless, she is relieved to see the progress from a police perspective. ""I was a little bit afraid that, you know, cases do go cold, right. You hear that all the time. And I just thought, 'Oh GodÂ â€_ this can't be one of them. Something's gotta come of it.'""Â  The preliminary hearing begins on Jan. 13.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mr-big-sting-saskatchewan-greg-fertuck-rcmp-police-canada-1.5388277,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/greg-fertuck-denies-killing-sheree-fertuck-1.5212297 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/friend-remembers-sheree-fertuck-at-accused-killer-s-court-appearance-in-saskatoon-1.5220735 https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2014-2015/mrbig https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kyle-unger-lawsuit-settled-1.5115948 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mr-big-ruling-a-game-changer-for-those-convicted-in-sting-operations-1.2724310,N/A382,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-22T14:57:21.357Z,Harvey Weinstein trial set for opening statements,"Harvey Weinstein arrived at court Wednesday to face the biggest trial of the #MeToo era, with opening statements soon to start in the rape case seen as a symbol of a global reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein, 67, walked past a phalanx of cameras and reporters as he arrived at a Manhattan courthouse. More than two years after allegations against the former movie magnate sparked an outcry that mushroomed into the #MeToo movement, the trial is a landmark moment for activists demands for accountability, victims' empowerment and frank confrontation with power dynamics in workplaces from Hollywood Boulevard to Main Street. Weinstein's accusers include some well-known actresses who plan to testify or attend the trial and others who are looking to the New York case for a form of justice because their allegations haven't resulted in criminal charges. ""This trial is so important because the enormity of Harvey Weinstein's international power and fame offers an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the rampant abuse of power that permeates our culture on a global level,"" actress Jessica Barth said Tuesday. ""Not only the outcome of this trial, but the trial as a whole, is precedent setting,"" said Barth, a star of the TedÂ films who says Weinstein once invited her to his hotel suite and demanded a naked massage. Weinstein's trial could take more than a month, Judge James Burke said. Judging from an arduous two-week jury selection that netted a panel of seven men and five women, it could be a hotbed of protests and intense media coverage. Extra court officers have been lining the front of the Manhattan courthouse where Weinstein, 67, has been ambling in and out with a walker that his lawyers say was necessitated by a summer car crash and subsequent back surgery. In a failed last-minute push to get the trial moved, Weinstein's lawyers said a flash mob's chanting ""the rapist is you!"" at street level could be heard in the courtroom, 15 floors above. Adding to the drama, actor Cuba Gooding Jr. is due at the same courthouse Wednesday for a hearing in a case in which several women have accused him of groping. He's denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Though dozens of women have accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them over the years, his New York trial involves just a pair of allegations: that he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulted a different woman in 2006. Backed by expected testimony from four other accusers, prosecutors will attempt to portray Weinstein as a monster who used his power to ingratiate himself with women, sometimes promising a film role or other career advancement, before sexually assaulting or raping them. One of them, actress Annabella Sciorra will testify that Weinstein forced himself inside her Manhattan apartment and raped her in 1993 or 1994 after she starred in a film for his movie studio. While Sciorra's allegations are outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges, the judge has said her testimony can be used to prove predatory sexual assault charges, which carries a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct. Weinstein's lawyers say any encounters were consensual. They plan to go on the offensive, pointing to ""dozens and dozens and dozens of loving emails to Mr. Weinstein"" they say show he and some of his accusers were in consenting relationships. Defence lawyer Damon Cheronis said some of the women ""also bragged about being in a sexual relationship with him."" Once trailed by whispers in Hollywood circles, Weinstein was met with an explosion of allegations from dozens of women after The New York Times and The New Yorker published separate exposes about his behaviour in October 2017. After opening statements, prosecutors are expected to call a former member of the board of directors at Weinstein's old movie studio to testify about how the company handled allegations against him. One issue that has remained unresolved in the trial is the defence's objection to a juror who wrote an upcoming novel about young women that includes, according to the book's publicity materials, descriptions of their relationships with predatory older men. If she is removed and replaced as a juror, that'll leave just two remaining alternates for the trial. Once the New York trial is over, Weinstein faces additional rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. Those charges were filed this month as jury selection in his New York trial was getting underway.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-opening-statements-1.5435800,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gooding-court-misconduct-1.5344047 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035,N/A383,Ben Mussett,2020-01-22T14:00:00.576Z,"How to say 'Hi' to Harry and Meghan, according to an etiquette expert","If British Columbians happen to spot the much-talked-about Duke and Duchess of Sussex, treat them like cats: let them come to you.Â  At least, that's according to Vancouver etiquette expert Elizabeth Burnett.Â  ""I would wait for them to attend to me,"" Burnett told Kathryn Marlow, guestÂ host of CBC's All Point West. ""I wouldn't just go up and tap him on the shoulder and say, 'Oh, hello, Harry, how are you?'"" ""We have to remember that Harry will always be royal,"" she added. ""It's in his blood.""Â  If presented to the newcomers, Burnett advised people to bow or curtsy. And never, she said, touch a royal. Instead, stand straight forward facing them with your arms at your sides.Â  However, Burnett also encouraged people to consider the situation before deciding how exactly to interact with the world's currently-most-watched couple. Perhaps such strict formality would be out of place on a Vancouver Island hiking trail.Â  Kitsilano residents play it cool over rumours they could be getting royal neighbours ""But you certainly wouldn't go up and start putting your hand out because they would offer their hand to you first and then you would shake hands,"" said Burnett, founder and president of Elizabeth Etiquette, an etiquette school. After announcing they would take a step back from their royal roles and work to become financially independent, Buckingham Palace and the Queen said on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of Britain's monarchy, no longer use their ""Royal Highness"" titles and would now pay their own way in life. So, what then should we call them? ""Well of course they're not His and Her Royal Highnesses anymore,"" noted Burnett. Trudeau says he hasn't spoken to Queen about security costs after Harry arrives in Canada She said they should still be addressed as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, titles they still officially hold, along with the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton and the Baron and Baroness Kilkeel. But, in the end, they may prefer simply Harry and Meghan.Â  ""They would like to be treated, I believe, as just one of the locals,"" said Burnett. Prince Harry â€” yes, he's still a prince â€” reportedly landed at Victoria International Airport on Monday night before reuniting with Meghan and their young son, Archie. The duchess and her eight-month-oldÂ have been staying on B.C.'s West Coast, where the family spent the Christmas holiday, after briefly returning to the United Kingdom earlier this month.Â  Royal watchers continue toÂ feverishly speculateÂ over where in Canada the Duke and Duchess might plant roots, with Greater Victoria, Vancouver and Toronto as apparent top contenders.

He lived on the Siksika First Nation, but growing up, he went to school and played hockey in Strathmore, Alta., a small town 20 kilometres north of the reserve.Â  He was seen as a bridge between the two communities in which he lived â€”Â until the night in March when he was shot and killed. A couple of days later, two men from Strathmore were charged with first degree murder in the 24-year-old's death.Â  ""My son was a very, very good kid, and well loved and liked by everybody,"" said Melodie Ayoungman, Kristian's mother. ""And the reality behind it is, it was an act of racism that took his life. And that's hard for me to comprehend."" Ayoungman said she believes her son's death was the result of racism, because of what happened in the hours before the shooting. Kristian, a champion pow-wow dancer on the reserve, was also a hockey star in town. On March 17, he played in an alumni hockey game in Strathmore. Kristian and his friends Brooker Prettyyoungman, Ryley McMaster and Breanna Crawler went to a local pub after the game. They say at the end of the night an exchange with strangers outside the bar led to a fight that was peppered with racial slurs.Â  ""He was like just calling me names, and he told me 'to go back to the f--king reserve you f--king dirty Indians â€_ get the f--k out of here,'"" Crawler said.Â  She added that she didn't know the man who yelled at her, but now believes it was Kody Giffen, one of the men charged with Ayoungman's murder.Â  ""I was looking at him and I was like, 'Are you serious? Like, don't talk to me like that.' I'm like, that's racist, right?"" Crawler, McMaster and Prettyyoungman say the altercation didn't last long and the two groups separated. They ran into each other again shortly afterwards, but this time, they say the group of men was larger and they had weapons. Crawler said when she and her friends saw a gun, they got into their truck and tried to leave. They said the men got into another vehicle and chased them out of town. Crawler was driving the truck and headed toward Siksika when she heard a gunshot.Â  ""I looked in the rear-view mirror. And by that time, that white car was behind me ... I seen it stop in like five seconds, it was like really fast. We heard a shot,"" Crawler said. ""I felt something on my back â€_ and I was thinking, like, I was thinking to myself did I get shot? Did I get shot? â€_. And then Kristian said, 'They got me, bro. They got me.'"" Ayoungman had been shot. His friends got him out of the truck, and he died on the side of the road south of Strathmore. Prettyyoungman and Crawler didn't see where the shot came from or who fired the gun that killed Ayoungman. Two days later on March 19, Kody Giffen, 22, and his brother Brandon, 25, â€”Â both from Strathmore â€”Â were charged with first degree murder. Brandon Giffen is in custody and Kody Giffen was granted bail in August. Both are scheduled to appear in court in the new year.Â  CBC News reached out to both for comment, but they declined through their lawyers. Although the trial of the brothers is several months away, some in the community are drawing parallels to the high-profile death of Colten Boushie, a young Indigenous man shot and killed by a white man in rural Saskatchewan in 2016. Unlike Boushie, Ayoungman's death received very little media attention. In the immediate aftermath of his death, avoiding the media was part of a strategy by Ayoungman's family and Siksika leadership to keep racial tensions from escalating.Â  Buck Breaker, a councillor on the Siksika First Nation, said he worried that if they didn't handle the situation carefully, more violence would follow. ""I'll make reference to the Colton Boushie tragedy â€”Â we didn't want to, like I said, cause any more animosity than was already there. A lot of our people were angry, and still are. But you know, we had to be careful on what we say,"" Breaker said.Â  ""A lot of the tension is on social media, Facebook or whatever, so we didn't want that to escalate to the point where our young people would go into Strathmore and take more action. If that was what would have happened â€”Â the jail cells would have been full and the morgue would have been full and the courthouse would have been full."" Melodie Ayoungman was pivotal in helping to keep people calm. She set the tone for how both communities would respond to Ayoungman's death. Instead of turning to anger, she turned to her Blackfoot culture and the teachings from her grandparents and called for peace between the two communities.Â  ""My son's life was taken in the wrong way, but this isn't the way we're going to deal with it. Not with revenge. We weren't taught like that,"" she said. The situation was so tense, Melodie Ayoungman heard that people from the reserve, including Prettyoungman and Crawler, were worried about going into Strathmore after Kristian's death.Â  ""They were traumatized,"" Ayoungman said. ""I didn't want our community to be afraid or feel scared. [I wanted] to show them, 'No, you can keep your head up. Be proud of who you are. Be proud of where you come from.Â  We belong here.'"" Ayoungman organized a candlelight vigil. People from her community travelled from Siksika into Strathmore, where they were met by dozens of people in town to honour her son. Strathmore mayor Pat Fule was among them. He's a longtime resident in Strathmore and a former teacher. Following the vigil, he took an unusual step that he said upset some residents of the predominantly white town. He wrote a letter in the local paper, admitting there was racism in Strathmore and called on people to confront it directly. He wrote: ""Until we can admit that racism is here â€”Â and due to the recent murder, our neighbours now worry about coming to Strathmore â€”Â we can't improve."" Fule said there was a mixed reaction to his letter, but that it was an important step to building a better relationship between the two communities. ""I was worried about the controversy â€_ but sometimes you have to do the right thing even if the right thing is the most painful or difficult thing to do. And so I decided I would do that."" Since Ayoungman's death last spring, Siksika and Strathmore leadership have been holding regular meetings â€” something that had never happened before, even though the two communities have been been neighbours for more than 100 years. Outside of school or sports, Mayor Fule said there was very little interaction between the two communities. ""Now, I'm saying hi to a First Nations person I run into at a store where maybe before I would [not]. I would not be rude or anything, but you just get comfortable in not doing things, you just interact silently,"" said Mayor Fule. ""And so I'm reaching out a little more, I'm holding doors, I'm saying hi."" It's too early to say whether the efforts of the community leaders will lead to reconciliation. The steps are small and the progress is slow, but Melodie Ayoungman has big hopes. She wants her son's tragic death to be a wake-up call for her community and others like it.Â  ""I hope that this can change the future for First Nations, because there's so much injustice towards First Nations and times need to change. Maybe this is one of the cases that can make that change happen.""

Infuriating, yes, but ""not shocking,"" said Amani Oakley, a Toronto-areaÂ lawyer who has battled nursing home chains for over two decades, and who currently has several lawsuits underway against Cascades owner Sienna Senior Living,Â formerly Leisureworld.Â  ""I'm infuriated that we still are allowing these corporations to make money off our seniors â€_ while delivering shoddy care,"" Oakley said. Burgon was first contacted on Dec.Â 20, 2018 by the CascadesÂ headÂ nurse, who was filling in for the vacationing executive director. She says she was told that a resident living next to her mother had brought bedbugs into the facility and that a single bedbug had been found on Bedford's bed. ""I assumed they knew what they were doing,"" said Burgon. ""I thought it would be not much of a big deal."" But according to a timeline the home later provided to health authorities, employeesÂ had, on Dec. 19, found ""10 small bite marks"" on Bedford's back and arms, ""blood spots"" on her bed and ""five possible bed bugs"" on her floor.Â  Staff were told to ""wash and change"" Bedford, and a pest control company was brought in, though only the apartment next to hers was heat-treated and vacuumed, according to the timeline.Â In Bedford's apartment, an antÂ trapÂ was placed between her mattress and box spring.Â  After two weeks, on Jan. 2, a Cascades employee complained to regulators with theÂ Ministry of Health, reportingÂ she and her colleagues were being instructed to keep Bedford confined to her room. ""Please help,"" the employee wrote in an email. ""It's inhumane.""Â  She claimed management told staff to lie to Bedford â€”Â that she was sick and couldn't visit with friends or share Christmas dinner with other residents. She also alleged management threatened to fire any staff who spoke publicly or to other residents about the outbreak.Â  ""I just can't do it any longer,"" the employee wrote, calling Bedford a ""blood buffet.""Â  ""This woman is 94 and blind. Locked in a room, being chewed up while management hides it."" That same day staff moved Bedford and her neighbour to new suites. Management later claimed, in the timeline, that they didn't have other rooms available until then. AnÂ employeeÂ secretly described what her mother had endured over the holidays, Burgon says. ""I was told of her crying and asking repeatedly, 'Are these bugs crawling on my skin?'"" she said. ""It broke my heart ... I felt betrayed.""Â  Around then,Â Cascades executive director Rob White returned from vacation.Â  Burgon says he told her that Sienna did not know how to handle theÂ bedbug outbreak and says he repeatedly complained to her about the cost of dealing with it. ""I had to listen to his concerns about how expensive this was and how much time it was taking him away from his job,"" Burgon said.Â  White did not respond to Go Public's request for an interview. Oakley, the lawyer,Â says she hears so many complaints of neglect and abuse involving Canada's three largest for-profit seniors' homes that last year, she filed a proposed class-action lawsuit involving 200 families. The lawsuitÂ namedÂ Extendicare, which runs 96 homes across the country;Â Sienna, which operates 83; and Revera, which runs 76.Â  Oakley alleged the companies were ""systematically negligent"" but the Ontario Superior Court of Justice discontinued the lawsuit, says Oakley, because the cases were too dissimilar.Â  She is instead pursuing dozens of individual lawsuits on behalf of the families. None of the allegations has been proven in court and all three companies deny the allegations have merit.Â  Oakley says because privately owned chains receive provincial subsidies for some clients, government oversight needs to be rigorous. ""Part of the problem is that [government] inspections tend to be announced,"" said Oakley. ""So they [long-term care chains] know when the inspectors are coming, weeks ahead of time."" Go Public asked several provinces whether their inspections are announced or unexpected.Â  Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario said some inspections are not announced, while others are and happen every one to two years â€”Â more often if a complaint is reported or a problem found. Nova Scotia said all inspections are unannounced and happen at least twice a year. Inspections in B.C. were previously only triggered by complaints. New legislation that takes effect Dec.Â 1Â allows inspections at any time.Â  But even when problems are discovered â€” Oakley saysÂ many homes are understaffed, and she often hears ofÂ one nurse being in charge of 60 people at nighttime â€”Â Â getting justice can be a challenge. She says the courts don't place much value on the lives of elderly people who are no longer working. ""I've been told by a judge that I'm wasting his time because the case is [financially] modest,"" she said.Â  Sienna Senior Living is a publicly-traded company worth $1.25 billion in 2018. Complaints to regulatorsÂ from staff and BurgonÂ led to an investigation and two reportsÂ in MayÂ and in June, which found Cascades violated regulationsÂ including not providing a ""safe and sanitary environment"" and notÂ protecting residents by responding in a timely manner to allegations of ""abuse and neglect."" The site was also found to not have sufficient staffing levels. As of last week, the home was still ""not in full compliance"" with health and safety standards,Â according to a Ministry of Health spokesperson, whoÂ added that officials had a recent meeting with Sienna to discuss outstanding issues and to ensure the company keeps working toward ""full compliance."" CascadesÂ management apologized in a letter to the familyÂ for the ""housekeeping inadequacies, miscommunications â€_ and the overall experience."" Sienna Senior Living declined an interview request by Go Public, sending a statement that said the company regrets what happened.Â  ""Our goal is to provide all tenants with the best possible quality service and overall retirement living experience through the warmth of human connection,"" wrote a spokesperson. ""We recognized that there were actions that should have been better."" ""We have apologized and worked with the tenant and family to resolve their concerns."" The spokesperson would not say why Bedford was left in herÂ room for two weeks, nor comment on a staffer's allegation that managementÂ threatened to fire any staffers. Burgon decided it would be too disorienting to move her mother â€”Â who turned 95 in February â€”Â to another nursing home. She's worried that speaking out about the care her mom received will bring repercussions,Â but says she wants Sienna held accountable. ""You trust that they're [Sienna] going to uphold their part of â€”Â not even the legal contract, but the social and moral contract,"" says Burgon. ""I'm appalled at how callous they were.""

From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own â€” it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.Â  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""Â  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away.Â Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me â€” they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.Â  This was also the way my parents parented â€” they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you â€” it has to be your own choice.""Â  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes â€” it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.Â  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.Â  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party â€” the discomfort has proven worth it.Â  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people â€” empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective â€” are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""Â  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.Â  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.Â  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like â€” that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business â€” I would never have believed you.Â  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in""Â my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?Â  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it.Â I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.Â  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.Â  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.Â  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

At least nine U.S. law firms are pursuing cases against Canopy Growth, Aurora Cannabis and Hexo Corp. in American courts. Although the allegations vary, each pot producer is accused of misleading investors or failing to disclose certain problems with their businesses. When those problems became publicly known, the lawsuits claim, share prices plunged and investors were stuck with losses. ""[Investors] are mad; they were taken by surprise,"" said Reed Kathrein, a lawyer at Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, which is pursuing claims against all three producers. None of the allegations haveÂ been proven in court. Each of the companies declined to be interviewed for this story. Canopy and Aurora denied the allegations in brief statements, while Hexo said only its lawyers are reviewing the claims. These companies were among several Canadian cannabis firms that listed on U.S. stock exchanges, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm surrounding the industry before and after Canada legalized pot. ""But when they hit obstacles, the share prices declined,"" said Kevin LaCroix, a Cleveland-based lawyer who is not involved in any of the proposed class actions, but has followed the industry. ""It's pretty common in the United States, when a company experiences a significant decline in its share price, opportunistic plaintiff lawyers will try and seize on that as an opportunity to try and make some money."" Even if the lawsuits aren't successful, they could still pose challenges to companies that are trying to win over investors, said Brad Poulos, a lecturer at Ryerson University's Ted Rogers School of Management. ""Anytime there's uncertainty about the future of a company, that's going to create uncertainty in the minds of shareholders,"" Poulos said. ""As the market determines the likelihood of a suit being successful, that will start to get priced into the stock,"" he said. The cases against these three companiesÂ have attracted the attention of at least nine legal firms because of a feature of U.S. law, Kathrein said. After an investor's lawyer files an initial securities lawsuit, they publish a notice, which gives other investors 60 days to apply to the court to become lead plaintiff in the case. Law firms then issue press releases seeking investors in the hopes that they can attract a client who becomes the lead plaintiff. One of the qualifications to become lead plaintiff is they suffered the greatest amount of alleged losses. ""It's a beauty contest,"" Kathrein said. ""These press releases are basically saying, 'Hey, I'm part of the beauty contest; select me.'"" Hexo, based in Gatineau, Que., is accused of failing to tell investors that it was inflating its revenue figures through a process called channel-stuffing, which involves sending retailers more products than they are able to sell.Â A court filingÂ alleges Hexo didn't tell investors its reported cannabis inventory was misstated and that it was growing pot in an Ontario facility not properly licensed by Health Canada. A class-action complaint filed with a New York court says when Hexo announced in MarchÂ 2019 it was buying rival Newstrike Brands, the company said it was acquiring Newstrike's four production facilities. It also said it was ""committing to achieving over $400 million in net revenue in 2020."" But by October, the company withdrew that commitment after projecting its net revenue for 2019 would hit betweenÂ $46.5 millionÂ andÂ $48.5 million. It blamed a slow rollout of retail stores across Canada, a delay in government approvals for edibles and vapes and early signs of falling prices. Two weeks later, Hexo announced 200 layoffs. In November, the company revealed one of the facilities it acquired from Newstrike was growing cannabis without the proper federal approvals. A press release said the firm learned about the problem in July, shut down production and notified Health Canada. ""All told, Hexo has lost hundreds of millions of dollars in market capitalization as a result of these disclosures,"" the complaint says. ""As a result of defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the company's securities, plaintiff and other class members have suffered significant losses and damages."" According to the filing, anyone who bought Hexo shares on U.S. stock exchanges between Jan. 25 and Nov. 15,Â 2019 can join the proposed class action. During that period, Hexo's shares plunged by 65 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange. In a brief email to CBC News, Hexo said it does not comment on litigation issues, but that its legal teamÂ is actively handling the matter. LaCroix, the Cleveland lawyer not involved in any of these claims, says law firms pursuing the cannabis class actions have to meet a high bar. It's not enough to argue that investors lost money. Their lawyers have to prove the defendant companies and executives intended to mislead shareholders when they made the allegedly false or misleading statements, a concept called scienter, he said. ""Scienter is meant to encompass not only actual intent to deceive but reckless indifference or just total indifference to whether or not investors are misled,"" LaCroix said. ""That's often where shareholder claimants fall short, is they don't sufficiently plead scienter."" Kathrein, one of the lawyers pursuing the class actions, said he wouldn't be involved in the cases unless he was convinced he could meet the scienter test. ""We don't just rely on public facts,"" he said. ""We have investigators that get out there and try and find witnesses who can tie the information that was allegedly known to them, tie that information to the senior executives."" Edmonton-based Aurora Cannabis is facing claims the company exaggerated or over-estimated the demand for its pot and produced too much, leading to oversupply. In November, Aurora said it was halting or deferring construction at production facilities in Denmark and Medicine Hat, Alta. It also reported disappointing financial results, including a 24 per cent drop in quarterly net revenues. A couple of months later, the company told mediaÂ it was selling a greenhouse in Exeter, Ont. Another allegation is that Aurora was not up front with investors that it didn't secure necessary approvals from German authorities to use a certain growing method in that country. After a Marijuana Business Daily report revealed German pharmacists were ordered to stop selling Aurora's medical pot until there was a review, the lawsuit says, the company's share price dropped. ""As a result of defendants' wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitousÂ decline in the market value of the company's securities, plaintiffs and other class members have suffered significant losses and damages,"" states the complaint, filed a week ago in a New York court. The filing says anyone who bought Aurora shares on U.S. stock exchanges between Oct. 23, 2018 and Jan 6, 2020 can join the proposed class action. During that period, Aurora's shares plunged by 75 per cent on the New York Stock Exchange, from $7.51 per share to $1.90. Aurora denies the allegations. ""The company believes it has conducted itself in accordance with all relevant securities laws, and refutes these claims,"" it said in a brief statement. ""The company intends to pursue a full defence against these suits."" Canopy Growth, Canada's largest pot producer, is facing allegations it exaggerated or overestimated the potential market for its products in Canadian retail stores, leading to inventory writeoffs and restructuring charges.Â  One class-action complaint says the Smiths Falls, Ont.-based company issued press releases leading up to legalization that it was expanding its production capacity to meet projections of growing demand for cannabis in Canada and around the world.Â  ""As a result of the dissemination of the aforementioned false and misleading reports, releases and public statements, the market price of Canopy securities was artificially inflated,"" the complaint states. In November 2019, the company reported lower-than-expected revenues and a $374.6-million loss.Â  Then-CEO Mark Zekulin told analysts at the time the disappointing results were the result in part of a slow rollout of retail stores in Ontario, which cut its potential Canadian market in half. He said some provinces had slowed their purchases of cannabis because of high inventories, though Canopy's shipments were up in its most recent quarter. Canopy's stock fell on the news. Between Sept.Â 8, 2017 and Nov.Â 13, 2019 â€”Â the period that the proposed class action covers â€”Â Canopy's share price on the New York exchange fell by more than a third, from $28.26 per share to $18.50. When asked for comment on the allegations, Canopy referred to a NovemberÂ 2019 press release, in which the company said it believes it has acted ""in accordance with all relevant securities laws, and that the claims are without merit. ""The company intends to vigorously defend itself against any such suits."" Kathrein, whose law firm is seeking the class actions, said the cases will start to move ahead after deadlines to select lead plaintiffs elapse, starting Monday. Ultimately, he believes the cases will likely be collapsed into one proposed class action for each of the three companies.Â  The defendant companies will likely file motions to dismiss the cases against them, Kathrein said. It could take months to debate those motions, which means they may not be resolved until the end of the year, if not later, he said. If the lawsuits survive that stage, it could take years to reach a resolution through the courts, though both sides could negotiate a settlement.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/major-canadian-pot-companies-facing-proposed-class-action-lawsuits-in-the-u-s-1.5431520,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hexo-s-poor-outlook-could-foreshadow-bad-trip-for-cannabis-industry-1.5318470 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hexo-shares-tumble-1.5409246 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hexo-reports-56-million-fourth-quarter-loss-1.5339629 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/aurora-cannabis-cannabis-construction-1.5360640 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canopy-growth-delay-cannabis-drinks-1.5430755 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canopy-growth-quarter-loss-1.5359058,N/A388,Adam van der Zwan,2020-01-22T13:00:00.566Z,Victoria police request 'cruise lights' to increase visibility on roads,"Victoria police hope to spearhead a one-year pilot project that would see six of their 40 vehicles fitted with solid blueÂ  lights that would be on at all times to increase police visibility. Chief Const. Del Manak told CBC it was ""quite clear"" from the department's 2017 public engagement survey that residents ""would like to see ... increased police engagement with the community."" He said his team has already purchased the lights, which are separate from emergency lightsÂ and wouldÂ activate themÂ after the project is approved by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. ""We want to test it,"" said Manak, of the project. ""The lights [would be] on either end of the light-bar that's on the rooftop of every police car.""Â  Manak noted the lights would be helpful duringÂ the evening, when police cruisers can be difficult to see.Â  The project would be the first of its kind in Canada.Â  Currently, sections 4.28 (2) and (8) of the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations allow red and blue emergency lights onÂ police vehicles.Â Some police departments in the United States, including Georgia, Virginia, Ohio and Hawaii, have recently adopted solid ""cruise lights"" for non-emergencies.Â  Police in Delta B.C., are also ""in the preliminary stages"" of researching cruise lights, said Cris Leykauf, Delta police's public affairs manager. In order for the pilot to take effect, Victoria police must obtain the province's written approval for the new use of lighting, as outlined in section 4.02 of the MVAR. A Freedom of Information request shows police have been seeking approval since last July.Â  Geoff Ford, acting manager of the inspections and standards program with the Ministry of Transportation, told Manak in a letter that he wantsÂ more information. ""While it may seem like a local issue, the act and application of itÂ is a province-wide consideration, and we must be satisfied that this request is able to be attributable to others that may wish to do the same,"" wroteÂ Ford. A statement from the Ministry of Transportation saysÂ that it would ""require support from theÂ British Columbia Association of Chiefs of PoliceÂ and a detailed plan to ensure road users are educated about what to do when seeing a vehicle with blue lights."" Victoria resident Stephen Harrison, who obtained the FOI, said the fact that police have already obtainedÂ the proper lights is ""incredibly presumptuous,"" and spoke against a heightened ""surveillance state,"" especially when Victoria has been one of the most heavily policed cities in Canada.Â  ""[We don't need] cruisers rolling along with lights reminding us that [police] are watching,"" he said. ""Particularly some of those groups that are over-policed like people living in poverty, Indigenous people and people of colour."" Manak said the pilot project wouldn't affect areas that have higher numbers of marginalized people, like the homeless, because ""most ofÂ the preventative work we do there is done by our bike officers â€_ and our foot patrol."" He said he's ""checked in"" with ""supervisors with vested interests in protecting the vulnerable"" and they say they're supportive of the project. Moussa Magassa, co-chairÂ the Greater Victoria Police Diversity Advisory Committee, saidÂ he ""definitely sees this project as a good one,"" especially for visibility, but asÂ a person of colour, he also understands how certain communities ""might feelÂ this will be triggering for them."" Manak said police would undertake a public engagement campaign through social media to educate the public on the project, and would use ""qualitative and quantitative analysis"" in response to the public's feedback.

Pallister said he will continue to have a dialogue with the federal government about Manitoba's strategy, and that he isÂ prepared to modify the provincial plan that could include a carbon price ""of some kind.""Â  He declined to provide details, but said he prefers it would be ""flat and low like the prairie horizon."" Deputy Prime Minister and Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said while Manitoba and the federal government might not share the same perspective on the right approach to tackling climate change, there is muchÂ respect for the province. ""When it comes to the question of respect, the premier already has tremendous respect from me, tremendous respect from the prime minister,"" she said. ""I hope that he would agree that we have a very effective, friendly working relationship with him, and we really appreciate it."" When it comes to climate change, Freeland said the government was open to hearing Pallister make the case for his approach, and to understand the rationale behind it. There will be ongoing conversations with the province on the issue, she said. Environment and Climate Change Minister Jonathan Wilkinson pointed out that New Brunswick put a price on pollution that met the federal benchmark and was therefore permitted to implement its own price. ""The same thing would hold true here in Manitoba if in fact the government determined that they wanted to implement a Manitoba-based price on pollution that met the federal benchmark,"" he said during a funding announcement event in Winnipeg. ""They are certainly free to do that in the same way that British Columbia does it, in the same way that many other provinces do it."" The Liberal cabinet retreat began its second day in Winnipeg Monday with the meeting between Trudeau and PallisterÂ to talk about public safety, flood protection and theÂ thorny topic of the federal carbon tax. The location of the retreat in the Manitoba capital, considered the gateway to the West, is considered strategic for a government working to ease tensions with the West.Â  Various ministers, including Freeland, have been making outreach efforts to build bridges with western provinces. ""The outreach is good, it's noble, and I think the intention is real,"" Pallister said. ""But you'll measure the effectiveness, as you should, by results. By achievements."" Freeland said she has travelled to seven provinces so far, and plans to visit the others plus the territories soon. Her takeaway is that Canadians love Canada and have a great commitment to pulling together to keep Canada united at a time of global instability. The Liberals were shut out of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the Oct. 21 federal election, largely due to voter dissatisfaction there over the carbon tax and the lack of progress over a pipeline being built. Trudeau has since promised to listen, reach out and address those concerns to calm the rising sentiment of western alienation. Yet the competing objectives ofÂ making climate change action a priority, while promoting a pipeline is proving to be a challenge. After delivering a briefing to cabinetÂ Sunday,Â IanÂ Anderson, chief executive of Trans Mountain Corp., was asked by reporters how Canadians might feel about the government's apparently contradictory objectives. Anderson replied that while there must be action on climate change, measures are also needed to promote economic development and trade. ""The oil that we're going to move in this pipeline is going to be consumed,"" AndersonÂ said. ""It's going to come from somewhere. Why not from Canada?Â  ""Why not from a country that has the highest standards of regulation, the highest standards of responsible development in the world?"" Anderson said the Trans Mountain pipeline project is under construction in Alberta and British Columbia, employing roughlyÂ 2,700 people. About 10 per cent of those employees are Indigenous, and there is also contract work underway with other IndigenousÂ companies, he said.Â  ""We hope that will be a real success story of the project once we're completed,"" he said, adding that the scheduled completion date is in 2022. Trudeau also met with Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman today, and the pair discussed infrastructure and public safety, including anti-drug strategies. Inside the cabinet room, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair is scheduled to update ministers MondayÂ on the government's plans to bring in gun control measures. The Liberals have promised to allow municipalities to ban handguns, and to prohibit certain types of military-style assault weapons. Last month, Blair said a list of those prohibited weapons would be released ""as quickly as possible.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-pallister-liberal-cabinet-meeting-1.5432616,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pallister-trudeau-carbon-tax-1.5428312 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/prime-minister-trudeau-winnipeg-bowman-pallister-meeting-1.5431597 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-cabinet-retreat-winnipeg-1.5432244,N/A391,Micki Cowan,2020-01-22T12:00:00.591Z,New Westminster offers $4M worth of free land for affordable housing ,"On full disability and in a wheelchair, New Westminster resident Aaron Pietras has only $375 a month in his budget for housing.Â  In the Lower Mainland, housing advocates say finding an accessible place for that price on the market is ""virtually"" impossible.Â  But with a stroke of luck, Pietras was able to get into one of the city's newest affordable housing projects at 43 Hastings St. last year.Â  The development wouldn't have been possible without the free donation of a plot of million-dollar land from the municipality. ""That's significant given the costs of land in the Lower Mainland and really made the project viable,"" said Janice Barr, CEO of the non-profit Community Living Project, which built and operates the facility.Â  The project was such a success, the City of New Westminster is looking to do it again.Â  It's requesting proposals for another affordable housing project on Fenton Street. The successful bidder will get the four plots of land worth around $4 million ""at no charge."" The city will also pay for additional expenses like a building permit and development approval. ""There are people here who previously didn't have housing who now have housing to stabilize their lives and they're part of the community. And, as a city, we really feel that that's really important,"" said John Stark, New Westminster's supervisor of community planning.Â  Providing free land is a relatively new push for the City of New Westminster, but other levels of government are increasingly looking to their own land holdings as a housing solution. The City of Vancouver calledÂ providing city-owned land to non-profits and government agencies a key approach in the quest for affordable housing. The province of B.C. wasÂ also on board with using publicly-owned land to create more affordable housing.Â  With property prices sky high, incentives to build affordable housing are becoming increasingly crucial to woo developers, said Michael Mortensen, who advises developers under the Liveable City Planning banner. Even private developers struggle with rising costs which makes choosing to build affordable housing a difficult option, he says. ""People have misconceptions about how much profit developers are looking for,"" Mortensen said.Â  The profit difference compared to a condo project is huge, according to Mortensen. He saysÂ most developers are looking for a 15 per cent return on costs, whereas rental properties usually average around six per cent. He saysÂ it's already tough to get those returns with increasing costsÂ and accepting a lower profit margin can make it harder to secure financing. But while leveraging publicly-owned land to create more affordable housing is something all levels of government seem to agree on, giving it away for free toÂ private developers isn't something many of them are keen on. For the current provincial government, it's a hard no.Â  ""Public land belongs to the people of B.C. and should benefit them, not wealthy corporations,"" said the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in a statement.Â  Andy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University, agrees. He pointed to the Little Mountain housing development site in Vancouver as a cautionary tale. The provincial government sold the land to private developer Holborn Holdings Ltd. in 2007 at a fraction of the assessed value. Years later, the demolished social housing units the company promised to replace are years away from completion. ""When the BC Liberals chose to sell off public land, in many cases for less than the land could have been worth, they gave away control and the opportunity to use that land to provide affordable housing for people,"" said the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in its statement.Â  Mortensen saysÂ private developers are still a key part of the housing solution. Â  ""When you have the creativity of the development industry and partner with them ... we can produce more housing.Â We can do it at virtually no cost to the taxpayer,"" he said.Â  Aaron PietrasÂ said finding an affordable place to live has made a huge difference in his lifeÂ andÂ allowed him to have true privacy for the first time.Â  ""I feel like I'm the king of the world right now,"" Pietras said. ""It's like a weight's been lifted off my shoulders."" But while PietrasÂ felt lucky to have his new home, he said accessible and affordable housing for others with disabilities is still hard to find. ""It's very challenging you know,"" he said.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-westminster-free-land-affordable-housing-1.5431915,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-needs-10-000-affordable-housing-units-a-year-to-address-rental-backlog-report-advises-1.5393571 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-to-consider-rental-only-zoning-including-4-storey-rentals-on-side-streets-1.5370160 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/little-mountain-vancouver-social-housing-10-years-since-units-destroyed-1.5380026,N/A392,Anonymous,2020-01-21T15:09:05.697Z,Gas station sustains significant damage during arrests in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation,"A man and a woman are facing numerous charges and several guns are off Saskatchewan streets following an incident in northern Saskatchewan where a vehicle drove into a gas station in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation. On Saturday, Loon Lake RCMP received a report from the Pierceland Detachment of a suspicious man in a farmyard driving a grey SUV. An RCMP officer from the Loon Lake detachment located a vehicle that matched the description on Highway 26. The officer tried to stop the SUV, but it sped away in response. A short time later, the vehicle and the man were seen at a gas station in Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation, at which time the RCMP pulled up behind the vehicle and arrested the man. However, as the officerÂ was bringing the handcuffed suspect to his police vehicle, the officer was hit from behind by a woman who was a passenger in the vehicle. RCMP say the officer then took the man to the ground to keep control of him. Then, the woman got back inside the vehicle and armed herself with a machete, entering the driver's side of the vehicle, accelerating it at the officer who was still on the ground. The officerÂ was able to move both himself and the handcuffed man out of the way to safety. The woman then tried to turn the vehicle around to drive at the officer, but lost control and collided with the side of the gas station, causing ""significant damage."" The officer was then able to arrest both individuals. No one was injured throughout the incident. Following a search of the vehicle, police seized several items including three semi-automatic handguns with five loaded magazines, six rifles, a revolver, ammunition, a black ski mask and leather gloves. Both the man, 50, and the woman, 35, have been charged with numerous charges and were set to appear in court in Meadow Lake on Monday.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/loon-lake-rcmp-guns-1.5434198,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/police-investigate-break-enter-gunshot-east-prince-albert-1.5423448 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/rcmp-hotel-robberies-rural-sask-1.5432084,N/A393,Anonymous,2020-01-21T17:53:32.646Z,"James Forcillo, ex-officer who shot and killed teen on streetcar, granted full parole","James Forcillo, the former Toronto police officer who shot teenager Sammy Yatim to death on a TTC streetcar in 2013, has been granted full parole. Forcillo, now 37, was convicted of attempted murder in 2016, and began serving prison time in November 2017 after his appeal was rejected. His sentence was supposed to last six years, five months and 29 days, according to the Parole Board of Canada document outlining his parole.Â ForcilloÂ was previouslyÂ granted day parole after 21 months in prisonÂ â€” a move that surprised and shocked Yatim's family.Â  A judge handed ForcilloÂ thatÂ sentence following an unusual verdict by a TorontoÂ jury, which found ForcilloÂ guilty of attempted murder, but not second-degree murder, despite the fact that Yatim died aboard the streetcar. The jury believed Forcillo was justified in firing the first three shots at Yatim, whoÂ was brandishing a knife before ForcilloÂ opened fire,Â but not a second round of shots. Nearly the entire incident was captured on camera and sparked a serious debate in the city about police use of force. The parole board saidÂ there's aÂ ""low risk"" Forcillo will commit another crime.Â  ""It is the Board's opinion that you will not present an undue risk to society if released and that your release will contribute to the protection of society by facilitating your reintegration into society as a law-abiding citizen,"" the document said. It also saidÂ Forcillo has enrolled in a full-time college program and intends to study to be an electrician.Â  The former constable has, however, been barred from ever having any contact with Yatim's family and he is prohibited from ever owning a firearm. In the document, the board notes theÂ ""devastating"" impact Yatim's death has had on his family, ""the effects of which will likely be felt for years to come. ""He was a loving son, a protective older brother, and a much-loved member of his community,"" it reads.

Around this time in 2019, the cannabis sector was booming. Investors wanted in and stock prices were skyrocketing. Today, share prices have tumbled and analysts are forecasting ""many"" bankruptcies by the end of the year. Just last month, two Canadian companies, AgMedica and Wayland, were granted creditor protection.Â  Some producers are looking for an exit, even if it means being bought by their competitors. OthersÂ looking to beef up their cash reservesÂ are offering to sell off equipment and greenhouses â€”Â at a discount. ""But in most cases, those are assets you don't want to take on. They're not efficient,"" said Greg Engel, chief executive officer of Organigram, a cannabis producer in Moncton, N.B. ""Certainly, there's going to be additional insolvencies."" The pot industry has been plagued with supply problems, stiff competition from the black market and a resulting loss of enthusiasm from investors. ""There's a lot of trepidation, understandably, and I think it's going to be some time before the capital markets come back,"" said Rishi Malkani, a cannabis industry expert and partner at Deloitte Canada. Oversupply, falling prices and the slow rollout of brick-and-mortar stores, particularly in Ontario, has contributed to low revenues for most licensed cannabis producers in the past year. Malkani said he expects more than a dozen businesses to face ""significant cash crunches"" in the next six to 12 months, without naming specific companies. ""We are now seeing the separation between real operators and companies that based their value on hype,"" said Engel. His company continues to operate at a loss but more than doubled its revenues in the first quarter of 2020, according to financial statements released last weekÂ (Organigram's Q1 2020 actually ended Nov. 30, 2019). There are currently about 200 cannabis companies in the Canadian market with annual sales around $1 billion. Even the biggest producers such as Canopy Growth and HexoÂ are in the red, with losses deepening into the last quarter of 2019. ""What it takes is more stores to meet demand,"" said SÃ©bastien St-Louis, co-founder and CEO of Hexo, which hasÂ facilities in Gatineau and the Ottawa region. Despite its plummeting stock price and a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, Hexo is aiming to become profitable this year, although its chief executive recognizes some elementsÂ  â€”Â like store rollouts and provincial regulation â€“ are beyond the company's control. ""The capital markets took a breath, retail investors pulled back from the industry and that has really created a situation where companies are not profitable and there's also no cash coming in for most companies on an investment basis,"" St-Louis said. Jordan Sinclair, vice-president of communications for Canopy Growth in Smiths Falls, Ont., has high hopes after the FordÂ government's decision to open the province's retail market. ""We're starting 2020 on a good note. The Ontario government is opening up its retail system to allow more of a free-market approach, rather than a lottery system,"" Sinclair said. The entire industry breathed a sigh of relief after the announcement, he said.Â  Even though three provinces delayed the sale of edibles, several producers hope these new products will be a lifeline for the legal market. Another hurdle to profitability for some Canadian cannabis companies is a wave of class-action lawsuits launched in U.S. courts. At least nine are targeting Canopy Growth, Hexo and Edmonton-based Aurora Cannabis.

""There has been one repatriation of remains which took place, and we respected the wish of the families to respect theirÂ  privacy. The family has asked that we ... and the media respect their privacy,"" Champagne said following a three-day Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg. Calling the situation ""dynamic"" andÂ ""fluid,"" Champagne said Iran has so far respected the families' wishes regarding burial. He said that claims the families' wishes hadn't been respected have not been substantiated. ""We are taking these allegations seriously. We are investigating with our team on the ground and with Iranian authorities,"" he said. ""But based on the information that I have from our consular officials which are working with the families ... in touch with the 57 Canadians and 29 permanent residents, the latest information I have received is that the wishes of the families have been respected."" Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. It's not known how many of the 57 Canadians killed in the crash also held Iranian citizenship. There also have been reports that Iran is intimidating and harassing family members of the victims. Canada has been demanding that Iran turn over the ""black box"" flight recordersÂ from the aircraft, which contain information critical to the crash investigation. Iran initially indicated it would release the black boxes to Ukraine or France â€” two countries with the technical expertise to analyze the dataÂ â€” but recent reports suggest the country is now backtracking on that pledge. Champagne said Iran should release the flight recorders in the spirit of transparency and accepting full responsibility for the crashÂ â€” but suggested global pressure isÂ the best way to persuade Iran to release them. ""The leverage we have I would say is ... the fact that the world is watching Iran. We have made demands which are very specific,"" he said. After initially denying any role in the crash, Iranian leaders conceded that Iran's Revolutionary Guard shot down the Boeing 737-800 using surface-to-air missiles on Jan. 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board. Of those passengers,Â 138 were destined for Canada. Today, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada continues to ""pressure"" Iran to turn over the black boxes to a third country. ""It is not simply a question of having the right experts in place to analyze the black boxes. There is the question of significant technological requirements that cannot be done in Iran,"" he said.

""When complaints came ... [owners] were told 'gosh we haven't heard of that happening. Isn't that weird?' And in fact the companies knew they had a big problem,"" Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who is heading up the lawsuit, told Go Public. The class action was filed inÂ Court of Queen's Bench in Regina on Monday, but has yet to be certified by the court. It names Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and their American counterparts â€”Â Hyundai Motors America and Kia Motors America. None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court. A Go Public investigation revealed concerns about Hyundai and Kia engines failing at high speeds or spontaneously bursting into flames â€”Â putting some drivers and their passengers into life-threatening situations and leaving others with thousands in repair bills. Consumer and safety advocates have criticized the South Korean automakers for taking too long to issue recalls of too few models with the Theta-family engines. The recalls started in 2015 and are still rolling out. ""Their difficulty is that they can't fix the problem. They don't know what to do about the problem. So a recall where there's no fix is really no recall at all,"" Merchant said. Go Public askedÂ Hyundai if it had a fix for the engine problems, but it didn't respond to that questionÂ directly. Merchant says the proposed class-action suit involves 37 Hyundai and Kia owners, and seven different models ranging in years from 2011-16 â€” but heÂ expects the number of drivers and vehicles involved to grow once word gets out about the lawsuit.Â  The legal action is also looking for compensation for owners with the problematic engines who haven't had failures or fires,Â but are facing a loss in vehicle value. ""For the vast majority of people, they're not going to have a safety problem. And many of them are going to be compelled to continue to operate these vehicles because they can't afford the hitÂ of getting rid of them. So they're entitled to financial compensation that flows from having a vehicle that's significantly depreciated,"" Merchant says. Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada andÂ Kia Motors America all told Go Public they do not comment on any current or pending litigation. Hyundai Motors USA responded to Go Public's questions about the latest Canadian lawsuitÂ with a general statement.Â  ""Nothing is more important than the safety and security of Hyundai customers,"" spokesperson Michael Stewart wrote in an email. ""Hyundai actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision engine fires, with all of our vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects â€_ Hyundai quality and safety is among the best in the industry.""Â  Go Public continues to get complaints from Hyundai and Kia owners,Â who say they are interested in joining a class-action suit if it means the automakersÂ would have to take responsibility. Marnie and Adam Nelson contacted Go Public after seeing previous engine stories. The couple's 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe caught fire while it was parked in their driveway last March.Â They bought it six months earlier and paid more than $50,000 for the SUV. They contacted Hyundai's head office by email to reportÂ the fire and askÂ for a refund on the extended warranties they had purchased, but say no one followed up to investigate. Instead, the couple says most of their messages to head office were ignored and the local dealership was only interested in getting them to buy a new vehicle. ""As soon as they [the dealership] found out we weren't going to come back in and buy another car, we were persona non grata, they wanted nothing to do with us. No return calls â€” nothing,"" Adam said. ""They should be standing behind their products better,"" Marnie told Go Public.Â  The dealership declined to respond to Go Public's questions about the couple's situation directly, referring us to head office.Â  Hyundai says its records show the Nelsons went directly to their insurance company to report the fire and only reached out to the company for a refund on an extended warranty they had purchased for the vehicle. The couple says they received a partial refund. The company wrote in an email to Go Public that its policy is to investigate every case of a fire, ""that we are aware of and requested to investigate to determine if the cause is attributed to neglect, abuse, environment or the product itself."" The Nelsons say their fire was never investigated by the company. The company did reach out to the couple after Go Public inquiries.Â  The engine in Daniel Roukema's 2013 Hyundai Santa FeÂ didn't burn â€”Â it died in 2016 while he was driving on a highway near Toronto. He says he had to pay aboutÂ $9,000 to replace it. When he asked the company to cover the cost, Roukema says it refused and blamed his lack of upkeep for the engine failure, which he denies.Â  Two recalls were issued for the vehicle after he paid to replace his engine. ""I think the way they've handled the situation is absolutely abhorrent â€_ we [owners] ought to be compensated,"" he said. Hyundai did not respond to specific questions about Roukema'sÂ case, but said ""if a customer previously paid for repairs in advance of a recall being issued, and it is determined that the repairs required were a result of a recall, Hyundai will reimburse the customer for the recall-specific repairs to their vehicle."" Hyundai says it will soon launch what it calls a microsite that aims to answer questions for customers affected by recalls. In Quebec, the Automobile Protection Association and a group of Kia owners are suingÂ Kia for compensation for alleged engine problems with the 2010-15 Kia Forte. Fires are not part of that class-action lawsuit. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.Â The transportation authority is asking owners who have had problems to contact the department.Â  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

HÃ©lÃ¨ne Rowley Hotte died of hypothermia on Jan. 20, 2019, on a morning when it was a bitter -35 C outside and snowing. In legal documents filed Monday, Rowley Hotte Duceppe's seven children allege their mother's life would have been saved if not for the ""gross negligence'' of the residence. ""Mother never stops dying. It continues all the time because (the residence's responsibility) isn't recognized,'' Gilles Duceppe said in a brief interview following the announcement of the lawsuit. Lawyer Marc-Antoine Cloutier told the Montreal news conference that while the death may have been accidental, the alleged negligence of staff at the Lux Gouverneur Montreal contributed to the tragedy. ""When we don't put in place what needs to be put in place, there are foreseeable consequences,'' he said. A coroner's report released last summer said video surveillance showed the woman trapped in the courtyard for six hours. She tried to get back inside the building to no avail, since her access card wouldn't let her back inside, and no one noticed her absence. Cloutier said the family and the estate are seeking $1.25 million for both the suffering experienced by Rowley Hotte Duceppe and the pain her death has caused her seven children. Gilles Duceppe said his mother had a ""horrible fear of fire'' and left her apartment upon hearing an alarm. He said the residence should have checked security cameras and the building's exits after the all-clear was given and the alarm turned out to be false. ""We can't understand how something like this can happen,'' he said. ""There were cameras. They could have seen her.'' â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ Duceppe says he also doesn't understand how staff allegedly didn't look to see if anyone was outside after the alarm on the emergency door into the courtyard signalled it had been opened. ""You have to open the door: they could have saved her, she would have come in. She was just there, on the other side.'' His sister, Monique Duceppe, said the family chose the residence precisely because it was advertised as safe. ""That's why we went there, because in their brochure, it was the highest technology in terms of security,'' she said. Her mother was happy there, she said. ""Nobody thinks they'll end their days like that, outside...'' she said, her voice trailing off. Cloutier said that while the family is only suing the one residence, he hopes the case prompts a wider societal discussion on the safety of seniors' homes, and the need for stricter standards. ""We hear more and more about the problems that stem from the lack of security in these residences, but also sometimes because of lack of personnel, lack of training, carelessness in some cases.'' The family sent the Lux Gouverneur notice last July that they were seeking damagesÂ and were prepared to take legal action if the residence did not respond. Cloutier said the possibility of criminal charges was raised at first, but the family ultimately decided on a civil action. The management of the residence said in a statement Monday saying staff remain ""extremely shaken by the death of Mrs. Rowley-Hotte.''

Canadians say they spend almost 11 hours a day in front of them â€” at their desks, on their laptops and especially on their smartphones. But after a long day at work, our eyes often start to feel dry, tired and strained, and many people are desperate for a solution.Â  Enter blue light filteringÂ lenses. Optical chains say they protect our eyes from blue light emitted from digital screens, and consumers are buying in.Â  And it turns out it's not just eye strain they want to warn us about. A hidden camera investigation by CBC's Marketplace found sales associates at some of Canada's largest optical chains making ""misleading"" health claims about blue light from digital screens, but experts say there is no scientific evidence that blue light from computer monitors and screens is harmful. Staff at four leading chains cautioned buyers that digital screens could damage their retinas and could lead to serious eye diseases such as macular degeneration andÂ cataracts. Two opticians at Hudson's Bay Optical suggested a link to cancer based on an in-store pamphlet provided by lensÂ manufacturerÂ VisionEase, while Vogue Optical's website suggests blue light may increase the risk of ""certain types of cancers."" Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery later told Marketplace the pamphlet is ""incorrect"" and will be pulled from Hudson's Bay Optical stores.Â  But experts in the fields of optometry and ophthalmology say there's no evidence that blue light from digital screens is harmful.Â  Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the idea of blue-light blocking is ""flawed on so many levels."" ""Blue light fear, paranoia, is really out there,"" said Khurana. ""But there's no evidence to show it's truly dangerous and blocking it has not ever [been] shown to [have] any benefits."" Marketplace producers went undercover and visited multiple Hakim Optical, Vogue Optical, Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery and LensCrafters locations in southern Ontario to see how the companies market the lenses to consumers.Â  Several dispensing opticians and salespeople told the producers that blue light from digital screens can lead to fatigue and headaches. One optician said blue light has ""very sharp rays, penetrating at the back of the eyes,"" while another salesperson said ""it tears the eyes right out of you."" Watch Marketplace go undercover at optional retailers: But more ""serious"" and even ""scary-sounding"" to ophthalmologist and macular specialist Dr. Sunir Garg were claims that blue light from digital devices might lead to retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and possibly cancer.Â  Buying blue light filtering lenses, it was suggested, might eliminate these risks. ""They're introducing this technology that blocks [the digital blue light] out,"" said one student optician. ""So we are not going to be seeing things like cataracts or macular degeneration, damage to your retina, things like that.""Â  Many of these claims are also found on Vogue Optical, Hakim, and LensCrafters websites and promotional material. Marketplace asked Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, to review the hidden camera footage.Â  He was concerned about how salespeople and opticians were ""misleading"" customers with claims about how the light from screens can damage eyes. Retinal damage and macular degeneration are ""serious"" claims, Garg said, ""but the blue lights from your screen is not the cause of that stuff.""Â  ""I think a lot of this is just to create fear and confusion and when people have fear and are confused, they end up spending money on things they don't need to spend money on,"" said Garg.Â  Garg's research has led him to conclude that far from benefiting customers, these lenses are mostly benefiting the companies that are selling them. ""Maybe those [blue light filtering lenses] are decisions made in different boardrooms across the country and around the world,"" Garg said, ""but from a science perspective, I don't think people need to worry about this at all.""Â  He doesn't blame the staff at these chains for spreading these claims, however.Â  ""I can't fault them [because] I'm sure they're getting a little info sheet that says here's three talking points about blue light-blocking lenses, but it's not based on scientific data,"" Garg said.Â  ""People will quote that blue light can hurt retinal cells,"" Garg said, ""but what they're not telling you is that it's not been shown in any group of people who are using their screens.""Â  The science into the harms from blue light is mostly done with retinal cells in a petri dish, he said, ""or taking a poor mouse and and shining a blue light ray intensely into their eyeball for hours on end."" Both Khurana and Garg told Marketplace there's no research that suggests blue light filtering lenses are necessary.Â  Phillip Yuhas, an assistant professor of optometry at Ohio State University, agrees. He said studies have shown people blink far less during computer use and that blue light filters have not shown any improved ""visual comfort"" for digital eye strain.Â  Khurana said if the problem people are having is from digital eyestrain, then blue light filters are doing nothing to address the core issue and ""could be doing more harm than good."" Â But that hasn't stopped eyeglass retailers from promoting them. One optician told MarketplaceÂ  the blue filter lens is like an ""extra shield on top of your eyes to protect your eyes from harmful rays.""Â  The lenses can be purchased with or without a prescription and range in price from $20 to more than $100.Â Â Â Â  Global sales of the lenses reached $18 million US in 2019, according to Marketwatch.com, and are projected to exceed $27 million US by 2024.Â Â Â  Staring at screens for a long time can make eyes feel dry, tired and strained, but blue light is not the culprit, said Garg, and purchasing special lenses won't fix the issue. ""What's bothering [people] isn't the blue light. It's the fact that when they're staring at their screen a lot they're not blinking as often. ""That causes the eye to dry out, [and] when your eyes become dry, they become irritated and scratchy and tired.""Â  To deal with that, he recommends a simple fix. It's calledÂ  ""the 20-20-20 rule.""Â  Look at least 20 feet (six metres) away from your screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.Â  Blue light does wake us up and make us more alert, so too much late at night can make it hard to get to sleep. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends turning off devices or turning on blue light filters, a couple of hours before going to bed.Â  In the United Kingdom, claims like the ones heard in Canada by Marketplace producers aren't allowed. Opticians and eyeglass retailers risk being fined if they make unproven claims about blue light from digital devices. In 2015, Boots Opticians were reprimanded and fined 400,000 pounds for making ""misleading"" claims that blue light causes retinal damage.Â Â  Dr. John O'Hagan, an optical radiation expert who works for Public Health England's (PHE) centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, conducted a study on blue light from digital devices on behalf of the organization.Â  He analyzed the amount of blue light coming from various sources including the sky, lightbulbs, mobile phones and computer screens.Â  ""Blue light in our normal environment is not dangerous at all,"" O'Hagan told Marketplace ""The main source of blue light for us is from the sky and a nice sunny day."" The PHE study found that for smartphones, laptops and digital devices, the amount of blue light emitted was less than one per cent of the safe exposure level, even if stared at all day.Â  O'Hagan said that the light levels from a smartphone, tablet or laptop are ""considerably below the levels that we experience outside, even in winter."" We get about 30 times more blue light just by being outside, he said.Â  ""You could stare at your phone all day long, right above the face, and the amount of blue light is not significant,"" O'Hagan said.Â  ""There is no evidence that blue light from your mobile or other devices is harmful.""Â  Marketplace reached out to the four eyeglass retailers visited by producers.Â  Hudson's Bay Optical/Glasses Gallery said Marketplace was given wrong information when it comes to cancer and macular degeneration from digital blue light, and says it will be pulling all Vision Ease pamphlets and marketing materials immediately from all stores. It says all staff will be retrained in the coming weeks and it is ""committed to providing the very best experience for our customers."" Manufacturer Vision-Ease saidÂ they ""stand by their marketing materials"" and say the science around blue light is ""conflicting"" and ""ambiguous"" and more studies are needed.Â  LensCrafters said ""while we train our associates on all products, including blue light and blue IQ lenses, some inconsistencies are possible in how individual associates articulate this topic across our stores. We plan to reinforce our in-store training as the awareness around the potential risks of blue light grows."" Vogue Optical said ""optical science evolves very quickly"" and ""there is a high volume of ongoing studies on blue light, some of which point to damaging effects on the eye."" They also said they are putting considerable effort into educating staff to help educate consumers about what's available on the market and help them make the best choices.Â Â  Hakim Optical says there is evidence that blue light is damaging, and they ""will continue to respect and support the licensed optician's obligation to protect and educate the public with all available information and options related to their eye health care."" They also said ""there is no evidence of harm from the blue-light filter upgrade.""Â  Health Canada says prescription lenses are regulated through the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.Â Â  As the Food and Drugs Act ""prohibits false, misleading or deceptive advertising of a medical device, such as the promotion of claims without safety and effectiveness data,"" Health Canada said it will follow up with the optical chains to determine whether medical devices are being advertised or sold in Canada with unsupported health claims. The Ontario Opticians Association told Marketplace ""there is an overwhelming number of clients who have expressed satisfaction with their blue light filters, in that they reduced or eliminated headaches, fatigue, eyestrain and the like."" For people who are concerned about good eye health, Garg has some other suggestions â€” and they don't include lenses to block blue light.Â  ""Do things like take a break periodically, start quieting down before nighttime, eat a good diet, exercise and not smoke â€_ all those things will help eyes way more than spending money on these blue blocking lenses.""Â  Sit about 63 centimetres (arm's length) from the computer screen. Position the screen so you are gazing slightly downward. Reduce screen glare by using a matte screen filter if needed. Take regular breaks using the ""20-20-20"" rule: every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet (six metres) away for at least 20 seconds. When your eyes feel dry, use artificial tears to refresh them. Adjust room lighting and try increasing the screen contrast to reduce eye strain. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing glasses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-blue-light-lenses-hidden-camera-investigation-1.5364678,[],N/A400,Anonymous,2020-01-21T22:23:01.530Z,Most of canal to open for skating Wednesday,"Time to sharpen those skates, if you haven't already:Â A longer stretch of the Rideau Canal Skateway â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹ â€” seven kilometres of itÂ â€”Â will open Wednesday morning, the National Capital Commission has announced.

Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes quizzed defence lawyer Eric GottardiÂ about the logic behind his argument thatÂ Meng's alleged offenceÂ wouldn't be considered a crime in Canada. Holmes is tasked with deciding whether charges against the 47-year-old chief financial officer meet the bar of so-called double criminalityÂ necessary to extradite someone from one country to another. Meng is charged with fraud in relation to an allegation she put foreign banks at risk of loss and prosecution by lying about Huawei's ownership of a hidden subsidiary accused of violating U.S. economic sanctions against Iran. Move that same set of circumstances to Canada, Gottardi told Holmes, and there would be no crime because Canadians have rejected economic sanctions. But Holmes didn't seem so sure, asking Gottardi whether someone could in fact beÂ prosecuted domestically for lying in Canada, over the phone, to someone in another country who then lost money as a result. The defence lawyer struggled for an answer, noting that the imagined scenarios were adding fiction to an exercise that already requires a judge to ponder a hypothetical scenario by transposing the facts of a case to Canada. ""It's difficult to respond to your question,"" he said at one point before ultimately returning to the fundamental argument underlying the case at hand. ""It's sanction breaking. It's in inducing a U.S. bank to breach domestic laws. That's what the Americans are upset about. That's what underlies these offences."" Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018 on a stopover from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina. She faces charges of bank fraud in the United States. She has been living under house arrest in a multimillion-dollar Vancouver home since last December, when she was released on $10 million bail pending the outcome of the extradition battle. Meng's case has already fracturedÂ Canada-China relations, after Beijing detained two Canadians and restricted imports in moves widely seen as retaliation for Meng'sÂ arrest. The Crown is expected to begin its arguments on Wednesday, asking Holmes to consider the ""essence"" of the allegations against Meng as the judge ponders the question of double criminality. In written arguments filed in advance of the hearing, prosecutors say that a fraud charge against Meng could be made on either side of the border, because she allegedly made a misrepresentation toÂ HSBC, which risked lossÂ as a result. The Crown's arguments also touch on the questions that Holmes put to GottardiÂ â€” suggesting that she could still think about the impact of U.S. sanctions without having to consider Canada's position on Iran. HSBCÂ could have been subject to millions of dollars in fines because of a deferred prosecution agreement with the United States in relation to sanctions violations against other countries. ""The sanctions context is useful only to aid in identifying the resulting harm flowing from [Meng's] alleged lie,"" the Crown wrote in a filing in advance of the hearing. Defence lawyer Scott Fenton concluded the defence's case by arguing â€” essentially â€” that theÂ case for fraud couldn't be made becauseÂ all the fraud involved stemmed from sanctions violations. He said that all the potential losses in the case comeÂ from ""legal"" risk of fines or prosecution for offences that don't exist in Canada. Fenton also noted that if banks are ""innocent dupes"" of a misrepresentation then they would have done nothing wrong, and if they haven't done their due diligence, they would be at faultÂ â€” not just Meng. The lawyerÂ also rejected the notion a Canadian bank could risk its reputation by financing a sanctions-breaking client. ""There is nothing wrong with a company in Canada transacting in dollars in Iran. In fact, our government supports it. Promotes it,"" Fenton said. ""There can't be reputational harm to a Canadian branch of a bank for doing the very things that our government has said are not only entirely lawful but encourages them to do."" If the judge decides the legal test of double criminality has not been met, Meng will be free to leave Canada, though she'll still have to stay out of the United States to avoid the charges. If the judge finds there is double criminality, the hearing will proceed to a second phase. That phase, scheduled for June, will consider defence allegations that Meng's rights were violated during her arrest in December 2018.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-extradition-case-day-2-1.5434341,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,N/A402,Anonymous,2020-01-20T20:11:01.659Z,"SpaceX launches, destroys rocket in successful astronaut escape test","SpaceX completed the last big test of its crew capsule before launching astronauts in the next few months, mimicking an emergency escape shortly after liftoff Sunday. No one was aboard for the wild ride in the skies above Cape Canaveral, just two mannequins. The nine-minute flight ended with the Dragon crew capsule parachuting safely into the Atlantic, after separating and speeding away from the exploding rocket. ""I'm super fired up,"" Elon Musk, the company's founder and chief executive, told reporters. ""It's just going to be wonderful to get astronauts back into orbit from American soil after almost a decade of not being able to do so. That's just super exciting."" Crew Dragon separating from Falcon 9 during todayâ€™s test, which verified the spacecraftâ€™s ability to carry astronauts to safety in the unlikely event of an emergency on ascent <a href=""https://t.co/rxUDPFD0v5"">pic.twitter.com/rxUDPFD0v5</a> NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. Musk and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said the next Crew Dragon could launch with a pair of NASA astronauts in the second quarter of this year â€” as early as April. The Falcon 9 rocket blasted off as normal, but just over a minute into its supersonic flight, the Dragon crew capsule catapulted off the top 20 kilometresÂ above the Atlantic. Powerful thrusters on the capsule propelled it up and out of harm's way, as the rocket engines deliberately shut down and the booster tumbled out of control and exploded in a giant fireball. The capsule reached an altitude of about 44 kilometresÂ before parachuting into the ocean just offshore to bring the test flight to a close. Everything appeared to go well despite the choppy seas and overcast skies. Within minutes, a recovery ship was alongside the capsule. Recycled from three previous launches, the SpaceX rocket was destroyed as it burst apart in flight and slammed in pieces into the sea. SpaceX normally tries to recover its boosters to drive down launch costs, landing them upright on a floating platform or back at the launch site. NASA's commercial crew program manager, Kathy Lueders, said the launch abort test was ""our last open milestone"" before allowing SpaceX to launch Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the International Space Station. Their launch date will depend, in part, on whether NASA decides to keep them for months at the orbiting lab, versus just a week or two. A longer mission will require more training before flight. The astronauts monitored Sunday's flight from the firing room. Hurley said it was ""pretty neat to see"" the capsule aboard the recovery ship within two hours. By all early accounts, the test was successful. ""We'll see what the data show and go from there,"" Hurley said. ""But it certainly is a confidence builder from the standpoint if you ever got into that situation, that Dragon can get us away from the booster quickly."" The astronauts also will have access to speed before liftoff. During a launch dress rehearsal Friday, Hurley and Behnken rode in a white Tesla Model X from Kennedy Space Center's crew quarters to the launch pad, their sleek white and black spacesuits matching the electric sports car with wing-like doors. Musk, who also runs Tesla, used the cars to get around the space center Sunday. Delayed a day by bad weather, Sunday's launch from Kennedy brought together hundreds of SpaceX, NASA and Air Force employees on land, at sea and in the air. Tourists and locals alike packed the adjoining visitor complex and nearby beaches to see the dramatic fiery spectacle of an out-of-control rocket. Musk brought along his own family, including his brother. NASA hired SpaceX and Boeing a decade ago to transport astronauts to and from the space station for billions of dollars. Both companies struggled with technical problems, adding years of delay and forcing NASA to shell out hundreds of millions of dollars extra for Russian rocket rides. After multiple cargo deliveries for NASA, SpaceX successfully flew an enhanced crew capsule to the space station last March without anyone on board, but it exploded a month later during ground testing. The emergency escape thrusters â€” the kind used in Sunday's test â€” had to be retooled. In all, SpaceX has tested these powerful Super Draco thrusters some 700 times. Last month, meanwhile, Boeing's Starliner crew capsule ended up in the wrong orbit on its first test flight and had to skip the space station. The previous month, only two of the Starliner's three parachutes deployed during a launch abort test. Lueders said it's too soon to know whether Boeing will need to send another Starliner to the space station without a crew or go straight to launching astronauts later this year. An investigation team is still looking into why the Starliner's automated timer was off by 11 hours during the December test flight. The importance of launch escape was demonstrated in 2018Â when two astronauts, an American and a Russian, were pulled to safety during a failed launch from Kazakhstan. They experienced up to seven times the force of gravity during the abort, but walked away from the accident. The SpaceX in-flight abort system, Musk pointed out, should be gentler for the crew and is good from the launch pad all the way to orbit. Musk said the Dragon's escape system should work â€” in principle â€” even if the capsule is still attached when the rocket erupts in a fireball. He said that could look like ""something out of Star Wars""Â with the capsule flying right out of a fireball. ""Obviously we want to avoid doing that,"" he quickly added, taking note of all the NASA personnel around him.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-capsule-escape-1.5433125,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-girlfriend-spacex-voyage-1.5424094 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boeing-starliner-crew-capsule-1.5403868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/spacex-crew-dragon-1.5048241,N/A403,Graham Thomson,2019-12-30T13:00:00.731Z,OPINION | 'You ain't seen nothing yet': A look at what's ahead in Alberta politics,"Psychics, astrologers and other impeccable internet sources tell usÂ 2020 promises to be an interesting year in which,Â ""animals tell us what they think,"" the world ""becomes one country,"" and Trump speaks ""only nonsense."" I suppose only two of those are actually predictions while the other one is a sad statement of fact. Making predictions is always a mug's game. And considering how much politics has changed in Alberta the past year, only a fool would attempt to predict what's going to happen in 2020. So, let me try. The year 2020 might look like a new year on paper but in many ways it's going to feel mighty old mighty quick. At least when it comes to Alberta politics. Many of the big issues from the past year will continue to dominate the new. Let's look at a few. Yes, it didn't take a crystal ball to figure this one out. Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives won the election on a promise of a strong economy and more jobs. It didn't work out that way and the NDP has been gleefully rubbing it in Kenney's face every chance they get. And they'll keep it up in 2020 as the UCP government tries to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Economists predict ""modest growth"" in the province's economy for the new year. Kenney will need to do better than that if he hopes to mute the critics â€”Â and claim ""promise made, promise kept"" in 2020. If there's one issue that has defined Alberta politics, this is it. Getting a new energy pipeline to tidewaterÂ has become an overwrought symbol of Alberta's dreams and frustrations â€” the dream of another energy boom and the frustration at failing to get a new pipeline built. In fact, a new pipeline will not solve our fiscal problems that are actually caused by a depressed price of oil and a world moving away from fossil fuels. And delays in getting a new pipeline built are not the fault of the federal Liberal government, as Premier Jason Kenney likes to suggest, but the courts. And the courts have delayed projects because of genuine complaints from First Nations. Work has started on twinning the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that work will continue through 2020 (and for two years after that) but the project will still face opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups. This will be a win-win for Kenney. If construction continues on TMX, he can point to it as a ""victory"" for his government; if it doesn't, he can blame the federal Liberals and ""foreign-funded"" environmental organizations for continuing to undermine Alberta's struggling economy. Speaking of blaming others for Alberta's ills, 2020 will see the UCP government maintain its pugilistic approach to issues via its Fight Back Strategy that includes the ""war room"" â€” officially, the Canadian Energy Centre â€” the public inquiry into the government's foreign-fundedÂ conspiracy theory, and the ""fair deal""Â panel that is looking into whether Alberta should have, for example, its own police force and pension plan. Alberta energy 'war room' discovers its logo was lifted from American software company These are all tactics designed to keep Alberta on a war footing and keep Albertans angry, frustrated and easily manipulated by a government that equates legitimate opposition with sedition. The past year ended with some frustrated public sector workers musing about a general strike. That strike never happened and perhaps it never will. But we might see strikes by individual public sector unions in 2020. They are upset by a government that is pressing workers to take wage cuts.Â The government has made it clear if the unions win wage hikes, they can expect job cuts. Perhaps the government was peering into its own crystal ball this fall when it passed a piece of legislation giving it the right to hire replacement workers in the event of a public sector strike. In 2019, the UCP government commissioned a long list of panels and committees to review everything from the $20-billion Alberta Health Services, to car insurance rates, to safe consumption sites. The granddaddy of them all was the blue ribbon panel that issued a report that formed the basis for the government's cost-cutting budget that rolled out in October. Alberta's 'fair deal' panel begins feedback tour with Edmonton town hall Those panels â€” with members and mandates carefully chosen by the government â€” will continue to influence government policy throughout 2020. That includes Budget 2020 coming in late February, which will actually be the first true UCP budget. The 2019 budget,Â introduced in an election year, was an amalgam of UCP policies and leftovers from the previous NDP budget. There won't be an election in 2020 but you're going to feel like you're trapped in a nasty election campaign anyway. The animosity between the UCP government and NDP opposition isn't just political, it's personal. Kenney has gone to great lengths to dismantle the former NDP government's legacy and the NDP sees Kenney as a right-wing bully. The mutual antagonism will continue as Kenney has already promised even more sweeping legislation in the spring session. Kenney's popularity took a substantial hit late in 2019, according to several public opinion polls, because of a sputtering economy and cuts to government services. But it appears he doesn't plan to stop or change direction. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he told cheering UCP members at their convention a few weeks ago. ""We're just getting started."" In one of the few times NDP leader Rachel Notley agreed with Kenney in 2019, she told a year-end interview she doesn't think Kenney is about to ease up on the gas pedal in 2020: ""There's nothing that makes me believe that they're going to change course and I think they're going to push harder.""

It will include a better population count and draw on traditional Cree and non-Indigenous conservation practices,Â and could include restrictions on Indigenous hunters,Â according to association president Tomatuk. He also said hunters need to stop over-harvesting, particularly female moose during the spring calving season.

Dugan, the academy's leader of just six months,Â has fired back via a statement from her lawyer, saying ""what has been reported is not nearly the story that needs to be told. ""When our ability to speak is not restrained by a 28-page contract and legal threats, we will expose what happens when you 'step up' at the Recording Academy, a public nonprofit,"" read aÂ statement released Friday to The Associated Press byÂ Dugan's attorney, Bryan Freedman. Dugan, the former CEO of Bono's (RED) organization, became the first woman appointed to lead the academy when she began the job in August.Â Before joining (RED), she wasÂ president of Disney Publishing Worldwide and executive vice-president atÂ EMI/Capitol Records. She started her career as anÂ attorney on Wall Street. Dugan's hire came after Neil Portnow chose not to seek an extension on his contract. Portnow had led the Grammys since 2002, but was criticized for saying women need to ""step up"" when asked about the lack of female winners at the 2018 Grammys during a backstage interview. That year, only two female performers won awards during the live telecast and the Grammys were criticized for not giving pop singer Lorde, the only women nominated for album of the year, a performance slot at the show. Recording Academy Board chair Harvey Mason Jr., a music producer who has worked with Chris Brown, Jennifer Hudson and more, will serve as interim president and CEO of the academy. ""In light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy Board of Trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team, the board has placed Recording Academy president and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave, effective immediately,"" the academy said in a statement to the Associated Press. ""The board has also retained two independent third-party investigators to conduct independent investigations of the allegations. ""The board determined this action to be necessary in order to restore the confidence of the Recording Academy's membership, repair Recording Academy employee moraleÂ and allow the Recording Academy to focus on its mission of serving all music creators,"" the statement continued. ""The Recording Academy Board of Trustees is committed to fostering a safe, diverse, and inclusive workplace, music industry and society."" Before Dugan, music executive Christine Farnon held the top position at the academy for yearsÂ though she never had the title of president and CEO. She held multiple positions at the Grammys throughout her tenure, retiring in 1992 as executive vice president. Michael Greene became the first official president and CEO of the academy in 1988, leading the organization until 2002, when Portnow took over. This year's Grammys, set to air Jan. 26 from Los Angeles, is slatedÂ to feature performances by Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, Tyler, the Creator, Run-DMC, Rosalia, H.E.R. and Lizzo, who is the top nominee with eight nods.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/deborah-dugan-administrative-leave-1.5430573,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammy-female-representation-1.4510037 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammys-2019-what-to-know-1.5012964,N/A406,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-25T19:22:58.757Z,'We would have been dead': Father outraged after engine fire puts family at risk,"Chris Dietrich, his wife and three young children were asleep when they woke up to a neighbour pounding on the door to tell them flames were shooting out of their garage and closing in on the house. The engine in the family's 2015 Hyundai Tucson had spontaneously burst into flames while parked in the garage. ""If it weren't for our neighbours, we would have likely been dead,"" Dietrich, from Ayr, Ont.,Â told Go Public. ""If it were 10 to 15 minutes later it would have hit our gas line to our gas barbecue."" The fire broke out in the early morning hours of Feb.Â 4, after the vehicle had been parked for hours.Â  The company Dietrich hired to investigateÂ found the fire started in the engine, but couldn't definitively determine why it started.Â  DietrichÂ isÂ not the only one withÂ an engine fire horror story. Since Go Public first broke the story about delayed recalls on Hyundai and Kia vehicles for possible engine problems,Â CBC News has been bombarded with stories of spontaneous vehicle fires and catastrophic engine failures.Â  Â Â  George Iny from the Automobile Protection Association credits that CBCÂ News investigationÂ with pressuring the South Korean carmakers into action. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issuesÂ in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.Â  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to determineÂ if the carmakers were too slow to fix faulty vehicles. ""We dragged some of [our belongings] out and then we watched it burn until the fire trucks got there,"" Michielsen told Go Public from his home in Coaldale, Alta. ""I got away lucky because we weren't injured.""Â  Michielsen'sÂ vehicle has been subject toÂ two engine recalls for different reasons. The first was in January 2018. He says his local Kia dealer inspected his engine and told him it was fine.Â  A few months later, the engine stalled and had to be replaced â€” only to catch fire earlier this month.Â  When he got home, he found a second recall notice in the mail. The latest recall brings the total number of recalled Hyundai and Kia vehicles to almost threeÂ million in North America since 2015.Â  The recalls have been for different defects that could lead to engine failures and fires, which is aÂ problem, according to Gretchen Freeman Cappio, a U.S. lawyer who is leading one of several lawsuits south of the border over engine fires.Â  ""There are numerous problems with these vehicles [in which] the companies admit they have a recall but they don't have a fix â€_ which is astounding when you say it out loud,"" Freeman Cappio said from her office in Seattle. Hyundai has the second highest number of engine fire reports among carmakers in the country â€”Â 21 over the past three years, according to Transport Canada. The company was seventh in car sales last year, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. Hyundai says it only has five confirmed cases of engine fires resulting from engine failures â€” saying that is a tiny fraction of the estimated number of its vehicles on the road.Â  Transport Canada has had three fire reports related toÂ KiaÂ engines, but theÂ automakerÂ wouldn't say how many it has recorded. FollowingÂ Go Public's investigation into the 2.0L and 2.4L ThetaÂ IIÂ engines, Hyundai and Kia Canada did more in a couple of weeks than they have done since the recalls started four years ago. Kia added 79,301 vehicles to its recall list and Hyundai added 255,370Â â€” more than doubleÂ since the recalls started. Hyundai is also extending warranties for those vehicles. Hyundai says it's doing that ""out of an abundance of caution."" The Automobile ProtectionÂ Association's InyÂ calls the warranty extensions ""a very big offer"" and says he's pleased with how Hyundai is stepping up action after Go Public's investigation. Â  ""That's a big development for consumers,"" he said. In a written response to Go Public's investigation, Hyundai Auto Canada saysÂ ""nothing is more important to Hyundai than the safety and security of our customers.""Â  ""Hyundai takes engine fires with the utmost urgency and seriousness. It is Hyundai's policy to investigate each and every engine fire that is brought to its attention,"" the statement reads.Â  Kia says ""when the result of any engine failure or fire is due to a vehicle manufacturing issue, Kia will conduct a voluntary recall,"" adding it ""continuously evaluates all Kia models â€_ [and] if a safety defect is detected â€_ Kia promptly reports a safety related defect to Transport Canada."" Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a potential safety-related condition with their vehicle to contact itsÂ Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Owners wanting to check if their vehiclesÂ are under a recallÂ can do that on the Hyundai and KiaÂ websites.

The available options to screen for impaired drivers are legislated by Parliament, it said, and police are not permitted to use alternatives. If a driver feels they had a lawful excuse for failing to comply with an impairment-screening test, ""they are encouraged to speak with legal counsel and consider bringing their concerns before the courts,"" the statement said. A B.C. man with severe breathing issues who recently had his car impounded and driver's licence suspendedÂ â€” twiceÂ â€”Â says new rules that allow police across the country to pull over any vehicle and force the driver to take a breath test are causing undue hardship for people who cannot blow into a breathalyzer. Jimmy Forster, 63, suffers from severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and takes daily medications to help him breathe. He lives in the small village of Chase â€” population 2,300 â€”Â in the B.C. Interior. In recent months, Chase RCMP have pulled Forster over twiceÂ and charged him with failing to provide a breath sample, after he was unable to blow hard enough into a breathalyzer device to register a reading. ""I'm just totally stressed right now,"" says Forster, who has an audible wheeze when he speaks and slightly slurred speech due to a childhood brain injury that also left him with a limp. He's on a disability pension, but is now on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get his car out of impound and his driver's licence reinstated, and says he has no idea how he will pay. There are almost 200,000 Canadians living with severe asthma and more than two million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the Canadian Lung Association. Thousands of others haveÂ disabilities â€”Â such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis caused by stroke â€”Â that may make themÂ unable to perform a breath test, causing concern for human rights advocates. ""I think it's important that the police consider human rights principles,"" says Dylan Mazur, a lawyer with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, ""including the duty to accommodate people with disabilities who can't provide a roadside test."" A spokesperson with the RCMP'sÂ national headquarters, Sgt. Marie Damian, did not respond when Go Public asked whether a specific policy exists to provide an alternative for people with disabilities who can't do a breathalyzer test. In an emailÂ she wrote, ""The determination as to whether the subject was 'able and unwilling' or 'legitimately unable' to provide a sample will be up to the investigating officer."" ""The actual volume and force of breath required for a sample is not significant."" Forster says his first police run-inÂ occurred when he was returning from a trip to the post office on the afternoon of Feb. 14, and an RCMP officer pulled him over and accused him of not wearing a seatbelt. Forster says he was belted in. The officer decided to employ the alcohol screening powers that came into effect on Dec.Â 18, 2018, granting police the right to demand a breath sample from any driver they pull over. In the past, police couldn't require a roadside breath test unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a driver had consumed alcohol. In B.C., any driver who refuses â€”Â or, like Forster, fails to provide a breath sample â€”Â faces an immediate roadside prohibition (IRP), whereÂ theirÂ licence is suspended and their vehicle towed, even though there is no evidence of any alcohol consumption. In other provinces, drivers face a potential criminal charge for refusing to blow. Forster says he blew into the breathalyzer device, but couldn't get a reading. He says he explained that he has severe asthma, but the officer didn't believe him. ""He just said, 'Blow harder! Blow harder!'"" says Forster, who says he tried about a dozen times to breathe deeply into the device, and thought he was going to fall over because he was getting dizzy. The RCMP officer issued an IRP, despite a lack of any evidence that Forster was impaired. ""I just couldn't believe it,"" says Forster, whose doctor told Go Public his patient has no history of a drinking problem. Â  Forster appealed to an adjudicator, submitting his medical records.Â The adjudicator dismissed the case and Forster got his licence back and his car out of impound, without financial penalty. A few weeks later, on the morning of March 20, police pulled Forster over again, just after he'd gone for a haircut and filled up his car at a gas station. ""He [the officer]Â didn't ask me any questions,"" says Forster. ""He just brought the breathalyzer and I blew five to six times and had the same thing happen again."" This time, Forster says, he asked the officer if he could take a blood test instead. ""He totally ignored me,"" says Forster. ""Just in one ear, out the other."" Once again, police impounded Forster's car and suspended his licence for 90 days. When he appealed a second time, an adjudicator said he believed police notes that said Forster was ""putting on a show"" to make it look as though he was unable to provide a breath sample. The notes do not claim that Forster appeared to have been drinking, smelled of alcohol, or was driving poorly. ""I was so choked,"" says Forster, who faces aboutÂ $1,400 in fees to get his car released from impound and his licence back next month. He has already spent $200 each time he appealed the IRPs. Forster lives with his cousin Sandy Johnston, who relies on him to drive her placesÂ since having a stroke 10 years ago. ""I'm totally dependent on Jimmy,"" she says. ""After his car got taken the second time, he was just in tears. And then I broke into tears, too. And we were crying together."" A leading researcher on lung disease says assessing whether or not someone's lung function is adequate to obtain a breathalyzer reading is not something that can be easily done in the field. ""The concern I have is that there likely are people that have lung function that's so low that they can't do the tests,"" says Dr. ChristopherÂ Carlsten, division head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of the Occupational Lung Disease Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. He says viral infections and other stressors,Â such as being pulled over by police,Â can affect the breathing capacity of someone with compromised lungs. Go Public has tracked down other cases in B.C.Â â€” as well as in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick â€” in which people with disabilities say they struggled to provide a breathalyzer test. One of the more prominent cases has prompted a charter challenge against mandatory alcohol screening. Norma McLeod, 76, of Victoria, was pulled over on Feb. 14,Â and says she was unable to provide a breath sampleÂ due to a chronic lung condition and an implantÂ in the roof of her mouth that's a result of cancer. Police towed her car and suspended her licence. ""It's happening more frequently now that the federal government has introduced the provision which permits mandatory alcohol screening based on absolutely no suspicion of alcohol consumption,"" says criminal lawyer Jennifer Teryn, part of the legal team representing McLeod. ""If someone's unable to provide a sample upon demand, it's my position that the police should have to get engaged in some minor investigation to find out for themselves whether there's a legitimate reason for that or not,"" says Teryn. Mazur says he alsoÂ expects police to ask people whether they have a disability preventing them from complying with a roadside breath test demand. ""I've heard this from people with disabilities who have mobility issuesÂ or who have speech issues â€” that they can be perceived as intoxicated,"" says Mazur. ""What the RCMP has to do is look at their policies, and look at whether there are provisions of reasonable accommodation based on disability."" Go Public asked Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s minister of public safety and solicitor general,Â about the difficulties some people with disabilities haveÂ Â providing breath tests. In a statement, Farnworth wrote, ""I plan to raise these concerns with my federal counterparts. In addition, I've asked my staff to research whether there are any amendments that could be made to the immediate roadside prohibition appeal process in these situations, including options to reduce any financial barriers for requesting a review."" His ministry said that of 2,558 IRP reviews conducted last year, 491 were dismissed. The office could not determine how many of the cases were dismissed due to disability or medical issues. Jimmy Forster is due to get his driver's licence back on June 20, but says he's anxious police will keep pulling him over. ""I can't afford it, I'm on disability,"" says Forster. ""I can't sleep at night."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment onÂ CBC-TV, radio and the web. We tell your stories and hold the powers that be accountable.

At times this morning, as few asÂ eight were running. OC Transpo is running ""special buses"" alongside its trainsÂ to help alleviate expected crowds and delays on the LRTÂ line caused by the train shortage. From 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., OC Transpo will run special buses from Albert Street, just west of O'Connor Street near Parliament station, to both Hurdman and Tunney's Pasture stations to get out of the core. Those buses ran from HurdmanÂ and Tunney's Pasture stations to downtown from 7:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. Buses from HurdmanÂ dropped passengers off at stops on Albert Street, similar to how express buses worked before Oct. 6, 2019 (but without stopping at stations along the way). Buses leaving from Tunney's Pasture letÂ people off onÂ Slater Street. On Monday afternoon, only 10 trains were working downÂ from theÂ 13 at rush hour and 11 during off-peak times required to meet rider demand. ""It's just frustrating,"" said Coun. Riley BrockingtonÂ on Monday. The River councillor is also a member of Ottawa's transit commission. ""Most reasonable people can understand and acceptÂ some issues now and then with the public transit system as a whole, but not with the frequency that we've seen for such a brand new service."" Costs to run the special replacement buses Tuesday will be charged to the LRT's builders Rideau Transit Group, said Manconi. They're now responsible for maintenance on the LRT under the name Rideau Transit Maintenance. The drop in the number of trains Monday and Tuesday was caused by a handful of problems with trains. On Thursday a wire above a train broke and damaged the train as it entered St. Laurent station, one train is out of service with a compressor issue and a few other trains are experiencing wheel flats,Â said OC Transpo operations director Troy Charter Monday afternoon. Wheel flats mean part of the wheel is dragging on the track instead of turning. That issue isÂ ""a main contributor to the inability to have 13 trains at peak period right now,"" he said. The city owns 17 double-carriage trains for the Confederation Line, butÂ two trains have yet to be sufficiently tested and are not ready for service. The other 15 are used in regular rotation or as backups, said Brockington. As only eightÂ were working TuesdayÂ it stands to reason seven trains were undergoing or have undergone repairs at the same time. Again, the city has not confirmed this. ""Sometimes you have to take trains out of service for regular maintenance that's planned, but the number of issues that we've seenÂ and the technical issues with these trainsÂ is not something that we should expect,"" said Brockington. The city councillor plans to raise both the St. Laurent station wire break and the lack of working trains at a special transit commission meeting on Thursday.

The audit, expected by April, will look at how efficiently two departments involved in the program â€”Â Employment and Social Development Canada, and the Canada Revenue AgencyÂ â€” have managed ""risks to the public treasury"" in doling out cash to students. Another item in the audit will be the departments' ""collection activities of student loans,"" and a third line of inquiry will assess how well the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada has worked to improve students' financial literacy. While the auditor general's report won't be out for weeks, high-level details of the audit are in a briefing note obtained by The Canadian Press under the Access to Information Act. The document prepared for the top civil servant at Employment and Social Development Canada notes that work on the audit has been underway since May 2019. The auditor general's office generally doesn't comment on reviews until they become public and declined to discuss this one, calling it ""premature"" to do so. Likewise, ESDC said in a statement it wasn't ""at liberty to disclose information pertaining to an ongoing audit,"" while the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada listed its efforts, including resources offered to classroom teachers and financial-aid offices, when asked for any data on how well the agency has performed. Outstanding federal student loans total about $17 billion, and the federal government regularly gives up on collecting some of them â€”Â because a person who owes the money files for bankruptcy, the debt passes a six-year legal limit on collectionsÂ or the debtor can't be found. Instruction in financial literacy needs to happen long before students arrive at colleges and universities, but it's not the sole solution for helping those in debt, said Trina James, national treasurer for the Canadian Federation of Students. She said she hopes the next federal budget will shift spending to reduce education costs directly. ""When we're looking at why a lot of students are defaulting on loans, it's not because they're not able to manage their money, it's mainly because a lot of the costs associated to accessing post-secondary education continue to rise,"" James said, citing the cost of textbooks and living expenses. New rules kicked in Nov. 1, 2019, that the Liberals hope will ease some of that burden, including a six-month, interest-free grace period on repaying loans after graduation and a drop in interest rates. And as of Jan. 1, the government allows those in arrears to spread out interest payments, which ESDC said in a statement should reduce debt write-offs. The department cautioned that ""it is too early to assess the impact of these initiatives,"" but noted officials collected $195.7 million from debtors last fiscal year compared to $192.2 million in the preceding 12 months. Adam Brown, board chair for the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (a rival to the Canadian Federation of Students in representing post-secondary students), said the program has improved in recent years to help students repay loans, but suggested a deeper look at other ideas like extending the interest-free grace period, ensuring students have solid finances before being asked to repay their loansÂ and targeted help to parents who are in school. ""Some of those things are going to make the program and make collections a little more complicated for the federal government, but at the end of the day, those are very, very worthwhile changes that are going to make repaying those loans in itself a lot easier for Canadians,"" Brown said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/audit-canada-student-loans-1.5432110,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/student-debt-loans-interest-credit-expert-1.5028057 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/facebook-students-loans-interest-1.4671304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-forgive-student-loans-again-1.3982728 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-loans-write-off-1.4539426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/student-loans-write-off-1.4539426 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberals-will-promise-a-student-loan-repayment-break-for-new-parents-report-1.5301769,N/A411,Anonymous,2020-01-22T03:01:57.000Z,Massive lines for groceries after Newfoundland storm,N/A,https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/massive-lines-for-groceries-after-newfoundland-storm-1.5435661,[],N/A412,Anonymous,2020-01-21T01:01:10.933Z,Hundreds of Central American migrants cross river into Mexico,"Hundreds of Central American migrants waded across the Suchiate River into southern Mexico Monday in a new test of U.S. President Donald Trump's Central America strategy to keep them away from the U.S. border. Some scuffled with national guardsmen on the riverbank while others slipped through Mexican lines and trudged off on a rural highway in small groups. Immigration authorities nabbed more there and chased others into the brush. Most, however, remained at the river's edge or stood in its muddy waters trying to decide what to do next, after being blocked from crossing en masse over the border bridge leading to Ciudad Hidalgo. ""Mexico's president said he would give us work and an opportunity and look,"" said Esther Madrid, a Honduran vendor who left her six children in Honduras. Sitting on a rock among dozens of people who didn't know what to do next, she offered only one word when asked if she would consider returning to San Pedro Sula: ""Never."" Mexico's strategy, developed after the first migrant caravan in late 2018, to break up the mass of people repeatedly and into increasingly smaller groups appeared to be working. Over the weekend, government officials convinced about 1,000 people they should enter legally over the border bridge. On Monday, migrants were detained at the river and along the highway. Those who continued could expect a gauntlet of highway checkpoints while trying to move north. After the river crossing Monday, Mexico's National Immigration Institute issued a statement saying that it would detain any migrants without legal status, hold them in detention centres and deport those who did not legalize their status. As feared, children suffered most in the clashes. A 14-year-old girl was carried from the Mexican riverbank unconscious. It was unclear what had happened but a guardsman said she had been convulsing. Later along the highway, a mother sobbed after realizing her youngest daughter had been separated when migrants tried to escape authorities. Sauri Marubeny Ortega had been walking with her four daughters, ages fiveÂ to 16. Another migrant who had been helping her by carrying the five-year-old ran in another direction when the migrants scattered and she hadn't been able to locate them. ""When the federales' cars began arriving, he ran off that way and I took off after him,"" she said. But when she saw an agent nab another daughter she didn't know who to help and lost sight of the youngest. ""I just beg the person who has her to leave her in a safe place and tell the police,"" the mother said as members of Mexico's migrant assistance force, Grupo Beta, loaded her and three of her girls into an ambulance. ""I don't want to leave here without my daughter."" WATCH | Migrants cross river from Guatemala into Mexico: The migrants started the day on the border bridge connecting Guatemala and Mexico,Â where they read aloud a letter asking Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for permission to cross Mexico en route to the U.S. border. Mexican officials replied that freeÂ passage would not be offered.Â They urged the migrants to enter legally, registering at the bridge and seeking protection and work permits if they wished to remain in Mexico. It was an offer many migrants viewed with suspicion. That sent the migrants down to the Suchiate where hundreds forded its shallow waters and soon faced guardsmen. On the Mexican side, migrants ran from side to side along the river bank, kicking up dust and looking for an opening in the ranks of National Guard troops sent to meet them. Guardsmen scrambled too, trying to head off groups and detaining people where they could. There was pushing and shoving. Some guardsmen carried plastic riot shields hit with rocks tossed by migrants and they occasionally zipped a rock back into the crowd. Others jogged to get into position with long staffs. Still others carried assault rifles. Many of migrants moved back to the river's edge and a smaller number crossed back to Guatemala. ""You have two options: You go back to Guatemalan territory or you come with us,"" Mexican immigration agents said to migrants who had crossed the river. They assured those who went with them that they would ""regularize"" their status, but few of the migrants believed them. Riot police with shields also appeared on the Guatemala side of river, raising questions about what options really remained for the migrants. While Mexico'sÂ government says the migrants are free to enter â€” and could compete for jobs if they want to stay and work â€” in practice, it has restricted such migrants to the southernmost states while their cases are processed by a sluggish bureaucracy. Those who do not request asylum or some protective status would likely be detained and deported. Trump has forced asylum seekers to remain in Mexico, or apply in Central American countries, effectively removing one of the escape valves for previous caravans. Under threats of trade or other sanctions from the Trump administration, Mexico has stopped an earlier practice of allowing migrants to cross its territory unimpeded. The Guatemala government issued new data Monday showing that 4,000 migrants crossed into the country through the two primary crossings used by the migrants last week, and over the weekend nearly 1,700 entered Mexico at two crossings. It said 400 were deported from Guatemala. After two caravans successfully reached the U.S. border in 2018 and early 2019, Mexico began cracking down, and by April 2019 raided the last attempt at a caravan, rounding up migrants as they walked down a highway. As this week's caravan approached, Mexico sent soldiers to patrol its southern border and monitored the area with drones. Migrants sometimes travel via caravan because it provides safety in numbers and offers a chance for migrants too poor to pay smugglers. Amid the chaos of the crossing some found a warmer reception. ""We went into a house and the very kind woman told us to stay there, that they (authorities) had no right to enter and she gave us food,"" said Bryan Fernandez of Honduras. He said he didn't know what to do now though. ""If it gets ugly, we don't know which way to go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/migrant-caravan-crosses-into-mexico-1.5433707,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mexico-us-border-detainees-1.5402767 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/guatemala-migrant-caravan-1.5431161,N/A413,Ashley Heisler,2019-12-21T09:00:00.675Z,Canada should be going for gold-standard when protecting elite athletes from abuse,"This column is an opinionÂ by Ashley Heisler, a second-year law student at the University of OttawaÂ and a former NCCA Division I athlete in women's lacrosse. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see theÂ FAQ. The recent New York Times video featuring U.S. long-distance runner Mary CainÂ shook the track and field community in North America with aÂ heart-wrenching story of physical and emotional abuse, and it has an all too familiar ring for those in sport in Canada. At 17, Cain signed a professional contract with Nike after becoming the youngest American track-and-field athlete to make a world championship team.Â Filled with potential, Cain says she was the ""fastest girl in America, until I joined Nike."" The seven-minute video provides an unadulterated recount of Cain's tenure training with Alberto Salazar's now dismantled Nike Oregon Project, during which she lost her period for three years, broke five bones and was burdened by suicidal thoughts. In Oregon, Cain says herÂ male coachesÂ insisted that, to be successful, she needed to be ""thinner, and thinner, and thinner,"" to the point where her body screamed for help. In Canada, physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuses haveÂ had severe and lasting effects on our nation's elite athletes, as well. In a federally funded, anonymous survey consisting of 1,000 former national team athletes this past year, for example, ""13 per cent of current and 20 per cent of retired athletes reported they had experienced suicidal thoughts,"" with only 15 per cent saying they had reported their experiences officially. Sandra Kirby, a professor at the University of Winnipeg and former Olympian who completed a study similar to the federally funded report, found that throughout Canada's elite sports management and coaching environments there is a general disrespect of the fact that athletes areÂ people. In other words, viewing athletes as a tool or mechanism for profit, medal count, or reputation often takes precedence over their safety and well-being. Some are no longer staying silent. This past June, former Canadian Olympic skier Allison Forsyth launched a class-action lawsuit against Alpine Canada, claiming that the organization failed to protect its female athletes from sexual assault by former coach Bertrand Charest. When Forsyth initially reported the incidents to Alpine Canada, she says she was told to consider her allegations as she could be responsible for a loss of team sponsorship, and adds there was an implication that there could be effects on her own professional career. OthersÂ in sports in Canada have also gone public with accusations of inappropriate treatment of athletes by coachingÂ staff or failure to properly protect athletes. Instances of ""abuse, manipulation and inappropriate behaviour"" have been alleged against a former coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer team, the Under-20 Women's National Team and assistant coach to the 2008 Canadian Women's Olympic Team, Bob Birarda. Among its conclusions, a report commissioned by the WhitecapsÂ and submitted Dec. 13Â found that theÂ club failed to ensure Birarda was adhering to a code of conduct designed to protect players, and made 34 recommendations to improve playerÂ safety and complaint management.Â Â  Athletes inÂ hockey, bobsleighÂ and rowingÂ have also been coming forwardÂ with allegations ofÂ inappropriate treatment and behaviour. While formal litigation is an option and Canadian courts have established that coachesÂ and their team staffÂ owe a general duty of care to their athletes, the case law is limited. Many lawsuits are settled before they can be determined by a judge, leaving no room for binding precedent.Â The decisions that are published primarily deal with male professional athletes, and often fail to consider the additional barriers and vulnerabilities female athletes face, such as less funding, lower representation and gendered stereotypes. Further, they generally fail to address the psychological repercussions of abuse, even in cases stemming from physical acts. But outside the courts, while new policy protecting both female and male athletes pursuing professional and amateur sports careers in Canada is in its early stages, recent reforms suggestÂ that measures safeguarding athletes are starting to change â€”Â and for the better.Â Â  Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science, Sport and Persons With Disabilities prior to the announcement of the new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 20, launched three major developments in order to combat harassment, abuse and discrimination at all levels of sport. First, an Investigation Unit supported by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) provides members of national sports teams with a third-partyÂ avenue to resolve disputes independent of an athlete's sports organization. Second, the Canadian Support Helpline was established as a neutral ""listening and referral service"" for athletes experiencing or witnessing harassment and discrimination in their sport. Third, Duncan committed to enforce a safety-valve mechanism, wherein federal funding will be withheld from national sports organizations if they fail to report incidents of discrimination and harassment, or don't utilize the SDRCC-supported Investigation Unit. For female athletes, specifically, Duncan took further steps towards ensuring their safety by appointing a federal Gender Equity Secretariat responsible for, ""developing, implementing and monitoring a gender equity in sport strategy."" This position is charged with facilitating initiatives to attract and maintain a greater female presence in sport, including athletes, coaches and officials, and aims to create a safer environment in which to train and compete. Members of national sport organizations will also be forced to undergo mandatory training in national policies around anti-harassment, abuse and discrimination before April 2020. It remains to be seen how the government will expand on these initiatives, as rookie MPÂ Steven Guilbeault takesÂ over the sport portfolio as part of his responsibilities as the new Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, the implementation of these early policies by his predecessor suggests an evolution in the culture of Canadian sport that is refusing to let competition harm athletes, and is helping to endÂ silence around abuse. While the process of ensuring that athletesÂ may pursue their goals without fear of abuse or harassment will hardly be linear, its current direction points to a promising future. As Olympic medallist Forsyth puts it, ""There is a strong sense of urgency to take action. We are not seeking perfection; we are seeking progress to ensure a safe, healthy sport environment for all athletes in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-sports-abuse-ashley-heisler-1.5363248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/elite-athletes-abuse-1.5125147 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur-sports-coaches-sexual-offences-minors-1.5006609 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-athletes-want-the-lip-service-around-safe-sport-to-stop-1.5117345 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes-renewing-call-independent-body-investigate-abuse-1.5378762 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abuse-sport-summit-1.5126753 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/shoemaker-canadian-olympic-committee-safe-sport-1.5128210,N/A414,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-15T17:58:55.890Z,'I did not kill her': Justice officials withheld report signalling no homicide while Alberta man sat in prison,"Butch Chiniquay was only months into a lengthy prison sentence in the death of his girlfriend, Charmaine Wesley, when senior officials in Alberta's Justice Ministry obtained a report that might have exonerated him. An initial autopsy had found that Wesley's 2011 death was a homicide, and that her injuries were ""inflicted trauma."" Chiniquay was charged with second-degree murder. But a later medical report written in November 2012 by a panel of expert pathologists concluded that there was no adequate evidence of homicide and that Wesley's injuries in a car accident were a possible cause of her death. An investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate has found that report, commissioned by Alberta Justice, was never provided to Chiniquay or his lawyer. In a recent interview, TheÂ Fifth Estate host Mark Kelley showed Adriano Iovinelli, Chiniquay's lawyer, the previously undisclosed medical finding. ""Why am I seeing this for the first time?"" Iovinelli said. ""You're not going to get [his] period of incarceration back."" Chiniquay, 34, said he feels vindicated by the new revelations. ""I am being honest, and I am telling the truth, and I am innocent,"" he said during an interview at his home on Stoney Nakoda First Nation, 60 kilometres west of Calgary, where he now lives after being released from prison. ""I did not kill her."" These revelations come as part of a six-month TheÂ Fifth Estate investigation that found senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of a medical examiner in Calgary a decade ago. At issue were some of the autopsies performed by Dr. Evan Matshes, a forensic pathologist working out of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Calgary in 2010 and 2011. After concerns were raised about some of his findings, Alberta Justice launched an inquiry into whether or not there had been miscarriages of justice relating to autopsies. Alberta Justice eventually decided to hire an external review panel of three U.S. forensic pathologists to assess Matshes's work. The panel later stated their opinion that Matshes had made ""unreasonable"" findings in 13 of 14 cases reviewed.Â Five of those cases were related to criminal charges. Yet The Fifth Estate has learned that in several criminal cases, those findings were not provided to defence lawyers or their clients, and that the report was buried for years by Alberta Justice â€” even as the incarcerated were serving their sentences. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Iovinelli said that it is up to Alberta Justice to explain why those reports were not released to defence lawyers. ""This is a significant difficulty that has to be addressed by the government, it just has to be,"" Iovinelli said. Alberta Justice declined repeated requests to speak to The Fifth Estate. Eric Tolppanen, the head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement that information was provided to defence lawyers ""where required"" and that they are ""confident"" that they met their ""disclosure obligations."" Tolppanen did not elaborate about what, if any, disclosure was provided or to whom. Legal experts consulted by The Fifth Estate say Alberta Justice was required by law to disclose any relevant documents to defence lawyers. ""It's not a question you have to give any thought to at all,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada and an expert in wrongful convictions cases. ""Alberta Justice has a lot to answer for."" Internal email correspondence shows that Alberta Justice acknowledged it must ""disclose to the defence what we know."" Court records also show that Greg Lepp, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, and now a provincial court judge, acknowledged Alberta Justice had a ""constitutional"" obligation to disclose the results of the expert review to defence lawyers. Alberta Justice also stated the findings of a medical examiner was often ""critical to the outcome of court cases."" ""The deputy (minister) is particularly concerned about whether there is someone in prison,"" Lepp said in a 2012 email to several senior justice officials. Tolppanen said that Chiniquay's lawyer Iovinelli was aware that ""additional disclosure regarding Dr. Matshes was available"" and that Iovinelli told Alberta Justice he did ""not require this further disclosure."" Iovinelli bristled at that suggestion. ""At no time was I ever told that there was a peer review done that indicates that this is not a homicide,"" he said. ""And more importantly, if they had that in their hand, why didn't they do something about it?"" Matshes declined to speak to The Fifth Estate. Â ""I stand by my work,"" he wrote in a statement. ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent."" Alberta Justice began looking into Matshes's work in early 2012 after an insurance company raised concerns about one of his accidental death autopsies. Internal records show officials were most concerned about possible wrongful convictions. A panel of three forensic pathologists was selected to review several of Matshes's autopsies, including cases that had already led to second-degree murder charges. One case involved 18-year-old Shelby Herchak, who was described in news headlines as a ""baby killer.""Â In 2010, she was charged with second-degree murder after her 26-day-old son Daniel died of blunt-force trauma to the head.Â Herchak later accepted a plea deal for manslaughter and served more than five years in federal prison. The original report by Matshes stated there were multiple injuries to Daniel's head, including one that was seven to 15 days old. To the police, that meant intent. Herchak was charged with second-degree murder. ""That medical examiner deemed me a monster,"" Herchak said in a recent interview at her home in Calgary's south end. No one told Herchak that senior officials in Alberta Justice â€”Â including some who are now judges â€” had initiated that review of Matshes's work. Her son's autopsy was among the cases reviewed. That report could have been critical to Herchak's defence because it questioned two key facts the Crown asserted to the judge ahead of her sentencing. The expert review panel disputed that there was evidence of that earlier injury to Herchak's infant son, Daniel.Â They also raised concerns that Matshes may have mistaken a natural separation in a newborn's skull, which is not fully fused, with a fracture. The possibility there was a single injury to Daniel's head would have fit Herchak's assertion that she dropped her baby after waking up suddenly. ""I did not kill my son. It was an accident. I dropped him,"" Herchak said. Alberta Justice was provided the new evidence contradicting Matshes's report long before her murder trial was to begin, yet did not disclose it. Lockyer said Alberta Justice has no justification for burying the report, and it was obligated to provide it. ""You have three pathologists who have reviewed the case and reviewed the original autopsy and all three of them are agreed that the original autopsy report was erroneous, wrong,"" Lockyer said. Without that evidence, Herchak told The Fifth Estate she agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""To go through trial on a second-degree murder charge knowing that the medical examiner, all the stuff that he said, the judge and the jury would have believed him over anything that I said,"" Herchak said. ""I just gave up, I couldn't do it anymore, I didn't want to go to jail for life."" In January 2012, Chiniquay also agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter to avoid going to trial on his second-degree murder charge. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Lockyer said the accused's decision to agree to a manslaughter plea bargain is not unusual in the circumstances. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada â€_ that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge,"" he said. The Fifth Estate showed Herchak a copy of the expert review panel report for the first time â€” seven years after it was written. ""Who in their name would bury a piece of paper so far down to make sure that nobody saw it, and send someone to jail for 5Â_ years? And with the name 'baby killer' for the rest of her life,"" Herchak said. In his statement, Matshes told The Fifth Estate he has been the victim of ""personal vendettas"" and ""local politics."" In a series of letters and emails to Alberta Justice in 2012 and 2013, Matshes and his lawyers asked that the findings of the review panel be set aside. Initially, Alberta Justice vigorously defended its process and the findings of the report.Â Officials with the ministry said they were concerned about possible miscarriages of justice and the impact on murder cases. Then in November 2013, Alberta Justice conceded in court that Matshes was not properly consulted.Â Both parties agreed to set aside the expert panel report. A judge formally approved the agreement and issued an ""order to quash."" At the same time, Alberta Justice told the court that it was ""integral"" that they continue their probe of Matshes's work. ""The minister also asserts that the administration of justice demands a new external review panel be conducted,"" said Marta Burns, then senior legal counsel and now a superior court judge with Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench. Alberta Justice did not respond to TheÂ Fifth Estate's queries about why that second review has not taken place, six years later. ""Nothing has happened,"" said Butch Chiniquay's lawyer Adriano Iovinelli. ""Who dropped the ball?"" In an email, head Crown prosecutor Eric Tolppanen said that because of the decision to ""quash"" the report, the findings are therefore ""inconsequential."" Matshes is now suing Alberta Justice, his former boss in the medical examiner's office and the expert panel members for $30 million for defamation. The Fifth Estate obtained the expert review reports and other related documents from two court actions initiated by Matshes against Alberta Justice. The Fifth Estate asked forensic pathologist Dr. John Butt for his opinion of review panel findings and related court documents. ""What this suggests to me is that there is a significant problem with the work that was done by Dr. Matshes,"" said Butt, who has helped develop medical examiner legislation across Canada. ""My understanding now is that the justice department swept this whole thing under the rug."" Some of the most senior members of Alberta Justice, including the then-ministers, were involved with and co-ordinated the review of potential miscarriages of justice relating to those autopsies. The review of Matshes's work was directly under the purview of Greg Lepp, now a provincial court judge, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service. ""We have a constitutional obligation to disclose anything that affects the case[s] to defence counsel,"" Lepp said in sworn court testimony in 2013. ""And we also have an obligation as prosecution service to consider this situation and determine what steps, if any, we're going to take in relation to these cases."" Reached at his office in Edmonton's provincial court, Lepp said he could not discuss whether disclosure had been provided. ""You're just going to have to pursue those enquiries elsewhere since it's just not advisable, it's not a good course of action for a judge to comment on what happened prior to his appointment,"" Lepp said. He added, ""the [justice] department's responsible for the decisions that were taken years ago."" Marta Burns, the former senior counsel for Alberta Justice and now a judge, declined to respond to questions in a statement sent by her spokesperson. ""In her capacity as litigation counsel with the legal services division, Justice Burns was not charged with making disclosure to defence counsel,"" the statement said. ""Decisions in this regard are made by the Crown Prosecution Service."" Tolppanen, the current head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, did not respond to questions about why the second review panel was never convened â€” after his ministry said justice required it happen. Doug Schweitzer, the current Alberta justice minister, also declined a recent request for an interview with The Fifth Estate. ""This matter predates the minister's time in office,"" his spokesperson said in an email. While the charge goes back almost a decade, Herchak said she is still living with the consequences of a miscarriage of justice. ""Why would you just shuffle the paperwork deep down and, like, destroy someone's life?"" Herchak said. ""That's my life, right there, that could have changed. But instead, I have this to deal with.""

Lung Association targets adults in battle against youth vaping,"The P.E.I. Lung Association has launched a new toolkit to help parents, teachers and coaches talk to young people about vaping. The association, in partnership with the Home and School Federation and Sport P.E.I., has created a toolkit with different modules for teachers, parents and families, and coaches. ""We're trying to work with adult influencers that are in the youths' lives to get this information out to them,"" said Julia Hartley, the association's co-ordinator. Hartley said the P.E.I.Â organization decided to target adults because Health Canada already has an anti-vapingÂ campaign aimed at youth and because surveys had shown them thatÂ many adults have misconceptions about vaping. The toolkitÂ covers what vaping is, why it's popular with youth and how to have a conversation about it with young people. The information was still crafted with children in mind â€” focus groups this fall in Charlottetown and Stratford with youth ages 12 to 14 showed they wanted to hear personal stories from other youth, which is reflected in the material. ""We were trying to meet the kids where they're at and see the kinds of issues that would resonate with them,"" Hartley said. ""Often children aren't as affected by something that might happen to them in 20 years, but when they see someone else that's their age with an issue ... resulting directly from vaping, then I think that that's something that might connect with them a little better."" Aside from the toolkit, the association is lobbying for P.E.I. to follow in the footsteps of Nova Scotia, which is banning the sale of flavoured e-cigarettes and juices as of April 1.Â  The non-profit group Smoke Free Nova Scotia recently conducted a survey that showed 95 per cent of youth who vape in Nova Scotia said they prefer flavoured juices, and more than 48 per cent said they would quit if flavours were banned. The only types of e-cigarettes and juice that will be available in Nova Scotia after the ban comes into effect are bland and tobacco. Hartley said the association wants the same rules in P.E.I. ""These flavours are created to directly target youth and to get them vaping and ... we completely support a ban on flavouring,"" she said. In November, the P.E.I. Legislature unanimously passed a private member's bill that aims to restrict where vaping products are sold, raises the age limit on e-cigarettes and tobacco from 19 to 21 andÂ restricts the sale of certain flavours. The Canadian Vaping Association has said banning flavoured products may protect youth from purchasing e-cigarettes and other vaping products, butÂ limits options for adults looking to stop smoking cigarettes. The Vaping Industry Trade Association said that vaping is much less harmful than smoking, but also stresses that minors should not have access to vaping products.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-anti-vaping-1.5433903,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/vaping-illness-alberta-first-1.5413065 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5270097/stay-away-from-e-cigarettes-doctor-warns-as-vaping-related-illness-sweeps-the-u-s-1.5270102 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-flavours-youth-campaign-1.5421165 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/juul-canada-flavoured-vaping-pods-1.5426832 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flavoured-e-cigarettes-1.5413871 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tax-hike-makes-it-pricier-to-buy-vape-products-in-b-c-1.5417863 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-oleary-fire-dog-saves-owner-1.5433694 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-outreach-centre-1.5433735,N/A417,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:45:34.303Z,Israeli army kills 3 Palestinian attackers near Gaza fence,"The Israeli military said its soldiers killed three Palestinians who crossed the Gaza border fence and threw an explosive device at troops on Tuesday. The army said its troops fired on three suspects who crossed the security fence and ""hurled a grenade or an explosive device"" at the soldiers. There was no immediate comment from the Gaza authorities. The deadly confrontationÂ along the Gaza frontier threatened to undermine efforts to reach an informal ceasefire between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas that rules the Palestinian enclave. Earlier in the day, a senior Hamas official saidÂ incendiary balloons Palestinians launched from the Gaza Strip recently were a signal to Israel to accelerate unofficial ""understandings"" meant to ease the crippling blockade on the Hamas-ruled territory. The resumption of flammable balloons and other explosive devices flown across the border broke a month of calm that had largely prevailed since Hamas suspended its weekly protests along the Israeli-Gaza frontier. The quiet is meant to bolster an informal truce between Israel and Hamas being negotiated by international mediators. Speaking to journalists, Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya accused the Israelis of moving too slowly. He said the balloons had been launched by disgruntled individuals, not Hamas. But he said his group was ""satisfied"" with the launches and is ready to send more ""if the occupation doesn't pick up the message."" Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas, a militant group that seeks Israel's destruction, seized control of the territory in 2007. The blockade, combined with Hamas mismanagement, has devastated the local economy. After three wars and dozens of smaller skirmishes, the bitter enemies have been working through Qatari, Egyptian and UNÂ mediators to reach a series of ""understandings"" that would ease the blockade in exchange for guarantees of quiet. Al-Hayya said Hamas expects Israel to allow in more medical supplies, unlimited trade between Gaza and the world, help create more jobs and extend Qatari payments for electricity and poor families. The incendiary balloons have not caused any damage or injuries on the Israeli side. But last week, an Israeli military helicopter struck an alleged Hamas target in Gaza in response to the resumption of the launches. The UN's Mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, called the renewed balloon launches ""concerning and regrettable"" in a briefing to the Security Council on Tuesday. ""These actions are a risk to the civilian population,"" he said. For the past 20 months, Hamas organized weekly demonstrations along the fence, demanding an end to the blockade. The protests often turned violent, including with the launch of hundreds of incendiary balloons that torched large swaths of Israeli farmland. More than 200 Palestinians, mostly unarmed, were killed by Israeli fire during the marches and hundreds of others were badly wounded. Israel, which drew international accusations of using excessive force, has said it is defending itself from attacks and attempts to breach the border. Hovering around 50 per cent, Gaza's unemployment rate is one of the world's highest and most of its twoÂ million people rely on humanitarian assistance.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/gaza-israel-1.5435317,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-hits-hamas-after-balloon-resume-1.5430314,N/A418,Shaina Luck,2020-01-20T20:41:10.789Z,Public to get more time to file formal complaints against police,"The province plans to give people in Nova Scotia more time to file an official complaint against police.Â  Right now, someone who wants to file a complaint with the independent Office of the Police Complaints CommisionerÂ has six months to do so. The province plans to extend the time limit to one year. The change would apply to all municipal police forces in Nova Scotia. The time limit on complaints against the RCMP is already one year. The current police complaints process has come underÂ fire in the last yearÂ in some high-profile instances, such as Carrie Low, a woman who said Halifax Regional Police failed to properly investigate a rape committed against her. The complaints process was also identified as a concern in the Wortley report, which was released by the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission last year and examinedÂ street checksÂ by police on the blackÂ community. ""I think a year is far more consistent with other policing services across Canada, and a six-month time limit is just ultimately too short,"" said Emma Halpern, the executive director of the Elizabeth Fry Society of Mainland Nova Scotia.Â  ""It doesn't allow people to process what's happened and their concerns and complaints in order to bring it forward. So I think it's definitely a positive all around to see the complaints process amended."" However, Halpern said for sexual assault survivors, a one-year time limit on complaints may be too short. ""Because of the incredible trauma associated with sexual assault, the time at which you might discover that you've had a mishandling of the case or a harm committed by the policing agency, that might happen at a later date once you've had a chance to process the trauma that you've been going through. Really, that shouldn't be limited to a year.""Â  Low's complaint against Halifax police was not heardÂ because she filed it outside the six-month time limit. She has launched a court challenge and wants a judge to order the police complaints commissioner to investigate her complaint. The anticipated changes to legislation, however, would not beÂ retroactive and won't help her. ""I'm certainly delighted to see that there is going to be a change made, however I do feel that there does need to be some alternate changes to that,"" Low said. One issue is that a person might not discover police have been negligent until much later. Even if they quickly file a complaint, it may still be too long after the negligence actually occurred. ""For future, people that need to bring complaints against police services, I think it's great, it's a good step in the right direction. But I will be up for a lengthy battle in mine,"" she said. The province told the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities in a letter that the police complaints commissioner will have the ability to extend the timeline beyond one year if there's a good reason to do so, in the public interest. The province hasn't decided exactly what date the change will take effect, butÂ the earliest it could happen isÂ Dec. 19,Â 2020.Â  Last May,Â the Halifax board of police commissioners decided to askÂ the provincial minister of justice to extend the six-month period for complaints to one year, following concerns brought forward in the Wortley report.Â Â  The police complaints commissioner, Judith McPhee, also asked for the six months to be extended.

Intuitively you would say that there will be an increased cost because there's more of an opportunity for people to bring these matters forward.""Â  Kinsella said he thinks it is ""exceedingly important"" for people to bring their concerns about police forward.Â Â  ""We need to increase the dialogue, we need to increase community members' opportunities to come forward whenever they want to bring any information in regards to police conduct or activity,"" he said.Â Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/public-will-get-more-time-to-file-formal-complaints-against-police-1.5433413,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/police-say-missing-truro-man-was-killed-1.5433206 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/saint-john-man-identified-after-body-found-digby-county-1.5433163 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/william-sandeson-taylor-samson-murder-appeal-nova-scotia-halifax-1.5428347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/facilities-at-clam-harbour-beach-to-be-torn-down-1.5432945 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/jim-smith-liberal-cabinet-minister-health-community-services-justice-1.5433030,N/A419,Charlene Pele and Frances D'Emilio,2020-01-17T20:52:10.829Z,Portrait found in gallery walls verified as missing Klimt masterpiece,"Art experts have confirmed that a painting discovered hidden inside an Italian art gallery's walls last month is Gustav Klimt's Portrait of a Lady,Â which was stolen from the gallery nearly 23 years ago. The authentication of the painting announced Friday solved one of the art world's enduring mysteries â€”Â where did the missing work end up? â€”Â but left several questions unanswered, including who had taken it and whether it ever left the museum's property.Â  A gardener at the Ricci OddiÂ modern art gallery in the northern Italian city of Piacenza was clearing away ivy last month and noticed a small panel door on a wall outside. He opened it and, inside the space, found a plastic bag containing a painting that appeared to be the missing masterpiece. ""It's with no small emotion that I can tell you the work is authentic,"" PiacenzaÂ prosecutor Ornella Chicca told reporters Friday, as two police officers stood on either side of an easel bearing the recovered painting.Â  Portrait of a Lady,Â depicts a young woman sensually glancing over her shoulder against a dreamy, moss green background.Â Klimt finished the painting in 1917, the year before he died. The Ricci Oddi gallery acquired it in 1925 and reported it missing in February 1997.Â Â  Since the gardener's discovery on Dec. 10, the canvas had been kept in a vault of a local branch of Italy's central bank while experts used infrared radiation and other non-invasive techniques to determine if it was the original. Experts said the painting was in remarkably good condition. One of the few signs of damage was a scratch near the edge of the canvas that may have resulted ""from a clumsy effort to remove the portrait from its frame,"" said Anna Selleri, an art restorer from the National Gallery in Bologna, Italy.Â  The experts who did the verification work found persuasive evidence in the work of their peers more than two decades ago.Â  An Italian high school student, preparing for her graduation exams in 1996,Â noticed strikingÂ similaritiesÂ between the paintingÂ and an earlier Klimt work of a woman with a similar posture and gaze â€” but wearing a hat and scarf, accessories that the artist didn't include in Portrait of a Lady.Â  Intrigued by the observations of the student â€”Â who went on to become an art researcher herself â€”Â experts back then examined the artwork in the Piacenza gallery's collection and found that Klimt had painted it on top of an earlier portrait of a woman. Experts studying the recovered work inÂ recent weeks, with the aid of X-rays, saw the earlier portrait. Selleri said the radiation analysis revealed that while painting the later portrait, Klimt didn't redo much of the face, but used whitish pigment from the earlier version for the skin. Portrait of a LadyÂ was officially listed as missing on Feb. 22, 1997, but might have been snatched from a gallery wall a few days earlier, during the exhibit preparation work. So who stole the painting? Chicca said police were studying some traces of organic material on the recovered canvas in hopes they might provide leads.Â  Asked if authorities knew if the piece had ever left the gallery's grounds, investigators said that's something else they hope to find out.Â  As for why and when the painting ended up stashed behind a wall, journalist Anne-Marie O'Connor, the author of a book about the dramatic fortunes of Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer,Â has an educated theory.Â  Before the 1990s, Klimt was largely ""considered an Austrian painter, but his stature really grew at this point,"" O'Connor said. When Portrait of a LadyÂ was taken, the value of the art nouveau artist's paintings was ""soaring,"" she said.Â  O'Connor ventured that perhaps whoever took the painting stowed it behind the gallery's walls while waiting for news about the heist to die down but the stolen work proved ""too hot to handle.""Â  ""It would have been hard to sell it to a private buyer"" on the so-called grey market, O'Connor noted in a phone interview from London.Â  Some of Klimt's works have experienced stunning turns of fortune. O'Connor's 2012 book The Lady In GoldÂ chronicled the ultimately successful effort by a woman to recover Klimt's Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer.Â  That portrait was snatched from the Bloch-Bauer home in Vienna in 1941 by a Nazi officer. The woman, Bloch-Bauer's niece, later sold the painting to cosmetics mogul Ronald Lauder in 2006 for $135 million US. Another famous Klimt piece is a second portrait of the same woman, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II.Â Oprah Winfrey eventually purchased that painting and reportedly sold it a few years ago for $150 million.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/painting-verified-klimt-1.5430909,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/stolen-klimt-walls-1.5392094 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/climate-strikes-impeach-o-meter-fixing-democracy-spoofing-downton-abbey-nxivm-whistleblower-more-1.5297400/an-art-dealer-disappeared-with-50m-17-years-later-a-documentary-crew-found-him-1.5297422 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nazi-looted-painting-returns-to-vienna-museum-1.972466,N/A420,Anonymous,2020-01-20T21:55:26.141Z,Vandalized Regina WalMart to reopen Tuesday,"The City of Regina can breathe easy as its third WalMart location reopens on Tuesday morning.

The Student Employment Experience Development (SEED) program will provide fewer job placements and limit employers to non-profit groups, First Nations and municipalities, the province announced Tuesday. The Progressive Conservative government is also scrapping the lottery system used to select students and allowing MLAs to recommend employers.Â  Trevor Holder, the minister of post-secondary education, training and labour, told reporters the program overhaul brings a greater level of fairness to the process while taking politics out of it.Â  Under the previous model, high school and post-secondary students entered a draw for placement vouchers and employers would then have to find a student with a voucher. Holder said that system meant some unlucky students never received a placement and it also created a disadvantage for rural employers and some non-profitsÂ that relied on students to run summer programsÂ because there weren't enough nearby students with vouchers. ""We have heard consistently from communities, from MLAs, from stakeholders in the community that the non-profit sector was not necessarily given the attention that it had previous when, in the past, this had been strictly a non-profit, municipality program,"" Holder said. The new system, which is already in place, has employers applying to his department for SEED funding. Each MLA will be allowed to recommend 22 placements in their riding. The applications are reviewed, approved employers will be notified in March and the jobs will be posted online. Students can then apply directly to the employers. Holder said he trusts MLAs to be engaged in their districts and to understandÂ the local needs, noting it's part of the government's ""strategy to empower MLAs."" He said each employer will be vetted and the department has the final say. ""In my view we have finally taken the politics out of it and treated every region around the province equal regardless of how the people in that area voted,"" Holder said. ""And I think this will go a long way to de-politicizing this process."" But the executive director of the New Brunswick Student Alliance said the changes are doing the exact opposite. ""I think it politicized the process,"" said KJ Conyers-Steede, adding the alliance pushed to remove MLAs from the process a few years ago.Â  ""We have wonderful civil servants who work within [the department] who are capable of providing insight of the services and the jobs placements."" Conyers-Steede, who said the alliance was not consulted about the changes, said provincial governments continue to tinker with programs like SEED and student financial aid, using them as a ""political football."" He said post-secondary students who are investing in the New Brunswick system ""want some predictability."" The SEED program alone has been changed three times in the last five years. Holder said the budget won't be changed, but there will be about 200 fewer placements available than the 1,400 last year. He said non-profit groups often require more than a 50 per cent subsidy â€” in some cases 100 per cent â€” meaning fewer dollars to go around with the new emphasis on non-profit employers. The minister said the subsidies aren't needed in the private sector. ""This gives us a lot more flexibility,"" Holder said. ""It allows us to focus squarely on on the priority of making sure our non-profit sector was supported here.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-changes-student-employment-1.5435534,[],N/A423,Shaina Luck,2020-01-22T16:11:38.172Z,'Historic' change allows transgender girls to enter Eskasoni pageant,"For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, the Eskasoni First Nation's annual winter carnival pageant is open to transgender women and girls. The Eskasoni Winter Carnival has been running for decades as a fundraiser for the local Holy Family Parish. The pageant is one of the most popular events of theÂ festival in Cape Breton. ""To have this as one of the biggest symbols of gender affirmation for people who are trans is a total success and a very historic moment, not only for Mi'kmaw people, not only for peopleÂ in Eskasoni, but for transgender women and girls all across this world,"" said Geordy Marshall, who is with Pride Eskasoni. Marshall is also the communications person for the Eskasoni First Nation and sits on the organizing committee for the winter carnival. He said about two dozen participants spend a month working on things like public speaking and confidence for the pageant. They bond as friends to encourage each other and learn from elders. ""It's an opportunity for young women to learn who they are and learn from the finest women in our community to become women. It's almost like a coming-of-age type of event,"" Marshall said. So far, one transgender participant has signed up,Â Bella Marie Poulette. SheÂ and her sponsors decided she should wait until after the pageant to do interviews to make sure the pageantÂ is fair for all participants and to allow her to have the same kind of experience as everyone else. ""She is excited and she's felt overwhelmed by all of this emotionally,"" Marshall said. ""She's just overfilled with joy. This is something she's dreamed of all her life to do."" The winter carnival will take place Feb. 20-23. Maryanne Junta, 19, won the title of queen in the 2016 pageant.Â She said she loves thatÂ transgender girls are now allowed to enter. ""Trans girls are girls and it shouldn't be any other way,"" she said. ""They should be allowed to join pageants, they should be allowed to go in the girls bathroom, because they're girls. They should be able to experience life as a girl, as they want to.""Â  Marshall saidÂ the community's reaction has been mixed.Â  ""There were people who celebrated and rejoiced on the wonderful day, but there's also a lot of people who expressed their transphobic beliefs and were totally against it,"" he said. Marshall said many transgender teens struggle with poor self-esteem, which is one reason being able to enter the pageant with other young girls is important. ""It's hard to live in a world where it's full of lateral violence and residual effects from residential schools and Indian day schools and colonization. A lot of these young girls deal with a lot of pressure in their lives,"" he said. ""This is one of the great things we get to celebrate as a community.Â We see all of their hard work paid offÂ and we truly honour them on that day.Â Whether they're a crowned winner or not, they're all our princesses.""

The province's publicly owned utility paid Florida-based Joi Scientific $13 million, hoping for a cut of potential profits from its mysterious technology. But a pair of large-scale potential investors in Japan, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Softbank's Vision Fund, have told Joi they need to see more results before they ante up, according to Joi's CEO in a conference call with investors. On the same call, CEO Traver Kennedy also poured cold water on an apparent proposal to have Joi work with Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems to power the Olympic flame at next summer's 2020 Games in Tokyo. Joi was in talks with Mitsubishi, a major Olympic sponsor, about demonstrating its technology during the event, but ""so far they have not provided us funding or stepped up to make it a reality,"" Kennedy said. The conference call took place when Joi was at what Kennedy called ""an inflection point"" â€” in the midst of a technological audit of their process, which is supposed to efficiently generate hydrogen energy from seawater. The audit was prompted by the company's realization that it was calculating power incorrectly and that the technology's efficiency was poor. During the call, Kennedy acknowledged results from its new calculations were ""disappointing,"" revealing what he called ""poor system efficiencies."" CBC News obtained a record of the call, which took place between mid-July and the end of August. NB Power CEO GaÃ«tan Thomas said earlier this year that Joi's secret technology could create hydrogen electricity from seawater â€” and could actually produce more energy than what it took to power the process. One of the company's patents claimed results as high as 200 per cent.Â  But a former employee told CBC News that the energy output was only around 20 per cent. LastÂ Friday, Thomas told a committee of MLAs that only one test had been at the 20 per cent level and others had better results, showing ""potential."" But he said confidentiality agreements prevented him from naming those figures. He said the numbers would have to exceed 70 per cent efficiency for the technology to be viable and they're not at that point yet. Thomas told the legislature's Crown corporations committee that several large players in Europe, North America and Asia are working with NB Power to ""scale"" the technology to commercial levels. ""There's a number of players working with us on this now, and some pretty strong players,"" he said, ""so we should be in a position in a few months to determine if we can go forward or not."" He refused to name those players. NB Power paid Joi $13 million for licensing rights to use, market and profit from the technology, hoping it would provide an alternate energy source for its Belledune generating station, which must phase out coal by 2030. So far NB Power has reported no profits from that licensing fee. Softbank, owned by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, ""told us that once we have a unit built that can demonstrate commercial opportunity, they would be interested in investing,"" Joi CEO Traver Kennedy told investors during the call. ""Until we get there, and we're not there yet, they're not interested in investing. â€_ We need to get the technology to product stage."" Softbank's recent investment of more than $20 billion in WeWork, a shared-workplace company, has been flagged by financial analysts as risky. The company's renewable energy investments have focused on wind and solar power. Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems was still looking at Joi at the time of the conference call and visited the company's Florida offices earlier the same month, but hadn't seen enough to inject much-needed capital into the Florida company. Kennedy told shareholders that Mitsubishi Hitachi signed a memorandum of understanding with Joi in August 2018 but didn't commit to investing. ""Once they complete their diligence, they then will develop a commercial business plan and will decide whether or not to invest in our company."" Mitsubishi is an enthusiastic promoter of hydrogen energy, though its chief technological officer,Â Akimasa Muyama, warned last year that hydrogen from renewable sources would be the norm only ""in the long term,"" after technical advances brought costs down. Mitsubishi is also a major sponsor of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, and during the summer conference call, Kennedy was asked whether Joi was ""still working towards powering the Olympic flame"" at those games.Â  ""We remain very interested in this opportunity,"" Kennedy answered. ""Not sure if it's going to be the flame, but MHPS presented the idea of participating in the Tokyo Olympics to do a demonstration along with their partners."" He said Mitsubishi officials ""still have interest in this"" and discussed it when they visited Joi's Florida labs, but did not commit any money to make it happen. Mitsubishi and Softbank have not responded to requests for comment. Kennedy told the conference call that earlier this year, Joi ""decided not to accept new investments"" when it realized there was ""uncertainty"" about its power calculations. The company launched a technical audit over the summer. Preliminary results were discouraging, forcing Joi to return to ""square one,"" a former Joi employee told CBC News. That meant ""just basic research, reading scientific articles and finding out what the best avenue is from there,"" said the former employee, who CBC News is referring to as Alex to protect their identity. According to the conference call, Joi's freeze on investment left the company with only enough cash to operate until the end of August, and the company decided to reopen itself to new investment while acknowledging its lack of a breakthrough. ""We're now seeking new funding based upon our new understanding of the system efficiency, realizing it will have a significant impact on the company's valuation,"" Kennedy said during that call. He said Joi was ""being very open and candid about where we are as a company and where we are in terms of our development of commercial product."" Company officials have refused to grant any interviews with CBC News about the state of the company and its research. Despite other large investors holding off, NB Power continues to spend $20,000 per month operating a laboratory at Joi's Florida headquarters. Thomas called that ""a minimal investment.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-investors-hydrogen-partner-joi-scientific-1.5345389,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-joi-committee-1.5344197 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-technology-update-1.5340245,N/A425,Guy Quenneville,2020-01-21T14:20:00.581Z,Saskatoon architect sparks discussion with ideas for where new arena should go,"The City of Saskatoon isn't expected to update city council on its search for a new arena site for several more weeks, but that's not stopping one architect from stoking discussion on six locations he says have potential.Â  Bertrand Bartake, an architect at Kindrachuk Agrey Architecture who started aÂ lively tweet-thread Sunday about where to locate the arena, is not affiliated with the city. He said he's just passionate about urban issues. ""I also just wanted to get a discussion going,"" Bartake said of his suggestions, which are based on factors like location, scale, proximity to other downtown amenities and potential to spur other development. Saskatoon city council has already pledged to locate the arena (and potential adjoining convention centre) downtown. Lesley Anderson, the city's director of planning, saidÂ earlier this month that the city's next report to council will arrive in the coming weeks. Whether that report will lay out the candidate sites draftedÂ by the city remains unclear. Ultimately, however, city council will choose the successful site following public consultation. While Bartake mapped out six potential locations, ""the Toys 'R'Â Us site is my personal favourite,"" he said.Â  The lot, numbered ""2"" on Bartke's map,Â is immediately south of Midtown Plaza and is largely vacant save for the toy store, he said. We're expecting to hear about the site for a new arena in <a href=""https://twitter.com/DTNYXE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@DTNYXE</a> in the 1st quarter of this year. Over the next couple days I'll discuss 6 potential arena sites in the core of <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/yxe?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#yxe</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/YXEarena?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#YXEarena</a> <a href=""https://t.co/bLbgzQNcuk"">pic.twitter.com/bLbgzQNcuk</a> ""Build it on the biggest empty parking lot in the downtown,"" echoed Bob Patrick,Â a faculty member in the geography and planning department at the University of Saskatchewan.Â Â  BartakeÂ said it's the only site on his list with some slope to it, creating potential for loading off 19th Street. It would also make an impression on drivers coming into downtown, BartakeÂ said.Â  ""It's probably out of all of them got the best landmark potential for a building,"" Bartake said. I would really like it to be #2. Would be so amazing for the fan experience. I do see congestion issues for the events that draw 15,000+ but assume that will be addressed. Iâ€™ll state the obvious then and say but what about Toys R us?!?!?!?! It's a tight space, though. ""If the city is committed to an arena-convention centreâ€_. you have to get creative or maybe build one on top of the other or buy some adjacent land,"" Bartake said.Â  The other potential sites mapped out by Bartake are numbered as follows: Alan Wallace, president of Saskatchewan Professional Planners Institute and the former director of planning for the City of Saskatoon, said the parking lot across from The Bay (Option 4 on Bartake's list) makes the most sense. First Avenue, where city council has already decided to locate a key downtown artery of the future bus-rapid-transit service, is located right near the site, Wallace said. ""Rapid transit is extremely important because then you don't need all that surface parking,"" Wallace said.Â  ""And the second thing is you've [already] got a critical mass of retail restaurants, hotels, entertainment and so on there.Â  You also have the ability to connect it to the existing convention center."" This downtown parking lot could be a contender for Saskatoon's new arena The parking lot in question is owned by the Midtown Plaza. Terry Napper, the mall's general manager, previously saidÂ the owners of the mall are not interested in selling the parking lot.Â  ""That could be posturing just to drive the price up,"" Bartake said.Â  The arena eyed for replacement, SaskTel Centre, is home forÂ several sports teams, including the Saskatchewan Rattlers basketball team.Â  Rattlers President and COO Lee Genier said he'd be happy with either the Toys ""R""Â UsÂ site, the Bay-adjacent parking lot or River Landing. ""I don't think any one is better than the other,"" Genier said,Â  ""as long as you have good ingress and egress."" Bruce Urban, owner of the Saskatchewan Rush lacrosse team, which also plays at SaskTel Centre, declined to cite a preference beyond wanting it to be in or near downtown. ""We do not know the exact associated land costs of each site, so we cannot comment without the proper knowledge,"" he said in a statement.Â  The River Landing option is the only one that the city has confirmed is actually under consideration. River Landing noted as possible location for downtown Saskatoon arena The area has also been touted for its potential to host other developments, including a new condo tower and a new market to replace the recently-departed Saskatoon Farmers Market' Co-operative. A prime River Landing plot could sprout Saskatoon's next high-rise condo building Riversdale condo developer 'disappointed' with loss of neighbourhood's farmers market Bartake likened his Option 3, at the corner of Idylwyld and 22nd Street, as the ""Portage and Main"" of Saskatoon, referring to the heart of downtown Winnipeg. ""It's also one of the worst intersections for people with vehicles,"" Bartake said. ""It's fine but nobody wants to stand there or hang out there."" It's also the smallest site on his list.Â  Best to worst; 6, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1.<br>6 has the most access to major arteries, large multi use area and potential for rapid rail access. 2 &amp; 4 great for access to bars and restaurants, but 3 would need to be a multi level parkade for both to work. 5 no. 1 is terrible. Worst access. Bartake's final two suggestions, Options 5 and 6, are both located in Saskatoon's north downtown area. Option 5 would encompass a lot southeast of the Saskatoon Police Service station that includes the John Deere building. ""That site is one that hasn't really been talked about,"" Bartake said. ""I saw that site as being one that is large enough to support a facility of this size."" If no. 5 means demolishing the old John Deere building you can just take that one off of there right now! (That's where the architecture school is supposed to go.) No. 2 is my personal favourite fwiw. Option 6 is the large city yards area flanking the police station to the north. ""You actually use the arena to form the land bridge that was proposed in that North Downtown Master Plan,"" Bartake said. ""Putting anything on that site, you're really constricted [access-wise] because you've got an active rail line cutting across the site."" Option 6 appeared to garner the most support among people who responded to Bartake's tweet-thread.Â  #6 gives you the potential to build a district to help offset the costs of the arena. All others donâ€™t have that opportunity. 6. Everywhere else too much congestion. I work at Persephone &amp; during my evening shifts I struggle to find parking with having the theatre, the cinema, the mall and bars all in close proximity. 6 is the only option that works if you want it downtown Bartake said that while Site 6 is ""really disconnected from much of what's happening elsewhere"".... Is 6 really considered downtown? Seems terrible. ...it's not without opportunity. ""[The city] could really create a neighbourhood from cart blanche there,"" Bartake said.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-arena-1.5433663,[],N/A426,Teresa Wright,2020-01-22T16:08:12.239Z,Jagmeet Singh says NDP caucus will discuss whether to support new NAFTA,"New Democrat MPs are gathering inÂ Ottawa today for a two-day planning session to prepare the reopening of the House of Commons next week.

But Singh says the deal was negotiated in a ""behind-closed-doors, take-it-or-leave-it way"" and that his caucus will discuss whether to support it. ""How can Canadians trust the Liberals to get this right when they spent months saying they had the perfect deal and mocked us for saying it needed to be changed? Now they're trying to take credit for changes they said were impossible,"" he said in a statement Tuesday. ""Canadian workers shouldn't have to rely on American politicians to protect Canadian jobs. They can count on us to look carefully at this agreement. We're going to discuss it in caucus and in the debate in the House and see if it actually delivers for Canadians."" Blaney says the caucus meetings will also include discussions on the downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 and how MPs can support families of the 57 Canadian victims to get the transparency and answers they are looking for.

Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a UNÂ ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments. The UNÂ Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. ""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here."" Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, not least in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Yet the convention relating to the status of refugees, signed in 1951, made no provision for climate change as a reason for people to flee their country and seek asylum elsewhere. As climate impacts grow, legal questions become more complicated. UNHCR, whose budget has risen from $1.3 billionÂ Cdn a year in the early 1990s to $11Â billion in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people. Turkey is the largest recipient, with more than 4 million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. That has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe. Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up, and he is now calling for the ""resettlement"" of up to 1 million Syrians in the north of their homeland. Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis, which has affected them since 2015, but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation. ""We must recognize that, for the past several years (Turkey)has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is 'let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-refugees-un-1.5435843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/canada-climate-refugees-1.5165029,N/A429,Anonymous,N/A,N/A,N/A,http://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/stormcentre/index.html?region=NL,[],N/A430,Anonymous,2020-01-21T20:26:37.099Z,"Makeshift slopes, ice-covered homes and other post-blizzard fun","When the weather forecast gives Newfoundland and Labrador lemons, people here do their best to make lemonade.

Her daughter, June Keenatch, took up the case after her mother'sÂ 2015Â death and continued the fight all the way to the B.C. Supreme Court where she faced Justice Canada's lawyers.Â Â Â  Federal lawyers argued that her mother did not qualify for compensation because she hadn't been officially admitted at the schoolÂ at the time of the assaultÂ and the federal employee was also not technically connected to a residential school â€” though he claimed to take children to the institutions. Justice Brenda Brown sided with Ottawa and dismissed the case in a ruling delivered on Jan. 9. ""I don't think that it was fair; there is no justice,"" said June Keenatch. KeenatchÂ saidÂ her mother had six children and used a wheelchair for much of her life.Â Â  ""I feel like the government is pretty racist toward First Nations people, like our lives don't really matter,"" said Keenatch, who lives in Saskatoon. NDP MP Charlie Angus said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, whose department directs Justice Canada on residential school cases, should settle with the family.Â  Angus said the case was one of the most glaring examples of the legal tactics federal lawyers used to defeat residential school claims.Â  ""No one in this government has contested in any way the facts of this terrible case. Yet they denied her justice on the grounds she was raped on the way to a residential school and not on the property itself,"" said Angus, in a news conference Monday.Â  ""What we have seen, time and time again, is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors."" Therese Keenatch was 15Â when she was picked up by a guidance counsellor employed by the department of Indian Affairs while she walked in her home community of Witchekan Lake First Nation in September 1970, according to Brown's ruling. Therese Keenatch ""knew nothing about residential schools . . . andÂ she did not know whose idea it was for her to attend one,"" according to evidence fromÂ Keenatch's original testimony described in Brown's ruling. The guidance counsellor then stopped his car near the town of Kilwinning, Sask., and sexually assaulted her before moving on to drop her off at St. Michael's residential school at Duck Lake,Â about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, according to Keenatch's evidence described in the ruling.Â  Doug Racine, a Saskatoon lawyer with the Aboriginal Law Group, represented June Keenatch. He said the case was lost on highly technical grounds based on competing interpretations of the wording of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA). ""It is very, very frustrating,"" said Racine, who fought the case for free. ""The courts sometimes are ill-equipped to deal with the trauma and justice in the sense of doing what is right. This was a technical decision."" Therese Keenatch's claimÂ wasÂ rejected repeatedly by the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) created by theÂ IRSSAÂ to provide compensation for abuse suffered at the institutions.Â  The B.C. Supreme Court case hinged on whether the IAP adjudicators erred in their decisions.Â  Brown said in her ruling that compensation could still be sought from the government through another legal channel. ""This is indeed a troubling case, and a troubling outcome,"" wrote Brown, who is a supervising judge for the IRSSA. ""But as the initial adjudicator noted, the finding that no compensation could be granted under the IAP for this very serious sexual assault in no way precluded pursuing the claim through other means.""Â  June Keenatch said she is done fighting. ""I just pretty much gave up,"" she said. ""This has been going on for a long time now."" Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett's office said in a statement that what happened to Therese KeenatchÂ was ""horrific and inexcusable.""Â The statement said the government is committed to resolving all claims, even if they fall outside the negotiated terms of the residential schools settlement agreement. ""Minister Bennett has directed departmental officials to identify other possible means for appropriate resolution as the Government of Canada does not dispute these allegations,"" said the statement. ""Minister Bennett has also directed the department to investigate toÂ ensureÂ appropriate resolution of similar claims."" Angus said the Crown-Indigenous Relations minister should never have fought this case.Â  ""She needs to come clean with Canadian people. What does reconciliation mean in her government when they take positions like this?"" he said. Angus said theÂ case is just another example of how federal lawyers used technical arguments to defeat residential school cases throughout the settlement process.Â He said a parliamentary committee needs to review how Ottawa handled the IRSSA. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said. According to the latest statistics available on the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat's website, as of Dec. 31, 2019 a total of 99 per cent of the over 38,000 claims filed have been resolved and close to 90 per cent of IAP claimants have received compensation under the IAP.

In keeping with the ""cooling-off"" period required by federal law, Jacques LaforgeÂ waited a year before accepting thisÂ paid role. But he was notÂ required to notifyÂ the federal ethics commissioner in order to evaluate whether the move wasÂ appropriateÂ â€”Â something that troubles critics of Canada's current conflict of interest rules. Laforge, a New Brunswick dairy farmer and a former president of the Dairy Farmers of Canada, was appointed CEOÂ of the commission by then-agriculture minister Gerry Ritz in 2012. The director ofÂ corporate services forÂ the Canadian Dairy Commission (CDC), Chantal Paul, confirmed to CBC News that Laforge's mandate ended inÂ MayÂ 2018 and he left the Crown corporation at that time. The corporate website for China Feihe Limited saysÂ Laforge was appointed as one of its three independent non-executive directors in June 2019. HisÂ appointmentÂ took effect in October, just over a month beforeÂ the Canary Islands-registered corporation wasÂ listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Under Laforge'sÂ leadership, the CDCÂ signed agreements in 2016 with FeiheÂ to build aÂ new manufacturing facilityÂ in Canada, where no other dairy processorÂ makesÂ infant formula. Now incorporated in Canada under the nameÂ Canada Royal Milk, theÂ factory took its first deliveries of Ontario milk in December and currently isÂ testing its processingÂ line. Once production ramps up, most of the formula will be exportedÂ to China. Documents obtained by CBC News under the Access to Information Act show that during Laforge'sÂ final two years as CEO, the CDCÂ set upÂ meetings forÂ Feihe executives withÂ other levels of government and federal regulators. Laforge also travelled to China multiple times, meeting with Feihe's chairman Leng Youbin and Chinese government officials. ""I definitely was involved in bringing them to Canada,"" he told CBC News. ""We spent a lot of energy ...Â We opened up the doors for them."" LaforgeÂ said he doesÂ not believe his role as one of three rotating independent board members amounts to a conflict with his former role at a Crown corporation because it's ""99 per cent international"" and won't deal directly with the Canadian factory. Despite his direct dealingsÂ with Feihe as a public official, LaforgeÂ told CBC he did not clear his new job with the federal ethics commissioner. When asked what post-employment rules apply forÂ Laforge, the CDC's Paul suggestedÂ the CBC examine Section 33 of the Conflict of Interest Act. It says: ""No former public office holder shall act in such a manner as to take improper advantage of his or her previous public office."" A spokesperson for Conflict of Interest andÂ EthicsÂ CommissionerÂ Mario DionÂ said his officeÂ can't answer questions about individuals because of confidentiality rules, but confirmed that Laforge'sÂ one-year ""cooling-off period"" is over, soÂ his board appointment is no longer prohibited. Guy Giorno, a former chief of staff to Stephen Harper who now advises clients onÂ ethics and accountability in his legal practice, said not requiring a former senior civil servantÂ like LaforgeÂ to discloseÂ offers of employment and submit to an ethics reviewÂ amounts to a ""hole"" in the law. ""It ought to be mandatory, and it stands to reason that the commissioner can't do a very good job policing people who have left when he's not under the statute required to be told about everybody who is seeking a new position,"" Giorno said. Nevertheless, several federal ethics rules apply for life, Giorno said. LaforgeÂ can't give advice based on confidential information he knewÂ as head of the CDC, and he can't ""switch sides"" and start working for FeiheÂ on any financial transactions or legal proceedings he handledÂ at the Crown corporation. But Section 33, the rule against ""taking improper advantage of a previous office,""Â hasn't been interpreted very often.Â Giorno called it ""very fuzzy."" ""That doesn't mean it's unimportant as a general rule ... In fact, it's the first listed in the statute,"" he said. Government service brings with it a network of contacts, goodwill and other ""intangible things"" which taxpayers paid LaforgeÂ to acquire, Giorno said. ""My own personal view is that Parliament intended to police the profiting from the monetization of those things,"" he said. ""Nothing happens for nothing. A former public servant must always be asking, 'Why are they paying me?'"" LaforgeÂ saidÂ he received a number of requestsÂ after he left the CDC. He followed itsÂ internal policy and waited a year before saying yes to anything, including Feihe's offer last summer. ""It's my first time doing this. I didn't know too much about independent directors,"" he said. ""Common sense was telling me, stay away for a year, and when you start taking things make sure that it's not in conflict of interest with some files."" ""They might have a Chinese nameÂ but ... they want to source and do things internationally,"" he added.Â ""I'm there to observe that they don't make any boo-boos affecting the shareholders."" He saidÂ he hasn't been paid yet, but expects his compensation to follow theÂ guidelines of the Hong Kong exchange, which provide for a ""basic fee of at least $400,000 HK ($67,000 Cdn) per year, coupled with additional payments for membership or chairing of board committees.""Â LaforgeÂ sits on twoÂ committees, including Feihe'sÂ audit committee. ""It might look lucrative,"" he said, adding it's not clear how much time it will require. He also admits he's nervous about the potential consequences of taking on this role. ""I know Feihe's a good company, but companies are companies. They go sideways once in a while,"" he said. David Mulroney, Canada's ambassador toÂ China from 2009-12, said it's not necessarily bad for a company that wants to build a high-quality reputation to have a Canadian aboard. DuringÂ China's 2008Â tainted baby formula scandal, which involvedÂ Feihe's competitor, directors on thatÂ company's board from New Zealand helpedÂ bring the facts to light. While Laforge said his role with the company is largely international,Â MulroneyÂ said the rationale forÂ his appointment still needs to be explored and explained. And although Laforge's appointment respects the ""cooling-off"" period in the law, Mulroney said that year-long period is too shortÂ â€” and Canadians should expect public servants to do more than tick the box on the minimum post-employment requirements. ""There's something wrong with the speed with which elected officials and senior officials areÂ taking jobs that do suggest they're trading on their past experience,"" the ex-ambassadorÂ said. ""The Chinese may be on the lookout for guanxiÂ opportunities in Canada,"" MulroneyÂ said, using a term that means ""connectedness"" to referÂ to theÂ ChineseÂ approach toÂ networking through seeking out personal connections. Without singling out Feihe, Mulroney said that China's corporate sector writ large is widely seen as too closely linked to the Chinese government. ""It's ... increasingly unclear in Xi Jinping'sÂ China that there are companies at all separate from the Chinese Communist Party,"" he said. ""It's difficult to understand why so many high-profile Canadians are allowing themselves to be associated with Chinese firms. It normalizes China at a time when China is anything but normal."" Feihe representatives have not responded to multiple interview requests inÂ recent months. CBC News asked Laforge about his decision to accept this workÂ at a delicate time in Canadaâ€“Chinese relations. ""Believe me ... don't think that's not crossing my mind,"" he said. ""It's too late now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/laforge-cdc-feihe-board-appointment-1.5375209,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-kingston-construction-1.4228501 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-plant-trade-1.4228502 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nafta-ratification-canada-friday-1.5429181 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/feihe-future-usmca-1.4858338,N/A433,Jackie McKay,2020-01-19T15:27:49.728Z,Inuit designers launch new line of parkas for Canada Goose ,"Canada Goose has launched a new collection of Inuit-made parkas.Â  The collection called Atigi 2.0 has 90 parkas made by 18 seamstresses who all live in Inuit Nunangat â€” Inuit regions ofÂ N.W.T., Nunavut, Quebec to Newfoundland and Labrador. Last year, Canada Goose launched project Atigi with 14 original parkas. The parkas from Atigi 2.0 were shown publicly for the first time at a media launch in New York Thursday.Â  ""It's unbelievable,"" said Stephanie Pitseolak, one of the designers who lives in Iqaluit. ""I can't believe my parka is there right now.""Â  New York isn't the only international city her parka will be on display; next week it will be making its way to France where the collection will be on display at the Canada Goose store in Paris. Pitseolak said the experience was exhausting. Canada Goose sends the seamstresses a box of materials to use for their designs. Things like fur, hollow fill insulation, zippers and Canada Goose commanders and patches with the logo. They had a month to make five identical parkas each in a different size.Â  Even Pitseolak was struggling. She said she couldn't give up and felt like her late grandmother was guiding her while she sewed.Â  ""I wanted people to know it's possible, even if you're very busy, even if you have kids, even if you're working,"" said Pitseolak.Â  ""I'm glad I did it and I'm happy for myself.""Â  The parkas will be onÂ sale at the Canada Goose website for $2,500 each. The proceeds will go to Inuit Tapiriit KanatamiÂ (ITK), a national organization that advocates for the rights and interests ofÂ Inuit in Canada.Â Â  Canada Goose donated nearly $80,000 to ITK from the sales of last year's Atigi parkas, according to ITK.

Parasite,Â the Korean language social satire about theÂ wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreignÂ language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26-year-history of the SAG awards. ParasiteÂ lead actor Song Kang Ho said winning on Sunday made him think that ""maybe we haven't created such a bad movie. ""I am so honoured to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,"" he said through an interpreter. Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood moviesÂ The IrishmanÂ and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,Â which bothÂ have A-list stars. The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, areÂ closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actorsÂ  form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion PictureÂ Arts and Sciences. Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fameÂ through violence inÂ JokerÂ has swept awards season. ""I am standing on the shoulders of my favourite actor â€”Â Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actorÂ  who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing theÂ  comic book villain. Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so farÂ for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopicÂ Judy. Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting roleÂ  as a charming stunt man in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,Â while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing aÂ ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic dramaÂ Marriage Story.

Sexual harassment drama BombshellÂ went into Sunday'sÂ awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed. Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangsterÂ movie The IrishmanÂ had another disappointing night, despite aÂ cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars onÂ  Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG. Those left out include immersive World War One film 1917,Â  the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, asÂ  well as Joker,Â Marriage Story,Â and novel adaptation LittleÂ  Women. De Niro, whose lead performance in The IrishmanÂ has beenÂ  snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given aÂ lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speechÂ  to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump.

""Someone helped me [get] out, but when I wanted to go back in, there was no one to open the door,"" said Marzo, 46.Â  ""It was cold. I called my sister but my sister was at work â€_ so I waited until my caregiver arrived."" She says none of the other doors in the building is an option. ""That means I get stuck behind the doors. If there's an emergency â€_ if there's a fire, I'm dead, there's no way I can get outside."" According to an advocate for people with disabilities, situations like Marzo's are ""all too common,"" because weak building codes and a lack of provincial accessibility laws are causing a ""chronic and pervasive shortage"" of accessible housing. ""Imagine that you're in a building where you paid good money to live â€_ and you can't get in or out without having someone there,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. ""Imagine you go to sleep at night knowing â€” God forbid â€” if there's a fire, you can't let yourself out. No one would want to live that way and people with disabilities shouldn't have to live that way."" Two years ago, after having emergency abdominal surgery, Marzo contracted sepsis â€” a reaction to a severe blood infection that leads to organs shutting down. Doctors amputated both legs and arms to save her life. Earlier this year, she started shopping for a condo that would allow her to get around with her wheelchair or prosthetics. She says she knew the place she bought wasn't perfect, but it was one of the few she could afford. She hoped to deal with issues as they came up, but never expected to be fighting for a door.Â  In May, a few months after she was locked outside in the cold, she asked the building manager if automatic doors could be installed. She was told the condo board decided not at this time. Marzo's social worker tried again, contacting the board on her behalf. She was told the board already had a plan for new doors but there would be no automatic push-button system due to security concerns of the doors being open too long. That explanation is ""a total red herring,"" according to Lepofsky. ""You could design doors with optical sensors to protect against that. But even a manual door, with a lock, there's no guarantee that requires it to be held open only long enough for the person with the key to get through."" Meanwhile, Marzo remains homebound and frustrated. ""I don't want to only benefit me. I want people who have lesser mobility to benefit as well. Because it's not easy to just be staying at home and be depressed,"" she said. The property management company declined to answer Go Public's questions, claiming it was a legal matter and referring us to the condo board. Go Public made repeated requests to board members for comment; all went unanswered. Automatic doors would cost between $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the design, according to Sean Crump from Universal Access, a Calgary company that provides advice to businesses on how to make buildings more accessible. Crump says there is public funding available to qualified candidates to help pay for building modifications, though it's not clear ifÂ Marzo's building qualifies.Â  ""There are a few resources. The federal government has an Enabling Access Fund that allows funds to be put into accessible design for spaces and buildings â€” and it's done a lot of good.""Â  More than three million people over the age of 15 have at least one physical disability according to the most recent Statistics Canada numbers from 2017. On July 11, the Accessible Canada Act came into force. Lepofsky says it's a well intentioned effort at mandating barrier-free access, but it, too, falls short by covering only sectors within Ottawa's jurisdiction like banking, telecommunications and the federal government. He says that leaves a mish-mash of accessibility laws â€” or none at all â€” at the provincial level. Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are the only provinces with that kind of legislation. ""We need the seven provinces in Canada that don't have a provincial accessibility law to enact one â€” to get with the program,"" Lepofsky said. But even in those provinces, Marzo would have little or no recourse. Manitoba and Nova Scotia's legislation don't address the responsibilities of condo boards. Ontario's does, but since it was implemented in 2005, it's done little to help people with disabilities, according to a review released in January by former lieutenant governor David Onley. ""We are almost 14 years later,"" Onley, who was Canada's first lieutenant governor with a physical disability, wrote, ""and the promised accessible Ontario is nowhere in sight."" ""For most disabled persons, Ontario is not a place of opportunity but one of countless, dispiriting, soul-crushing barriers."" Changing the building codes could also help, according to Lepofsky. But, though national and provincial codes cover new buildings and major renovations, older buildings like Marzo's are under no obligation to renovate. All of this, Lepofsky says, leaves people with disabilities to deal with problems ""one battle at a time"" through human rights complaints. The national and provincial human rights codes say buildings used by the public need to be accessible.Â  Marzo says everywhere she turned no one could â€” or would â€” help. She says her call to the Alberta Human Rights Commission wasn't returned and the City of Calgary told her there is nothing it can do. ""They just keep [telling me] call this person or this person and eventually someone from City of Calgary called me and said they cannot force the condo board to put the door in because it's not the law."" Go Public took Marzo's situation to provincial and federal lawmakers. Watch: Verna Marzo says she's determined not to let any barriers stand in her way Jennifer Dagsvik, spokesperson for Alberta's Ministry of Community and Social Service, says the province is ""monitoring"" the new federal and existing provincial laws.Â  She saysÂ while Alberta lacks an accessibility law, people with disabilities can seek help under the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Ottawa's most recent minister of public services and procurement and accessibility didn't answer Go Public's questions directly. Instead Carla Qualtrough sent a general statement, referring to theÂ Accessible Canada ActÂ and the accessibility review board â€” theÂ Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO) â€” it created.Â  ""While CASDO is still in its early stages of development, it has been made evident by Canadians and members of the disability community that standards in new and existing buildings is a priority,""Â Qualtrough said.Â  Marzo says she won't give up, saying it's ""hideous"" she's had to fight this hard to be able to enter and exit the building she lives in.Â  She's planning to talk to a lawyer for advice on what to do next. ""They will get old too,"" she says, referring to members of her condo board. ""And they will lose their strength. And they will thank me for that door if they will do it now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/go-public-disabled-automatic-door-1.5313633,[],N/A436,Bobbi-Jean MacKinnon,2020-01-21T01:21:32.472Z,Accused in hit-and-run death of Brady Francis told police he thought he hit a deer,"The day after Brady Francis was found dead, Maurice Johnson told police he initially thought he had struck a deerÂ in Saint-CharlesÂ the night before, his hit-and-run trial heard Monday. But after hearing media reports about a man being killed alongÂ Saint-Charles South Road, Johnson began to wonderÂ if he had hit him, testifiedÂ RCMP Const.Â Natasha Grimard-â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹BÃ©lisle, who took his statement. The MonctonÂ Court of Queen's Bench also saw security video of Johnson and his wife buying a pint of vodka and a case of 24 beer from the Co-Op inÂ Saint-Louis-de-Kent the afternoon Francis was killed. But Johnson told police he wasn't drinking that night and Cpl. Guillaume LaroseÂ testified he found no evidence Johnson had consumed alcohol. The body of Francis, 22, of ElsipogtogÂ First Nation, was found onÂ Feb. 24, 2018, at around 9:40 p.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles, has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. The trial, which is being held in French at Johnson's request, is scheduled to continue on Tuesday morning. Grimard-â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹BÃ©lisleÂ testified she was dispatched to Johnson's home on Feb. 25, 2018, after his wife called 911. Johnson told the officer he and his wife drove out to their camp the night before hoping to see some friends, but nobody was there andÂ they wereÂ getting tired, so they decided to head home. The couple wereÂ talking, and Johnson said when he turned his head to look at his wife for a split second heÂ hit what he believed to beÂ a deer, Grimard-â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹BÃ©lisle told the court. Johnson described it as being a blur, but about four feet high. He said he was driving about 85 kilometres an hour, possibly 95 km/h, and didn't have time to brake because it happened too fast, saidÂ Grimard-â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹BÃ©lisle. About three weeks later, Johnson was arrested at his home. On Monday, the court watched part of the videotaped statement he gaveÂ to theÂ RCMPÂ at the Richibucto detachment on March 15, 2018. In the video, Johnson is wearing a short-sleeved camouflaged shirt, jeans and white socks, andÂ sitting with his arms and legs crossed.Â Cpl. Nicholas Potvin, of the major crime unit in Moncton, asks him in French how he and his family are doing. ""It's not easy,"" Johnson replies in French.Â ""This is a young person. This is an accident,"" he says, then pauses, rubs his eye, andÂ looks down at the ground. Family and friends of Francis, who do not speak French, followed the proceedings from an adjacent courtroom where a volunteer from theÂ Mi'kmaq communityÂ provided translation for them. Francis's mother Jessica PerleyÂ has said the volunteer is doing herÂ best, but still can't understand everything being said. ""We're getting bits and parts and then we're piecing it together and we're asking other people that may be sitting in the actual courtroom,"" Perley hasÂ said. ""So it's frustrating."" Still, the family is grateful to the volunteer, she has stressed. Francis's parents and advocates had pushed for the province to provide simultaneous interpretation of the trial, butÂ Justice Minister Andrea Anderson-Mason said in December 2018 none wouldÂ be provided. A department spokesperson has said the family was welcome to co-ordinate its own interpretation in the adjacent courtroom, which is serving as an overflow room and has a live video feed of the proceedings. In the video, Potvin asks Johnson if he hit the young man and fled the scene. Johnson repeats what he told the other officer. He was talking to his wife while driving, turned his head to look at her for a brief moment and when he turned back, all of a sudden, something was on the road in front of his truck. ""I thought it was a deer."" Johnson says he looked behind them and couldn't see anything on the road so he thought the animal was safe and had run away. ""If IÂ thought it had been a person, IÂ would have stopped,"" he tells the officer. JohnsonÂ says he and his wife didn't discuss the matter any further that night. When they got home, he watched some TV, got undressed and went to bed, he said. His videotaped statementÂ was originally scheduled to be viewed last week but had to be adjourned after Crown prosecutor Pierre Gionet discovered it had not been properly edited.Â Portions of the tape were supposed to be removed because the judge had deemed the content inadmissible. GionetÂ advised the court he plans toÂ continue playing the videotaped statement on Tuesday. It isÂ between four and five hours in total, he said. The Crown has three more witnesses to call and expects to wrap up its case by end of day Wednesday, said Gionet, then defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux will begin presenting his case. Earlier Monday, the court heard from the surprise witness who came forward last week in the nearly two-year-old case. Rodney SteverÂ wasn't asked and never saidÂ in courtÂ what prompted him to contact police about that night. ButÂ he testified he was driving on Saint-Charles South Road to his mother's house on Feb. 24, 2018, when he came across a dark-coloured SUV blocking the road, about 275 metres from the Saint-Charles store. A woman told him there was an accident up ahead, emergency crews had been called and he couldn't pass, he said. So he pulled his beigeÂ 2010 Ford Ranger pickup truck into the driveway of a mini home on the left side of the road and turned back. The Crown prosecutor showed Stever a photograph of a truck. SteverÂ said it was the same colour, make and year as his truck, but the rims were different. The truck in the photograph also appearedÂ to be inÂ mint condition compared to his, which had a black rust paint around the bottom front and around the wheels. ""You can tell that truck from my truck no problem,"" he said. The relevance of Stever's testimony to the case was not immediately made clear to the court. Last week, the court saw security video from the Saint-Charles store of the victimÂ walking on Saint-Charles South Road on the night he was killed and a tan vehicle passing by shortly afterward. Under cross-examination, Stever said he wasn't sure what time he was driving in the area but estimated it was between 8 p.m. and midnight. He said he no longer has the truck, which was sold through a junkyard and crushed. Johnson owned a grey 2003 GMC Sierra, the trial has heard. LastÂ Friday, the court heard from a collision reconstructionist who testified he had no doubt Francis was struck by a vehicle, and the damage to Johnson's truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck, but he could not say whether the damage occurred on the day Francis was killed. The trial began last Monday and has heard from 29Â witnesses so far. It is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.

The city'sÂ new Access to Information and Protection of Personal Privacy Bylaw, passed first reading by a unanimous vote at Tuesday's meeting of council, but concerns remain. ""We need to get a better handle on costs,"" Coun.Â Brian McFeely told council during discussion before the vote. Adoption of such a bylaw is mandatory under the province's recently updated Municipal Act.Â Staff from a law firm that handles legal matters for the city gave council members a briefing on how the bylaw will work, and outlined some of the demands that could be put on staff. ""This is a significant shift, I think it's fair to say, in municipal governance in Prince Edward Island,"" said Ian McCarville, a staff member of Key-Murray Law. The complete text of the new bylaw was included in the Tuesday's briefing notes to council. One staff person at Summerside City Hall will handleÂ access to information requests, council was told. Processing a request might require consultation with multiple departments within the cityÂ to access all relevant documents. Some names or other personal information mightÂ have to be redacted before the documents are provided to the person who requested the information. All city council minutes and financialÂ documents, including all payments made to council members, would be accessible under the bylaw. Records of closed meetings, commercial and real estate negotiations, and matters subject to solicitor-client privilege are among the items that would not be made public. Legal staff told council it is not clear how much staff time might have to be devoted to information requests under the bylaw. The cityÂ is entitled to set a schedule of fees for access-to-information requests.Â Those fees are payable by the person requesting the information, and may not exceed the actual cost of performing the search. The city is also bringing in a Retention of Records Bylaw.Â  It stipulates how long various types of municipal documents must be retained and remain in storage before they canÂ be destroyed. The Retention of Records Bylaw is also mandatory under the province's Municipal Act. ""It's not only Summerside. It's every municipality on the Island,"" said Mayor Basil Stewart. ""WeÂ have to have it complete ... so that will be done.""

The city created the incentive program in 2012 to help fill lots that were either vacant, underused and perhaps containing onlyÂ a rundown shack, or being used for parking. Kinden Kosick, senior planner for the city, says since then, the program has helped develop 342 units in WhitehorseÂ â€” from townhouse condosÂ to commercial developments to rental units. ""We see certain types of housing getting built â€”Â for example, there's a lot of townhouses getting built in Whistle Bend and not too many apartments,"" Kosick said. ""So this is trying to target different sectors of the housing market that we don't see being built."" Those who qualify for the incentive wouldn't have to pay certain municipal developerÂ fees (which start at $2,185), and depending on the size of the structure, they could also get a 10-year tax grant for up to $500,000.Â  Non-profit groups likeÂ Habitat for Humanity Yukon, which buildsÂ houses and makes them affordable for low-income families to own, would have new benefitsÂ catered to them. These include a grant for developing costs for up to $20,000, as well as deferred payment for any lot purchased from the City of Whitehorse. ""The fact is that the city owns very little land,"" said Mike Gau, director of development services for the city. ""It's the Yukon government that owns most of the vacant land in town, along with the First Nations, so they may choose to do different pricing on a lot of land. But the city's main tools are financial, zoning and planning.""

It's been three months since the election. Can you believe that? I can't. It feels like just yesterday we were talking about increasing regional tensions and whether Andrew Scheer should resign as Conservative leader.Â  Events, as I wrote last week, change a lot. The devastating shooting down of a passenger jet carrying 57 Canadians - and, as we learned Friday, 29 permanent residents of Canada - has rightly consumed the government.Â  And yet, there hasn't been a lot of criticism of the Liberal government's response to this file. There is, more largely, a critique from the Conservatives on the Liberal government's general foreign policy towards Iran, which the Tories say is too tender, but on the handling of the crash itself, all of our Power Panelists, of all party stripes - even the few Conservatives who still talk to the CBC, lol - were united this week; the prime minister has struck the right tone.Â  But Justin Trudeau's attention will now have to turn elsewhere, to a degree. Cabinet is, as you read this, meeting in Winnipeg for the first time this year, and of course, for the first time since the downing of that jet. And beyond responding to this awful tragedy, there will be questions from reporters, that are aimed at trying to figure out what this government will be about. There have been only a few clues so far. The government's throne speech (which happened just six weeks ago - but doesn't it feel like at least year?) echoed much of what we heard during the election: a focus on climate, on reconciliation and a tax cut. We know what the tax cut looks like, but not a whole lot about the rest. The one piece of legislation we can be sure is on the way, is the amendment to Canada's medically assisted dying law. The law was found to be, in part, unconstitutional by a Quebec judge last year. The courts in that province gave the federal government six months to fix the law. The six months will be up in early March and the government has telegraphed that it will likely meet that deadline with a change to the law that will ease the requirement that a person's death must be ""reasonably foreseeable"" in order for them to qualify for an assisted death. But I've been racking my brain (I mean granted it's full of other things too; like, should I buy a snowblower, but still...) because aside from the assisted dying, and the the CUSMA implementation bill, I can't think of another specific piece of legislation we know is coming. And when I talk to people in government, and I ask them what might be coming, I don't get a lot of detailÂ  -- which wouldn't have been the case, say, in 2015. Will the government, for example, introduce legislation to hold itself accountable on its climate targets? Speaking of emission reduction targets, when will the government release its full plan for reaching them, and when or how will it fulfil its promise to be more aggressive on those targets?Â  On regional tensions, which consumed us after the election and appear to dominate Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland's time these days, what will come of her listening tour and multiple meetings with political leaders in Alberta and Saskatchewan? Alberta wants $2 billion in back payments for its struggling economy. Will they get a decision on that big ask before the budget, or will the answer come with the budget? It remains unclear.Â  Speaking of the budget, when's that coming? My contacts say it won't be an early one, possibly even as late as April. That's important because the budget will likely provide a specific indication, and measure, of the government's priorities.Â  It's not surprising that it might not happen until spring, there is a lot of frustration among even political staffers about the pace of change in government right now. The prime minister's chief of staff only announced the senior leadership team last week. Communication teams are just now falling into place, but I've had multiple people in those offices tell me it was a painful process; decisions were slow and many loyal staffers felt left in limbo for longer than usual. You can feel that hesitancy in the way some ministers communicate on their files, hedging specifics on plans with the caveat they will need support from, and to consult with, the opposition.Â  Now, It's a fact to be sure - that in a minority Parliament, the government does need the opposition's support. But will that fact create an overly cautious government agenda? It seems that way right now, but we should have a better idea with this cabinet retreat -- and then most definitely when Parliament resumes in a week. This is just one part of the Minority Report newsletter. In this week's issue, Ã‰ric Grenier looks at the last time Peter MacKay was leader of a conservative party and what that means for his pitch to replace Andrew Scheer.

Dalhousie University law professor Matthew Herder used Canada's Access to Information Act to obtain hundreds of documents to track the development ofÂ the vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) from the first experiments at Winnipeg'sÂ National Microbiology Laboratory in the early 2000s throughÂ to the Ebola epidemic in West AfricaÂ in 2014. The documents revealÂ Canadian government scientists strugglingÂ against federal funding cuts and industry indifference to push the discovery forward.Â  After spending five years piecing the story together, Herder said Canada's Ebola vaccine experience challenges the dogma that drug companies are the only way to commercialize academic drug discoveries.Â  Herder's analysis suggests that Canada's scientists did most of the technical development work â€” even generating hundreds of doses of manufactured vaccine â€” while the private sector allowed the discovery to languish. In the paper, published in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences, Herder concludes ""the private sector was not only unnecessary to its development, but also likely slowed it down."" ""We have this dogmatic reliance upon the private sector,"" Herder said. ""That is not always warranted.Â Our case study of this Ebola vaccine shows the public sector can and in fact does do far more in important instances."" The Ebola vaccineÂ researchÂ had a serendipitous startÂ in Canada more than two decades ago.Â German scientist Heinz FeldmannÂ had already been studyingÂ hemorrhagic fevers when he joined the Public Health Agency of Canada'sÂ National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), which had recently opened in Winnipeg. Once settled in the high security lab, heÂ designed an experiment trying to identify the keyÂ protein that made Ebola so deadly. He didn't get the answer he expected. What he discovered instead was that the experimental mice were protected against the Ebola virus. It was the first evidence that an Ebola vaccine was possible.Â  At the time, the world had not yet experienced the full terror of an Ebola epidemic. That changed in 2014, when the virus ravaged West Africa, killing more than 11,000 people. Today,Â Congo is still struggling to control an outbreak that has killed more than 2,200 people. But in the early 2000s, the Ebola researchers in Canada had difficulty securing the funding they needed as they competed for moneyÂ with other public health priorities.Â  Still, they managed to scrounge enough resources toÂ conduct preliminaryÂ animal and toxicology studies as they tried to find a drug company interested in taking theirÂ promisingÂ vaccine research to market. But the documents reveal there was little commercial interest in an Ebola vaccine, especially in the years before the first major outbreak. So the scientists pushed onward, struggling to find funding and doing much of the development work normally done by industry. That included gettingÂ more than 1,000 doses of vaccine manufactured for use in human clinical trials. Herder points to that as proof that governments can, underÂ certain circumstances, make life-saving medicines that have little commercial appeal. ""It provides evidence that a lot of that later-stage drug development or vaccine development can happen within the public sector,"" said Herder.Â  A small biotechnology company in Iowa called BioProtection Systems Inc., which later became NewLinkÂ Genetics, eventually stepped forward in 2006 offering to take the discovery to market. Herder said he examined a copy of the agreement between the Public Health Agency of CanadaÂ and NewLink and discovered that the company failed to deliver on commitments it made in exchange for the patent.Â  ""There's very little evidence in the documents that they were doing anything beyond taking part in meetings,"" Herder said. NewLinkÂ Genetics did not respond to CBC's request forÂ comment. The documents also reveal that, by 2010, the vaccine project was at risk of being shelved due to lack of funding and the factÂ the lead researchers had left the NML for positions at other research institutions. ""We have evidence in the records that we obtained that the lab in WinnipegÂ thought seriously about stopping this work,"" Herder said. But one dedicated researcher managed to keep the project going. Judie AlimontiÂ wasÂ a contract scientist at the NML. Despite her precarious position, she volunteered to take over the floundering Ebola vaccine file. Herder said she played a pivotal role.Â Without Alimonti's perseverance, the vaccine might never have been available for emergencyÂ use when Ebola ravagedÂ West Africa in 2014. ""And so by virtue of itÂ being ready,Â I'm sure she helped save lives in the middle of that epidemic."" Despite her commitment to developing the Ebola vaccine, Alimonti's contract was not renewed and she left the NML in 2015.Â SheÂ died of cancer two years laterÂ at age 57. Herder's research suggests that it was only after Ebola began spreading in WestÂ Africa and threatening the world that the vaccine project was treated with more urgency. ""Questions began to be raised publicly about the delay in development of a vaccine that had been shown to be 100% effective in animal models as early as 2004,"" Herder writes, citing a 2014Â New York Times article with the headline: ""Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf."" Canada donated 800 doses of its experimentalÂ vaccineÂ for use during the outbreak. The federal government also continued to provide support forÂ the clinical trials, including a Phase 1 trial at the Canadian CentreÂ for Vaccinology in Halifax. Meanwhile,Â in the midst of the 2014 outbreak,Â NewLinkÂ transferredÂ the Ebola vaccine patent to Merck for $50 million US. At the same time, funding for the research continued to be provided by public sector sources with more than $120 million from the Canadian and U.S. governments and the World Health Organization to support clinical trials during the epidemic, according to the paper.Â  Herder was unable to access the pharmaceutical industry documents, leaving him withÂ questions about Merck's role. ""What the record does establish is that it was the public sector, not Merck, that provided all of the financing, including for clinical trials, during the West African epidemic, in addition to providing the technical expertise, human resources, and infrastructure that was necessary to carry out the trials,"" Herder writes. Merck spokesperson Elise Giasson told CBC News in an emailÂ thatÂ after acquiring the licence from NewLink in 2014, the companies ""worked together on moving it into additional Phase 1 trials as well as Phase 2/3 clinical trials."" ""Merck is proud to be part of the unprecedented global collaborations to aid in the fight against Ebola."" The vaccine, now known as Ervebo, was approvedÂ for commercial sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency over the past two months. It'sÂ a milestone that took too long, Herder suggestsÂ in his paper.Â  ""Instead of celebrating this milestone, our analysis raises the question as to whether [the Ebola vaccine] could have been available earlier if public laboratories had taken a different approach to the vaccine's development.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-national-microbiology-laboratory-pharmaceutical-industry-scientists-1.5429060,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-vaccine-congo-outbreak-1.5201697 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-august-20-2019-1.5252290/canadian-made-ebola-vaccine-could-have-saved-more-lives-if-research-was-funded-earlier-microbiologist-says-1.5252292 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-relapse-congo-1.5404082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/glybera-lpld-rare-drug-orphan-disease-nrc-cbc-price-1.5312177,N/A441,Jason Proctor,2020-01-21T00:47:15.560Z,"Meng Wanzhou case is about the U.S. wanting Canada to enforce sanctions it rejects, defence says","Meng Wanzhou's lawyersÂ appealed to Canadian independence Monday as they accused the U.S.Â of trying to use Canada to enforce economic sanctions Canadians have rejected in order to extradite the Huawei executive.

Glass walls cut the lawyers and Meng off from a public gallery that holds about 150 people. The gallery was overflowing and Holmes announcedÂ the court was planning to broadcast the proceedings into the overflow area. The defence is expected to use about two days of court time, to be followed by the Crown's submissions. Both sides have filed arguments in advance of the hearing. The Crown plans to argue that the ""essence"" of the conduct is what is important in Canadian extradition as opposed to ""offence-matching"" laws on either side of the border. They sayÂ Meng is charged with fraud in that she is accused of making a misrepresentation that put banks at risk of loss. But Peck rejected that logic, saying it was a ""fiction"" to suggest the U.S. had any interest that didn't involve sanctions when it came to policing the private dealings between foreign citizens and their banks. He ran through the history of U.S. sanctions against Iran and Canada's decision to drop economic sanctions against the Islamic republic as a result of an international deal to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. He said the U.S. decided to implement sanctions again in 2018 when President Donald Trump left the treaty. But Canada did not follow suit. ""That move was out of step with the international community,"" Peck said.Â  ""What it resulted in was a decision by the United States to criminalize conduct that Canada and most of the other countries, if not all, permit."" The courtroom was filled with an array of onlookers, including lawyers from other parts of the building, students and numerous Huawei employees, many of whom have made a habit of attending the proceedings. During the afternoon, Holmes interrupted Peck's co-counsel Eric Gottardi as he discussed the elements of fraud. She asked him whether a person could be successfullyÂ prosecuted in Canada given the same set of circumstances, but with the alleged lie being told in Canada instead of Hong Kong. Gottardi seemed to indicate that they probably could. The judge then asked why the same consideration wouldn't apply to an extradition hearing. He told her he would need the night to ""crystallize"" his answer. Media from around the world have obtained court accreditation in advance of this week's hearing. Mo Vayeghan, a Vancouver criminal defence and extradition lawyer, says the case is unusual and largely without precedent, but the Crown has a good chance at success. ""American prosecutorsÂ understand that theÂ allegations they are making needÂ to meet the test of dual criminality,"" he said. ""They get this issue. That is why the United States prosecutors, in their indictment, they have worded their allegations broadly to include misrepresentations and fraudulent activity."" If the defence succeeds in convincing Holmes the bar of double criminality has not been met, the extradition proceedings against Meng would come to an end. But the court has scheduled a series of other hearings if necessary. Those include a week of arguments in June in which the defence will claim thatÂ Meng's rights were violated when she was detained by Canada Border Services Agency officers for three hours before her arrest by RCMP. Meng's lawyers will also argueÂ that she is being used as a political pawn in the U.S. and China's trade battle. Her lawyers have cited comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who told Reuters shortly after her arrest that he would intervene in the case if it would help get the U.S. a better trade deal with China. Trump signed an initial trade deal with China last week, with no sign that he had heeded a suggestion from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December that any pact should deal with Meng and two Canadians who were detained in China shortly after her arrest. Entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig were later formally arrested and now face accusations of spying in China, where they areÂ incarcerated without access to lawyers or family. China has also cut off Canadian canola and meat imports in the past year, lifting a ban on pork and beef in November.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-extradition-criminality-1.5430149,https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/live-blog/meng-wanzhou-extradition-hearing-live?scribble_id=2919008 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-canada-huawei-1.5429460,N/A442,Anonymous,2020-01-17T22:01:05.496Z,"Pay-as-you-go health care: Uninsured people in Canada face sky-high bills, delays in treatment, doctors say","In a Scarborough, Ont., clinic, a woman receives test results with news no one wants to hear: she has stage three breast cancer. But along with the prospect of chemotherapy, radiation and a mastectomy, she's also facing a bill in the thousands, because she doesn't have health insurance. CBC Radio is calling her Grace because she fears she may risk being deported if her identity is revealed. She came to Canada legally in 2001 as part of the live-in caregiver program, but lost her job â€” and her status â€” before she could complete it. ""I feel like it's ripping me apart,"" she said. ""I have to put [on] a brave face just like nothing happened."" Grace first detected a lump last August. She paid hundreds of dollars for a mammogram and ultrasound at a walk-in clinic â€” but without a financial guarantor, couldn't affordÂ a biopsy to get a diagnosis. In the meantime, she was prescribed antibiotics and Tylenol for the pain. TheÂ Canadian Centre for Refugee and Immigrant Healthcare (CCIRH) agreed to do the diagnostics at no cost to Grace. The clinic's volunteer oncologist who delivered the newsÂ told White Coat, Black Art host Dr. Brian Goldman she's likely looking at treatment at a cost north of $10,000. According to a 2016 report by the Wellesley Institute, an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people live in Canada without health insurance. They could be landed immigrants living in Ontario, Quebec or B.C., which mandate a three-month waiting period before provincial health benefits kick in. They could also be temporary foreign workers who remained in Canada after their contracts ended, refugee claimants or people seeking asylum. Veteran family doctor Dr. Paul Caulford, who works at the CCRIH clinic, calls the 500,000 figure a ""conservative estimate."" ""Health equity is the issue here. As physicians â€_ we try our best to create health equity access, to reduce the health disparities that happen within our population,"" he said. For the last 18 years, Grace has been working under the table at factory and babysitting jobs, keeping herself afloat and sending money to her family back home. She would have been able to apply for permanent residency after working for 24 months over three years in the then live-in caregiver program. But she says she lost her job and status after being ""hunted"" by her abusive husband. ""I came here looking for a greener pasture; that someday I can take my children here,"" she said. A health scare in 2012 landed her in the emergency ward. She came out with a new pacemaker and a bill in the tens of thousands. She's paidÂ most of itÂ out of her own pocket. ""I thought, Oh my God. Will I die of the bill, or will I die of the sickness?"" A 2013 report by the Toronto Board of Health characterized the medical charges billed to uninsured residents as ""inconsistent,"" and noted that they often don't know how much they will be charged before treatment. ""Key informants note that hospitals often bill uninsured residents at rates substantially higher than OHIP rates, resulting in exorbitant charges that they cannot afford,"" the report said. Caulford is calling on Ontario to waive the three-month wait period for OHIP coverage for people applying for immigration status in the province.Â  ""Ontario has an obligation under international law to ensure that all residents can effectively access essential health care services,"" the province's human rights commissioner wrote in a July 2019 letter to Health Minister Christine Elliott. Caulford also says it should be mandatory for health-care practitioners and agencies to enrol in the Interim Federal Health (IFH) program, which offers limited health coverage like dental and vision services for refugee claimants and asylum seekers. In 2012, the Conservative government made cuts to the program, but the Federal Court ruled those cuts violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Liberal government reversed the cuts in 2016, and in July 2019Â announced a $283 million infusion in response to the surge of asylum claims in the last few years. Caulford says the 2012 cutsÂ led to confusion about how IFH actually works, and that many physicians refuse to enrol as a result, even today. ""Right now, we see patients with their IFH â€_ go to a walk-in clinic for an infection, and the walk-in clinic won't see them. They'll charge them $100 or $150 to be seen,"" he said. White Coat, Black Art reached out to Health Minister Patty Hajdu's office for comment.Â  The request was forwarded to the Ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, which responded in part by noting that ""publicly funded health insurance is a provincial responsibility."" In Vancouver, pediatrician Dr. Anamaria Richardson is worried about four-year-old Renata, who arrived illegally with her mother from Mexico three years ago. They met at Watari, a counselling and support service community for the city's Latin American community. Richardson says Renata is non-verbal, and may have autism spectrum disorder. Because her condition isn't life-threatening, diagnostic tests or treatment aren't available without payment, which the family cannot afford. Renata's mother, who does not speak English, told Richardson she worries that getting even routine medical care puts them at risk of being deported. ""Two years ago she needed to take Renata to a consult with a doctor, and she said it turned into just an immigration questionnaire,"" said Richardson. ""I think it's so unfair."" She says she understands why some Canadians might object to coverage for non-citizens, especially when health-care budgets are strained. But she believes capacity exists for patients like Grace and Renata. ""I understand that it is a very costly venture. However, we live in a country that has so much, and I feel like we need to at least bring light to the issue,"" she said. The CCRIH clinic operates on private donations and a small amount of money from the provincial government. ""It runs out about five months into the year ... we're going on fumes for about seven months,"" Caulford said. Doctors, nurse practitioners and other health-care providers volunteer their time to work there, donating the small government stipend they receive back to the clinic to help keep it afloat. During a visit earlier this month, Caulford says he was alarmed at how dramatically Grace's tumour has grown since the fall. ""As a physician, we see so much. [But] I just stepped backwards when I saw this thickened, inflamed, red â€_ warm, hot mass that was eight centimetres that started out at two to three centimetres in October,"" he said. Promisingly, a CT scan funded by donations revealed that while the cancer spread to her lymph nodes, her bones, lungs and liver are clear. Caulford has reached out to several doctors about Grace's situation, and two breast surgeons have offered to waive their fees to help with treatment. He hopes to start chemotherapy soon with the donations they've gathered already and hopefully raise more â€” ""on a lot of faith."" But he wishes it didn't need to come to this.

Officials with the Canadian Red Cross said the womanÂ rented the house. They said volunteers have arranged emergency lodging, food, winter clothing purchases and some other basics for her. When firefighters arrived, the fire had reached inside and outside the house,Â said O'Leary Deputy Chief Jason Greenan. He said the fire was working its way through the atticÂ of the storey-and-a-half dwelling.

The UN special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said they had information pointing to the ""possible involvement"" of the prince in the alleged 2018 cyberattack. Saudi officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd. Cybersecurity experts hired by Bezos, the world's richest man, concluded his phone was probably infiltrated by a video file sent from a WhatsApp account purportedly belonging to the prince in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. They said the device began leaking massive amounts of data about a month afterward, the source said. Callamard, the special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, and Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said the allegation of Saudi involvement ""demands immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities."" Outside experts consulted by the UN agreed that while the case was not airtight, the evidence was strong enough to warrant a fuller investigation. But the UN said the case illustrated the dangers ""from the unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware."" Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the charges. ""I think 'absurd' is exactly the right word,"" he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. ""The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos's phone is absolutely silly."" The alleged cyberattack is said to have taken place months before the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""At a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post,"" Callamard and Kaye said in their statement. Prince Mohammed, or MBSÂ as he is familiarly known, said last year that the KhashoggiÂ killing was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it. Callamard led a UN inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. ""The evidence points overwhelmingly â€” and, in fact, in only one direction â€” which is that the killing was the state killing,"" she told CBC News in December. The Guardian newspaper first reportedÂ the crown prince's alleged involvementÂ in the Bezos phone incident. Listen: Callamard speaks to CBC about Khashoggi murder investigation The relationship between the Amazon chief executive and the Saudi government had soured since early last year after he alluded to Saudi Arabia's displeasure at the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Khashoggi. In a previous flashpoint, Bezos's security chief said last year that the Saudi government had gained access to the Amazon CEO's phone and leaked messages to U.S. tabloid the National Enquirer between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who the newspaper said he was dating. A month before, Bezos had accused the newspaper's owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to Sanchez. The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirer reporting. Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy dismissed the latest allegations.

Tim Garrity also says Elections P.E.I.Â doesn't currently have the capacity to run two elections at the same time, putting to rest â€”Â at least temporarily â€” the idea of pairing trustee elections with either a provincial or municipal election to increase turnout. The PCs promised to re-introduce elected trustees to manage P.E.I.'s education system after previous Liberal governments did away with trustee elections, and eventuallyÂ the last remaining English school board in the province. MLAs on the province's standing committee on education and economic growth were recently briefed by the Public Schools Branch on efforts to re-introduce elected trustees. Education officials told MLAsÂ it was ""not an option"" to piggyback trustee elections with another vote because Elections P.E.I. doesn't have ""the human resource or the system capacity."" Garrity said because Elections P.E.I. has never run a trustee election using its current database system, a new database would have to be created, similar to those that exist for provincial and municipal elections. Complicating the issue, he said, is the fact that trustee elections will likely end up using a different boundary system from the other elections. ""So we're currently working with our vendor on that right now to see what the possibilities and the costs around that are,"" Garrity said. ""But right now it's just not feasible for us to be able to run the two at the same time."" The recommendation to piggyback trustee elections onto either a municipal or provincial vote was put forward by P.E.I.'s Education Governance Commission as a means to increase voter turnout. But there has never been another election for English trustees since the government-commissioned report was delivered in 2012. Garrity has suggested running an online election for trustees could be easier, more cost-effective and lead to increased turnout. Under the old trustee elections, voter turnout maxed out at just under four per cent. ""There are several companies that do the online portion and they have worked with our vendor in other jurisdictions in the past and it's basically a seamless switchover,"" Garrity said.Â  ""They can kind of turn on an online portal and there's almost a, you know, an off-the-shelf solution that they will customize to our needs."" But P.E.I.'s Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson, one of the MLAs on the education committee who received the briefing on elected trustees, thinks government should continue to work with Elections P.E.I. to see if trustee elections can in fact be held in conjunction with a provincial election. ""I wouldn't want to shut the door on either"" option, said Hudson. But ""P.E.I. has had one of the highest turnouts for general elections of any province across the country,"" he said, suggesting that could present ""the opportunity to increase the number of ballots, the number of votes"" cast in trustee elections. The Department of Education will ultimately decide how trustee elections will be held. Public consultations around the return to elected trustees are to take place this winter, with the next elections to come in May of 2022.Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elections-1.5433757,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elected-education-1.5383650 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-board-elected-1.4645716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-car-fire-bypass-sunday-1.5433379 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-winter-games-2023-update-1.5433370,N/A449,Sarah MacMillan,2020-01-20T22:58:05.017Z,How this small dog's big bark helped save its owner from fire,"Pearl BulgerÂ has always spoiled her loyal companion, Missy. But this week, the 5.5-kilogram Yorkie-poodle mix is getting a little extra love. Bulger credits the dog with saving her life, after a devastating house fire in O'LearyÂ early Sunday morning. Bulger had been living at a house in O'LearyÂ owned by her brother, for about a year. She and Missy were the only ones home when the fire broke out. When she woke up to the sound of Missy barking just before 6 a.m., Bulger at first told the dog to go lay down.Â  ""She was just so persisting, and she wouldn't listen to me,"" Bulger said.Â  ""So I got up, I got up and checked the front door thinking maybe somebody's at the front door, and there was nobody there and I just, out of the corner of my eye, I looked out and the back deck and everything was just nothing but flames coming out."" Bulger and Missy were able to escape the houseÂ before it became engulfed in flames.Â  ""The only thing I took out is what I was wearing.""Â  Â  Firefighters from O'Leary, West Point and Alberton responded to the call, and spent more than six hours working to put out the blaze.Â  ""It was just flames everywhere,"" Bulger said. When she returned to the house later, she said everything was destroyed. ""Everything is just, it's just a mess,"" Bulger said.Â ""You have to really see it, the pictures don't do it justice."" Bulger is receiving assistance from the Red Cross, including three nights at a hotel, and some money for food and clothing.Â  She said she's grateful for the help, but isn't sure where she'll go next.Â  ""I've been phoning around all morning seeing if anybody has anything to rent, and there doesn't seem anything available around here."" Bulger is thankful she managed to escape the burning house, and said if it weren't for her dog, she may not have made it out.Â  And as a special thanks, Missy was treated to a slice of bacon with her supper Sunday night.

But it's not paint or clay she comes to collect. It's roadkill.Â  Peter-Paul is a quillwork artist. She uses porcupine quills to create intricate designs that can stand alone in a frame or adorn wood, leather and other materials.Â  Her medium is a prickly one and one not readily available to her. She has to harvest the quills from dead porcupines she finds on the side of the road. Porcupines are not native to Prince Edward Island. Peter-Paul scours the highways of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to find carcasses to load into her cooler and take back to her home in Scotchfort, about 25 kilometres notheast ofÂ  Charlottetown. Once there, she painstakingly separates the porcupine fur with one hand and uses the other to pluck the quills. Tens of thousands of them. Porcupine quilling is an art form unique to North America. The use of quills to add ornamentation to clothing, jewelry, medicine bags and boxes can be dated back to the sixth century. Many quillers switched to beadwork when beads became readily available. It requires the same skills as quillwork, but it's less gruelling. Quillwork is nearly a lost art.Â  But people like Peter-Paul are keeping it alive. For her, it's more than a job. Porcupine quilling is a calling.Â  ""As soon as I picked up the quills, it was like this is what I was meant to do,"" Peter-Paul said. ""You wait all your life to find out what you want to be when you grow up. In that moment I was like 'this is it!'"" Peter-Paul goes through about half a dozen porcupines a year for her art. One porcupine can yield around 30,000 quills.Â  The ancient indigenous art form involves softening and dying the quills and weaving them onto leather or birch bark for ornamentation.Â  Peter-Paul said quilling has been integral to her Mi'kmaq identity. ""The ancestors' presence when I do quillwork is so strong and I really feed off of it."" Her interest began in 2014, when she took a workshop from her cousin who was visiting from Nova Scotia.Â  At first, it began with triangles and other simple patterns. It evolved into more intricate designs inspired by an old book Peter-Paul read on Mi'kmaqÂ quillwork.Â Â  The pictures in the book are black and white. Peter-Paul said the vistas of the Island inspired her to bring colour to the designs and make them her own.Â  ""I saw lupines and I saw the red clay, and then I saw the ocean waves and the grass, and I used all those colours.""Â  Peter-Paul went on to complete a 20-week apprenticeship with her cousinÂ and eventually to conduct her own workshops across the Maritimes. For Peter-Paul, quilling has revived a family tradition that was lost over generations. Her great-great-grandmother was a quiller. Her works have been archived at the Nova Scotia Museum in Halifax. Without having a mentor in the province, Peter-Paul looks to the art of her ancestors for inspiration, often helped along by the soul-cleansing smoke produced by smudging, the practice of burning sacred medicines. ""When I'm stuck on something, I have to light up my smudge and I pray â€_ so when I'm sitting there with those old quill pieces, it's almost like I'm jumping into a time machine and I'm getting all of the answers.""Â  Her grandmother and mother were both basket makers. Peter-Paul said likes toÂ incorporate sweet grass into her work, because her grandmother would harvest it by the river near her community for her baskets.Â  ""It's really important to me to still be using all of our traditional materials in that connection with my grandmother.""Â  Today, there are about half a dozen quillers on the Island.Â  Peter-Paul has exhibited her work with other artisans in the province. This past summer, she hadÂ her first solo exhibit in downtown Charlottetown andÂ in November, she won the P.E.I. arts grant, the only Indigenous woman to receive the grant this year. ""I have people that still encourage me to keep this going because everybody else sees the importance of keeping quill work going.""Â  Peter-Paul is also a mother. Just as she has looked to the voices of her ancestors to guide and inspire her in her art,Â she now tries to bestow that wisdom on her two children.Â  ""My oldest son is 12,Â so he's harvesting porcupine with me. My children are all a part of my process and I make sure this is their normal. They see a porcupine on my step and they're like, 'Oh, hey, Mom's working today.'Â This is their normal."" Peter Paul laughed as she spoke.Â  ""So my boys will be quillers.""Â ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/made-from-this-land-quillwork-1.5384150,[],N/A451,Anonymous,2020-01-17T13:00:00.836Z,"Freezing bear cub was covered in ice after conservation officer dropped it off, concerned rescue group says","A B.C. animal rescue group is calling for better training ofÂ conservation officers after a sedated bear cub was brought in covered in ice after riding in the back of an open truck.Â  Nathan Wagstaffe, a senior wildlife technician at Critter Care Wildlife Society in Langley, said the black bear cub arrived at the centre the evening of Jan. 14. The year-old bear was driven there in an open-sided kennel in the bed of a conservation officer'sÂ truck, he said.Â It was â€“9 C and the bear was in rough shape, Wagstaffe said. ""He had ice ... attached to his fur,"" he said. ""His temperature wasn't regulated at all. His core body temperature was extremely low for a bear with the added implications of being over-sedated."" The bear, which weighed about 40 pounds, had been given about three times the necessary amount of sedation, Wagstaffe said. Animals cannot regulate their body temperature when sedated, he added. ""He could have died,"" he said. ""I'm surprised he survived."" It's not clear where the bear came from or why it was on its own, but Wagstaffe said he'd heard a report about an orphaned bear cub in Port Moody, B.C., days earlier. The bear was brought into the clinic and staff worked to warm him up. WagstaffeÂ said he tended to the cub every two hours for 24 hours to get him on track again.Â  Wagstaffe said he offered the conservation officer blankets to wrap around the kennel next time, but the officer said they wouldn't be necessary. Wagstaffe said it's not the first time he's been concerned about the care an animal has received from a conservation officer. He's calling on the province to revisit its policies for animal care.Â  ""We are just done with this,"" he said. ""We want COs to take proper care of these animals."" In an emailed statement, Ministry of Environment spokesman David KarnÂ said the bear was tranquilized ""to ensure its safety"" before it was placed into the enclosure in the truck and brought to the rehabilitation facility.Â  ""Conservation officers are trained in the proper handling and care of animals, which includes guidance from our provincial wildlife veterinarian on the safe transportation of bear cubs to rehabilitation centres,"" Karn said. Wagstaffe said Critter Care currently has 29 bears in its care, all under a year old. The bear brought in this week is recovering and doing well, he said. The bear will be rehabilitated and willÂ likely be released in the summer. Proper care early on can make all the difference in the outcome of an animal, he added.Â  ""What is the point of sedating a bear, driving it out here if it's just going to die because of the negligence?"" he said.

The CBC/Netflix drama series was not renewed for a fourth seasonÂ in late November, and creator Moira Walley-Beckett has said on Instagram that ""there is just no way to revive"" it anywhere at this point. But viewers are still holding out hope the show can find a new life, and they're continuing their campaign to make that happen. Earlier this week, a viewer-created group that calls itself AWAE Fan Projects spent $1,000 on five digital ""Save 'Anne with an E'"" billboards in Toronto's downtown Yonge-Dundas Square. The campaign ran four days and featured fan-created artwork depicting the heroine from Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic novel Anne of Green Gables,Â which inspired the series. Now, they're hoping to get similar digital displays in New York's Times Square. ""AÂ lot of us are willing to wait it out and see if anything happens,"" says Lisa Elksnitis, a senior financial administrator in Toronto who is part of the fan group and helped get the billboards. ""We understand it's not something that would happen overnight. Most people are going to keep trying for several months at least."" The third and final season of Anne with an EÂ finished airing on the CBC in late November and hit Netflix on Jan. 3. Irish-Canadian actress Amybeth McNulty starred as the Prince Edward Island orphan, who is taken in by aging siblings, played by R.H. Thomson and Geraldine James. The series was shot in P.E.I. and Ontario and was a co-production between the CBC and Netflix. While the show was inspired by the novel, Walley-Beckett and co-executive producer Miranda de Pencier added new elements, including LGBTQ and Indigenous storylines. A post on Instagram this week showed Walley-Beckett visiting one Toronto billboard, whichÂ featured an image of Anne with a tear running down her cheek beside a list of words including ""racism,"" ""feminism"" and ""gender bias."" ""They have injected modern themes and storylines into this show but in a really successful way, and that's what kept me interested in it,"" says Elksnitis. The 37-year-old Elksnitis admits sheÂ didn't initially realize the show had such depth and didn't become a huge fan until after it was cancelled.Â Spurred byÂ the online uproar, she binged it online and was blown away by the production value and acting. ""I just never got into it at the time, which annoys me, because if there are others like me then maybe there would have been more viewers back then,"" Elksnitis says. Elksnitis says the AWAE Fan Projects group has about 12 members who came together on social media and whom she hasn't met in person. They hail from countries including Canada, Germany, France, Portugal and the United States. The group startedÂ two GoFundMe campaigns â€” oneÂ to pay for social media advertising and another for billboards. Elksnitis is now working to get digital billboards in Times Square. She says the group also sent fan letters to the producer, Northwood Entertainment, and the CBC. ElksnitisÂ knows of another fan group that plans to send white rags to TV studios â€”Â a nod to a season 3Â episode in which some Green Gables residents wave white rags at a freedom-of-speech protest. There are also fan petitions calling on Netflix to renew the show. Elksnitis hopes any new AnneÂ incarnation would have the same cast and creative team.

The blowout prompted the crewÂ to initiate emergency protocols and prepare passengers for a bumpy landing, but the plane landed in Ottawa without incident. The flight took off from Toronto's Pearson International Airport at 6:39 a.m. and landed at the Ottawa International Airport at 8:06 a.m., according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Passenger Steve Wynne said he knew there was a problem when he heard a ""bang"" immediately after the plane took off from the runway.

That review is now being assessed by the government and funding will remain in place until a decision is madeÂ but there is no deadline set for that decision, a spokesperson for Associate Minister of Addiction and Mental Health Jason Luan confirmed. Stacey Carmichael is with Red Deer's Turning Point, a temporary harm reduction site run out of a trailer. She said the organization has been running at capacity â€” and a larger, permanent facility sits empty while they wait for a decision. ""For us it's particularly tricky because we're being, I guess, measured on a temporary solution and we've never had the opportunity to implement the full complement of services that we know that we need and the capacity is not meeting the demand in the community,"" she said. ""So we're leaving a lot of people underserved and that's unfortunate."" Funding for Alberta's supervised consumption sites will end March 31, and Carmichael says long-term planning and staff retention are challenges given the site's uncertain future. Red Deer's site is currently seeing upward of 165 visits each day and December was the busiest month yet, with 5,076 visits. Two other planned sites, one in Medicine Hat and a mobile unit in Calgary, are also on hold. Celeste Hayward, with theÂ Alberta Community Council on HIV (ACCH), said the uncertainty could see some sites shut down and she fearsÂ disrupting stability for clients could impede their recovery. ""There's a lot of unknowns which make it likely that the safest way forward is to actually close their doors â€_ while they wait for budgets to be confirmed which means no services, which means risk of life."" Hayward said it's important to remember that consumption sites don't just offer aÂ supervised, clean location to consume illegal substances, but also wraparound services likeÂ emergency medical care, education on the harms of drug use, and referrals to other social services. Luan has been criticized for some of his comments about addiction, from saying distributing naloxone kits may enable drug use to deleting a tweet pondering ifÂ research supporting supervised consumption sites is funded by big pharma. Carmichael said she remains optimistic in Turning Point'sÂ future. ""I'm hopeful that the evidence and the research will maybe trump ideology and we can just proceed.""Â  The review looked at social and economic impacts of the sites but did not consider health benefits or social issues around drug use, or its efficacy in curbing addiction. The associate minister said at the time the review was announced that the scope was chosenÂ because the evidence is already well established the facilities play a role in harm reductionÂ but the Opposition argued thatÂ scope left out a crucial aspect of the review. A report published by ACCH last year found Alberta's supervised consumption sites have a 100 per cent success rate at reversing overdoses, and that there's been a decline in opioid-related deaths, overdoses in emergency rooms and EMS responses, allÂ attributable to the harm-reduction strategies.

Photographers from 78 countries entered imagesÂ and over $85,000 in sponsor prizes have been awarded.Â  ""It was a beautiful day out on the ocean. We were diving one of our normal spots we call 'sea garden,'"" Gross said.Â  His girlfriendÂ was leading a dive tour when they came across the turtle. She returned to the boat and was very emotional at the site, he said.Â  ""There were tears in her eyes,"" he said. ""She started telling me about this poor turtle that was entangled in the fishing line, which was also entangled in the coral and turtles need to breathe air. So the turtle was so entangled that it couldn't reach the surface to breathe. And essentially the turtle drowned."" Gross decided that since there was nothing they could do for the turtle, they could remove the line and try to raise awareness.Â  Gross dived to the spot, removed the line to prevent others from getting caughtÂ and snapped a photograph. ""This type of thing happens in the ocean every day. We just normally don't get to see it. I mean, nobody wants to see that. But we have to because that's the truth,"" he said.Â  This was the eighth time Gross has entered the photography competitionÂ but it was the first year they had a conservation category.Â  ""This seemed like a very fitting image,"" he said. ""A category dedicated to images that show humans' impact on the oceans.""Â  People who see the image have had emotional reactions, Gross said.Â  ""People get quite upset when they see it,"" he said. ""Which I think is a good thing because this is our fault."" ""Part of the emotional impact here is that the turtle's eyes must have been eaten out by a scavenger,"" Gross said. ""That dead stare right into the camera seems to strike people in a very emotional way."" People don't respond to statistics, they respond to individuals, Gross said.Â  ""I hope that this turtle becomes kind of a representative for the oceans as a whole,"" he said.Â  Humans are attacking the ocean from every angle, with plastic, climate change, over-fishing or invasive species, Gross said. He hopes the image will have people rethink their own consumption habits and change.Â  ""[It's] an individual turtle that is a victim and died in a horrible way because of our negligence. I hope that it can inspire a few people to be better towards the planet,"" he said.Â  There's plastic everywhere in the ocean, even far from shore, Gross said. Near his home on Harbour Island in the Bahamas there is a beach he walks every day, he said.Â  ""[There's] flip flops and other plastic items washing up on the beach every single day. And there are people, their whole job is just cleaning that beach,"" he said. ""So tourists don't have to look at it."" ""You go to a beach that isn't being cleaned every day and it's just, you can barely see the sand because there's so much plastic in it,"" he said.Â  ""I'm still hopeful because there is still a lot of beauty,"" Gross said.Â  He said he sees live turtles, sharks, stingrays, octopi and more, but there areÂ fewerÂ animals when compared to eight years ago when Gross first moved there.Â  Corporations and businesses will need to step up to the plate to createÂ change, he said, and individual consumers can hold them responsible for it.Â  ""There's a lot of problems â€”Â but there is still hope,"" he said. ""I have to believe in hope.""

That's when her boyfriend, Newfoundland Growlers captain James Melindy, fired up his snowmobile. ""She's a good person that wanted to help out on her day off,"" he said.Â ""Newfoundlanders find a way."" The St. John's area was ravaged FridayÂ by a blizzard that brought hurricane-force winds and record snowfall. On Wednesday, the city was entering its sixth day of a state of emergency. Churchill and Melindy managed to make it off their road and she got into a waiting car, which drove her to the hospital, where she works as a registered nurse on the intensive-care unit. Melindy said he knew exactly what to do when Churchill wanted to get to work. He grew up in the Goulds, where his mother was a nurse and his father often used a snowmobile to get her to work during snow storms. This storm, however, was unlike anything they've seen before. ""I'm in the Goulds so to have a Ski-Doo isn't too far out of the norm,"" MelindyÂ said. ""We have a field so we get a lot of drifting as well. Just down the road from me was 10-, 15-foot drifts. It was crazy."" As of Tuesday, essential workers could drive to and from work in their own vehicles. Most roads have had at least one cut through with a snow plow. Churchill can probably get to work without a snowmobile now, but she'll always have a story to tell. And Melindy has a renewed appreciation for the work she does. ""Our nurses and first responders, and people out taking care of this storm and snow, have done a tremendous job,"" he said. As the city gets closer to lifting the state of emergency, the Growlers get ready to hit the road.Â  The team hasn't missed any games due to the storm, and are supposed to fly to Pennsylvania on Thursday.

The size of the crowdÂ and the expected participation of white supremacists and fringe militia groups raised fears that the state could see a repeat of the violence that exploded in 2017 in Charlottesville. But the rally in Richmond concluded uneventfully around noon, and the mood was largely festive as attendees â€” many carrying military-style rifles â€” spilled into the streets, chanting ""USA!"" and waving signs denouncing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. ""I love this. This is like the Super Bowl for the Second Amendment right here,"" said P.J. Hudson, a truck driver from Richmond who carried an AR-15 rifle just outside Capitol Square. He was one of the few black rally-goers in the crowd that was overwhelmingly white and male, and frequently was stopped and asked to pose for pictures wearing his ""Black Guns Matter"" sweatshirt. An estimated 22,000 people attended, according to authorities, who said one woman was arrested on a felony charge of wearing a mask in public. The protesters came out despite the frigid temperature to send a message to legislators, they said. ""The government doesn't run us, we run the government,"" said Kem Regik, a 20-year-old private security officer from northern Virginia who brought a white flag with a picture of a rifle captioned, ""Come and take it."" Northam was a particular focus of the protesters'Â wrath. One poster showed his face superimposed on Adolf Hitler's body. Many of the protesters wore camouflage. Some waved flags with messages of support for President Donald Trump. Trump weighed inÂ Monday with support:Â ""The Democrat Party in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are working hard to take away your 2nd Amendment rights,"" he tweeted. ""This is just the beginning. Don't let it happen, VOTE REPUBLICAN in 2020!"" But the state's Democratic lawmakers â€” including House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn and Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw â€” said the rally wasn't going to impact their plans to pass gun-control measures, including universal background checks and a one-handgun-purchase-a-month limit. Democrats say tightening Virginia's gun laws will make communities safer and help prevent mass shootings like the one last year in Virginia Beach, where a dozen people were killed in a municipal building. ""I was prepared to see a whole lot more people show up than actually did and I think it's an indication that a lot of this rhetoric is bluster, quite frankly,"" said Del. Chris Hurst, a gun-control advocate whose TV journalist girlfriend was killed in an on-air shooting in 2015. The Virginia State Police, the Virginia Capitol Police and the Richmond Police had a strong presence, with officers deploying on rooftops, others patrolling in cars and on bicycles. Authorities were looking to avoid a repeat of the violence that erupted in Charlottesville during one of the largest gatherings of white supremacists and other far-right groups in a decade. Attendees brawled with counter-protesters, and an avowed white supremacist drove his car into a crowd, killing a woman and injuring dozens more. Law enforcement officials faced scathing criticism for what both the white supremacist groups and anti-racism protesters said was a passive response. On Monday, Southern Poverty Law Center staff members attended the rally and identified members of militia groups, including the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, as well as the League of the South, according to outreach director Lecia Brooks. The League of the South, which the centre designates a hate group, advocates for Southern secession. In contrast to Charlottesville, there was little sign of any counter-protesters challenging the gun rights activists. Police limited access to Capitol Square to only one entrance, and a long line formed to get into the rally zone. Demonstrators also filled the hallways of the building that houses lawmakers' offices. One couple, Jared and Marie March, travelled from Floyd County, over three hours west of Richmond, to meet with lawmakers. ""Guns are a way of life where we live,"" said Marie March, who was concerned about a proposed red-flag law she said would allow citizens to be stripped of their guns due to ""subjective criteria."" A proposal to establish universal background checks amounted to ""more Big Brother,"" she said. ""We just feel like we need to push government back into their rightful spot."" Monday's rally was organized by an influential grassroots gun rights group, the Virginia Citizens Defense League. The group holds a yearly Lobby Day rally at the capitol on Martin Luther King Day, typically a low-key event with a few hundred gun enthusiasts listening to speeches from a handful of ambitious Republican lawmakers. But this year's event was unprecedented.Â Second Amendment groups have identified the state as a rallying point for the fight against what they see as a national erosion of gun rights. The pushback against proposed new gun restrictions began immediately after Democrats won majorities in both the state senate and House of Delegates in November,Â with much of the opposition focused on a proposed assault weapons ban. More than 100 localities have since passed measures declaring support for the Second Amendment. Erich Pratt, senior vice-president of Gun Owners of America, said voters need to replace the Democrats in control of the government in Virginia. ""We need to throw the bums out. We need to clean house in the next election,"" he told the crowd. House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert complimented the behaviour of the rally-goers and said Democrats should take a lesson from them. ""The law-abiding gun owners in attendance today are the ones who would bear the brunt of their anti-gun proposals, which would have little to no impact on crime or criminals,"" he said in a statement. The rally coincided with the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, which is typically a chance for everyday citizens to use a day off work to lobby their legislators. However, the threat of violence largely kept other groups away from the capitol, including gun control groups that hold an annual vigil for victims of gun violence. When that event was cancelled, students from March for Our Lives, the movement launched after 17 were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.,Â in 2018, decided they had to do something. A group of about 15 college students and one high schooler slept overnight in the offices of two Democratic lawmakers to ensure they could make it into the capitol area safely. The lawmakers, Hurst and Del. Dan Helmer â€” who isÂ sponsoring a bill that would block the National Rifle Association from operating an indoor gun range at its headquarters â€” camped out as well. Michael McCabe, a 17-year-old high school senior from northern Virginia, said he was there to underscore the ""moral urgency"" felt by a generation ""unduly affected"" by gun violence. ""Our main goal is not to engage with gun extremists today,"" McCabe said. ""We are really here to be present in the legislature to make our voices heard.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/virginia-gun-rights-rally-1.5432969,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/james-fields-heather-heyer-charlottesville-sentence-1.5211830 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nra-walmart-1.5269970 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fbi-arrests-the-base-georgia-wisconsin-1.5432006 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/militias-oath-keepers-rallies-1.4246317,N/A
