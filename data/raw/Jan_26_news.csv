Pharmacists Association said pharmacists take on that work in other parts of the country. By not allowing pharmacists to fill that role, the province is putting more pressure on nurses who are already overworked, said Erin MacKenzie, the group's executive director.  ""We have 50 pharmacists right across the province in various communities,"" she said. ""And, also, the pharmacists can assess and prescribe medication without having to refer back to a physician or nurse practitioner for smoking cessation products if they are deemed necessary."" MacKenzie said she's heard from both pharmacists and patients who have said that the P.E.I. program has too many barriers.  ""We feel that … it's kind of a missed opportunity maybe to help pharmacies alleviate some of the barriers, particularly in this nursing crisis,"" she said.  She said the group has spoken with the province about its concerns and hopes there'll be more consultation and involvement the next time a smoking cessation initiative is launched. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-pharmacists-asking-for-bigger-role-to-help-smokers-quit-1.5440610,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-winter-survival-guide-january-2020-1.5435261 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-alan-doyle-musical-jan-2020-1.5440304,N/A
1,David Morley,2019-12-30T09:00:00.675Z,Millions of children in need of humanitarian assistance heading into new year,"This column is an opinion by David Morley, president and CEO of UNICEF Canada. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. We are entering the final year of what has been one of the worst decades for children. War, disease and extreme weather events are robbing them of their right to simply be a kid – to have a safe, healthy and carefree childhood. In far too many communities around the world, sounds of youngsters laughing and getting into mischief are being replaced by silence. It doesn't have to be that way. This month, UNICEF launched Humanitarian Action for Children 2020, a report on the world's emergencies. It highlights some of the key challenges children are facing around the world: severe malnutrition, conflict, infectious disease, climate change, and access to education. Children displaced by crises are also vulnerable to increased harm, including gender-based violence, recruitment as soldiers, exploitation, and trafficking. The sheer magnitude of the situation is heartbreaking. The report identifies 59 million children in 64 countries who are living in crisis zones and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 2 million children with disabilities. These are the highest levels since we began keeping records. The projections for the year ahead are just as dire. The main causes are threefold – conflict, climate change and major outbreaks of disease. The number of armed conflicts is at a three-decade high, with many civil wars engulfing entire countries. More than 30 million children are caught in the middle. Yemen has been a battleground for more than four years. Fighting has been going on for six years in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Syria's civil war is now in its ninth year. And these conflicts have no end in sight. Some have lasted so long that many kids are growing up only knowing war. Top priorities in these war-torn regions include providing children with protection, safe water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. And the need is great. In the coming year, for example, UNICEF expects it will need to treat 5.1 million children for acute malnutrition, provide 4.5 million children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, and distribute emergency cash assistance to 1.7 million families to meet their most urgent needs. Immediate responses to crises in the year ahead must also be balanced with the longer-term needs of children, most importantly their education, which is also under attack. During disasters, schools are often used as shelters or distribution centres, since they are usually among the strongest structures. In conflict zones, they are increasingly becoming targets. More than 3,000 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the past three years because of violence and insecurity. Kids are incredibly adaptable, but in any emergency, getting them back into a classroom as quickly as possible is essential. Education to help them reach their potential is obviously important, but letting them be with their friends in a safe space also gives them a return to normalcy. As if wars and conflict weren't enough, millions of children are also threatened by outbreaks of highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Major outbreaks are now hitting the most vulnerable in conflict zones, greatly complicating the ability of aid agencies to respond. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest ever recorded and the first to occur in the middle of a conflict zone. There are 3,000 confirmed cases, including more than 900 children. Measles has also become a threat to children despite safe and affordable vaccines. As with any public health campaign for children, educating the adult decision-makers is the key to eliminating this deadly threat. Climate change is also affecting the most vulnerable. More than 500 million children live in areas that have experienced extreme flooding, while 160 million live in regions that are subject to severe drought. And the number of extreme weather events keeps rising. Mozambique was hit by back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, for example, and rebuilding will take years. Regions like the Sahel in Africa, where livelihoods rely on agriculture, grazing and fishing, are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Solutions demand a long-term commitment. The positive news is that humanitarian organizations have made tremendous progress working with host governments in areas likely to experience extreme weather and flooding, helping to build more resilient communities and better prepare for disasters. Still, the threats children are facing are overwhelming. The amount of funding for emergencies that UNICEF projects it will need in 2020 is $4.2 billion US, a staggering 3.5 times the amount required in 2010, underscoring how frightening the world has become for young people. But as someone who has worked in the international humanitarian sector for going on four decades, I refuse to be discouraged. We cannot give up. The international community, governments and civil society need to come together to protect and defend children's rights. The government of Canada is playing a global leadership role in prioritizing education for children in conflict zones and other protracted humanitarian crises. But as a nation we must do more to help children around the world. People in this country clearly care about children's welfare. I am confident Canadians will rise to the challenge and defend, for every child everywhere, the right to a safe and healthy childhood.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-child-welfare-1.5367654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-war-saudis-houthis-1.5373868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unhcr-refugee-forum-1.5398929 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mali-violence-massacre-children-1.5171664 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/mali-mission-1.5272076 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/violence-against-health-workers-worsening-measles-outbreak-in-congo-1.5377716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107,N/A

3,Anonymous,2020-01-24T20:55:21.569Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence can keep working","An obstetrician at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital accused of sexual wrongdoing by two female patients whose final day of work was supposed to be Friday is now allowed to continue working. On Thursday, the Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons announced Dr. Manivasan Moodley would face a hearing over allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. As a foreign-trained doctor, Moodley is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship was being withdrawn, and his last day of work was supposed to be Friday. However, the college announced today that another sponsor had come forward, which means Moodley will be able to continue practising medicine. His hearing over accusations of professional misconduct and incompetence is scheduled to begin next month. On Thursday night, about 80 people rallied outside the Cape Breton Regional Hospital to show their support for Moodley. College registrar Dr. Gus Grant said the significant public response to the allegations against Moodley nearly scared off the two female complainants at the heart of the misconduct hearing. ""All would agree that Dr. Moodley is owed due process and the college is going to deliver due process,"" said Grant. ""All would agree, also, that these women are owed safety, freedom from intimidation and privacy.""   He said the public outcry in support of Moodley failed to consider the complainants' point of view, and that could have derailed the hearing. ""The least fair outcome would be if these allegations were dismissed simply because the complainants chose not to give evidence,"" Grant said. However, the complainants are still ready to proceed with the hearing, he said. The registrar also said it is important to separate Moodley's license troubles from the allegations against him. Grant said without a sponsor or supervisor, Moodley simply couldn't practice, and the decision to withdraw or step forward as a sponsor is up to those individuals. Moodley was not available for an interview, but in an email, said he was grateful for the support of the community, his colleagues and patients. ""I now know for sure that I am part of this community and that as much as I will provide unique care for them, they will stand up for me if ever I am challenged again,"" Moodley said. Dr. Margaret Fraser, head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said she was very pleased with the extension of Moodley's licence. She said Dr. Jeremy Hilliard had stepped forward to sponsor Moodley and Dr. Angus Gardner has agreed to be his supervisor. ""I think it's the right decision to allow him to continue until the college process has been gone through,"" Fraser said. She also said it's not clear if the rally and other public support helped Moodley get his licence renewed. ""I don't know if that had any effect, but certainly it was heartening for Dr. Moodley to see that his patients supported him and that his colleagues supported him in this difficult time."" Grant said comments on social media had also weighed on the complainants' minds this week. Although some were in favour of Moodley, others suggested Cape Breton must be desperate for doctors if the community was rallying to support a physician facing serious sexual allegations. Fraser said that's not a fair comment. ""This man is being judged in the court of public opinion,"" she said. ""No decision has been made regarding his licensing. No decision has been made regarding his culpability in this matter ... so until the college has gone through its process, it is unfair to judge this man prematurely."" The college alleges that in the case of one complainant, Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in a sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. In the case of another complainant, the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace.

4,Maria Jose Burgos,2020-01-26T16:45:45.919Z,"Love ritual takes hold in Saint John, but tossed keys a worry to some","While walking through a trail in Little River Reservoir Park in east Saint John, photographer Monique Gionet noticed padlocks of all sizes hanging from the railings of a small bridge. Initials were scribbled on most them, along with messages like ""Jess + Jon"" and ""Forever + Always."" During the past two years, dozens of locks have been hung on the bridge's railings, according to Gionet. With the growing numbers at the reservoir, people have already begun hanging locks from another bridge, near the city's Lily Lake. ""I really love the sentiment of love locks,"" Gionet said. ""I always have. But it fights the mini environmentalist in me."" During the early 1900s, a common love tale inspired many to hang locks on bridge railings to protect love, or to make it last — even if just for a little longer.  But as the practice spread across the world, love locks have provoked environmental and structural concerns. Some locks have had to be ripped from crumbling bridges such as the Pont des Arts in Paris. Partners write their initials on locks — some use sharpies while others go for laser technology inscriptions, they hang the locks from bridge railings and throw the keys in the water, while wishing for unbreakable love. Bridges of cities like Paris, Rome and even Canadian cities like Winnipeg have so many that the clusters of locks resemble flower bouquets.  Gionet had never considered the environmental or structural impact of hanging locks from bridges and throwing keys until she lived in Bristol in 2015 and friends made her aware of the potential environmental and structural impacts. She also worries about the environmental impact of throwing keys to a body of water. ""What the keys are doing in the water? I don't think it would be good for the environment or the structures the city has put in place."" In Saint John, some industries extract water from Silver Falls, one of the two reservoirs at the Little River Reservoir Park, but no water from the park is used for drinking, said Graeme Stewart-Robertson, executive director of the environmental non-profit ACAP Saint John.  ""As storybook as it is, we are essentially dumping something into water, which is not only potentially an issue, but it is technically a violation of a couple of different laws,"" he said of the love lock keys. Even though most keys aren't made out of anything particularly damaging like lead or arsenic, Stewart-Robertson said some animals that live in or near Little River, including amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds could try to eat the keys.  ""It is possible, we have seen this in ducks before, that they will eat a lot of objects that aren't good for them in the process of searching for those that are."" Gionet thinks the City of Saint John should attach a plaque on both ends of the walking bridge asking people not to hang locks or toss the keys in the water. ""It's great for photos, I'll tell you as a photographer. But structurally you can see how [the bridge] is already starting to bend in."" Lisa Caissie, communications manager for the city, said in an email statement that the city is aware of the love locks and has no plan to remove them, as long as people are not damaging the walking bridge. She said park staff will consider adding a bucket for key disposal or a sign requesting people to pocket their keys. The Pont des Arts bridge in Paris reached more than 700,000 individual locks, weighing about 45 tonnes, or the combined weight of almost 20 elephants, according to CNN.  The love locks were removed from the bridge that year, the railings replaced with plexiglass coverings, and clusters of about five to 10 locks were sold to the public to raise money for refugees. But the history of love locks is not Parisian. It is not even French.  The most widely accepted account begins just before the First World War in Serbia, when a school teacher met an officer at a bridge in the small town of Vrnjačka Banja called Most Ljubavi, which translates to the Bridge of Love. Shortly after they fell in love, the officer went to war in Greece and married a local woman from Corfu. According to the tale, the Serbian woman died alone of a heartache. Young women from Vrnjačka Banja who heard the tale decided to protect their love by writing their initials and those of their loved ones on padlocks and fixing them to the railings of the bridge where the Serbian school teacher had met her then-lost love. The ritual became popular yet again around 2006 in Rome with the release of the book I Want You by the Italian author Federico Moccia.  For Stewart-Robertson, this ritual shows that, in New Brunswick, water sources are often taken for granted because they're everywhere. ""When dozens of people do something, it builds and can have a structural impact or an impact on invertebrates and shore birds. We need to think beyond ourselves,"" he said. He thinks people should learn more about what he calls the ""leave no trace philosophy,"" the idea of leaving nothing behind after you visit a green area.  The goal, he says, is to have a net zero impact. ""Or try to leave [green areas] a little better by picking up garbage."" Even if that's not very romantic.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/love-locks-a-cause-for-concern-1.5438843,[],N/A
5,John Peters,2020-01-12T12:00:00.257Z,Mental health advocate wants you to know how to survive suicidal sadness,"Please believe me, I know how it feels to want it all to stop. It wasn't that I even wanted to die. I didn't. I was just so exhausted from feeling the way I was feeling.  And while those moments — when dying feels like your only option — are scary, you feel so frustrated that it makes it so tempting.  But here's what I need you to know! When you hear someone has died by suicide, it's heart-wrenching, it makes you feel sick to your stomach, it brings on a sudden intense feeling of ache in your soul — and always leaves you asking ""Why?""  Too many of us know the sting that suicide brings. Too many of us are scared to talk about suicide, and too many of us perpetuate stigma around suicide.  I don't have every answer. Nor can I speak to every case.  But three things, in my experience, I know are certain. John Peters offers a personal message to anyone in crisis: I've often seen individuals who have been hesitant to talk about suicide, because they believe talking about it causes it to happen more frequently.  But I believe that if you're in pain, then you must talk about it. We need to have more conversations about suicide and life promotion with our families, children and friends, in our workspaces and communities. Through storytelling and education, we can abolish the stigma around suicide and be more compassionate. There is power, growth and a healing impact when we speak the truth.  Ignorance causes us to belittle, gaslight and silence those who are battling this enormous fight.  There is a persistent behaviour of calling people ""too sensitive"" — which is a way to avoid being held accountable and to continue with abusive behaviour.  It can be seen everywhere, when you hear ""it's just a joke"" or ""don't take it so seriously.""  We must remember — we don't know what an individual is experiencing and what a person's thresholds are. Humour that involves someone's identity, religion, sexual orientation, mental health or appearance could be detrimental.  We as a community need to acknowledge the truth: there are many of us who fight silent battles and we urgently need to cultivate safe, shame-free spaces and communities, where an individual feels safe enough to reach out when in crisis.  We as community members are all accountable to our neighbours. Every human being's life is precious.  Today, there is no excuse for saying ""I don't know."" With the amount of information on the internet, public health, and local mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, we can take steps every day to ensure that we are informed and equipped with the right information and tools.  Which brings us to … It is a privilege to have access to resources and efficient care.  Sadly, here in Canada, prejudice and neglect are two major barriers in the system.  Due to the genocidal foundation of our country, colonial systems and policies, a large number of Canadians do not have access to care.  I speak to this as a front-line worker. In my area, for example, we have fewer than 1,500 people, and the number of people who have to tirelessly fight to access care is appalling.  Now, think about that in a lens looking at the entire country.  If any Canadian suffers, if any Canadian dies by suicide, we fail, Canada fails — and continues to fail. Commission your community's leadership and local governments to bring in resources, and do not be gentle or quiet about it. BE LOUD AND ADAMANT! Community is incredible and when we are connected, we can move the earth. Conduct workshops facilitated by health professionals about suicide prevention, so the community can gain knowledge. Provide mental health therapists and programs to respond to our community members who reach out when they are in crisis. This will help us support and care for them in a good way.  Provide spaces where people can pray together, and provide creative outlets for people to nourish their gifts and talents. Each individual has a unique expression form and when it's nourished, it is powerful and healing.  You can also start prevention and life promotion initiatives in your own community to raise awareness. Really, the list could go on and on, because everyone is responsible for actively contributing to the prevention of suicide. There are lives at stake!  Many people, such as your friends, family, even you, may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.  I need you to know, if that's you right now, wherever you are — listen to me: You are loved, you are not a bad person, you are not a bad parent, you are not a bad kid, you are not a screw-up, and you are not worthless. You are beautiful, you are talented, you are gifted, you have purpose, and we need you to stay with us.  If you are struggling today, please reach out to a loved one.  You can also call the Canada Suicide Prevention Service at 1-833-456-4566, Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868, First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness Help Line at 1-855-242-3310 or you can visit thelifelinecanada.ca for more information on other crisis help lines.  Also, for young readers, please check out WeMatter campaign on Facebook, Instagram and wemattercampaign.org.  Remember: The world is beautiful with you in it!

6,Jorge Barrera,2020-01-25T19:00:56.059Z,"Ottawa backed away from commitment to approve child welfare lawsuit, lawyer says","Ottawa is balking at a pledge to consent to the certification of a proposed class action lawsuit over First Nation child welfare — less than two months after the justice and Indigenous services ministers publicly said the federal government wanted to settle the case, according to one of the lawyers on the file. Justice Canada informed lawyers handling the proposed class action via email Thursday evening that Ottawa was not ready to consent to the certification of the lawsuit, said David Sterns, a lawyer with Toronto-based Sotos LLP, one of three firms handling the litigation.  Sterns said the federal government served legal documents outlining its opposition to certification on Thursday. A move to challenge certification would break a public commitment made in late November by Justice Minister David Lametti and Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller, who jointly said the government would consent to certification — a key step in negotiating a class action settlement. ""This is a step backwards. This is going to lead to a lot more delay in the case and it's reneging on a very public commitment to consent to certification,"" said Sterns. ""This is a government that says it wants to do the right thing, but it isn't really prepared to get to first base."" A lawsuit needs to be certified by a court in order to become a class action. The proposed class action was filed with the Federal Court in March 2019. It's seeking $6 billion in compensation for First Nation children affected by the on-reserve child welfare system, and for those who were denied health services Ottawa was required to provide under the policy known as Jordan's Principle. According to Jordan's Principle, the needs of a First Nations child should always be placed ahead of jurisdictional disputes over funding for health care and other public services. The plaintiffs in the case are Xavier Moushoom, from Lac Simon Anishnabe Nation, Que., and Jeremy Meawasige from Pictou Landing First Nation in Nova Scotia. Moushoom was shuffled through 14 foster homes between the ages of nine and 18. Meawasige was born in 1994 with cerebral palsy, spinal curvature and autism. Indigenous Services Canada, which is the lead department on the file, said the government needs more time before agreeing to consent to the certification of the lawsuit. ""We have been working in concert with counsel for Moushoom to reach mutually agreed upon terms to certify the class action lawsuit. We are asking for additional time to reach these terms, given the significance of this matter,"" the department said in a statement.   ""As we have said, we must get this right. We continue to work with all parties to move this important matter forward."" Sterns said his side is now preparing for a certification hearing before a Federal Court judge in September — where, without a consent agreement, the two sides will have to argue over why the case should or should not be certified. ""[Consent to certification] was going to remove significant delays and procedures and really streamline the process,"" he said. ""So their announcement is a serious disappointment and it's a big step backwards in terms of their prior commitments."" The government, from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on down, has said repeatedly that it wants to settle and compensate all individuals affected by the on-reserve child welfare system. Justice Minister David Lametti and Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller announced on Nov. 25, 2019 that the government would be moving forward with settlement talks on the lawsuit and would consent to its certification. ""The Government of Canada is committed to seeking a comprehensive settlement on compensation that will ensure long-term benefits for individuals and families and enable community healing,"" said the statement at the time. ""To that end, we will work with plaintiffs' counsel with the goal of moving forward with certification of the Xavier Moushoom and Jeremy Meawasige v. The Attorney General of Canada class action."" The announcement came on the first day of a Federal Court hearing on Ottawa's challenge of a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal compensation order which is part of a separate discrimination case linked to the on-reserve child welfare system.  The human rights tribunal ruled in January 2016 that Ottawa discriminated against First Nation children by knowingly under-funding on-reserve child welfare services. The federal government is now seeking a judicial review to quash a tribunal compensation order issued in September that Ottawa pay $40,000 to First Nation children taken from their families and communities since 2006 through the on-reserve child welfare system, and in Yukon. Miller said in December that the government preferred to settle the human rights tribunal case through the Moushoom class action. ""We will be sitting down with parties and seeing where there is a meeting of minds and move forward on a compensation package, a compensation model that is fair and equitable,"" said Miller at the time. Since then, Indigenous Services and Justice Canada officials have held separate talks with the Moushoom legal team and the parties to the human rights tribunal case — which include the First Nation Child and Family Caring Society and the Assembly of First Nations. Sterns said there have been no discussions to date on bringing the two separate talks together. ""Whether or not there is going to be a more joining up of the forces, it remains to be seen,"" said Sterns. ""But, so far, it really has been proceeding with two parties that, frankly, aren't much able to talk to each other.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/ottawa-lawsuit-children-1.5440349,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/child-welfare-class-action-1.5372281 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/challenge-child-welfare-lawsuit-1.5343818,N/A
7,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2019-12-04T20:00:17.049Z,Plastic surgeon vows to fight potential class-action lawsuit alleging he filmed patients without consent,"UPDATE: Since the publication of this article, Dr. Martin Jugenburg has responded to CBC's request for comment. The article has been updated to reflect that response.  A Toronto plastic surgeon who could face a class-action lawsuit over allegations he breached the privacy rights of patients by recording them without their consent using surveillance cameras at his clinic said the suit is without merit and that he intends to vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Dr. Martin Jugenburg — known online as Dr. 6ix — is well-known on social media and was the focus of a Marketplace investigation last year that found security cameras in examination rooms at his clinic in the Fairmont Royal York hotel.  The petition to have the lawsuit certified as a class action was filed on behalf of former patients on Nov. 28 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It alleges that Jugenburg failed to act in the class members' best interests and that he placed his interests over theirs ""in pursuit of his own personal and commercial gain.""  J.C., a representative plaintiff in the case, went to Jugenburg's clinic for a breast lift consultation and said the behaviour alleged in the lawsuit is unacceptable.  ""I can't imagine how many other women out there don't even know this has gone on. No doctor should be able to get away with this type of behaviour.""   The statement of claim also alleges that Jugenburg's clinic posted images of patients on social media without their consent. The allegations have not been proven in court. In a Dec. 2 statement to CBC News, Jugenburg said patient privacy continues to be his highest priority. ""We believe this legal action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit,"" he said. Jugenburg said he has apologized to his patients for not posting visible signage alerting them to the security cameras in his clinic and said the footage was ""protected, secure, and auto-deleted itself after a time delay.""  If given the go-ahead by a judge, the class-action could represent patients who visited Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, between January 2012 and February 2019.   ""The heart of the lawsuit is really to get damages for women who had their trust abused by Dr. Jugenburg and who suffered some pretty serious mental health effects as a result of realizing that they were filmed without their consent,"" said Tina Yang, one of the lawyers involved in the case.  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record' The plaintiffs are seeking $50 million in damages, including aggravated damages, and $25 million in punitive damages, plus an amount to be determined for special damages. Lawyers say these numbers could change if the lawsuit is certified, the number of plaintiffs in the class is determined and their additional experiences are gathered.  Last year, while reporting undercover for a story on breast implants, Marketplace producers spotted security cameras in a closed-door examination room where patients are asked to undress, as well as in the waiting area. The small black-and-white devices were attached to the ceiling in the corners of the rooms. At least some of the cameras in these rooms were also recording audio. Following CBC's coverage, Jugenburg said in an email that he provided clear signs about security cameras and removed the cameras from examination rooms.  J.C., one of two representative plaintiffs on the statement of claim, had read Marketplace's article last year.   ""I remember I was walking through my basement reading it and then I ... literally fell onto the chair and I was overcome with humiliation."" J.C. visited Jugenburg's clinic in the summer of 2018. She said a nurse asked her to remove her top and bra so that photos of her breasts could be taken for her medical record with a hand-held camera, which is common practice.  At one point, J.C. also took off her pants so the nurse could examine her for a ""tummy tuck."" J.C said that at no point during her consultation did staff tell her about the additional security cameras in the room. ""The entire time I was there, it wasn't private,"" she said. At one point during the consultation, the nurse left the room to give J.C. and her friend who accompanied her to the appointment a moment to discuss their thoughts, J.C. said. ""That private conversation for starters wasn't private,"" she alleged. ""But [the nurse] knew it wasn't private.""  Both Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) launched investigations into Jugenburg's clinic following Marketplace's reports in December 2018. The commissioner's investigation found that the clinic's use of security cameras went against Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and that the clinic did not obtain patients' consent to film them with security cameras during appointments.  The commissioner reported that the clinic had a network of 24 security cameras that were recording 24 hours a day in examination rooms, the operating room, pre-operative room, reception areas, hallways, administrative offices, a computer workroom and the staff kitchen.  According to the commissioner's report, some cameras were first installed in 2012 but stopped working sometime that year. When the clinic expanded to two floors, the system was reset. These recordings began running in January 2017. The clinic said it shut off the cameras on Dec. 13, 2018.  The footage was available for Jugenburg to view live through a secure application on his phone. Footage from the security cameras was also stored on devices that were automatically overwritten with new footage approximately every 30 days, the report said. Jugenburg told the IPC that the cameras were installed for the security of the clinic, staff and patients and not for health-care purposes.  As part of the investigation, the clinic gave the IPC examples of when footage from the surveillance cameras was reviewed by staff. On two occasions, the footage was reviewed to verify statements made by staff to patients during consultations and on another occasion to review staff conduct.  In the spring of 2019, the college told Jugenburg to remove all cameras from rooms where patients undress and required that the clinic post clear signage alerting visitors to video surveillance.  WATCH: A plaintiff says security cameras were a huge violation of her privacy The clinic told the IPC that there are now only two security cameras — one at each of the two reception desks on both floors of the clinic. These cameras are only recording after office hours.  The clinic confirmed with the IPC that it destroyed all footage recorded prior to January 2019 except for footage that was seized by the college for its investigation.  ""Even though the cameras are no longer rolling, he still has to be held accountable for what he's done,"" said J.C.  Neither of the two representative plaintiffs know if the clinic shared photos of them on social media. ""We're alleging that there were photographs taken of patients that were then placed on social media without consent,"" said Kate Mazzucco, another lawyer involved in the claim.  The lawyers who launched the lawsuit said these allegations are in the statement of claim based on a pending case against Jugenburg with the CPSO that alleges Jugenburg engaged in ""disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct"" by allowing a film crew into a patient's surgery without her consent, touching her inappropriately and posting photos of her on social media without her consent.  When asked previously about these allegations, Jugenburg said they are ""denied and being defended."" These allegations, and allegations that Jugenburg used video recording devices at his clinic, will be addressed at a college disciplinary hearing in May 2020.  If you have a story you'd like to share, send it to caitlin.taylor@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239,https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/toronto-plastic-surgeon-marketplace-cameras-1.5137052 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-breast-implant-cameras-1.4944628,N/A
8,Kieron Testart,2020-01-24T13:00:00.851Z,"OPINION | N.W.T. Child and Family Services is broken, will MLAs be able to fix it?","The Northwest Territories government is failing foster parents and children in care — but is anyone surprised?  After two damning auditor general reports, barely four years apart, and no real changes, revelations from the Foster Family Coalition of the Northwest Territories' recent 27-page letter simply constitute the latest chapter in this sad story. For more than eight years, we've heard horror stories of the mistreatment of children. We've also heard first-hand accounts from front-line caregivers about being misled and verbally abused by child protection workers. No wonder so many have lost confidence that the government will meaningfully act to fix Child and Family Services. We've heard these promises again and again. The auditor general's office says it's up to elected representatives to make necessary fixes to the system. It will take determined political will on the part of MLAs to make that happen.  Politicians often treat issues at Child and Family Services as an inconvenience — problems that can be managed with action plans and rosy speeches — rather than as a real crisis. Slap on a few Band-Aid policies, add some funding, and hope the problem goes away. Diane Thom, the minister of health and social services, first refused to meet with the Foster Family Coalition. She changed her mind only after the group's searing letter went public. Premier Caroline Cochrane, apparently, was too busy to speak to the matter, but encouraged foster parents ""not to lose hope."" Most reasonable people would agree that the government leader should respond instantly to alarming issues involving the children of the Northwest Territories. The tone-deaf responses from Thom and Cochrane are frustrating, and echo the same hollow excuses proffered by previous governments. Thom, a political rookie who inherited these problems from the previous minister, can perhaps be forgiven. But the premier should know better. Cochrane knows intimately the problems in Child and Family Services, having served as a minister in the last cabinet when the health minister of the day faced a confidence vote following the second damning auditor general report.  If this was Ottawa or the provinces, the opposition parties of the legislature would pounce on the government over this scandal. There would be weeks of hard questions in the House and motions compelling the government to act. But this isn't Ottawa, and in the N.W.T.'s consensus-style system, I expect things will play out quite differently. Cabinet will close ranks around their colleague Thom, and she will rely on existing action plans and strategies. Thom will say it is too soon to expect results. Cochrane will lean on her bona fides as a social worker to deflect criticisms of how her government is handling the situation.  Regular MLAs, for their part, will offer words of support to foster parents, caregivers and front-line workers. They will try to resolve this crisis through closed-door meetings and hushed chats with their cabinet colleagues. None of this will give the public confidence that our elected leaders are doing what's best for children in care.  Politicians must prioritize protecting children over re-election. Regular MLAs must pressure cabinet to take decisive action, even if it means ruffling a few feathers. Camaraderie among decision-makers is valuable, but good relations alone won't resolve this crisis.  Showing compassion and understanding to long-suffering caregivers, however, is a good place to start.  Thom should immediately meet with the Foster Family Coalition and officials in the Child and Family Services system, including front-line workers. Cabinet must direct the public service to rethink the child welfare system. Incremental changes aren't working. Sporadically hiring new staff isn't working. To see real change, the entire system needs an overhaul, taking into account recommendations of the auditor general, standing committees, the Foster Family Coalition, front-line workers and caregivers. The outcomes from these changes must be measurable and realistic, with clear marching orders to public servants. Additionally, cabinet must make all relevant documents and witnesses available to the Standing Committee on Social Development without political interference, and the committee must ensure its review of Child and Family Services takes place in public, and that those who testify are protected from reprisal.  This is the first real test of the 19th Legislative Assembly and Cochrane's cabinet. We elect leaders to effect change and get better results for our communities. The time for bold action is now. There is nothing more important to Northerners than their children and we cannot afford to fail them again.

10,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:54:06.649Z,What impact do private jets and celebrity lifestyles have on the fight against climate change?,"Read Story Transcript The CEO of a company that sells private jets to corporations says his clients are concerned about climate change, but ultimately they ""still have to conduct their business.""  ""We are still living in the 21st century and people do have to understand that,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of The Jet Business. ""We're not in the Stone Age, and as much as people want to be able to save the Earth, you still have to survive, you have to live, and you have to produce revenue for your shareholders.""  Despite that, Varsano told The Current's Matt Galloway that the topic of climate change is coming up ""more and more"" in his luxurious showroom in London, U.K. ""People are becoming more conscious of it and they do want to do something about it,"" he said. ""There are some companies and programs that you can easily buy carbon footprint offsets, and it's not that expensive, believe it or not.""  Carbon offsetting works by calculating the emissions generated by a flight you take, for example, then paying someone to plant enough trees to remove that carbon from the atmosphere.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that domestic and international aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of global CO2 emissions produced by people.  Varsano argued that due to the relatively small number of private jets in the world, the carbon emissions involved are quite small. But Stefan Gössling, a professor of tourism, said it could be argued that every individual emission is irrelevant, until they start to add up. ""The question is how does each and every individual in the world contribute to climate change? And that should be the point of measurement,"" said Gössling, who works at Linnaeus University in Sweden. Gössling also questioned the wisdom of carbon offsetting by planting trees, due to widescale wildfires in recent years.  ""Look at Australia, look at California. I think everybody would realize that is not a really safe way of storing carbon,"" he said. Gössling has published research exploring how the lifestyles of the rich and famous affect social attitudes to flight and travel. He tracked the movements of 10 celebrities in 2017, including Bill Gates and Paris Hilton, mining their social media to estimate their travel itineraries and associated carbon emissions. He found their flight-related emissions could be 10,000 times greater than the average person — but he thinks the problem goes further. ""The issue with the celebrities we studied in our paper is that they are obviously famous people who live specific lifestyles that they are admired for,"" he said. Fans and followers may then aspire to, or imitate, their jet-setting lifestyles, he explained. ""That becomes something that is problematic because we need the opposite. ... We need a social norm change towards people being more critical about flying and travel."" Varsano said a pre-owned jet will sell for between $10-$30 million US — depending on size — and is equipped to fly 14 passengers up to 14 hours. A new jet can sell for $100 million US.  One of his famous clients includes motivational speaker Tony Robbins, but he said the worldwide ownership of private jets is split between state-owned planes, and business jets owned by big corporations. While he understands people see private jets as luxury items, Varsano said they're also business tools, describing his product as ""a time machine."" ""You have flexibility in your schedule, you have security, you have confidentiality. So there's a lot of things that you benefit from from being in a corporate jet besides just the pure fact of being in a luxurious atmosphere,"" he said. The time that a frequent-flier executive saves — not lining up at airport security, for example — can be used to grow their business, he said.  ""There's no value you can put that, you know, in a dollar term.""

11,Jennifer Sweet,2020-01-25T14:52:17.800Z,8 things you should know before heading into the woods,"No matter where you live in New Brunswick, you're never very far from wilderness. And whether you make a wrong turn on a woods road, your vehicle breaks down, or you hurt yourself while hiking, it can be easy to find yourself stuck or lost in the middle of nowhere. Chris Steeves of Riverview has seen it all. He's been a search and rescue volunteer since 1987. His group, Tri-County Ground Search and Rescue, covers the southeastern part of the province from the Nova Scotia border and Fundy National Park all the way to Kouchibouguac and almost to Sussex. They've had some years with as many as 26 searches, many in the hills of Albert County near the Fundy coast. Sometimes it's a case of someone who has overestimated their ability to travel, said Steeves, or had a mishap using a compass or GPS. They may have attempted a silly stunt. Other times, they've simply gotten lost in the dark, or wandered off due to a cognitive impairment. ""It's not one demographic,"" said Steeves. ""It just seems to be a mix of a whole bunch of things. And no two searches are alike."" So how do you make sure your story turns out to be a successful adventure overcoming adversity as opposed to a tragic tale? Survival experts say following a few basic tips can make all the difference. Steeves recalled one drunken misadventure that resulted in a man lying exposed in a snowy field for three days and requiring the amputation of his feet. It started, said Steeves, with a spur-of-the-moment trip to a neighbour's house at around noon on a new ATV. The man told his family he'd be back in a few minutes, but ended up staying longer and having a few too many drinks. When his ATV got stuck on the way home, he started walking. He was so cold and inebriated that he walked right out of his boots without even noticing. ""He fell down and that's where he stayed."" Firefighters searched along nearby trails for a couple of days before Tri-County Ground Search and Rescue was called in. ""We go into the bush"", said Steeves. ""We look everywhere."" SAR volunteers set out at around 8 a.m. They found the man at 12:30. He was 600 metres from home. The man was put on a litter and carried to a waiting ambulance. He survived, but his feet were so damaged by frostbite they had to be cut off.  ""All he had on were wet socks,"" said Steeves. ""I don't think he got the training that we offer.""   A new snowmobile suit helped prevent the man who'd fallen in the field from freezing to death, said Steeves.  At this time of year, proper wilderness attire includes waterproof boots and pants and dressing in layers, said survival expert Wayne Russell, of Saint John. Russell has been teaching wilderness skills for 35 years and shares his knowledge on YouTube. Layers retain heat better, said Russell, and if you have to hike a distance you can peel off a layer to avoid getting drenched in sweat, which will soon freeze.  Thick mitts and boots with felt liners will help keep your extremities warm, added Steeves. If your feet do freeze, he cautioned against removing your boots to warm them up. Your feet will swell and you won't be able to get your boots back on. Steeves also advised against wearing cotton underwear or socks. Cotton holds moisture. Wool, fleece or silk will keep you warmer, Steeves said. Keep your head, neck and upper chest warm, and the rest of your body will normally be warm too. Top it off with a windproof outer layer. A garbage bag will do in a pinch. This is key to maintaining your core temperature, said Russell. Without shelter a person can die within a few hours of exposure. To make a basic lean-to, attach a rope between two trees (a ridgeline) at about hip height, drape a tarp over it and stake it down at about a 45-degree angle using tent stakes or wooden stakes that you carve in the woods. Make a raised bed in your lean-to out of brush, so you're not lying directly on the ground or snow. A long fire is best with a lean-to, said Russell. It's used for warming your whole body. To make a long fire, make a ""fire lay"" about one step from the front of your shelter. That's a bed of two-inch-round, six-feet-long sticks laid side by side to a width of about two feet. Lay tinder the size of pencil lead and pencils on top of the fire lay in three or four different places. Top the tinder with finger-sized sticks. As the fire gets going add arm-sized pieces of wood, then logs. Once you start seeing coals, said Russell, you can basically relax. ""I've slept in minus 18 with a survival blanket and long fire just in my clothes ... At one point it was plus 50 on my bed.""  Beyond clothing and shelter, that means don't run. It makes you sweat. Don't cross a stream. And, at this time of year, don't walk out on lake or river ice. ""We haven't had cold enough temperatures yet,"" said Steeves. Plus, he said, water doesn't freeze uniformly. There could be a spring or faster moving water that keeps the ice thin in some places. Here are some of the key items Russell recommends you keep in your car or take with you when you venture into the woods: One or two six-by-eight-foot tarps:  You want a tarp that's long enough to overhang your body so it protects from driving rain or snow, said Russell. You can get one of these for about $4 from the dollar store. You may want a second tarp to protect your fire from precipitation. 50 feet of paracord or mason's twine: These are available from hardware stores or dollar stores and either will fit in your pocket, said Russell. Even butcher twine is fine, said Steeves. It's made of natural fibre that will biodegrade. Two or three lighters or packs of storm-proof matches: Carry one on you, advised Russell. Even a flint and steel can suffice, said Steeves, if you have something that catches fire easily. Lighters will still spark even after they run out of fuel. Knife with a fixed blade: You want the blade thick enough, added Steeves, so that you can whack the back of it with a stick to split wood Orange garbage bag or bright-coloured cloth: To signal for help. A trash bag can also be filled with leaves to make a mattress, said Russell. Whistle: Three blasts followed by an equal silence is the international call for help. Whistles are great, agreed Steeves. You can blow it if you hear noises in the woods. If the noise was made by an animal, the animal will run away, but if the noise was made by searchers they can follow the sound of the whistle to find you. Headlamp with extra batteries: In case you have to look for firewood at night Someone is going to be looking for you, said Russell, so once you find a spot with enough firewood to last the night, you should settle in and stay put as much as possible.  By the next day you'll need to find a spot close to water. An ideal spot will also be near an open area, such as power lines, where you can build a signal fire or plant a signal flag, and have natural shelter such as a bank or cave. ""The only time you move is when resources are gone,"" said Russell, ""but you leave a big arrow in the direction you're going."" Steeves recommends checking out the website adventuresmart.ca. It has advice on what to bring and an app that allows you to file a trip report. If you don't check back in once you're scheduled to make it home, it will automatically alert authorities. SAR groups in every part of the province are trained and ready to help, he said. The department of public safety covers their expenses, but they fundraise to pay for their own training and they search for free. Steeves said they save the province about $20 million in search costs per year. ""We're Maritimers,"" he said. ""We look after each other.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/tips-wilderness-survival-1.5439532,[],N/A

The community's South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. appeared before the legislatures's Health and Social Development standing committee Wednesday. South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. has invested in a medical office in its community centre and is offering a doctor who wants to set up there a year's free rent and all the medical equipment in the centre for free. It's also been advertising independently to recruit a doctor, and that has run it afoul of Health PEI policy. ""Health PEI directed us not to use the word Crapaud. They wanted to do their own advertising and they have the position advertised as all of Queens west, which would include Charlottetown,"" said Lisa Gallant, secretary for South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. ""That concerned us because we don't want to see medical services being moved out of our rural area into an urban center."" In an emailed statement to CBC News, Health PEI said it is its policy not to advertise for individual communities. ""We advertise physician positions based on network or county,"" the statement said. The agency said it has been working with Crapaud to find a doctor, and intends to continue to do so. It noted while no doctor has established a permanent practice in the clinic, four doctors have been seeing patients there at walk-in clinics. ""We appreciate the community of Crapaud's concerns and desire to ensure residents of the South Shore region have access to health care services,"" the statement said. ""Our discussions with community representatives have been meaningful to date and we look forward to continuing those conversations in future."" But Gallant said while Health PEI has told South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. it is supportive of its plans, the advertising restrictions suggests something else. ""When they tell us we can't use the word Crapaud in our advertising I think that sends a strong message to the contrary,"" she said.

14,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:34:55.925Z,Volkswagen ordered to pay $196.5M after pleading guilty to all Canadian emissions-cheating charges,"German automotive giant Volkswagen was ordered to pay a $196.5-million fine to the Canadian government after pleading guilty in a wide-ranging emissions-cheating scandal on Wednesday. Judge Enzo Rondinelli handed down the record-setting fine hours after the automaker formally pleaded guilty to all 60 charges it was facing, including admitting — among other acts — to secretly importing cars that violated polluting standards. The Crown and Volkswagen jointly suggested the penalty, which falls short of the maximum $265 million the company could have been forced to pay. But prosecutors said the penalty is more than 20 times higher than Canada's previous record environmental fine, a contention Rondinelli supported as he ushered in what he described as new standards for environmental accountability. ""The proposed fine here indicates that a new era of environmental protection is upon us,"" Rondinelli said in his decision. ""The proposed fine here would be the biggest fine imposed in Canada for an environmental infraction, by a wide margin."" The German automaker and the Crown submitted an agreed statement of facts in a Toronto court, acknowledging the company imported 128,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, along with 2,000 Porsches, that violated the standards. Reading from the statement, prosecutor Tom Lemon noted that certain supervisors and other employees at Volkswagen ""knew that VW was using software to cheat the U.S. testing process,"" the results of which are used by Canadian authorities. The federal government charged the auto giant last month with 58 counts of illegal importation under the Environmental Protection Act and two counts of providing misleading information. The penalty proposed by both sides was significantly higher than the $7.5 million fine incurred by a mining company in 2014. The money paid by Volkswagen would go to the Environmental Damages Fund, and both parties suggested distributing it to the provinces and territories based on how many affected vehicles were sold in each jurisdiction. The statement of facts notes that the automaker has already tried to make some amends in Canada. Volkswagen ""has devoted significant resources to, and undertaken extensive measures for, the remediation of the subject vehicles,"" Lemon read in court. ""VW settled Canadian consumer claims by providing compensation and benefits for emissions modification and buyback options to remediate the subject vehicles ... or remove them from the road."" Those settlements, according to the document, provided benefits ""of up to a potential maximum"" of $2.39 billion, and were completed by Aug. 31, 2019. But the company refused to admit any actual human or environmental harm caused by its pollution, saying only that the scheme had the potential to cause harm. In court last month, defence lawyers said they intended to plead guilty, but the resolution was delayed while three people sought to make victim-impact statements and provide other input. Rondinelli ruled against them, saying it's not their role to prosecute the company accused of harming them. Lemon said at the time he would gather victim impact statements and review them before submitting them to the court on Jan. 22, in line with the typical process. On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that the ""community impact statement"" turned in to them was not admissible in court. The seven-page document — accompanied by 520 pages of reference materials — was an attempt to enter untested expert testimony into the record, they said. Rondinelli accepted that argument. ""We are at a sentencing hearing, not a trial,"" he said. Volkswagen previously pleaded guilty in U.S. court to three felonies in 2017 and was fined $4.3 billion. German prosecutors fined the company  €1 billion euros in the emissions-cheating case in 2018.

If you want to get a uniform and smooth result, you can blend all the green ingredients together first before adding. If you're adding meat, it's better to add it in together with the pondu at the same time since you want your meat to be tender. If you're adding fish, it's good to let the pondu boil for half an hour before adding the fish to it since the fish doesn't take long to cook. Let the pondu cook for about half an hour, then add your palm oil. Cover and let boil for another 45 minutes to an hour. It is always good to cook it at a medium heat so it cooks well. Serve with fufu, rice or any other dish of your choice.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/congolese-pondu-soup-recipe-1.5433233,[],N/A

Michelle Douglas had a front row seat, looking directly across at Trudeau, as he apologized on behalf of the Canadian government. For decades, right up to the 1990s, members of the public service, the RCMP and the military faced discrimination and harassment, and — in many cases — were forced out of their jobs simply because of their sexual orientation. Douglas is a survivor of the LGBT purge herself and is now executive director of the LGBT Purge Fund. The fund was created following the settlement of a class-action lawsuit against the government, launched by purge survivors. Douglas and her team are now focused on creating a national monument to honour victims of the purge and pay tribute to LGBT Canadians who faced historic discrimination. ""I see this as a matter of reconciliation, and to memorialize especially those who never lived long enough to see this day of justice,"" Douglas told CBC Radio's The House. An official unveiling is still years away, but this week a central Ottawa site was approved by the National Capital Commission. Douglas met host Chris Hall on the newly green-lit site to share her own story from this dark chapter of Canadian history.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-s-newest-national-monument-will-honour-lgbt-canadians-and-remember-the-purge-1.5437395,[],N/A
17,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:44:56.516Z,Anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad falls short of million-strong turnout called for by Shia cleric,"Thousands rallied in Baghdad on Friday to demand that American troops leave the country, though their numbers fell short of the million-person turnout called for by an influential Shia cleric. The rally came amid heightened anti-U.S. sentiment after a U.S. drone strike earlier this month killed a top Iranian general in the Iraqi capital. Since mid-morning, large crowds gathered on the Muslim day of prayers as loudspeakers blasted ""No, no America!"" at a central square in Baghdad. A child held up a poster reading, ""Death to America. Death to Israel."" But by the afternoon the rally had failed to reach the critical numbers called for by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Apparently seeking to show control, al-Sadr's supporters did not engage in altercations with security forces or target the separate, anti-government protests in neighbouring Tahrir Square, a possibility feared by activists in the lead-up to Friday's march. Officials and experts said the rally was the cleric's attempt to capitalize on brewing anti-American feeling and show he had the upper-hand on the Iraqi street as negotiations among political elites over who should be the next prime minister stumble on. In his weekly Friday sermon, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, called on political parties to stop stalling and move the talks forward. ""The formation of the new government is constitutionally long overdue, it is necessary for the various parties concerned to co-operate,"" al-Sistani said in a sermon delivered via a representative,""it is an important step toward resolving the current crisis."" The march did not head as initially feared toward the U.S. Embassy, the scene of violent clashes last month when militia supporters tried to storm the compound. Roads and bridges leading to the heavily fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq's government and home to several foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were blocked off by concrete barriers. Iraqi security forces stood guard, blocking access to the gates to the zone. There was a heavy security presence as the protesters, mostly Shia hailing from the capital but also Iraq's southern provinces, walked on foot to an assembly point in Baghdad's Jadriya neighbourhood, waving Iraqi flags and wearing symbolic white shrouds. Al-Sadr, whose party won the most seats in the May 2018 parliamentary elections, had called for a ""million-man"" demonstration to demand the withdrawal of American troops following the U.S. drone strike near Baghdad's airport that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The killing sparked the ire of Iraqi officials from across the political spectrum. According to U.S. military officials, rather than draw down, Americans have poured 20,000 additional troops in the Middle East to counter what Washington describes as an escalating threat from Iran. There are around 5,200 U.S. troops in Iraq, where they help train and assist Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State group (ISIS). Iran has long sought the withdrawal of American forces from neighbouring Iraq, but the U.S. strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad has added new impetus to the effort.  In retaliation for the U.S. drone attack in Iraq, Iran struck bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. In the aftermath, Iran's military shot down Ukraine Airlines Flight PS752 shortly after it took off from Tehran, killing everyone on board, including 57 Canadians. It took several days for the Iranian government to admit it had accidentally shot the plane down while on high alert anticipating U.S. retaliation.   In a statement Friday, al-Sadr — the Iraqi cleric whose followers fought U.S. troops after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to oust dictator Saddam Hussein — issued a list of conditions for American military presence in Iraq. The list includes cancelling existing security agreements, closing U.S. military bases, ending the work of American security companies and closing off access to Iraqi airspace. If the conditions were met, the statement said, ""the resistance will temporarily stop until the last soldier leaves Iraq,"" al-Sadr said, referring to American troops. Al-Sadr, once a huge thorn in the side of the American occupation after the 2003 invasion, derives political capital from his ability to call on supporters to clog streets and paralyze all movement in Baghdad. Friday's rally came at a critical time as rival political blocs are jockeying over the selection of a premier to replace outgoing Adel Abdul-Mahdi. It was supported by mainstream Shia parties, including that of al-Sadr's political rival Hadi al-Ameri, who heads the Fatah bloc in parliament, as well as the Popular Mobilization Units, an umbrella group comprised of an array of militias, including Iran-backed groups. Al-Sadr ""proved once again he can amass the crowds to take them to the street, cleverly prevented any targeting of protesters in Tahrir Square,"" tweeted Farhad Alaadin, head of the Iraqi Advisory Council and a former presidential adviser. In response to a public outcry over the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis, Iraq's parliament passed a non-binding resolution this month, calling on the government to expel foreign troops from the country. Kurdish and most Sunni lawmakers boycotted the vote. ""The American forces should leave,"" said an 18-year-old protester, Amer Saad. ""I am ready to fight against the Americans if Muqtada al-Sadr asks us."" Police and militiamen of the Popular Mobilization Units also closed off roads leading to the protest site, in both Karada and Jadriya neighbourhoods of Baghdad. In Tahrir Square, anti-government protesters carefully eyed al-Sadr's anti-U.S. rally but no confrontation took place. As the anti-U.S. demonstration dwindled away by the early afternoon, the anti-government protesters remained in their sit-in. ""I am not against the Sadrist movement's demonstrations today, but if Muqtada asks for the exit of the Americans and non-intervention, he should raise the same slogan against Iranian interference, to be honest,"" said one of the anti-government protesters, Yahya Mohammed. In neighbouring Iran, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the Baghdad march on Friday was a ""countdown"" to expelling U.S. forces. ""It indicated that Iraqi people are the flagship on the path of expelling the U.S. from the region,"" he said. Cleric Mohammad Hassan Abutorabifard who led Friday prayers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, told worshipers that Iraqis at the rally ""stood by Iranians"" following Soleimani's killing. ""The legitimacy of the West-appointed puppet rulers in the region has totally collapsed,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-anti-us-demonstrations-baghdad-1.5438812,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-baghdad-deadly-protests-1.5387275 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/baghdad-airport-missiles-1.5413594 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-iraq-crash-soleimani-trump-1.5423238 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-soleimani-trump-trudeau-iraq-1.5422308 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sajjan-troops-leave-request-1.5431700,N/A
18,Santiago Guzmán,2020-01-12T11:30:00.858Z,"I'm new to Canada, and here's why I'm terrified of falling on ice ","Picture this: you just finished grocery shopping for the week. Standing in front of the glass door that leads to a crowded parking lot in St. John's, you see a not-so-scary snowstorm coming before you.  Luckily, you're just a couple of metres away from the bus stop, so it shouldn't be that bad. You don't take the bus regularly because of its lack of efficiency — sometimes it's easier and faster to walk, instead of waiting for an extra half-hour. This time, the bus is your best bet. Plus, the bus will leave you almost in front of your door. Sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're trying to be positive. Although this is not your first winter in Newfoundland and you know how to deal with it, sometimes it's hard to keep yourself positive. Kudos to you. Now that you've made a plan, you put your groceries on the floor to prepare yourself to face this winter crusade: you pull out your mittens, put your warm hat on, cover your mouth and nose with your bulky scarf. You walk through the glass door.  You can feel the immediate change in temperature, and the wind. You start walking slowly, aware of the slippery street, balancing the grocery bags you're carrying. It seems like there is enough salt on the floor to protect you from sliding, and the bus stop is barely 60 metres away. Slip. Your right boot swiftly slides on an icy spot that the salt didn't cover. Miraculously, you juggle the grocery bags, as though you were on a tightrope above a hungry shark waiting for its prey to fall. You find your balance and stand still for a second. That was close! You let a laugh out, take a deep breath and try all over again. Slip. Crack.  Now you're sitting on the barely cleared sidewalk with all your groceries around you. No laughs this time. Instead, slow tears that freeze as they fall down your face. Your ankle. Despite the cold numbing your body, you can feel pain. Deep, sharp, acute pain. It's broken, you know it. In the distance, you see the bus arrive. Its passengers get out while some others hop on, and you're still on the ground in pain. No bus, no groceries, no laughs, but a broken ankle and the fear of having to go to the doctor. No, you're not afraid of needles, and prescriptions — you're afraid to have to pay fully for the medical service in the ER. You don't have health coverage. You really don't know why you're crying now, if it's the pain of your broken ankle or of depleting your minimum wage savings to pay the medical bills.  Unfortunately, the previous scenario is the fear of multiple immigrants in Newfoundland and Labrador. In order to be eligible for the provincial Medical Care Plan, you have to be a current resident of the province, and fall under one of these groups: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, international post-secondary student or international worker (with a valid work visa). It seems simple, but it's not. I put myself forward as a case study. I live in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to the Medical Care and Hospital Insurance Act, a resident is a person ""who is lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, makes his or her home in the province, and is ordinarily present in the province but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the province."" Since I was pursuing my studies here, I envisioned making Newfoundland and Labrador home.  So, emotionally speaking, I would argue that I was a resident even back then. Of course, my feelings could be debatable compared with the actual number of international students who decide to remain in the province. Therefore, as students, we're only given the credit of a temporary resident, because what will happen after we graduate? Nonetheless, after graduating, I decided to stay here. I moved from Corner Brook to St. John's and signed a lease in the house I'm currently renting. I think that's enough for me to become a resident.  I am not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (I have all the intention to become one when I can actually afford it), and I am no longer a post-secondary student — so these are three other categories I don't qualify for. OK, but I do have a valid work permit, so I take it that I'm considered as an international worker. Well, yes but no.  I have to be employed by a Newfoundland and Labrador-based company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for MCP. I'm a self-employed artist trying to make a living from what I came to study in Newfoundland and Labrador to begin with. Securing a full-time position in my field can be quite challenging, but that hasn't stopped me from finding continuous work in my field almost since I graduated last May. However, my contract work won't be considered as full-time employment. Immigration and career consultants have worked hard with me to find a solution. They've helped me look for and connected me with available resources in order for me to get an affordable health care plan. Have I been lucky? No. The answer I've always encountered is ""you're not eligible."" Like the character in the scenario above, I'm afraid to get injured because I wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills. I blamed myself in the beginning for not looking into this situation earlier. I truly thought that this was only happening to me. However, as I became more vocal about it, I found that fellow former international students who decided to reside in N.L. have struggled with this issue as well. Why haven't we found a solution? Why is there nothing in place to support the transition of these international graduates from students-to-workers in matters of health care? Here's a tip: if you're currently an international student, want to stay in this province, and find yourself reading this article, make sure to purchase insurance with your current insurance provider within 30 days of graduating.  I wish someone had told me, because I walk my days afraid of falling.

19,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:41:39.440Z,"China closes cinemas, delays film premieres over coronavirus spread","Chinese movie fans will have to catch the premiere of a much-anticipated new comedy online because many cinemas have closed in response to an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus. Theatres have been shuttered across central Hubei province at the start of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday as part of the effort to curb the spread of the virus that has killed at least 25 people and sickened more than 800 others. The Hong Kong-listed Huanxi Media Group announced on Friday an agreement with Beijing's Bytedance Network to show its new movie, Lost in Russia, on Bytedance's online platforms. Bytedance, which owns the popular TikTok video-sharing app and the news app Jinri Toutiao, said given the efforts to reduce the risks of big gatherings, it had secured the deal to let fans watch Lost in Russia for free on its apps, starting Saturday. China has stepped up efforts to contain the coronavirus, discouraging public gatherings across the country. Ten cities in Hubei province have suspended some public transportation over the outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported on Friday.  Authorities have all but shut down Wuhan, a city of 10 million and a major transport hub, where the outbreak was first confirmed at the end of December. The Lunar New Year holiday usually sees audiences flock to cinemas, with distributors taking advantage of the crowds to launch films, but the premieres of at least seven movies have been postponed, including four produced in China — among them, Vanguard, a thriller starring Jackie Chan. Another big-budget film on hold for release is Detective Chinatown 3, the third instalment in the popular buddy action-comedy series from director Sicheng Chen. Imax released a statement on Thursday to say it supports the decision to postpone the release of the slate of holiday films. ""The safety of Chinese audiences is our top priority,"" the company said in a statement. Variety reports the Chinese holiday had been expected to generate around $1 billion US in box office revenue. The Hollywood Reporter quoted distributors and exhibitors in Beijing as saying the decision to postpone the releases was made voluntarily by the major Chinese studios. All movie theatres in Guangdong, a southern province with more than 110 million people, were ordered closed for the holiday, while many theatres in Beijing shut down after the city's culture and tourism bureau ordered mass events to be cancelled.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/china-film-premiers-theatres-coronavirus-1.5439338,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/cirque-china-cancel-1.5438796 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5438737 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-sets-blistering-pace-to-build-new-wuhan-hospital-1.5438832 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,N/A
20,Alicia Bridges,2020-01-24T18:40:31.823Z,Greg Fertuck committed to 'lengthy' trial over death of estranged wife Sheree,"Greg Fertuck, who is accused of killing his estranged wife Sheree Fertuck in 2015, has been committed by a judge to stand trial on charges of first-degree murder and causing an indignity to a body. The decision by Judge Brent Klause followed a two-week preliminary hearing held at the Saskatoon Provincial Court to determine if the Crown has enough evidence to take the case to trial. The evidence presented at the preliminary hearing cannot be reported on. Sheree Fertuck's family members exchanged hugs and shed tears outside the courtroom after the decision was made. Her sister, Teaka White, said she is happy and relieved with the outcome. ""It's another step forward, I suppose, for hopefully getting closure for our family,"" said White. White said she feels confident about the Crown's case against Greg Fertuck. Sheree Fertuck has been missing since the semi-truck she used for gravel-hauling was found abandoned at a gravel pit near Kenaston, Sask. in December 2015.   Her body was never found. RCMP previously described it as unusual to lay charges without a body. Greg Fertuck was charged in June 2019 after an undercover police operation known as a ""Mr. Big"" sting.  He confessed to the undercover officers that he killed Sheree but later told CBC the confession was a lie. He said he made it up because he was afraid of the undercover police, who were posing as criminals.  Fertuck said he is innocent and denies any involvement in Sheree's death. The case is the focus of the CBC investigative podcast, The Pit. White said she learned new details from the hearing but was not surprised by much of what she heard.  ""I just had my own instincts, which I guess proved to be true,"" she said.  White said it feels surreal to be involved in a murder trial for her sister.  Crown prosecutor Cory Bliss said the trial date will be set in the future at the Court of Queen's Bench.   ""The preliminary hearing, which was some of the evidence, was two weeks so we're looking at a lengthy proceeding,"" said Bliss.

21,Adam Miller,2020-01-26T18:39:10.076Z,Why Canada's 1st suspected coronavirus case is 'a world of difference' from SARS,"News that Toronto has its first suspected case of coronavirus may come as a shock to Canadians, but health officials have been preparing for this exact scenario for weeks.  ""We knew that there was going to be a case in Canada. We knew that there was probably going to be a case in Toronto,"" Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, told CBC News.  ""It was just a question of time.""  The unidentified patient is a man in his 50s who was taken to Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre with symptoms after travelling from the Chinese city of Wuhan to Guangzhou and then to Toronto on Wednesday.  Officials said he had limited external contact with people in Toronto when he arrived at his residence, before being taken by paramedics to hospital in stable condition. ""No one would be surprised if this is a positive case,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital.  ""It appears that this may have arrived on our doorstep and we're ready.""  McGeer, who contracted SARS in 2003 while working as a physician on the front lines of the epidemic, says she believes the risk to the public with this case is low.  ""I'm not concerned about transmission from this case at all in Toronto,"" she said, adding that Toronto Public Health officials have already begun the process of contacting people who may have come in contact with the patient.   ""There are mechanisms for making sure that we can get in touch with all of those people and as long as they're followed up, the rest of us who live in the city are not at any risk at all.""  McGeer said there's still no indication that this coronavirus can be transmitted to anyone but people who have come in close contact with infected individuals, but officials will take precautions.  There are two types of transmission with a coronavirus like this: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission,"" the World Health Organization in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health Dr. Barbara Yaffe said at a news conference Saturday that officials would be looking to identify passengers on the flight the patient took to Toronto who were within three rows for potential risk.  Bogoch said that while the suspected case is not unexpected, by no means does it indicate that there is a wider outbreak in Toronto.  ""I think that people should just go about their lives as they normally do,"" he said. ""But also be aware of the news and follow the situation closely as things change.""  Canada has already ruled out several suspected cases of the coronavirus in Quebec and Bogoch said that is an indication that the systems in place are working.  ""Thankfully, those weren't cases, but at least it demonstrated that people knew what to do and where to go if they had symptoms suggestive of infection with this coronavirus,"" he said. ""It almost was a bit of a test of the system.""  Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director for infection prevention control at Sunnybrook Hospital, said the patient was immediately isolated for further investigation, placed in a negative pressure room with protective equipment and was in stable condition.  Watch: How officials are dealing with public fear over coronavirus Bogoch said the work is not just being done inside the hospital, but preventing further transmission in the community and beyond.  ""This is one case, this is still an evolving situation and of course we might get additional cases as well,"" he said.  ""But we are prepared and the system appears to be working.""  We still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, which had a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""We are in a very, very different place than when we were responding to SARS,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, president of Public Health Ontario. ""One of the things that is very different is that we know what the virus is. We have a fast, reliable test and that really is a game changer."" More than 400 Canadians were diagnosed with SARS and 44 died as a result of the epidemic that killed almost 800 people worldwide in 2003.  Compared with the 2003 SARS outbreak, the flow of information worldwide and speed at which diagnostic tests have been developed has improved dramatically.  ""The speed with which people identified SARS was amazing for 17 years ago, but it still took weeks,"" McGeer said. ""Here, the problem was recognized the last week of December, tests were available around the world 10 days later.""  Information was hard to come by in the early days of the SARS epidemic, too, and health officials in Canada were caught off guard when the virus was confirmed to have landed in Toronto in March 2003. McGeer said health-care workers were ""unprepared to take precautions"" during the SARS epidemic due to a lack of diagnostic tests and experience with outbreaks. ""If you had told people before SARS that a new disease would emerge in China and cause outbreaks in Toronto, they would have laughed you out of the room,"" she said. ""And the situation now is very different. We know what these risks are. We know how they're going to come at us and what you've seen is the perfect example of that working.""  McGeer said the patient clearly received information that he needed to contact authorities when he had symptoms arise, which he did, and the sample was identified by officials within a day.  ""Everybody took the right precautions,"" she said.

UNB researchers on quest to find out ,"Two researchers at the University of New Brunswick are collecting coyote carcasses this winter to find out if the canines are getting bigger.  Graham Forbes, biodiversity and wildlife professor at the University of New Brunswick, is working with graduate student Max Zhong to compare the size of modern coyote carcasses to ones that died 40 years ago.  The pair became interested in studying the topic after hearing trappers and other researchers comment on the size of coyotes in the province.  ""We thought we'd get some data to try to get a handle on that,"" Forbes said.  Forbes and Zhong receive the coyote carcasses from people who are trapping the animals for pelts.  They've collected around 100 carcasses so far from across the province, but are looking to pick up about 50 more. ""We're doing sort of north to south, east to west just to get good coverage for the spatial extent of the province,"" Forbes said. The researchers have already begun splitting the carcasses into four categories: adult males, adult females, male pups and females pups. They can tell the age of the animal based on the size of its teeth.  Forbes and Zhong have also started measuring the weight, length of the body, tail, hind foot, distance from the shoulder blade to the foot and size of the paw. They'll be comparing those measurements to ones recorded by Gary Moore in the 1980s.  Forbes said the size of coyotes may be increasing because the coyotes have an ecological advantage on other species by being bigger. The canines in New Brunswick are actually a hybrid of the smaller western coyote from the prairies and wolves from the Great Lake Region. The species moved eastward and was first recorded in New Brunswick in the 1950s. ""This group of wolf-like animals are quite complicated genetically and so there's a lot of variety in their genes,"" Forbes said, adding that variety makes it possible for some New Brunswick coyotes to end up larger. The scientists expect the project will be completed this spring.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/coyotes-bigger-unb-researchers-1.5439312,[],N/A

Coun. Joe Cressy, chair of the Toronto Board of Health, says he has ""full confidence"" in the city's Medical Officer of Health and the Toronto Public Health team, and will continue to work closely with them to ensure the public remains protected and informed. ""While I understand that this news may cause some fear and concern for Torontonians, it is important to know that we have a strong and capable public health system in place for just this reason, and the risk of contracting the virus in Toronto remains low,"" Cressy said in a statement. ""Toronto Public Health has a strong and experienced communicable disease surveillance program. They do this work each and every day."" Public health officials announced Saturday afternoon that a man in his 50s who had travelled to Wuhan, China, became ""quite ill"" within a day of arriving in Toronto. He was diagnosed with the coronavirus at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and placed in isolation. Watch | Health officials outline how Canada is responding to the coronavirus: On Sunday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer said the man, who remains hospitalized, is currently in stable condition.  Tam said authorities are now working to help track some of his fellow passengers, but said the case demonstrates that the country's public health protocols are working. She said federal authorities, together with Toronto Public Health, are in the process of reaching out to those who were within a two-metre radius to the man to ensure they know what to do if they become ill. ""The patient has been managed with all appropriate infection and prevention control protocols, so the risk of onward spread in Canada is low,"" Tam said at a morning news conference in Ottawa. ""The TPH team is working with the affected individual and their health-care team to follow up with all known contacts who may have been exposed to the virus,"" Cressy said.  ""TPH is co-ordinating closely with provincial and national health agencies, hospitals, airports, and community agencies."" CBC News spoke to a passenger who said he was on China Southern Airlines flight CZ311, which took off on Tuesday to Toronto from Guangzhou. ""I am worried,"" he wrote to CBC News on Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo. ""I am worried for me and my family."" The man from Toronto, who did not want to be identified because of the stigma associated with the coronavirus, said he was returning to Canada after visiting family in Guangzhou for the last few weeks. He did not visit Wuhan. He said he hasn't exhibited any symptoms of the coronavirus. He said he called Public Health Ontario Sunday morning after reading on social media that he might have been on the same flight as the patient. ""I didn't know what I should do,"" he said. Health officials told him the risk to Canadians remains low. He was told to continue to follow the usual health precautions and to seek medical care if he starts developing symptoms. Still, he said he's going to ""self-quarantine"" and will refrain from going out in public for the next two weeks. Messages suggesting that CZ311 passengers should isolate themselves began popping up on Chinese social media on Saturday night, shortly after Ontario confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto. The messages have since been shared thousands of times in the last 24 hours. Romeo Lian says he returned to Toronto from Shanghai a week ago and he was back at Toronto's Pearson Airport on Sunday to meet his wife who's also arriving from the Chinese city. Shanghai is more than 800 kilometres from Wuhan. Lian, who was wearing a mask, says he is taking precautions to protect himself and others. ""This is a public area. If I carry the virus, I don't want to spread it to other people,"" Lian told CBC News. He also believes health authorities should reach out to everyone who was on the flight with the infected man. ""I think they should contact everybody [on] the flight. Everyone, because you know the [aircraft] has the airflow … so it's very dangerous."" Meanwhile, Mayor John Tory said the city's frontline health-care workers are the best in the world and have procedures in place to keep people safe. ""While we now have one presumptive confirmed case, our health officials are clear that the risk to residents continues to remain low,"" Tory said. ""Toronto Public Health is continuing to work closely with provincial and federal health colleagues to actively monitor the situation and respond as appropriate."" In Markham, 30 kilometres northeast of Toronto, Mayor Frank Scarpitti called on the federal government to implement additional and advanced screening and detection measures at Canada's airports, including Pearson International Airport.  Scarpitti said with the confirmation of a case of coronavirus in Toronto, there is ""heightened concern and anxiety"" in Markham, which he describes as ""Canada's most diverse community."" ""The current measures introduced are less stringent than at other major airports in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles that involve passengers from China being screened for symptoms,"" Scarpitti said in a statement.

25,Kris Rowe,2019-12-27T09:00:00.675Z,The race to exascale is on — while Canada watches from the sidelines,"This column is an opinion by Kris Rowe, a computational scientist working to get science and engineering applications ready for the next generation of exascale supercomputers. Born and educated in Canada, he has worked at major Canadian and American Universities, as well as two U.S. national laboratories. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Some of the brightest minds from around the globe have been quietly working on technology that promises to turn the world on its head, but so far Canada has been watching from the sidelines. While it is unlikely that people will be huddled around their televisions to watch the power to these incredible machines being switched on, the scientific discoveries that follow the debut of exascale computers will change our daily lives in unimaginable ways. So what exactly is an exascale computer? It's a supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion billion calculations per second — or 1 exaflops. ""Exa"" is the metric system prefix for such grandiose numbers, and ""flops"" is an abbreviation of ""floating-point operations per second."" For comparison, my laptop computer is capable of about 124 gigaflops, or 124 billion calculations per second, which sounds fast. According to the TOP500 list, today's fastest supercomputer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit, which tops out at a measured 148.6 petaflops — about one million times faster than my laptop. However, Summit is a mere welterweight relative to an exascale supercomputer, which is more than 60 times faster. To put that speed in perspective, if you took all the calculations a modern laptop can perform in a single second, and instead did the arithmetic non-stop with pencil and paper at a rate of one calculation per second, it would take roughly 3,932 years to finish. In a single second, a supercomputer capable of 1 exaflops could do a series of calculations that would take about 31.7 billion years by hand. While colloquially a supercomputer is referred to as a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of servers — or compute nodes — connected by a dedicated high-speed network. You might assume that an exascale supercomputer could be built simply by using 60 times more compute nodes than today's fastest supercomputer; however, the cost, power consumption, and other constraints make this approach nearly impossible. Fortunately, computer scientists have an ace up their sleeves, known as a GPU accelerator. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the professional-grade cousins of the graphics card in your personal computer and are capable of performing arithmetic at a rate of several teraflops (ie. really, really fast). And a feasible route to exascale can be realized by not only making supercomputers larger but also denser. Sporting six extremely powerful GPUs per compute node, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora will follow this approach. Scheduled to come online in 2021, Aurora will be the first exascale supercomputer in North America — although the title of first in the world may go to China's Tianhe-3, which is slated to power up sometime in 2020. Several other machines in the U.S., China, Europe and Japan are scheduled to be brought to life soon after Aurora, using similar architectures What exactly does one do with all that computing power? Change the world, of course. Exascale supercomputers will allow researchers to tackle problems which were impossible to simulate using the previous generation of machines, due to the massive amounts of data and calculations involved. Small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) design, wind farm optimization and cancer drug discovery are just a few of the applications that are priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project. The outcomes of this project will have a broad impact and promise to fundamentally change society, both in the U.S. and abroad. So why isn't Canada building one? One reason is that exascale supercomputers come with a pretty steep sticker price. The contracts for the American machines are worth more than $500 million US each. On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU signed off on €1 billion for their own exascale supercomputer. While the U.S. and Europe have much larger populations, the annual per capita spending on large-scale computing projects demonstrates how much Canada is lagging in terms of investment. The U.S. DOE alone will spend close to $1 billion US on its national supercomputing facilities next year, a number which does not take into account spending by other federal organizations, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation. In comparison, Compute Canada — the national advanced research computing consortium providing supercomputing infrastructure to Canadian researchers — has a budget that is closer to $114 million Cdn. In its 2018 budget submission, Compute Canada clearly lays out what it will take to bring our country closer to the forefront of supercomputing on the world stage. Included is the need for increasing the annual national spending on advanced research computing infrastructure to an estimated $151 million — a 32 per cent increase from where it is now. Given cost of the American exascale supercomputers, this is likely a conservative estimate. However, the need for an exascale supercomputer in Canada does not seem to be on the radar of the decision-makers in the federal and provincial governments. Hanlon's razor would suggest that this is not due to some sinister plot by politicians to punish the nation's computer geeks; rather, our politicians likely don't fully understand the benefits of investing in the technology. For example, the recent announcement by the premiers of Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to collaborate on aggressively developing Canada's small modular reactor (SMR) technology failed to mention the need for advanced computing resources. In contrast, corresponding U.S. DOE projects explicitly state that they will require exascale computing resources to meet their objectives. Why should the Canadian government — and you — care? For the less altruistic, a benefit of supercomputing research is ""trickle-down electronics."" The quiet but persistent legacy of the space race is technology like the microwave oven found in most kitchens. Similarly, the technological advances necessary to achieve exascale computing will also lead to lower-cost and more energy-efficient laptops, improved high-definition computer graphics, and prevalent AI in our connected devices. But more importantly for Canada, how we invest our federal dollars says a lot about what we value as a nation. It's a statement about how we value the sciences. Do we want to attract world-class researchers to our universities? Do we want Canada to be a leader in climate research, renewable energy and medical advances? It's also a statement about how much we value Canadian businesses and innovation. The user-facility model of the U.S. DOE provides businesses with access to singular resources, which gives American companies a competitive advantage in the world marketplace. Compute Canada has a similar mandate, and given the large number of startup companies and emerging industries in Canada, we leave our economy on an unequal footing without significant investments in advanced computing infrastructure. Ultimately, supercomputers are apolitical: they can just as easily be used for oil exploration as wind farming. Their benefits can be applied across the economy and throughout society to develop new products and solve problems. At a time when Canada seems so divided, building an exascale computer is the kind of project we need to bring the country together.

26,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-22T23:21:13.084Z,"As U.S. threatens retaliation over digital taxes, Canada waits for OECD talks","As the U.S. continues to threaten other countries with retaliation if they proceed with a digital services tax, Canada's trade minister says the question of how to ensure profitable search engines, social media platforms and online retailers pay their fair share can only be tackled on a multilateral basis. France is preparing to target internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook with a three per cent tax on the revenues from their digital business in that country. Canada may eventually follow France's lead — but for now, it's not prepared to go it alone. Speaking while in transit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Wednesday, Small Business Minister Mary Ng said her government is looking at this issue in terms of what's in the best interests of Canadian businesses. ""I do think it's important to tackle this on a multilateral basis,"" she said. ""You do need to work through those processes."" Taxing multinational tech firms was part of the Liberals' re-election platform, which committed to ""work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations."" The proposal would tax the proceeds of online advertising and user data sales for digital firms with global revenues of more than $1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than $40 million. The Liberal platform projected $540 million in new revenue in 2020-21 from ""making multinational tech giants pay their fair share."" But Canada may not be able to proceed with its plans and start banking that kind of income this spring. Taxing multinational tech firms is easier said than done. Digital businesses models cross borders: a company may be headquartered and taxed in one country while it profits from its business activities in many others. That's why the 36 member countries of the OECD are trying to reach an international agreement on how to tax digital companies by mid-2020. Governments share a common concern: multinationals setting up in low-tax jurisdictions and avoiding taxes in others. Ng told CBC News Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to work though this process. Last fall, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among American industry groups urging the Trump administration to oppose Canada's adoption of a French-style digital tax. American digital companies believe they could be subject to ""double taxation,"" where they end up paying tax on the same revenue in both countries — something the tax treaty in place between the U.S. and Canada is supposed to prevent. The U.S. groups warned that the Liberal proposal could undermine American investments in the Canadian tech sector and be inconsistent with Canada's international trade commitments. World Trade Organization rules, as well as trade agreements like the recently renegotiated North American free trade deal, are supposed to prevent discrimination between foreign and domestic companies in areas like tax policy. Countries aren't allowed to create arbitrary rules to game the system in favour of their own corporations. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party also proposed taxing digital firms in the last election, said ""it makes no sense at all"" that an international foreign company could make money in Canada and not pay any taxes. Speaking during a break in caucus meetings Wednesday in preparation for the return of the House of Commons next week, Singh said that when working class people are paying their fair share, it's wrong for multinationals to do otherwise. He brushed aside the risk of retaliation. ""I don't think that we should live in fear of Mr. Trump. I don't think we should make decisions based on fear,"" he said. ""Particularly when our decisions are the right thing to do."" Talks Wednesday in Davos brought a temporary truce to a heated trade dispute over France's tax, which targets companies that have global revenues of over 750 million euros ($1.09 billion Canadian) and French revenue of over 25 million euros ($36 million Canadian). The thresholds are meant to offer French start-up companies room to grow. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he'd agreed to postpone collection of the tax until December — after the next U.S. election cycle — in return for a commitment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold off on the retaliatory sanctions President Donald Trump threatened to impose on French exports like champagne and cheese. Other European countries, including Austria, Italy, Spain and Britain, are considering similar taxes. Sajid Javid, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), told a panel in Davos Wednesday his country plans to proceed with its two per cent tax in April as a ""temporary tax"" until there is an international agreement on how to proceed. Mnuchin then told the same panel discussion that the pair needed to have ""some private conversations"" about this because such a tax would be discriminatory. ""If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on their car companies,"" Mnuchin said. More talks between Le Maire, Mnuchin and the head of the OECD, José Ángel Gurría, are expected Thursday. Gurría urged the countries to take the ""time and the space"" necessary to reach a deal and avoid bilateral confrontations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764,N/A
27,Ariana Kelland,2019-12-18T10:48:09.612Z,Jennifer Hillier-Penney took estranged husband off life insurance 2 weeks before she disappeared,"Two weeks before Jennifer Hillier-Penney vanished from her estranged husband's house in a remote Newfoundland town, she removed him as a beneficiary on her life insurance policy. For her oldest daughter, Marina Penney, that gesture says a lot about what her mother was thinking in the days leading up to her disappearance in St. Anthony. ""She knew that something was going to happen to her,"" Penney said from her Clarenville home this week. ""She was living in fear."" Hillier-Penney disappeared from Dean Penney's home on Nov. 30, 2016. Documents show the change in her life insurance policy — removing Dean Penney and leaving her two daughters as beneficiaries — was signed and dated on Nov. 16, 2016. ""The 16th of November, as I know it, it was the day her life was threatened. She went back to work that day and she had her friend witness those changes to take my dad off that policy,"" Marina Penney said.  The RCMP have not named any suspects in the suspicious disappearance of Hillier-Penney. Documents, however, indicate the Mounties believe she was kidnapped and killed.  The RCMP are not commenting on the existence of the life insurance policy or what it could mean. ""All tips and any new information received are being pursued,"" RCMP spokesperson Glenda Power said in an email. ""Police do feel there are people who may have information relevant to the investigation who have not come forward."" Marina Penney said she knew about the change in her mother's policy shortly after she went missing. But after three years without answers, she's decided to take it upon herself to reveal details she believes are important in the case. She posted the policy documents on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her mother.  ""There were very few people that knew that had happened, and I'm to the point now where I just need to put her story out there,"" Marina Penney said.  ""People need to know that."" Hillier-Penney went to her estranged husband's home that night to stay with their daughter, Deana.  Dean Penney told The Fifth Estate last year he was going hunting at their cabin in Northwest Arm, 45 minutes away. The next morning, her daughter woke to find her mother's cellphone, purse, jacket and books were still inside the house. Her vehicle was also still outside.   Police believe she disappeared around 8 p.m. Before she disappeared, Hillier-Penney was looking into leaving her estranged husband and her hometown behind, her daughter said. She had a job interview lined up in Glovertown. Friends of Hillier-Penney have said she expressed fear over leaving Penney. ""Jennifer told me … that he said that he would make away with her. And they would never find her. Like she knew that,"" friend Vicki Burden told The Fifth Estate in 2018. ""She had said stuff to me, but not to the extent she told other people,"" Marina Penney said. ""She just didn't want to burden me with it."" Dean Penney did return to his home the night of Hillier-Penney's disappearance, he told The Fifth Estate, to get his duck decoys. Penney said last year he has no knowledge of what happened to Hillier-Penney. Marina Penney is unable to move forward until her mother's body is found. ""I'm in limbo. A lot of anger right now. Coming up on the third year, the weight of all this is heavy,"" she said. For three years, she has racked her brain thinking of where her mother could be. She has no doubt she's dead. Those suspicions have torn Marina Penney's family on both sides apart, she said, ""No one looks at each other the same anymore."" Dean Penney's lawyer, Bob Simmonds, declined comment when reached by phone Tuesday about the change in Hillier-Penney's life insurance policy.  In the years following Hillier-Penney's disappearance, Marina Penney has longed to have her mother near her — especially when she had her first child, who's now 19 months old.  It's not about what Marina has missed, she insists, but about the life her mother never got to live.  ""She was 38 years old. She had plans. She was sick of living a miserable life and she wanted to do more for herself,"" Marina Penney said. ""She wanted to be happy and that was taken from her."" What tears Marina Penney up inside is knowing her grandfather went to his grave in August without knowing what happened to his daughter. ""In the last three years, he spent so much time sat down by himself consumed by his own thoughts,"" she said. ""That killed him. It was too hard on his heart."" The RCMP were granted an extension last Thursday to hold items seized from Dean Penney's home, the family cabin and a vehicle. Some exhibits have been tested at the RCMP's national crime lab in Ottawa, while others may need to be sent for analysis. ""If they had hard evidence, somebody would be in jail,"" Marina Penney said.  Penney said she's not confident in the case that the RCMP is building, and has been disillusioned by the investigation.  ""It's not that [the RCMP] don't want her found. They want her found more than anything but they got to start taking more action. Because people are going to start doing it themselves.""

28,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-23T20:00:43.698Z,'Is that even legal?': Companies may be sharing new credit or debit card information without you knowing,"A Vancouver woman is sounding the alarm for millions of Canadians who have credit and debit cards, after information about her debit card was shared when it shouldn't have been. Vanessa Acuña blames an ""updating service"" that some credit and debit card companies have that allows new account numbers and expiry dates to be shared with merchants customers have dealt with in the past.  Information about the sharing of this kind of information with third party companies is often buried in the fine print of bank and credit card agreements. She thought the details of her Visa debit card — a debit card that can be used for online purchases — were secure. ""[I thought], 'How is this legal?'"" Acuña said after discovering PayPal was given the new expiry date on her Visa debit card without her knowledge. Visa — and other major credit cards — have ""updater"" programs, that automatically provide updated customer credit card information to subscribing merchants, including account numbers and expiry dates. Companies automatically opt-in their customers to the service, whether they realize it or not.  The program is meant to be a convenience for customers and help merchants avoid missed payments on recurring bills. ""I have huge privacy concerns … I would really prefer that they tell you and give you an option to opt out of it. But that's not what they did."" The merchants who get the automatic updates pay for the service.   Thomas Keenan, author of TechnoCreep — a book about how technology is eroding privacy — says financial institutions need to ask themselves if they should be making money by sharing customers' information.  ""Banks make a business out of information sharing. They actually have services — Visa, MasterCard — and they are paid to share that information,"" said Keenan.  Acuña believes that updater service is the reason the online payment system got her card information when it shouldn't have — but when she tried to find out why it happened, she couldn't. Acuña thought what happened to her private information was her decision, when PayPal sent an email in March asking her to update her debit card's expiry date.  She says she ignored the request, since she opened the account five years ago and rarely shops online and didn't want PayPal to have her new card information.  ""Two days afterwards, I got another email saying, 'Oh we updated for you, so you don't have to.' And I just thought 'what?'"" Acuña said. She spent hours on the phone with TD Canada Trust, PayPal and Visa Canada, but instead of getting an explanation, she got three different answers. PayPal told Acuña it got her new expiry date from her ""financial institution or her credit card company.""  Visa and TD both denied giving PayPal that information. ""[They said] they don't know who gave PayPal my information, which I don't think is a very good answer,"" Acuña said. It turns out Acuña's information shouldn't have been shared at all, since only Visa credit — not debit — cards are part of the updating agreement with TD. Yet, none of the three companies involved will explain how her new debit card data ended up with PayPal.  After initially telling Go Public it got Acuña's information from the ""account update services,"" PayPal  backtracked a few days later, saying the account updater service ""doesn't apply"" in Acuña's case. So, how did PayPal get her new expiry date? It won't say, citing customer confidentiality — even though Acuña agreed to waive confidentiality to allow the company to answer Go Public's questions. Visa Canada and TD also won't say who gave her card's new expiry date to PayPal.  ""Visa does not automatically update expiry date information on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email. ""Please refer your questions to PayPal."" ""TD has no ability to automatically update expiry date information with merchants on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders. For more information about the service, we recommend reaching out to Visa,"" wrote Geraldine Anderson from the bank's public relations department. The lack of answers is why banks and credit card companies shouldn't be sharing any credit or debit card information without clear consent from customers, says Ann Cavoukian, who heads up the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto.  ""It's totally unacceptable,"" said Cavoukian, who worked as Ontario's information and privacy commissioner from 1997-2014. ""PayPal is one thing. But your own personal bank where your financial info is stored and kept? As I keep telling businesses, this is not your information. The information belongs to the individual."" She wants to see banks get what she calls ""positive informed consent"" before providing a third party with a customer's information.  ""The banks have to step up and do this. They can't just assume you're OK with them sharing your new credit information.""  Cavoukian wants to see Canada's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, upgraded to match the one the European Union introduced in May. The General Data Protection Regulation is considered to have some of the world's strictest online privacy rules. For now, if customers want to stop merchants from getting updated credit card information, they have to opt out through their banks — although it's unclear if that would have helped Acuña. ""I'm capable of putting in my information online if I need to. It's not a hassle for me, so I definitely would like the option,"" Acuña said She says from now on, she'll take the time to read through all the legalese on those lengthy card agreements, and make sure she opts out of anything that allows financial institutions to share her information with third parties.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

29,Lenard Monkman,2020-01-26T09:00:00.392Z,Lake research video translated into Ojibway to help promote language as well as science,"An environmental science video has been translated to Ojibway and the creators are hoping it sparks youth interest in science and language revitalization. ""We really believe that language is an essential part of culture and any way that we can help kind of promote local languages, the better,"" said Pauline Gerrard. Gerrard is the deputy director of the International Institute for Sustainable Developments Experimental Lakes Area and has been working with the organization since 2014. The Experimental Lakes Area is comprised of 58 lakes located in northwestern Ontario that are set aside for scientific research. For 50 years, researchers have been doing studies to understand the impacts that humans are having on freshwater systems. In 2017, IISD created a video about some of the work the organization does in researching the effects of mercury contamination on freshwater ecosystems, with versions in English and French. That video was recently translated into Ojibway. Gerrard said funds for the Ojibway translation came from the Canadian Heritage Fund. For Gerrard, working with First Nations people over the years has been a good eyeopener into Indigenous worldviews. ""On a personal level, I've really learned a lot about the importance of water to Anishinaabe culture and the kind of personal responsibility that Indigenous people take for water management and water protection,"" said Gerrard. The Experimental Lakes Area is in the heart of Treaty 3 and Ojibway territory. Because of the location, the IISD has built relationships with Ojibway communities in the area. The translations were done by Ojibway language speakers Nancy Jones, Don Jones and Jason Jones of Nigigoonsiminikaaning (Red Gut) First Nation. Jason Jones is an Ojibway language teacher at Fort Frances High School and has been teaching the language since 2005. Jason, who is related to elders Don and Nancy, said one of the coolest things about working on the video was coming up with new words in Anishinaabemowin/Ojibwaymowin for things like mercury and carbon dioxide. ""Our language has vitality, with the ability to create new words,"" said Jason Jones.  Jason Jones's duties included writing down the Ojibway translation for narrator Emma Bruyere to voice. Bruyere is a Grade 9 student of Jason Jones's and is from Couchiching First Nation. She has grown up hearing Ojibway and describes herself as a student of the language. ""I watched the [English] video a couple of times throughout before I did the job, to know what I was talking about and I found it actually really helpful,"" said Bruyere. ""I am really into environmental issues and things like that. And so learning about that really boosted my knowledge."" Bruyere said it makes her happy to know that there are efforts being made to preserve the Ojibway language and she wants to stay involved with language revitalization after high school. ""I want to be working with the language my entire life… I know that I want to work with the language and help other people learn because of how much it's dying out.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/ela-ojibway-mercuiry-lakes-video-1.5440308,[],N/A
30,Anonymous,2019-12-20T17:00:00.792Z,"I worked hard to raise a feminist daughter, but her racy online selfies make me feel I failed","This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage. For more information, please read our FAQ.   To some, ""feminist"" is a label that every empowered woman and progressive man should wear proudly. It is not controversial — it stands for the idea that every woman is a complete human being. Women are not less than men. Women deserve equal pay, equal say and equal rights in any society.  To others, ""feminist"" is a problematic term because of the biases and expectations that accompany it. Within the world of women, a feminist can be rejected as such for not following certain rules or can find herself scrutinized for failing the movement — because a feminist is expected to look a certain way, speak a certain way and live a certain way. Here are two conflicting views of what feminism means today, as told in this point-counterpoint by one Montreal mother and her teenage daughter.  I don't think expecting my daughter not to post sexed-up selfies amounts to 'slut-shaming': Jennifer Morrow Last summer, I stumbled onto my teenage daughter's social media account. What I found confirmed my worst fear: I had failed to raise a feminist.  There, among the pouty-faced selfies, was a photo of her posing, Sports Illustrated-style, on a jet ski in her bikini, brandishing her middle finger at the camera with a smirk on her face. My heart sank.  ""Who is this person?"" I asked myself. All her life, I've tried to model feminism: taking her on marches for women's rights, reading to her from books like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should all be Feminists and surrounding her with a community of strong, independent female friends.  I realize now that the wisdom of my mother's ""Women's Lib"" generation doesn't cover the challenges of raising a feminist daughter in the 21st century.  Indeed, most young women seem so put off by the identity politics that come with calling themselves feminists that they're rejecting the label altogether.  ""What's the big deal?"" Clara asked me when I confronted her about the offending photo. ""It's just a picture."" Where do I start?  As I write this, 14 beacons of light are shining in the night sky over Montreal, in memory of the women killed in the Polytechnique shooting.  They are stark reminders that our daughters are still vulnerable to violent men who will do whatever it takes to keep women silent and subservient.  Feminism seeks to create a new world where that isn't the reality they face.  My daughter believes a photo of herself sitting on a jet ski in her bikini represents girl power. But it actually just looks like the media has poisoned that message entirely and used it to perpetuate the status quo.  We want our girls to grow up brave, confident and assertive.  But they are drip-fed gender-conforming, sexualized images to the point where they think it's perfectly normal to strive to meet male-defined expectations of them — the more performative and sexy the better.  What is the point of these images? The question answers itself, and I find the porny subtext deeply disturbing.  Girls like my daughter can afford to be ambivalent about feminism. They live in a society that is relatively safe for girls, especially if they are privileged and white. As far as she is concerned, my pontificating about the need to fight gender stereotypes is just an old-fashioned demand to cover up her body — also known as slut-shaming. What is a mother to do? Ever since I first held her in my arms, all I wanted was for her to be happy and safe. This thing called feminism is a complicated gift.  One day, when she's out of the house and I can't hold her daily, I hope she will unwrap this complicated gift and find what she needs inside — the tools to navigate an even more complicated world while staying true to herself. 'Would a boy be punished for looking too sexy?' asks Clara Morrow-Coffrant When my mother confronted me with the pictures on my Instagram, I thought ""What's the issue? It's not that big a deal.""  I told her that everyone posts photos like this. Also, it's not like this is anything new to our society. For example, Barbie is a hypersexualized children's toy that is given to girls as a sort of role model. Yes, she now comes in more shapes and colours, but we still think of her as having a perfect body and perfect blond hair. My mother thinks I'm too young to be putting this sort of image online, but I am not ashamed of it. What I, as a young woman of 15, post on social media doesn't define me. It is not the whole of who I am.  Am I a feminist? I don't know. The fact is that feminism today is much too difficult to define because everybody has a different perspective on what it means.  Of course, I believe in equality, but you are putting all the burden on me to police my self-expression in the interest of feminism — something I don't completely understand and can't get a real definition of.  Would a boy sitting on a jet ski be punished for looking too sexy?  Anyway, statistics show that my personal safety doesn't depend on what I wear. I also think that people are much too quick to judge a girl based on how she looks. You can judge me if you want to, I really don't care. My posts are for me and my friends. They are meant to be funny and ironic. It's not that deep. It's not political.  Instagram is just for fun. I'm still young, and I am allowed to make a few mistakes as I figure out who I want to be. This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage.

Erin Norwood, Atlantic Canada's manager of government relations for the Insurance Bureau of Canada, said while companies don't condone driving when it is prohibited by a municipality, it doesn't necessarily violate your policy. ""Driving during a state of emergency in and of itself would not typically invalidate auto insurance coverage,"" she said. Amanda Dean, vice-president of IBC Atlantic, said other considerations still apply, such as who is at fault and whether your vehicle was in a fit condition to drive. The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary has ticketed drivers during the state of emergency for driving with windshields covered in ice and snow. Dean said it's essential to prove you took every safety precaution, including clearing snow from your vehicle. Some people have run into trouble while starting their vehicles when the engine block is covered in snow. One person posted on Facebook about a family member's vehicle catching fire because it wasn't cleaned out under the hood. With the city digging out and people assessing their properties, Norwood said it's important to let your insurance company know as soon as possible. While insurance adjusters are not included in the professions exempt from the state of emergency, she said now is a good time for policy holders to gather photos and find old receipts. Some houses suffered damage to shingles and siding during the hurricane-force winds last Friday. Others had leaks from snow blowing into attics and melting down through the ceiling. Dean said people should check their insurance policy to see if it covers alternate accommodations, so they can stay in hotels, motels or with relatives before their homes can be repaired.

34,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-21T19:56:05.924Z,"'If there's a fire, I'm dead': Quadruple amputee battles condo board for access to her own building","Verna Marzo says she'll never forget the embarrassment of being stuck outside her Calgary condo building — in the cold for almost two hours, waiting for someone to let her in — because as a quadruple amputee she can't open the doors on her own, and her condo board has refused to install automatic doors she can use. ""Someone helped me [get] out, but when I wanted to go back in, there was no one to open the door,"" said Marzo, 46.  ""It was cold. I called my sister but my sister was at work … so I waited until my caregiver arrived."" She says none of the other doors in the building is an option. ""That means I get stuck behind the doors. If there's an emergency … if there's a fire, I'm dead, there's no way I can get outside."" According to an advocate for people with disabilities, situations like Marzo's are ""all too common,"" because weak building codes and a lack of provincial accessibility laws are causing a ""chronic and pervasive shortage"" of accessible housing. ""Imagine that you're in a building where you paid good money to live … and you can't get in or out without having someone there,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. ""Imagine you go to sleep at night knowing — God forbid — if there's a fire, you can't let yourself out. No one would want to live that way and people with disabilities shouldn't have to live that way."" Two years ago, after having emergency abdominal surgery, Marzo contracted sepsis — a reaction to a severe blood infection that leads to organs shutting down. Doctors amputated both legs and arms to save her life. Earlier this year, she started shopping for a condo that would allow her to get around with her wheelchair or prosthetics. She says she knew the place she bought wasn't perfect, but it was one of the few she could afford. She hoped to deal with issues as they came up, but never expected to be fighting for a door.  In May, a few months after she was locked outside in the cold, she asked the building manager if automatic doors could be installed. She was told the condo board decided not at this time. Marzo's social worker tried again, contacting the board on her behalf. She was told the board already had a plan for new doors but there would be no automatic push-button system due to security concerns of the doors being open too long. That explanation is ""a total red herring,"" according to Lepofsky. ""You could design doors with optical sensors to protect against that. But even a manual door, with a lock, there's no guarantee that requires it to be held open only long enough for the person with the key to get through."" Meanwhile, Marzo remains homebound and frustrated. ""I don't want to only benefit me. I want people who have lesser mobility to benefit as well. Because it's not easy to just be staying at home and be depressed,"" she said. The property management company declined to answer Go Public's questions, claiming it was a legal matter and referring us to the condo board. Go Public made repeated requests to board members for comment; all went unanswered. Automatic doors would cost between $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the design, according to Sean Crump from Universal Access, a Calgary company that provides advice to businesses on how to make buildings more accessible. Crump says there is public funding available to qualified candidates to help pay for building modifications, though it's not clear if Marzo's building qualifies.  ""There are a few resources. The federal government has an Enabling Access Fund that allows funds to be put into accessible design for spaces and buildings — and it's done a lot of good.""  More than three million people over the age of 15 have at least one physical disability according to the most recent Statistics Canada numbers from 2017. On July 11, the Accessible Canada Act came into force. Lepofsky says it's a well intentioned effort at mandating barrier-free access, but it, too, falls short by covering only sectors within Ottawa's jurisdiction like banking, telecommunications and the federal government. He says that leaves a mish-mash of accessibility laws — or none at all — at the provincial level. Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are the only provinces with that kind of legislation. ""We need the seven provinces in Canada that don't have a provincial accessibility law to enact one — to get with the program,"" Lepofsky said. But even in those provinces, Marzo would have little or no recourse. Manitoba and Nova Scotia's legislation don't address the responsibilities of condo boards. Ontario's does, but since it was implemented in 2005, it's done little to help people with disabilities, according to a review released in January by former lieutenant governor David Onley. ""We are almost 14 years later,"" Onley, who was Canada's first lieutenant governor with a physical disability, wrote, ""and the promised accessible Ontario is nowhere in sight."" ""For most disabled persons, Ontario is not a place of opportunity but one of countless, dispiriting, soul-crushing barriers."" Changing the building codes could also help, according to Lepofsky. But, though national and provincial codes cover new buildings and major renovations, older buildings like Marzo's are under no obligation to renovate. All of this, Lepofsky says, leaves people with disabilities to deal with problems ""one battle at a time"" through human rights complaints. The national and provincial human rights codes say buildings used by the public need to be accessible.  Marzo says everywhere she turned no one could — or would — help. She says her call to the Alberta Human Rights Commission wasn't returned and the City of Calgary told her there is nothing it can do. ""They just keep [telling me] call this person or this person and eventually someone from City of Calgary called me and said they cannot force the condo board to put the door in because it's not the law."" Go Public took Marzo's situation to provincial and federal lawmakers. Watch: Verna Marzo says she's determined not to let any barriers stand in her way Jennifer Dagsvik, spokesperson for Alberta's Ministry of Community and Social Service, says the province is ""monitoring"" the new federal and existing provincial laws.  She says while Alberta lacks an accessibility law, people with disabilities can seek help under the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Ottawa's most recent minister of public services and procurement and accessibility didn't answer Go Public's questions directly. Instead Carla Qualtrough sent a general statement, referring to the Accessible Canada Act and the accessibility review board — the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO) — it created.  ""While CASDO is still in its early stages of development, it has been made evident by Canadians and members of the disability community that standards in new and existing buildings is a priority,"" Qualtrough said.  Marzo says she won't give up, saying it's ""hideous"" she's had to fight this hard to be able to enter and exit the building she lives in.  She's planning to talk to a lawyer for advice on what to do next. ""They will get old too,"" she says, referring to members of her condo board. ""And they will lose their strength. And they will thank me for that door if they will do it now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/go-public-disabled-automatic-door-1.5313633,[],N/A

""For us in health care if we can keep people safe during the worst of the blizzard then we can figure out how to catch up,"" CEO David Diamond told CBC on Thursday. ""And that's been the work this week."" Eastern Health made the call Jan. 16, the day before the storm, to close community service offices, but Diamond said he learned pretty quickly last Friday morning as snow began to build that it would be worse than anticipated.  With the city declaring a state of emergency, visitors to the hospital and discharged patients became trapped in the hospital, too. Diamond, himself, stayed three nights in his office at the Health Sciences Centre.  ""I've been in this business about 30 years now and and have been through a number of crisis situations and this is probably as complex as it's been in the 30 years I've been doing this,"" Diamond said.  ""We had to make sure we had the right people in the right skills."" Diamond said they had a few scenarios in which employees leaving or coming to work couldn't be contacted. Posts on social media showed nurses and doctors going to great lengths to make it to work, including by showshoe and snowmobile. ""We put in place some mechanisms to make sure that anybody who was outside, we had a connection with them and we could know that they were safe so we're trying to keep our staff safe as well."" There were 19 babies born at the Health Sciences Centre from midnight Friday to midnight Monday, keeping staff busy with storm newborns. Despite the irregularity of such weather, Diamond said, he can't pinpoint one thing that failed during the trying state of emergency. However, everything will go under the microscope during a debriefing in the weeks to come.  Health Minister John Haggie was watching the aftermath from his district in Gander. Central Health also encountered some issues, like when the power went out at the hospital on Fogo Island. ""It was a challenge for the rigs (ambulances) to get to the street and it was a real challenge for the paramedics to get to the street to the house,"" Haggie said Friday. Transportation will be one of the challenges discussed at the upcoming debriefing.  ""It's not often I'm short of words but really and honestly I can't find enough superlatives to describe how the health-care staff in Eastern Health managed and coped throughout the course of that weekend."" If photos tell the story, it appears as though people working in the health-care system made it work by leaning on one another. That's something they will have to keep doing as appointments get rescheduled and hospitals come back to life. Extra shifts will be added, Diamond said, adding he's confident that by next Friday the system will be like it was before the storm.  ""It's quite amazing when I think of where we started last Friday.""

39,Anonymous,2020-01-25T17:26:06.910Z,Iraqi security forces raid protest camps after populist cleric withdraws support for demonstrators,"Security forces set fire to anti-government protest tents in the southern Iraq early Saturday and re-opened key public squares in Baghdad that had been occupied by demonstrators for months. The crackdown came hours after a powerful Shia cleric dealt the protest movement a blow by withdrawing his support, prompting his followers to pack up and leave the demonstration encampments. One protester was killed and 44 wounded when security forces fired tear gas and live rounds to disperse them from nearby Baghdad's Khilani Square, as clearance operations were underway, medical and security officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Near the square, demonstrators gathered around a torched tuk tuk, auto-rickhaw taxis that became the most potent symbol of the anti-government demonstration, which security forces had set ablaze. Activists said the presence of Muqtada al-Sadr's followers and his militia group had shielded the protesters from security forces and unknown groups looking to harm and suppress them. With that cover gone, many in the four-month-old movement feared the worst. His decision to withdraw support came just hours after tens of thousands of his followers staged a separate anti-U.S. rally in a nearby Baghdad neighbourhood, which most anti-government demonstrators steered clear of. The succession of events amid an ongoing political tug-of-war over naming the next prime minister sent a clear message to Iraqi officials: The Iraqi street was al-Sadr's domain. It also comes as Iraq is embroiled in ongoing U.S.-Iran tensions that reached fever pitch when an American drone strike killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani outside Baghdad's airport. ""He is reclaiming the mantle of populist leader with a popular base able to mobilize large crowds,"" said Fanar Haddad, senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute, National University of Singapore. In Tahrir Square, the hub of the anti-government protest movement in Baghdad, protesters said they were fearful of what would come next. ""We are all alone now,"" said Mustafa, 24, who asked that his full name not be used fearing reprisals. The demonstrations have been critical of government corruption, high unemployment and Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. Crackdowns by security forces have killed at least 500 protesters. In a tweet Friday evening, al-Sadr indicated his ""disappointment"" toward anti-government protesters in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the anti-government protests. ""I am expressing my disappointment and my regret toward all those who doubted me among the Tahrir Square protesters,"" said the tweet. ""I thought they were supporters of me and of Iraq."" He also accused protesters of being ""foreign paid tools."" A spokesperson for al-Sadr said his supporters withdrew from Basra because protesters had insulted those participating in the anti-U.S. rally and even obstructed access to the rally point. ""The Sadrist movement's position toward the demonstrations will be neutral, not with them or against them,"" said Sheikh Salah al-Obaidi. At around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, riot police set fire to a protest encampment in a central square in the oil-rich southern city of Basra, two activists said. The crackdown came after al-Sadr's followers had packed up their tents and left. ""The protest square is now controlled (by the security forces), after they used force,"" said Basra activist Nakeeb Lueibi. ""This is considered a betrayal by the al-Sadr bloc. ... There will be no peace after what has happened in Basra last night."" In Baghdad, key squares and roads that had previously been a focal point of protest violence were re-opened for vehicle access, according to a statement from the Baghdad Operations Command. Protesters feared the entry of security forces to Tahrir. At least eight tents occupied by al-Sadr's supporters were removed, said two activists. ""(Al-Sadr's statement) gave the green light for the government to suppress the demonstrations,"" said Husanien Ali, a 35-year-old protester. Others said they would remain resilient. ""We called for more people to join us in Tahrir,"" said Noor, a protester who only gave her last name fearing reprisal. ""We are rebuilding the tents."" The unrest following al-Sadr's decision to pull back his followers on Friday along with the calm of the anti-U.S. rally the previous day underscored the cleric's ability to manipulate the street during a critical time in Iraqi politics, analysts said. Political blocs have yet to agree on a consensus candidate to replace outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi, who resigned in December amid pressure from protests. ""For him it's about political capital and relevance,"" said Sajad Jiyad, managing director of the Bayan Center, a Baghdad-based think tank. Al-Sadr, who's Sairoon party won the largest number of seats in the May 2018 federal election, has rejected every proposed candidate put forward by rival bloc Fatah, headed by Hadi al-Ameri. His show of force on the street is one way to ensure the next premier brings a pro-Sadrist agenda to government, analysts said. ""Al-Sadr has shown the he can bring large numbers to the street, by asking his supporters to withdraw yesterday nigh is showing that he is the force behind the protests, and can put an end to them if necessary,"" said Jiyad. In Baghdad, the vital Mohammed al-Qasim highway, Tayaran Square and al-Nidhal Street were all reopened. Ahrar Bridge, which had been partly occupied by protesters in a stand-off with security forces, was also reopened, according to Baghdad Operations Command. Concrete blocs has also been removed to re-open al-Khilani Square. Protesters continued to occupy the Jumhuriya and Sinak bridges, which lead to the heavily fortified Green Zone.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-protest-crackdown-1.5440631,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-baghdad-deadly-protests-1.5387275 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-protests-anti-government-1.5371566 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iraq-anti-us-demonstrations-baghdad-1.5438812 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/baghdad-airport-missiles-1.5413594,N/A
40,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-24T23:51:00.154Z,Defence-witness pharmacology expert testifies Jason McKay had alcohol-induced amnesia,"A pharmacology expert testified Friday that he believes Jason McKay suffered from alcohol induced amnesia, but noted he was forming some of his opinion based on what McKay said. McKay is on trial at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench, accused of fatally stabbing his wife Jenny in 2017. He pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Steven Richardson, a pharmacology expert, was called to testify as an expert by the defence.  Richardson said McKay was unable to appreciate the consequences of his actions when he allegedly stabbed Jenny because of alcohol-induced amnesia — sometimes called blackouts. Richardson suggested a combination of Sertraline (an antidepressant) and alcohol led to this state. McKay testified Thursday that he took antidepressants daily and that he drank four cans of Twisted Tea and some red wine on Sept. 5, 2017. McKay said that after his first sip of red wine he began to experience multiple blackouts. He said he remembered stabbing his wife twice with ""a dagger"" after hearing voices, although no ""dagger"" was recovered from the crime scene.   Richardson said there are no scientific studies on how Sertraline might act affect the blood alcohol level, but he was confident there would be some sort of interaction.  ""If someone's in an amnesia period, they would have no judgment,"" Richardson maintained under cross examination on Friday. He said that's because brain cells responsible for creating long-term memories are also involved in judgment. Richardson said people are still capable of thoughts, ideas and plans in an alcohol-induced amnesia state, but plans would be carried out without an ""appropriateness filter.""  When asked by the Crown to point the court to the scientific evidence to back that up, Richardson he couldn't. He said his opinion was based on an understanding of brain functioning.  McKay testified his blackouts extended to his time with police after his arrest. He said he couldn't remember police interviews on the eve of Sept. 6, or the next morning.   Richardson said it's possible McKay was still suffering from alcohol-induced amnesia during the evening — about 13.5 hours from the time McKay was arrested. He admitted he had been assuming that McKay continued to drink wine. ""Are you just assuming things that tend to favour Mr. McKay's recollections?"" asked Breker.  ""I do not know scientifically whether he was suffering,"" Richardson said, adding he was relying on McKay's behaviour after he was told Jenny was dead by a police officer, which he felt was consistent with someone who could not remember.  ""I have to take his word for it.""  However, Richardson did say he didn't think McKay would still be suffering from the amnesia on the morning of Sept. 7, 2019  — an interview McKay said he cannot remember.  Richardson said there is not yet scientifically acceptable means to assess if alcohol induced amnesia has occurred, so the only way to know is to talk to someone and ultimately trust their account. Closing arguments are expected to take place on Monday afternoon.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/pharmacology-expert-jason-mckay-defence-1.5440296,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-testifies-second-degree-murder-trial-1.5438479 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-murder-trial-voir-dire-1.5436612,N/A
41,Matt D'Amours,2020-01-24T17:37:32.612Z,Evictions on the rise as Montreal's vacancy rate hits 15-year low ,"Housing advocates say parts of Montreal are seeing a spike in eviction letters and repossession notices for rental units. With the city's vacancy rate at a 15-year low, that's raising concerns for moving day. ""We are worried about the situation for the first of July,"" said Maxime Roy-Allard, spokesperson for Quebec's coalition of housing committees. ""All those people who are being evicted right now will have a really hard time finding a new place."" Quebec law allows landlords to evict tenants in order to subdivide, substantially enlarge or change the use of a dwelling. Units can also be repossessed by owners for family use. The housing coalition says tenants in central Montreal neighbourhoods are being hit hardest, including the Plateau, Villeray and La Petite-Patrie. Last moving day, 94 households in Montreal hadn't found a new place to live, and dozens had to be temporarily housed by the city. ""If the Quebec government doesn't act quickly and give Montreal resources to help to solve the crisis, we might face the same situation, or even worse, this year,"" Roy-Allard said. At the Petite Patrie Housing Committee, staff say that last year, a few people would come into the office or call per day to ask for help with an eviction or repossession case. This year, there are about 10 each day. Community organizer Martin Blanchard says the situation hasn't been this bad in 20 years. ""We have never seen these numbers before,"" he said. ""We're under a lot of stress right now."" The committee has a stack of roughly 200 cases, including one belonging to Michelle Tompkins. She says her family is facing a repossession of their La Petite-Patrie apartment, so her landlord's son can live there. But Tompkins has doubts that will end up happening. ""Will the son be there three months from now? Or will he have gotten a job in Ottawa, and the rent's gone up, and so some other tenants move in?"" Tompkins and her husband want to fight the repossession, but they're also looking at other apartments. She says many units in the area are out of their price range, and with a three-year-old son, the family is on edge. ""I try to just put it aside when my kid comes home,"" Tompkins said. ""But when he goes to bed, it's hard to sleep at night, because you're wondering where you're going to live. You're crying, you're stressed — you don't know what to do."" Housing committees in the Plateau-Mont-Royal and Ville-Marie boroughs told CBC News they're also seeing more eviction and repossession cases than normal. Last week, it was announced that Montreal's vacancy rate dropped from 1.9 per cent in 2018 to 1.5 per cent in 2019. Coupled with the influx of evictions and repossessions, housing advocates say this could spell disaster on moving day. ""[It] looks like a season where there will be hundreds of tenants that will have no lease — no apartments,"" said Blanchard. ""There will be many tenants who will have to move out of town, or at the periphery of town."" Montreal's executive committee member in charge of housing, Robert Beaudry, says the city is doing what it can to help. He says funding has been doubled for the city's municipal housing office, which helps people find apartments, and more social housing is on the way. Montreal will also have temporary housing at the ready on moving day. But with July 1 on the horizon, Beaudry says the city needs more funding to invest in housing. ""Municipal is there for the situation, but we need provincial and federal,"" said Beaudry. ""If nothing is done from other levels of government, it's going to be an emergency."" Amid what it calls a housing crisis, Quebec's coalition of housing committees is calling on the province to prohibit evictions for subdivisions, enlargements or changes in use. It also wants a moratorium on repossessions in areas where the vacancy rate is below three per cent.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/rosemont-petite-patrie-montreal-housing-vacancy-evictions-reposessions-1.5438084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-real-estate-2020-forecast-renters-buyers-1.5422868,N/A

That's the question that Iranian-Canadian visual artist Anahita Norouzi is asking as part of a new photo project. She's inviting immigrants and refugees in Montreal to share their stories of migration with her, and highlight the objects they brought to Canada that remind them of home. ""Storytelling, for me, is a way to nurture a sense of home for a displaced person,"" she told CBC Montreal's All in a Weekend. After putting out a call for participants, Norouzi received responses from people who came from Algeria, Jordan, Syria and Afghanistan, among others. One woman from Tunisia brought a large wooden key — 50 centimetres long. ""That belongs to her grandfather's home, which doesn't exist anymore,"" Norouzi said. Another man from Algeria told Norouzi that he brought a suitcase with him two years ago, and has never opened it.  She said the two plan to open it together at his home and record his reaction. ""There is definitely a very personal dimension to these objects,"" she said. Along with photos and letters, many people brought spices and other ingredients for recipes passed down through generations. ""It's incredible,"" she said. ""What you bring from home — it tastes differently. I think it's more psychological than real."" In her project, Norouzi hopes to weave together audio recordings and photographs documenting her subjects' attachment to the objects they've carried to their new homes. ""It's a way of gathering their voices and making them heard,"" she said. Norouzi came to Montreal to study fine arts at Concordia University, and has remained on and off for the last 10 years. With her time split between Tehran and Montreal, she brings an old Russian lamp back and forth with her. ""That's where the idea came from,"" she said. ""I guess what that lamp incarnated for me was the idea of home."" Norouzi is planning to exhibit her project in 2021.

In punishing Howard Wu earlier this month, the discipline committee of Ontario's medical regulator noted the doctor had a history of problems that included previous findings of professional misconduct. ""(Dr. Wu) failed to maintain the standard of practice with multiple patients in varying situations,"" the committee found in ordering his licence revoked. ""He has demonstrated serious clinical deficiencies that put his patients at risk."" Wu, 50, who studied medicine at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, practised in Markham, Ont. According to disciplinary records from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, a mother took her feverish newborn to see him in November 2015. Instead of recommending an immediate hospital visit, the doctor sent them home with instructions to give the baby water and vitamin C-rich juice. He gave the same advice two days later when the infant's condition did not improve. The baby died within days. A college investigator stopped short of blaming Wu directly for the death but said he did not give the child the needed care. The committee also reviewed complaints from an insurance company that Wu was prescribing an inordinate number of medical devices such as braces. Evidence was that the supplier next door paid him $100 a year for each patient he referred. Wu had previously denied any financial interest in the sale of devices sold by the supplier. In addition, the committee found that Wu had done hundreds of eye exams despite having little competency. He was unable to describe the basic steps needed for such exams or the equipment used, according to the committee. Records also indicate Wu was convicted of dangerous driving in 2015 and driving while disqualified in January 2017. However, evidence was that he lied to the college on several occasions when he denied having faced any charges. Despite admitting some allegations and pleading no contest to others, Wu argued he should be allowed to return to a period of supervised practice after a 15-month licence suspension. He admitted not having the knowledge to recognize that a baby with fever could be much sicker than appeared. He also said he no longer performed eye examinations. Overall, he promised to do better but the committee was having none of it. In considering appropriate punishment, the panel noted Wu had been suspended for misconduct in 2009 and again in 2013, and had been through several periods of supervision. The committee also found Wu had been less than truthful on multiple occasions. ""These omissions and misrepresentations extend beyond simple poor judgment and reflect a propensity to mislead the college, which causes the committee significant concern with respect to Dr. Wu's governability,"" the committee said. Ultimately, the panel ordered immediate revocation of Wu's licence along with a reprimand. He must also pay $31,110 in costs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doctor-loses-licence-1.5436400,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,N/A
45,Graham Thomson,2019-12-30T13:00:00.731Z,OPINION | 'You ain't seen nothing yet': A look at what's ahead in Alberta politics,"Psychics, astrologers and other impeccable internet sources tell us 2020 promises to be an interesting year in which, ""animals tell us what they think,"" the world ""becomes one country,"" and Trump speaks ""only nonsense."" I suppose only two of those are actually predictions while the other one is a sad statement of fact. Making predictions is always a mug's game. And considering how much politics has changed in Alberta the past year, only a fool would attempt to predict what's going to happen in 2020. So, let me try. The year 2020 might look like a new year on paper but in many ways it's going to feel mighty old mighty quick. At least when it comes to Alberta politics. Many of the big issues from the past year will continue to dominate the new. Let's look at a few. Yes, it didn't take a crystal ball to figure this one out. Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives won the election on a promise of a strong economy and more jobs. It didn't work out that way and the NDP has been gleefully rubbing it in Kenney's face every chance they get. And they'll keep it up in 2020 as the UCP government tries to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Economists predict ""modest growth"" in the province's economy for the new year. Kenney will need to do better than that if he hopes to mute the critics — and claim ""promise made, promise kept"" in 2020. If there's one issue that has defined Alberta politics, this is it. Getting a new energy pipeline to tidewater has become an overwrought symbol of Alberta's dreams and frustrations — the dream of another energy boom and the frustration at failing to get a new pipeline built. In fact, a new pipeline will not solve our fiscal problems that are actually caused by a depressed price of oil and a world moving away from fossil fuels. And delays in getting a new pipeline built are not the fault of the federal Liberal government, as Premier Jason Kenney likes to suggest, but the courts. And the courts have delayed projects because of genuine complaints from First Nations. Work has started on twinning the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that work will continue through 2020 (and for two years after that) but the project will still face opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups. This will be a win-win for Kenney. If construction continues on TMX, he can point to it as a ""victory"" for his government; if it doesn't, he can blame the federal Liberals and ""foreign-funded"" environmental organizations for continuing to undermine Alberta's struggling economy. Speaking of blaming others for Alberta's ills, 2020 will see the UCP government maintain its pugilistic approach to issues via its Fight Back Strategy that includes the ""war room"" — officially, the Canadian Energy Centre — the public inquiry into the government's foreign-funded conspiracy theory, and the ""fair deal"" panel that is looking into whether Alberta should have, for example, its own police force and pension plan. Alberta energy 'war room' discovers its logo was lifted from American software company These are all tactics designed to keep Alberta on a war footing and keep Albertans angry, frustrated and easily manipulated by a government that equates legitimate opposition with sedition. The past year ended with some frustrated public sector workers musing about a general strike. That strike never happened and perhaps it never will. But we might see strikes by individual public sector unions in 2020. They are upset by a government that is pressing workers to take wage cuts. The government has made it clear if the unions win wage hikes, they can expect job cuts. Perhaps the government was peering into its own crystal ball this fall when it passed a piece of legislation giving it the right to hire replacement workers in the event of a public sector strike. In 2019, the UCP government commissioned a long list of panels and committees to review everything from the $20-billion Alberta Health Services, to car insurance rates, to safe consumption sites. The granddaddy of them all was the blue ribbon panel that issued a report that formed the basis for the government's cost-cutting budget that rolled out in October. Alberta's 'fair deal' panel begins feedback tour with Edmonton town hall Those panels — with members and mandates carefully chosen by the government — will continue to influence government policy throughout 2020. That includes Budget 2020 coming in late February, which will actually be the first true UCP budget. The 2019 budget, introduced in an election year, was an amalgam of UCP policies and leftovers from the previous NDP budget. There won't be an election in 2020 but you're going to feel like you're trapped in a nasty election campaign anyway. The animosity between the UCP government and NDP opposition isn't just political, it's personal. Kenney has gone to great lengths to dismantle the former NDP government's legacy and the NDP sees Kenney as a right-wing bully. The mutual antagonism will continue as Kenney has already promised even more sweeping legislation in the spring session. Kenney's popularity took a substantial hit late in 2019, according to several public opinion polls, because of a sputtering economy and cuts to government services. But it appears he doesn't plan to stop or change direction. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he told cheering UCP members at their convention a few weeks ago. ""We're just getting started."" In one of the few times NDP leader Rachel Notley agreed with Kenney in 2019, she told a year-end interview she doesn't think Kenney is about to ease up on the gas pedal in 2020: ""There's nothing that makes me believe that they're going to change course and I think they're going to push harder.""

Parasite, the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26-year-history of the SAG awards. Parasite lead actor Song Kang Ho said winning on Sunday made him think that ""maybe we haven't created such a bad movie. ""I am so honoured to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,"" he said through an interpreter. Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which both have A-list stars. The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors  form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in Joker has swept awards season. ""I am standing on the shoulders of my favourite actor — Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor  who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the  comic book villain. Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role  as a charming stunt man in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama Marriage Story. ""It was a difficult part,"" quipped Pitt of his role. ""A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,"" he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob. Sexual harassment drama Bombshell went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed. Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangster movie The Irishman had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on  Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG. Those left out include immersive World War One film 1917,  the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as  well as Joker, Marriage Story, and novel adaptation Little  Women. De Niro, whose lead performance in The Irishman has been  snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech  to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump. In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her  role as a TV anchor in The Morning Show, bringing the second  award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming  service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week. Comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and British royal drama The Crown took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But Mrs Maisel actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should  have gone to quirky British comedy Fleabag. Moments earlier, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a  year of multiple awards for her and the show.

He categorized the meeting as an ""information exchange"" and said Dias did not ask him to get involved in the matter. ""[It was] a very productive conversation, an interesting conversation,"" Fougere said of the meeting.  Fougere said he spent the time expressing concern about public safety and access to the refinery in the event of an emergency. He also said he encouraged Dias to get back to the bargaining table with Co-op and resolve the dispute quickly.  The mayor said Dias told him he understands the only way the dispute can be settled is through collective bargaining but didn't offer any information as to when the parties would resume talks.  Fougere said the city is not a party in the dispute, but noted the city is affected by it. He said as mayor he's ""staying away"" from the dispute and not choosing sides. He said he also expressed his concerns about public safety and desire to see both sides of the dispute return to the bargaining table as quickly as possible.  Fougere said he can't think of any similar labour disputes that have happened in his political career. ""This is much more intense than I thought it would be.""  Regina Police Service chief Evan Bray said the blockades set up by Unifor members are illegal in a video statement released on Twitter on Friday evening.  ""[An investigation is] something that we've been working on,"" Bray said.  He said the police service wouldn't be using tactics that could escalate the situation further like the arrest of Unifor's national president and a handful of members earlier this week. He said more ""investigative"" measures would be taken instead. Safety is on the top of Bray's mind, too. ""In the last 24 hours, we've had conversations with Unifor and conversations with refinery management and both sides have agreed that it is very important we keep community safety in the front of our minds.""  Bray said because of that, there needs to be uninhibited access through at least one of the gates into the refinery facility.  That was granted as of Friday morning according to Bray, who said one gate was dedicated to emergency access only. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/regina-mayor-police-chief-public-safety-1.5440425,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/timeline-of-co-op-refinery-lockout-1.5436080 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/coop-strike-lockout-1.5385638 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-co-op-refinery-lockout-1.5418113,N/A
49,Anonymous,2020-01-25T19:00:00.850Z,"Kind, 'caring' researcher killed on Flight PS752 was visiting his wife for 1st anniversary","This is part of a series on the B.C. victims of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which was downed near Tehran, Iran, on Jan. 8, 2020, killing all 176 people on board. A postdoctoral fellow from the University of British Columbia (UBC) killed when a Ukrainian jetliner was shot down in Iran Jan. 8 is being remembered as a kind, ""pure soul"" who wanted to spend his life researching better, more sustainable ways to clean wastewater for communities. Mehran Abtahi was one of 176 people on board Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 when the plane was downed by an Iranian missile after taking off in Tehran on Jan. 8. The Canadian government has said 138 of the passengers on board were bound for Canada. The crash was a national tragedy. ""I wish he could see the whole nation is mourning for him; I want him to know that we all remember him and love him,"" said Abtahi's brother, Arman. ""He wasn't just my brother. He was my best friend. He had a good soul; a pure person. He was always there for me, no matter what the situation was."" Many of those onboard the flight were academics returning to Canada after spending the winter holiday break visiting relatives in Iran. Mehran was one of them. He had been with his wife to celebrate their first wedding anniversary in December. The newlyweds had been in a long-distance marriage since October, when Mehran moved to Vancouver to join UBC as a post-doctoral research fellow. His wife stayed behind for her job as a pathologist and university faculty member. In the caption of one Facebook photo, Mehran called her his ""everything."" ""He fell in love,"" Arman said. Arman said Mehran, 37, was an environmental civil engineer, who studied at Tehran University before completing his PhD at the MESA+ Institute at the University of Twente in the Netherlands in 2018. He was interested in wastewater treatment. His PhD thesis was centred on lowering the amount of micropollutants released from municipal wastewater treatment plants. An online profile published to mark Mehran's graduation in 2018 said he published findings from his university research in scientific journals and had presented his work around the world in places such as Singapore, Vienna and San Francisco. In a statement, UBC said Abtahi was a post-doctoral research fellow in the department of civil engineering. Postdoctoral fellows are researchers at UBC who are in training and want to study their particular area of research further, under the supervision of a faculty member.  His brother said he wanted to be a researcher and faculty professor at home in Iran, like his wife. Arman, who moved to B.C. first for his own studies, said he had a hand in convincing his brother to choose Vancouver. ""I was always telling him how beautiful Canada is.... Here in Vancouver, we were back together,"" Arman said. ""We spent a lot of good time here."" The brothers' mother also joined them in Vancouver. They travelled around the South Coast when they could, visiting places such as Victoria, Squamish and Whistler. Arman was supposed to welcome Mehran at the airport when he landed back in Vancouver. ""I was going to YVR airport to pick him up. Instead, I went there to fly back to Iran for his funeral ceremony."" Iran has admitted it ""mistakenly"" shot down the jet hours after Iran's forces fired missiles at Iraqi bases where U.S. troops were stationed. The attack was in retaliation for the U.S. killing a high-ranking Iranian military general.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mehran-abtahi-ubc-iran-plane-crash-1.5426532,https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/iran-plane-crash-bc-victims-1.5418946,N/A
50,Elizabeth Chiu,2020-01-24T10:00:00.099Z,'Good for your soul': Basketball coach uses comedy to help families heal,"When Colter Simmonds, 41, walks into Dartmouth High, it's not long before teens come up with smiles of surprise and warm hugs. It's the same reception at other schools around Halifax. For the last 20 years, the North Preston, N.S., native — nicknamed C.C., short for Coach Colter — has been earning respect and receiving affection as a mentor to hundreds of children in both sports and school. His coaching in basketball and life is aimed at keeping them off the streets where beefs are sometimes settled with guns, leaving lives violently cut short, and others locked up. What those teens might not realize is those realities were ""close calls"" Simmonds himself escaped. ""For me to be here, I think I'm an example that you can change and do better,"" he said during an interview last week at the North Preston Community Centre. In recent days he's been visiting with school principals, church pastors and bereaved parents — his special guests at Laugh Out Violence, the fundraiser he's organized Feb. 22 at Casino Nova Scotia, during African Heritage Month. Simmonds's goal is a sold-out evening to raise funds for We Will Win Youth Association, the non-profit organization he started in 1999 to help children pursue their dreams on the court, in the classroom or in the community. Comedy, he said, is ""healing, it takes your mind off things, it's good for your soul."" Leaders in the black community carry an added emotional burden, he said. They may know both sides in a dispute that's turned deadly — a situation he's found himself in after mentoring so many kids.  Karen Hudson, principal at Auburn Drive High School, said that's almost inevitable in a small province with many large, extended African-Nova Scotian families. ""You've got to show compassion and show them that you care. And as a black female, you never take off that skin, so you have to let them know that some of the individuals that are within the community, they may affect you too,"" she said. The night of comedy is no joke for Simmonds. He's spent nearly $8,000 of his own money to book the room and the headliners — Mark Walker, from Truro, N.S., and Cedric Newman and Chris Quigley, both from the Toronto area.  The event has no corporate sponsors, although the casino is offering the showroom at a reduced rate. We Will Win Youth Association has taken kids to tournaments around North America, and helped develop NCAA wing Daneesha Provo and NBA G-League guard Lindell Wigginton. Simmonds spent his teens in Toronto where he was an all-star point guard with enough talent to make it to the NCAA or Canadian university basketball, he said. But some ""influences"" tried to pull him in the other direction, and ultimately his attitude blocked him from reaching college ball. Even when he didn't believe in himself, his supporters never gave up on him, telling him, ""You can do better."" That message eventually sunk in, and stayed with him as he became a father at 21, a baptized Christian, a college graduate and now a youth programming co-ordinator. His belief that ""the more you do for others, the more God is going to bless you"" guides him as he pays it forward with the fundraiser.  Simmonds estimates he's known 40 people who've died violently or gone to prison because of it. It drives him to keep connecting with young people, especially those at risk, to show them that turning away from violence creates another path. ""You do what you're exposed to,"" he said. ""If you're exposed to negativity, then that's what you're going to get. If you're exposed to positivity, then there's the likelihood of living a positive life."" He hopes bereaved parents of children he's mentored will attend the evening of entertainment to know ""their child hasn't been forgotten."" The first Laugh Out Violence fundraiser was held in 2017, after Halifax marked 12 homicides in 2016, including three shooting deaths in seven days. Tyler Richards, 29, was among the young men killed. It was a terrible blow to Simmonds. Richards first reached out to Simmonds in 2003 to play for a team he was coaching in Toronto. Their paths crossed again the following year when Richards was trying out for Canada's basketball team, and also in 2013 when Richards made the NBL's Halifax Rainmen, briefly coached by Simmonds. ""Gone too soon, and to know he was somebody that was really wanting to do better in life,"" Simmonds said. R&B, gospel and hip hop musicians, along with a dancer — all who have been mentored by Simmonds — will take the stage at the fundraiser. He said this opportunity fulfils a promise to them. Spoken-word artist Michael Earle, known as MAJE, will perform his song Smile, which features positive lyrics and a music video that shows black fathers and their daughters. Earle didn't know Simmonds's back story until he shared it last week, but ""I always knew he had a big heart."" ""Like C.C. said, his kid is the reason he changed, so being in your kid's life can do miracles for you as a human."" Simmonds's son, Tyrell, was born when he was barely out of his teens.  ""I want him to have me there with him all the way through his life until he's old enough to have his own kids and understand that when I go, it's because it's time, I'm old.""

51,"Shanifa Nasser, Benjamin Blum",2020-01-26T20:55:21.893Z,Canada's 1st 'presumptive' case of coronavirus found in Toronto,"Canada confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto as the number of infections worldwide surpasses 1,900 cases. Public health officials announced Saturday afternoon the patient —  a man in his 50s who had travelled to Wuhan, China — was found at Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Within a day of arriving, officials say, he became ""quite ill,"" said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate chief medical officer of health with the provincial Ministry of Health. Officials say lab results were received Saturday afternoon. The man is in stable condition. While the case has been confirmed by a test in Toronto, officials said it has yet to complete separate testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. The illness can't be officially confirmed until that testing is completed. Watch: Health officials say they have the situation 'well-managed.' Officials said the man took a flight on Jan. 21 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, then from Guangzhou to Toronto, arriving on Jan. 22. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said the patient showed mild symptoms on the flight, but did not report his flu-like symptoms upon arrival. He is believed to have travelled ""privately"" from the airport to his home. Officials do not believe he took public transit. They have not said what part of the city the man lives in. Upon arriving, he told family members he felt ill and called 911. Officials say paramedics arrived prepared, taking all necessary precautions ""right from first contact"" until the hand-off to the hospital's emergency department on Jan. 23, officials say. Watch: An associate professor at U of T's faculty of medicine discusses what comes next. But in a tweet following Saturday's news conference, the Toronto Paramedic Union said the first responders who transported the man only learned he was infected with the coronavirus after they had transported him. ""Why did @TOPublicHealth not notify the division? This is completely unacceptable,"" said the tweet, which has since been deleted. Toronto Public Health issued a statement in response saying it does not notify paramedics about patient lab results if they have not been exposed to a public health risk. ""In this situation, the paramedics used full personal protective equipment and no followup was therefore necessary,"" said the statement from Dr. Rita Shahin, associate medical officer of health. The union later sent a pair of followup tweets, confirming that the division was notified by Toronto Public Health ""of a change in condition to a patient that paramedics transported... ""Paramedics were fully protected during the emergency call. It remains unacceptable that they were not informed of the change in condition prior to the media release."" When the man arrived at Sunnybrook, hospital officials say he was immediately identified as possibly affected by the virus and placed into a negative pressure room to prevent any contamination, with health-care workers taking protective measures to ensure the safety of staff and other patients. Public health officials are now working to track down some of the passengers of the China Southern Airlines flight after learning that the man showed symptoms on the plane. Federal authorities, together with Toronto Public Health, are in the process of reaching out to those who were within a two-metre radius to the man to ensure they know what to do if they become ill, she said. Officials are also trying to determine exactly how much contact the man could have had with others since his return to Canada. Officials say any contact was likely limited to members of his household.  Anyone who lived with the man is currently in ""self-isolation,"" said Yaffe. Watch: Health officials discuss whether people on the same flight are at risk. The federal government says it has been working with provincial, territorial and international counterparts since China first began reporting cases to make sure Canada is prepared to limit the spread of the infection.  ""Canadian hospitals have strong infection control systems and procedures in place to limit the spread of infection and protect health-care workers,"" said federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu, who is expected to hold a news conference on Sunday morning. Health officials referred to the case as ""presumptive"" because they're being cautious due to the detailed process of testing and validating the sample, said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.  When testing for a typical virus, technicians with the Public Health Ontario Laboratory would compare the sample with positive and negative specimens in order to verify a positive result, she said. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is caring for a patient who has a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.<br><br>The patient is in stable condition and has been admitted to an isolation room. More info: <a href=""https://t.co/BDLgqfjAzw"">https://t.co/BDLgqfjAzw</a> But because the test for the new coronavirus was developed so quickly based on positive cases overseas, it's standard practice to have two laboratories verify the sample.  ""You never call something definitive until two labs with two different tests have called it,"" McGeer said.  ""It would be really surprising if it wasn't confirmed."" Dr. David Williams, chief medical officer of health for Ontario, told the news conference that the province's health system acted as it should. ""As a result, the risk to Ontarians is still low, and things are managed and well-controlled,"" Williams said. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada yearly. At this point, the World Health Organization has not declared the outbreak to be an international public health emergency. So far, there have been 76 reported deaths attributed to the virus, all in China, according to China's state media. The majority of those infections have been inside China, where the virus has mostly been concentrated in Wuhan city, although there have been confirmed cases reported in Shanghai and Beijing, along with Hong Kong and Macao. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in France, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, Vietnam, Australia and Malaysia. In China, transportation has also been shut down in roughly a dozen cities, home to roughly 36 million people. Canadian officials have said such mass quarantines are unlikely, even if the virus spread here.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that most often cause mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses including the common cold, but they can also lead to severe diseases. Some coronaviruses spread between animals, some pass between animals and people, and others go from people to people. Watch: Health officials discuss what precautions people can take. This new virus is different from the coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  Its symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.  Typically, coronavirus infections manifest as the common cold. Symptoms can include runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and fever. Young babies may contract gastrointestinal disease. Severe cases involve pneumonia, kidney failure and even death. Those with weakened immune systems are most vulnerable to severe disease. That includes the elderly and people with chronic illness, such as diabetes, cancer, heart or lung disease. Those travelling to China, where the majority of infections have happened, are advised to avoid crowded areas and seek medical attention if they become sick. The federal government advises avoiding farms, live animal markets and contact with animals alive or dead, in addition to usual precautions. Confirmation of this case comes just one day after Williams said it was only ""a matter of where and when"" the virus would arrive in Canada. ""Ontario is ready, our systems are ready,"" Williams said in a news conference Friday. ""We're light years away of where we were in 2003,"" he said, referring to the SARS outbreak that killed 44 people in the Toronto area. Watch: Health officials say they're better prepared than they were for SARS. Dr. Peter Donnelly, CEO of Public Health Ontario, said Friday the province has testing that lets medical professionals know within 24 hours whether an illness is this new coronavirus type. Toronto Mayor John Tory said he has ""complete confidence"" in the city's medical officer of health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, to co-ordinate the city's response. ""Our front-line health-care workers are the best in the world and have procedures in place to keep people safe,"" Tory said in a statement. ""Toronto Public Health is continuing to work closely with provincial and federal health colleagues to actively monitor the situation and respond as appropriate."" The federal government says measures to stem the risk and spread of diseases like the coronavirus are in place. These include messages on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a border services officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, as well as an additional health screening question on electronic kiosks used by international travellers. If need be, officials say passengers will be referred to local hospitals, with the individual's travel history available to the hospital they may arrive at. British Columbia's minister of health and provincial health officer said there have been no cases in B.C. and the overall risk to the province is still low. """"We are closely watching the situation in Canada and globally and are meeting regularly with our counterparts across the country to make sure we are prepared if cases arise in B.C.,"" Adrian Dix and Dr. Bonnie Henry said in a statement issued Saturday.

52,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-22T22:00:43.144Z,"Harvey Weinstein trial begins, portraying ex-producer as predator","Harvey Weinstein went on trial Wednesday in a landmark moment for the #MeToo movement, with prosecutors painting him as a sexual predator who used his movie-magnate stature to abuse women for decades, while his lawyers sought to discredit his accusers and portray them as willing participants. Prosecutor Meghan Hast told the jury of seven men and five women that the former studio boss was ""not just a titan in Hollywood — he was a rapist"" who screamed at one victim that she ""owed"" him sex, used injections to induce an erection before an assault and pushed his way into the apartment of another woman and assaulted her. ""It is for his complete lack of empathy that he must be held accountable,"" Hast said. Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis countered by laying out plans to use friendly-sounding emails, calendar entries and other evidence to call the accusers' accounts of being attacked into question. The opening of the rape trial more than two years after a barrage of allegations against Weinstein gave rise to #MeToo was seen by activists as a milestone in the global reckoning over sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's lawyers, though, have portrayed the case as the result of a climate of accusation run amok. Weinstein, 67, said little as he arrived at a Manhattan court Wednesday. Asked whether he believed he would have a fair trial, he said yes: ""I have good lawyers."" Guided by aides and lawyers, he wasn't using the walker he's leaned on lately after a summer car crash and subsequent back surgery. He said he was feeling better. Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. He could get life in prison if convicted. The once-powerful and feared executive brought to the screen such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech, Shakespeare in Love and Chicago, and hobnobbed with the elite in Hollywood and beyond, a point prosecutors made by showing jurors a photo of Weinstein with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. A prosecutor also told the judge that Weinstein had taken calls from Clinton while Weinstein was with one of his accusers. Weinstein's lawyers later cited the photo in asking for a mistrial, accusing prosecutors of improperly trying to influence the jury. Judge James Burke denied the request. The prosecution called former board member of The Weinstein Co., Lance Maerov, as its first witness. Maerov described the ex-producer as ""an extremely influential, powerful person"" who could be charming in public and aggressive in private. ""I would say his public personality was diametrically opposed to who he was in private,"" Maerov said. The movie company went bankrupt after Weinstein's fall. At the end of the day's session, Weinstein left the courthouse with the use of his walker. Asked how the day went, he said, ""Good."" Scores of women have accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them over the years. But the New York charges centre on two allegations: that he forcibly performed oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his apartment in 2006 and raped an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. The rape accuser found a needle in the hotel room bathroom after the alleged assault and realized Weinstein had injected himself to get an erection, Hast said. Another time, after the woman told him she had a new boyfriend, Weinstein dragged her into a bedroom, ""all the while screaming at her that he owed her one more time,"" Hast said. ""He ripped her jeans off so forcefully that it left scratch marks."" The prosecutor said Weinstein later told the woman, ""I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. I just find you so attractive, I couldn't resist you."" In addition to the two women he is charged with attacking, prosecutors plan to call to the stand four other accusers — including actress Annabella Sciorra — in a bid to portray Weinstein as a monster who lured women with offers of career help, then forced himself on them. ""They will each describe their fear, their shame and their humiliation — the struggle each went through to push their trauma down and show a brave face to the world,"" Hast said. Hast detailed allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted Sciorra around 1993 after giving the Sopranos actress a ride home to her Manhattan apartment and forcing his way inside. ""She told him to get out. She told him no. But Harvey Weinstein was undeterred,"" Hast said. Weinstein's lawyers made it clear they plan to go on the offensive. Cheronis said the 2013 rape accuser sent Weinstein a request that year asking for ""time privately"" with him and another message letting him know, ""I got a new number. I just wanted you to have it. Always good to hear your voice."" ""These aren't our words. They're hers. It is not a relationship based on fear, you are going to see that,"" Cherinos said. Weinstein's trial could take more than a month, Burke said. Judging from an arduous two-week jury selection that netted the panel of seven men and five women, it could be a hotbed of protests and intense media coverage. In a failed last-minute push to get the trial moved, Weinstein's lawyers said a flash mob's chanting ""the rapist is you!"" at street level could be heard in the courtroom, 15 floors above. Adding to the drama, actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was in the same courthouse Wednesday morning for a hearing for a case in which several women have accused him of groping. An April 21 trial date was set for the Oscar winner, who has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Once the New York trial is over, Weinstein faces additional rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. Those charges were filed this month as jury selection in his New York trial was getting underway.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-opening-statements-1.5435800,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035,N/A
53,Anonymous,2020-01-25T18:05:35.687Z,"Surrey issues notice to Uber to stop operating, Uber 'respectfully declines'","The City of Surrey issued a notice to Uber Friday to stop operating by 9 p.m. or face fines. Councillor Jack Hundial said council did not receive a copy of the notice but he confirmed the news with city staff. The reasoning is that Uber, which just began operating Friday morning in the Lower Mainland after years of delays, does not have the proper business licence to operate in Surrey, Hundial said.  ""I don't see how the city would be able to enforce it,"" he said.  Hundial said there are ""a few hundred"" businesses operating in the city without licences due to expiration and other factors. He said the city is capable of issuing licences to businesses quickly or providing a grace period.  Hundial said he was not sure whether Uber complied with the notice and ceased its operations in the city by 9 p.m., but said he supports ride-hailing.  ""I was excited this morning. Like a lot of people, finally, it's coming here,"" he said. ""But we're up against a mayor who supports his friends and really not what the people of Surrey are wanting. ""I just want to see the City of Surrey get the same benefits of ride share that every other city in the region is benefiting from."" In a statement issued by Uber, the company wrote that ""Surrey has requested that Uber pause operations, but we respectfully decline. No other city is taking this approach."" ""The Passenger Transportation Board and the provincial government have given Uber all necessary licences authorizing Uber to continue operating across Metro Vancouver and in the City of Surrey. We look forward to working with all Councils on a path forward for the regional licencing of this new industry,"" Uber's head of western Canada Michael van Hemmen wrote in the statement. As ride-hailing operators Uber and Lyft began picking up passengers for the first time in the Lower Mainland on Friday morning, Surrey Mayor Doug McCallum reiterated his opposition to ride-hailing. ""What continues to be my chief concern is the unfair advantage that has been created without any regard as to how it will impact those who are employed in the taxi industry. It is no secret that a large percentage of cab drivers live in Surrey,"" he said.  Surrey businesses can be subject to a $500 fine if they do not have an operating licence, Hundial said.  ""They can expedite business licences if they choose to,"" he said. ""So it's really up to the city now to sort of decide what they're wanting to do with Uber operators."" The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure said municipalities can set requirements for business licences for ride-hailing operators but provincial laws prohibit blocking ride-hailing altogether.  In a statement Friday night, Rob Costanzo, general manager of corporate services for the City of Surrey, said staff told Uber that council has not yet come to a decision on how it wants to deal with ride-hailing business licences.

""Look what happened to our caribou ...15 or 10 years ago caribou were thick like mosquitoes."" The Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council is asking the provincial government to put in place a moratorium on the 2020 moose hunt in the réserve faunique La Vérendrye, south of Val-d'Or, saying hunters are seeing steep declines in the population.  Last week, the council issued a press release saying it was disappointed the ministry was refusing to act so far. ""The moose population is going down fairly quickly,"" said Algonquin Anishinabeg Grand Chief Verna Polson. ""We've been talking about this for several years now."" Polson said her nation is co-operating with officials at the province's Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs to carry out a moose population count in the reserve this winter. The nation is continuing to pressure the government for a moratorium.  The Cree Trappers Association is hoping to present its draft moose management plan to members at its annual general assembly this summer. It will include a better population count and draw on traditional Cree and non-Indigenous conservation practices, and could include restrictions on Indigenous hunters, according to association president Tomatuk. He also said hunters need to stop over-harvesting, particularly female moose during the spring calving season. ""In Waswanipi last year, nine moose were killed,"" said Tomatuk, adding all were female and pregnant. That one harvest took a total of 27 moose out of the area, he said.

55,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-25T01:00:00.884Z,More surgical items being left inside patients blamed on rushed operations,"Tracy-Ann Wallace says she'll never forget the sharp pain in her stomach and the putrid smell coming from inside her body after a partial hysterectomy. ""I was in constant pain and I had problems going to the bathroom,"" said Wallace, 47 who had the surgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in 2014, after developing uterine fibroids. The 47-year-old says her doctors told her the problems were part of routine healing, but as the weeks passed, the pain and smell got worse. Finally, a friend convinced Wallace to show up at her surgeon's waiting room, and just sit there until the doctor agreed to see her. When the surgeon finally examined Wallace, the problem was apparent and ""horrifying.""  ""She put her gloves on and reached in and took a glove and two sponges out of my body,"" said Wallace. As Go Public recently reported, the number of objects being left in patients after surgery in Canada has jumped 14 per cent over the last five years.  That's no accident, but a systemic problem caused by doctors and nurses being pressured to rush through surgeries, according to veteran surgical nurse Bev McLean.  McLean has spent more than half of her 33-year career in operating rooms, as a nurse, among other positions, and, most recently, reviewing operating room mistakes for legal cases. She says Wallace's story reminds her of a case she reviewed in 2010. In a rush to finish an operation, a surgeon grabbed a sponge from the instrument table after a nurse had finished counting medical devices to ensure all were accounted. The sponge was lost in the count and left inside the patient. It was only discovered after he developed a painful infection and required another surgery to be removed, says McLean. In an effort to reduce wait times and cut costs, many provinces cap funding for certain kinds of surgeries, no matter how complicated or what problems arise. At the same time, the provinces require hospitals to balance their budgets, resulting in a crackdown on overtime and adding to the pressure to rush through surgeries. ""There's a big push these days to be fast,"" McLean told Go Public, ""and that's part of the problem. The faster you go in any procedure, no matter how good you are as a team, there's always the risk that you're going to take a shortcut or that you might miss a step, or you're doing two steps at the same time."" The Canadian Nurses Association and the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada say they too see this as part of the problem. Asked what it's doing about the problem, Health Canada said in an email ""the practice of medicine"" is up to the provinces.  There are oversights and safety measures in place. Accreditation Canada, an independent agency that sets standards for publicly funded hospitals, made it mandatory in 2011 for surgical staff to count the devices — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — used after a procedure to ensure nothing is left behind. This kind of medical mistake is considered a ""never event,"" meaning there are enough safety measures in place that it should never happen. But despite that, it does. Alberta and Quebec have the highest rates of leaving foreign objects inside patients, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Both are above the national average of 9.8 such mistakes per 100,000 patients: Alberta at 12 and Quebec at 15 per 100,000 patients. A spokesperson for Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services tells Go Public, such ""omissions remain very rare,"" adding operating room staff need to be vigilant and follow best practices. Alberta Health Services recently finished a comprehensive review of what's causing these errors, and found the ""primary factors identified are distractions, incorrect surgical tool counts and challenges with surgical team dynamics,"" according to spokesperson Kerry Williamson. Williamson says there is no single, identifiable reason why Alberta's rates are higher, but that it's likely due to the province's good reporting system. In Ontario, hospitals are required to report to the Ministry of Health on their use of the instrument checklist — which has shown to ""reduce the rates of death and complications,"" according to ministry spokesperson David Jensen. The ministry noted the province's rate of left-behind medical devices is lower than the national average, but would not comment on whether the funding model or the pressure to balance hospital budgets is leading to rushed operations.  In some parts of Canada, including Toronto and Ottawa, evidence about medical errors is being gathered in operating rooms equipped with ""black box"" recorders, similar to those in airplanes, providing a window on what can go wrong. The boxes include cameras and microphones that monitor what's being said and done in operating rooms, analysis of which shows distractions like loud noises, irrelevant conversations and doors opening and closing may be leading to medical mistakes. The Toronto doctor behind the project, Teodor Grantcharov, has been testing the boxes for almost four years.  Noises distracted surgeons a median of 138 times per surgery according to findings released in June 2018.  Misplaced medical devices are part of the broader problem of ""preventable patient harm incidents"" — a category of mishaps that also includes hospital-acquired infections, blood clots and childbirth trauma.  Those mishaps are part of a ""silent epidemic,"" according to advocate Kathleen Finlay, founder of the Center for Patient Protection, an independent,Toronto-based group aimed at improving health care. ""People are being injured, permanently disabled and even dying … so the federal government needs to treat this as the public health-care crisis it is,"" said Finlay. And when it comes to such incidents, Finlay says the future looks grim, based on a 2017 report from the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, a not-for-profit health-care watchdog.  The report found more than 12 million Canadians in hospital and home-care settings will be harmed by the healthcare system over the next 30 years, costing the health-care system an additional $2.75 billion per year. Another 1.2 million people will lose their lives.  So what can be done? Finlay would like to see those black boxes routinely used in operating rooms across the country. She's also calling on the federal government to create an independent organization that would investigate hospital medical errors and wants Canada to implement a national hospital rating system, like those in the United States. She also wants to see provinces standardize what data is collected and reported about medical errors so Canadians have a clear picture of what's happening. ""They're very different from one province to the next,"" she says. ""So they're really not the kind of numbers that give you a full picture."" Tracy-Ann Wallace, the former patient, says she was shocked to learn how many patients have had the same — or similar — experiences to her own. In her case, the surgeon apologized, telling her it shouldn't have happened. Yet, five years later, she's still wondering how it did. ""This doesn't need to be happening and it shouldn't be happening. We need to tend to it,"" she said. St. Michael's Hospital tells Go Public it reviewed what happened in Wallace's case and the results led to changes that strengthened its process for counting equipment at the end of a procedure. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/medical-devices-left-in-patients-1.5364248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/fetal-monitor-left-inside-surgical-medical-error-1.5349111 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736,N/A

57,Raffy Boudjikanian,2019-12-03T00:32:26.160Z,Some Canadian schools see China's Confucius Institute as a handy teaching tool. Others reject it as propaganda,"After tying his sneaker shoelace, Laur An-Yochim jumps back to his feet.  Gym is his favourite class, and the fifth-grader does not intend to miss a moment of physical literacy consultant Stacey Hannay's instructions. ""What is this in Mandarin?"" Hannay asks, hopping around the basketball court inside Kildare School in Edmonton. The students yell the answer, then move along to a game that involves finding hidden trinkets underneath rows of plastic cups, following directions shouted in English and Mandarin.  Kildare is one of 14 schools in the Edmonton Public School Board's jurisdiction that takes part in programming offered by the Confucius Institute. That includes Mandarin classes but also other subjects taught in Mandarin, ranging from physical education to math. The Institute is partly funded by China's Ministry of Education and offers programming at elementary and high schools, as well as colleges and universities across Canada. China provides annual funding to run the programs as well as Chinese instructors who are are paid by China. In Edmonton's case, they work alongside the school's regular teachers to deliver language immersion programming. Much of Confucius Institute programming consists of classes in language and aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy. China says it helps operate more than 500 of them around the world. In Canada, eight colleges and universities and three school boards have signed agreements with the organization.  Some critics, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), accuse the Institute of political interference and censorship in some of its classes, but the EPSB says it hasn't experienced those problems and has had thousands of its students complete the program since it first struck an agreement with Beijing in 2007. For An-Yochim and other students, the immersion program means his Mandarin is as smooth as his English. He switches effortlessly between the two and says knowing one of the world's most widely spoken languages has allowed him to connect with his grandparents when he visits China annually. ""They say every year, 'Wow, how are you this tall? Or, 'Your Chinese is really good this year,'"" he said.  WATCH | Students at Kildare School in Edmonton test out their Mandarin: The Edmonton school board insists it carefully reviews teaching materials and has no concerns about controversial subjects getting suppressed in class. The board receives annual funding from China to run the program, and 10 EPSB delegates flew there to renew the deal last October at Beijing's expense. ""I needed to go to see what it is, what does this look like? Right? What is the value?"" said Trisha Estabrooks, the board's chairperson and a former CBC News journalist, who was part of the delegation, there for six days. ""I learned about the value that some of our principals in Edmonton Public see in having that partnership.""  Estabrooks does not believe her independence as a trustee was compromised by having the trip expenses covered by China.   ""Taxpayer dollars were not used,"" she said.  ""I'd be concerned about the optics if Alberta taxpayer dollars were used to pay for my trip to China. I would not have gone on that trip.""  But Kathleen Lowrey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Alberta, doesn't want her nine-year-old daughter anywhere near Confucius programs. ""We're inviting them into elementary schools that Canadian taxpayers have paid for,"" she said. ""It's important to separate Chinese culture and language and civilization from the Chinese state.""  Lowrey supports student exposure to Chinese culture, but she worries the country's government ""has very different values from Canada."" She cited the example of two Canadian citizens — Fan Wei and Robert Lloyd Schellenberg — who were sentenced to death in China for drug offences. Some schools that originally took on Confucius Institute programs have since severed their ties. In 2013, McMaster University in Hamilton ended its contract with the organization after a teacher, Sonia Zhao, left the Institute, citing discriminatory hiring practices over her membership in the Falun Gong religious group. The Toronto District School Board dropped out of a partnership before it got off the ground five years ago.  At the time, Concordia and McGill universities in Montreal told CBC they were approached by China but never signed up. McGill cited a lack of safeguards to ensure its academic freedoms. New Brunswick's Education Department, meanwhile, is opting out completely by 2022, calling the program ""Chinese propaganda."" A 2013 intelligence report by CSIS warned that Chinese leaders identified Confucius as ""an organization for spreading propaganda and building soft power"" and spoke of a ""perception that CIs do not allow discussion of topics that the Chinese government deems sensitive,"" such as the political situation in Tibet and Taiwan or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.  Other foreign-government funded institutions promoting culture and education operate in Canada, including Germany's Goethe Institute, Spain's Cervantes Institute and the British Council, but CSIS placed the Confucius Institute in a different category. ""Unlike the British Council, whose charter ensures that it is free from political interference, the CIs are closely linked to the Chinese part state,"" the report said. In 2014, the director of the Confucius Institute in Quebec told CBC she was visited by CSIS agents shortly after setting up shop in Montreal, and they only left her alone after she threatened to file a human-rights complaint. Determining exactly what kind of contracts are in place between Canadian schools and the Confucius Institute can be tricky.  CBC News reached out to eight higher-education institutions to find out about their agreements with China. Four of them didn't respond: The University of Waterloo, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina and Halifax's St. Mary's University disclosed that they renewed their contracts in 2016 but only Waterloo and the Saskatchewan schools provided copies to CBC News. St. Mary's asked CBC to fill out a freedom of information request. The Coquitlam School District in British Columbia and the Edmonton Public School Board provided copies of their agreements. The two boards' contracts specify that China's role will include providing a set amount of annual funding but don't spell out an amount other than a one-time ""start-up"" contribution of $150,000 in Coquitlam's case.  If Canadian educational institutions have to accept foreign funding, they should control the curriculum, said Gordon Houlden, a former diplomat with the Canadian government who has worked in Hong Kong and Beijing. ""If there isn't enough money available, it's very hard sometimes ... to say no,"" said Houlden, who now heads the China Institute at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, which is mostly funded by the province and receives no money from China. Houlden says young Canadians should continue learning about an important economic power like China, but the funding for any such education programs should come from local governments or school boards.  ""The 21st century will be, in my view, dominated by Asia,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/confucius-institute-schools-funding-1.5370858,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/confucius-institute-programs-china-school-1.5259963 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-votes-to-end-confucius-institute-partnership-1.2817805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/local-chinese-school-visited-by-csis-director-says-1.2759399 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-uighurs-camps-secret-documents-1.5368925 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/xi-jinping-global-ambition-1.5373557 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-belt-and-road-cbc-1.5372916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/china-power-belt-and-road-caribbean-jamaica-1.5374967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/chinas-power-editors-note-1.5373823,N/A

61,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-24T00:00:00.569Z,"Crapaud could be 'perfect model' of rural health care on P.E.I., says minister ","Minister of Health and Wellness James Aylward says his government is committed to filling a doctor vacancy in the Crapaud area — and that it's ""looking forward to setting Crapaud up as a perfect model"" for health care in rural P.E.I. The statement comes one day after community volunteers appeared before the province's health and social development committee, describing their ongoing two-year struggle to fill the position, and an apparent lack of commitment from the province to maintain a doctor in the community. Aylward said Thursday filling the position for a doctor based out of Crapaud has ""always been our plan,"" since the PC government came to power following the April 2019 provincial election. ""What we would envision for a community like Crapaud, for example, would be a full-time physician complemented with a nurse practitioner complemented with an RN that would visit the community who maybe specializes in COPD,"" said Aylward. There has been some confusion recently — expressed by members of all three political parties in the legislature Wednesday — over what the Dennis King government's plan might be to provide primary health care in rural communities. Community members in Crapaud built their own new 3,000-square foot clinic building and purchased the necessary medical equipment. That building is currently home to a walk-in clinic and a single nurse practitioner. Members of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc. told a committee of MLAs Wednesday they were advised by the province's deputy minister of health of a new direction in primary care, with clinics operating with a minimum of four to five physicians working under the same roof. But Aylward said Thursday that's not a policy his government is pursuing — that it remains committed to Crapaud and other rural communities operating with only one physician. With a ""standalone practice, like in Crapaud for example, we want to ensure that the doctor is supported by other health-care professionals"" such as nurse practitioners and registered nurses, Aylward said. And if communities want to advertise their own doctor vacancies to try to find a physician to fill them, ""full steam ahead,"" he said. The South Shore group told the committee they were asked by the province not to include that the vacant position was in Crapaud in ads they were running. They continued to do so regardless. ""I'm not sure where that came from, it may have been the previous administration,"" said Aylward. When contacted by CBC, Matt MacFarlane, co-chair of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc., said ""it's great to hear"" that the current government has planned all along to fill the doctor vacancy in Crapaud. ""That plan has never been communicated to us as the plan,"" he said. ""So at this point it's certainly wonderful to hear, finally, a commitment to placing a doctor in Crapaud and we'd love to hear a little bit more about the government's plan for rolling that out.""

62,Christine Rankin,2020-01-23T12:38:17.095Z,'Alarming' amount of plastic waste found at St. Catharines beach,"A Brock University professor says the amount of plastic waste found by student researchers on a St. Catharines beach is ""alarming.""  Students visited Sunset Beach in St. Catharines in October 2019 as part of a geography and tourism studies class to measure the amount of plastic waste. They sifted through grains of sand along the shoreline of Lake Ontario as if panning for gold ; but instead, they combed the top 5 cm and found bottle caps, lollipop sticks, and a whole lot of Styrofoam. In one instance, one square metre of the beach yielded a whopping 665 pieces of plastic material.  The course's professor Michael Pisaric said the results were ""eye-opening,"" but unfortunately not surprising given the research available about plastics in the environment, let alone bodies of water.  This research, he says, supports discourse that the issue is close to home.   ""A lot of what people have heard about with regards to plastics in the environment has been around the Pacific Ocean garbage patch...and so that's a long ways from where we live here in southern Ontario,"" he said. ""Now there's a growing amount of evidence and studies that have been done to show that the amount of plastics in the Great Lakes is a fairly significant problem as well.""  What did surprise him, Pisaric said, was the sheer amount of ""nurdles"" — tiny plastic pellets a couple of millimetres in diameter, which smaller organisms can mistake for food — and the amount of everyday objects, like pen caps, found in the environment.  He added that having his students collect data first-hand on a ""real-world problem"" was a huge takeaway.  Fourth-year geography student Michelle Pearce — who participated in the field collection — said that when people think of where their waste ends up, they normally envision landfills full of garbage bags — not beaches.  She said it shocked her to think about what she was finding, and how the situation could be much worse depending on where she was looking.  ""You have to think 'this is just one metre squared of the whole entire beach that we're looking at"" she said. ""And that was just our group — there were five other groups going as well. So it was mind-blowing to extrapolate up...I can't even imagine what's two feet to my left or two feet to my right.""  She said her class came across hundreds of bits of material on the beach, especially up shore. One reason for this, she said, is that the wind could be sweeping small pieces up the beach.   And some material found didn't immediately appear to be plastic. Pearce explained that her group kept finding pieces with same consistency of gum, which turned out to be plastic insulation of boats. The waste Pearce and her class collected is only the type they can see with the naked eye. Incredibly small microplastics end up in waterways from all sorts of everyday actions, she said, like washing clothes.  This is the first time Pisaric and his class have done this kind of work. He plans to continue with next year's group of students, potentially comparing the differences between amounts that end up on the shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie and exploring how much there is. The goal, he said, is awareness.  ""The biggest message is thinking about our use of plastics and how much plastic do we really need in our daily lives, and are there alternatives to that that we could use that would then eliminate and reduce the amount that gets into the environment."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/st-catharines-beach-plastic-brock-university-1.5436377,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/krantzberg-microplastics-1.5374907 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-sea-turtle-photographer-award-image-1.5435786,N/A

Fundraising efforts started with the Rally for the Valley, where several hundred Islanders showed up in the parking lot of the former rink and took a photo to draw attention to their Kraft Hockeyville bid. Now, Jeff Noye, the mayor of Tyne Valley, said some NHL legends will play a hockey game and all the proceeds will go toward rebuilding the rink. Noye said the hockey game will take place on Feb. 9, which will include legends like Ray Bourque who once played for the Boston Bruins.  Bourque will be headlining the game in Summerside at Credit Union Place. All the money raised will go toward rebuilding the rink in Tyne Valley. Tickets are $15 for adults and $10 for kids. ""All proceeds from everything from that game goes back to our fundraising efforts,"" said Tyne Valley rink manager Adam MacLennan. The Charlottetown Islanders are also throwing their support behind Tyne Valley with a Skate for the Valley after their game Sunday. The support Tyne Valley has had from other P.E.I. communities goes to show how ""tight-knit"" the hockey community is and Craig Foster, president of operations for the Islanders, said the team wanted to be part of that. ""We just want to do what we can to help their fundraising efforts."" Admission to the skate with the Charlottetown Islanders is by donation and all money raised will go toward the rink rebuild. ""Get some autographs, get some pictures,"" MacLennan said. ""It's not every day you get to go out and get to skate with potential future NHL players."" Charlottetown Mitsubishi will also be outside the Eastlink Centre offering test drives. For every test drive, the dealer will donate $20 to rebuild the rink. ""It's great to have local support here in Tyne Valley, but you know the support, I can tell you, has been overwhelming across the Maritimes,"" MacLennan said. The Tyne Valley fundraising committee has been busy working on a business plan and economic study, as well as preparing applications for provincial and federal government funding, MacLennan said. He said the committee is still waiting for the final word on the insurance claim for the rink. Every year, the Hockeyville competition gives one Canadian community money to upgrade its arena and host an NHL pre-season game. A top prize of $250,000 is up for grabs and the winner is announced March 28. Tyne Valley's bid to win the Hockeyville contest has gained a lot of attention. It has been supported by other Maritime communities. Celebrities with an Island connection have endorsed the bid like Trailer Park Boys and Mr. D star Jonathan Torrens. ""We've had great shout-outs from Ron MacLean, Elliotte Friedman, Doug MacLean,"" MacLennan said. MacLennan said nominations for Hockeyville end on Feb. 9 and he is hoping people continue to show their support so they make the top-four finalists. Noye said many Island communities have been supportive of rebuilding the rink. The Boys and Girls Club of Summerside has an online auction running with proceeds going to the rink rebuild. Moosehead Breweries is donating $1 from every case of beer the company sells on the Island until Feb. 29 to a maximum of $20,000.  Noye said he hopes the company is able to reach that maximum.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nhl-islanders-tyne-valley-fundraising-jan-2020-1.5439765,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-rink-kraft-hokceyville-jan-2020-1.5415594 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tyne-valley-arena-fire-cleanup-1.5413061 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-cwf-expanding-programs-jan-2020-1.5439405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ten-thousand-villages-1.5438994,N/A

In its third update of the now annual study, titled ""Inclusion in the Recording Studio?,"" the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative looked at the Hot 100 Year-End Billboard charts and the 2020 Grammy nominations to see how women fared on the gender parity scale, comparing this year's numbers to last year's study, as well as their full data range from 2012-2019.  In the January 2020 version of the study, the Initiative concluded that ""women are still missing in the music industry,"" with women representing less than one-third of all performers and 12.5 per cent of songwriters across 800 songs, with women accounting for 2.6 per cent of producers across 500 songs.  But there were minor improvements toward gender parity in the study: the percentage of women artists in the 800-song sample increased over 2019 after a two-year low, jumping to 22.5 per cent from 2018's 17.1. (The biggest year in the study's record was 2016, with 28.1 per cent, while the lowest was 2017, at 16.8.) This year's study also showed that the ratio of men to women producers is 37 to one for 2019, while it was 47 to one in 2018. This year, like last year, artists of colour were well represented, with 56.1 per cent of the artists coming from ""underrepresented racial/ethnic groups"" — Drake being the top performer, with 37 counted songs. But the study also concluded that ""women of colour are invisible as producers,"" as only eight out of 1,093 producing credits went to women of colour. While the study showed that the gender gap at the Grammys continues, this year's numbers hit an eight-year high for women nominees (20.5 per cent in 2020), with women most likely to be nominated in the best new artist and song of the year categories. Categories like producer of the year, where only one woman has been nominated in the last eight years (Linda Perry, in 2019), and record or album of the year, where less than 10 per cent of nominees are women, continue not to improve significantly. ""While these shifts are small, collective action takes place when multiple companies, in multiple positions of gatekeeping, take action,"" Dr. Stacy L. Smith, the Initiative's founder and director, told Billboard. ""We're starting to see change."" In March 2018, two months after the inaugural USC Annenberg study, the Recording Academy established the Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion — the same year that Lorde was the only woman nominee in the record or album of the year categories, and shortly after then Grammy president Neil Portnow said women needed to ""step up"" in order to fix the #GrammysSoMale trend. It aimed to address diversity and inclusion at the Grammys, releasing a report with 18 recommendations in December 2019. Two years later, the numbers are slightly higher but the Grammys are facing more scrutiny: Deborah Dugan, former Grammys CEO, alleged this week that she was ousted from the Recording Academy after reporting sexual harassment and pay disparities, among other complaints, in the Grammys' nominations process. Dugan was placed on administrative leave last week, after six months as CEO.  The 2020 Grammy Awards will take place on Jan. 26.

66,Laura Sciarpelletti,2020-01-23T20:38:47.777Z,'It can be very taxing on families': New study reflects unmet needs of Canadian caregivers,"Melissa Lawrence of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan has two full-time jobs. She is a massage therapist and she is caregiver to her husband David Lawrence, who has Type 1 diabetes.  Melissa has been David's caregiver since she was 21 years old. Now 39, Lawrence has to feed, clothe and bath David. and change his diapers.  ""You're either working or you're taking care of him. There's not much room for anything else,"" Melissa said.  She is not alone. In 2018, approximately one in four Canadians aged 15 and older provided care to a family member or friend, according to a recent Statistics Canada report.  That is about 7.8 million people. Those needing care struggle with a long-term health condition, physical or mental disability, or problems related to aging. Listen to the story on CBC's The Morning Edition: Shortly after David and Melissa married nearly 20 years ago, he lost his vision. Then his kidney failed.  David got a kidney transplant in 2006. Since then he has suffered two strokes, the most recent in summer 2019.  Of those surveyed by Statistics Canada, nearly 70 per cent who had received some type of support said they would have liked to have more government financial support or tax credits. The next most common unmet need is home care, with 40 per cent. Melissa said her biggest challenge is surviving off of her sole income and David's small pension, left over from before he was too sick to work. ""You're on a super tight budget. If any little things happens, that can throw that out the door,"" Melissa said.  Melissa said the couple gets both a disability tax credit and a caregiver tax credit from the federal government, but that it isn't enough when living off of one income.  She said the couple could use extra government funding once a month to go toward better equipment to lift David out of bed, diapers and bed protectors.  ""I think that would make a big difference,"" she said. ""All the little things ... they're on us [as caregivers] to take care of.""  Melissa said that even though she is lucky enough to have David's parents and her brother around to sometimes help care for David when she is at work, she has very little time to focus on herself. Even if she did have time, she said there is no mental health support for unpaid caregivers like herself in Moose Jaw.  Rebecca Rackow, a consultant at the Canadian Mental Health Association Saskatchewan division, heads up a program in Regina called Caregiver Affected Recovery Education (C.A.R.E.). The program provides caregivers with tools to help them stay mentally healthy while carrying out their responsibilities. She says mental health is difficult to maintain for many caregivers.  Rackow said a lack of self-care can cause some caregivers to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction or compassion fatigue.  ""Imagine you have a container full of compassion or empathy. You can only give until that container is empty. And then after that people tend to struggle with compassion fatigue and that can lead to terrible things. It can lead to situations of abuse."" Nora Spinks, CEO of the Vanier Institute of the Family — a Canadian research and education organization geared toward increasing public understanding of the complexities and family life — said that caregiving strains are a common part of family life.  ""It can be very taxing on families,"" Spinks said. She said there is a need for local and federal governments to help provide support for caregivers.  ""The reality is families are the most adaptable institution that we have. So families will adapt and adjust and evolve very quickly. And oftentimes [with] public policy and community programs ... there's a bit of a lag time. It takes a while to catch up,"" Spinks said.  ""Every caregiving situation is so unique that there has to be full collaboration and co-operation between levels of government, between government and community organizations and formal and informal resources.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/new-study-reflects-unmet-needs-of-canadian-caregivers-1.5436281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/young-caregivers-impact-education-career-support-research-1.5302766,N/A
67,Anonymous,2020-01-26T14:10:15.149Z,Welcome to The Debbie Show: Receptionist putting on exhibit at Confederation Centre,"Debbie Muttart has been a friendly presence behind the reception desk at the Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown for almost 25 years, but now she's stepping into the spotlight. Muttart, who has seen about 400 exhibits come through the gallery over the years, was ""flabbergasted"" and ""flattered"" when she was asked to pick her favourite pieces for a new gallery exhibit called The Debbie Show: View from the Desk. ""I know every one of them by heart,"" Muttart told CBC Radio: Mainstreet P.E.I. host Matt Rainnie of the artworks in the exhibit. ""It's going to be a good one, I think!""   She's known for encouraging anyone walking by or peeking in the door to come in and have a look around — stressing art galleries are for everyone, from young children to elderly patrons.  She loves to chat with them about what pieces are their favourites and why, and educate them on the history of the pieces, which she researches enthusiastically. ""There's tons of people from all over the world come here and ask me questions — like I'm a fountain!"" Muttart said.  She has learned not only about history and styles of art, but has had the privilege of getting to know many artists from around the world in person and through their work. And The Debbie Show is eclectic. It includes an entire wall of portraits of dogs — 47 to be exact — by Canadian photographer Shari Hatt, one of the first shows ""that really stuck with me,"" said Muttart. She's a big fan of dogs, she said, and always has a hound she's adopted from the local pound. Another of her favourites is a painting of the Yankee Gale of 1851, a famous storm in the Gulf of St. Lawrence along P.E.I.'s North Shore that wrecked dozens of ships, many of them fishing schooners from New England working in the area. At least 160 crew members died, and many of them are buried in the cemetery by the Cape Tryon lighthouse in French River. ""All the Americans lost their lives, and all the Prince Edward Islanders went out to try to save them, and they lost all their lives — it just meant a lot, cause I'm from up that way,"" Muttart said.  She also picked some Group of Seven paintings — ""I just like the colour, when they're up in the range where the mountains are."" Muttart dedicates her show to the memory of her father, Ronnie MacLean Sr., who taught her to love nature. ""I learned to fish, hunt — and we loved animals,"" she said. ""My father meant so much to me, very much. He's been passed now quite a few years. And I just loved him.""  For the display, Muttart worked with co-curators Jill McRae and Andrew Cairns to choose some of her favourites from the gallery's own collection. McRae says the idea for The Debbie Show came up during a weekly meeting when staff talked about how they enjoy working in the gallery because they get to overhear Muttart's enthusiastic interactions with gallery patrons. They pitched the idea to Debbie, who loved it. Then began the process of choosing from thousands of works in the centre's collection. ""I very much agree with Debbie's taste, so the pieces that she's chosen I love,"" said McRae.  ""We have a good collection of sort of older pieces, as well as some new stuff that we haven't shown before,"" she said, noting Muttart went down into the centre's art vault, something she doesn't normally get to do.  Co-curator Cairns helped bring Muttart's choices together in cohesive groupings.  ""She's got a real eye for colour,"" Cairns said. ""A lot of the pieces, they're different but they still have a 'Debbie' touch — as she was saying, she really loves nature and animals.""  Muttart emphasized to the curators that she wanted the show to be welcoming. ""I feel the pieces really reflect that — make you feel good in the gallery!"" Cairns said.  Many of Muttart's choices are female artists including Lindee Climo and Aganetha Dyck. ""I like strong women in art,"" Muttart said.  There's a sculpture by Island artist Sarah Saunders, ""such a delicate person, yet she's a strong artist and I like that,"" Muttart said.  ""My life is a very, very good life,"" she said, adding working at the centre is her dream job. ""I've learned so much!"" She said she plans to work at the gallery ""until they take me out feet first, probably.""  The Debbie Show can be viewed at the gallery in the Confederation Centre of the Arts until April 12.

68,Kailea Switzer,2020-01-19T13:00:00.987Z,The agony of letting our kids take risks: Opinion,"I am a first-time mother of a one-year-old, and over the past year I've had to temper my fears a million times. From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own — it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away. Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me — they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.  This was also the way my parents parented — they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you — it has to be your own choice.""  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes — it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party — the discomfort has proven worth it.  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people — empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective — are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like — that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business — I would never have believed you.  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in"" my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it. I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

A new fishing boat with lofty goals of transforming the industry, and bringing much-needed jobs to northern New Brunswick, drew plenty of eyes Friday during the first day of Canada's largest commercial marine trade show, The Pro Cat stood out because it's a catamaran, a double-hull, composite vessel that looks nothing like traditional fishing boats in the region, or on the showroom floor. The 32-by-16-foot vessel is said to be a more stable and speedier option — with a top speed of 38 knots — ready to hit the market. Michel Pachiaudo, vice-president of Pro Cat, said the design catches some fishermen off guard.  ""Everybody does the same thing, year after year,"" Pachiaudo said. ""Things are from the '70s with no innovation, no engineering, so maybe this is a little bit risky, but why not be risky to bring something good to people?"" He said the stability and speed comes from its catamaran design, which moves on the water rather than pushing through it like a monohull vessel. Tom Duym, a prospective buyer from Maine, was a little skeptical about the design. ""It's different,"" he said. ""It really could make an interesting addition to the fleet,"" Duym said. ""So I'm anxious to look it over and see what it's like."" The company says the average age of fishing vessels on the East Coast is roughly 27 years, meaning there's going to be demand for new boats. Pachiaudo said buyers are often waitlisted two to three years before their order is filled. But the company has a plan for that. ""We are mounting an assembly line that works like the automotive industry and that assembly line, when it's all set up, we can put out the door one boat per week,"" he said. That assembly line is being established in Dalhousie.  Magguy Thibodeau, who founded Pro Cat, said the northern New Brunswick town was a good fit because of its deepwater port.  She said there are a handful of employees setting up the plant, but that number will grow to more than 50. Although the Pro Cat is geared for the fishing industry, Pachiaudo said it can be used as a commuter, crane boat, fire boat, tour boat and even military transport.  The Pro Cat will be on display at the Moncton Coliseum on Saturday, the final day of the trade show.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/pro-cat-catamaran-fishing-boat-1.5440297,[],N/A

Canadians say they spend almost 11 hours a day in front of them — at their desks, on their laptops and especially on their smartphones. But after a long day at work, our eyes often start to feel dry, tired and strained, and many people are desperate for a solution.  Enter blue light filtering lenses. Optical chains say they protect our eyes from blue light emitted from digital screens, and consumers are buying in.  And it turns out it's not just eye strain they want to warn us about. A hidden camera investigation by CBC's Marketplace found sales associates at some of Canada's largest optical chains making ""misleading"" health claims about blue light from digital screens, but experts say there is no scientific evidence that blue light from computer monitors and screens is harmful. Staff at four leading chains cautioned buyers that digital screens could damage their retinas and could lead to serious eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. Two opticians at Hudson's Bay Optical suggested a link to cancer based on an in-store pamphlet provided by lens manufacturer VisionEase, while Vogue Optical's website suggests blue light may increase the risk of ""certain types of cancers."" Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery later told Marketplace the pamphlet is ""incorrect"" and will be pulled from Hudson's Bay Optical stores.  But experts in the fields of optometry and ophthalmology say there's no evidence that blue light from digital screens is harmful.  Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the idea of blue-light blocking is ""flawed on so many levels."" ""Blue light fear, paranoia, is really out there,"" said Khurana. ""But there's no evidence to show it's truly dangerous and blocking it has not ever [been] shown to [have] any benefits."" Marketplace producers went undercover and visited multiple Hakim Optical, Vogue Optical, Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery and LensCrafters locations in southern Ontario to see how the companies market the lenses to consumers.  Several dispensing opticians and salespeople told the producers that blue light from digital screens can lead to fatigue and headaches. One optician said blue light has ""very sharp rays, penetrating at the back of the eyes,"" while another salesperson said ""it tears the eyes right out of you."" Watch Marketplace go undercover at optional retailers: But more ""serious"" and even ""scary-sounding"" to ophthalmologist and macular specialist Dr. Sunir Garg were claims that blue light from digital devices might lead to retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and possibly cancer.  Buying blue light filtering lenses, it was suggested, might eliminate these risks. ""They're introducing this technology that blocks [the digital blue light] out,"" said one student optician. ""So we are not going to be seeing things like cataracts or macular degeneration, damage to your retina, things like that.""  Many of these claims are also found on Vogue Optical, Hakim, and LensCrafters websites and promotional material. Marketplace asked Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, to review the hidden camera footage.  He was concerned about how salespeople and opticians were ""misleading"" customers with claims about how the light from screens can damage eyes. Retinal damage and macular degeneration are ""serious"" claims, Garg said, ""but the blue lights from your screen is not the cause of that stuff.""  ""I think a lot of this is just to create fear and confusion and when people have fear and are confused, they end up spending money on things they don't need to spend money on,"" said Garg.  Garg's research has led him to conclude that far from benefiting customers, these lenses are mostly benefiting the companies that are selling them. ""Maybe those [blue light filtering lenses] are decisions made in different boardrooms across the country and around the world,"" Garg said, ""but from a science perspective, I don't think people need to worry about this at all.""  He doesn't blame the staff at these chains for spreading these claims, however.  ""I can't fault them [because] I'm sure they're getting a little info sheet that says here's three talking points about blue light-blocking lenses, but it's not based on scientific data,"" Garg said.  ""People will quote that blue light can hurt retinal cells,"" Garg said, ""but what they're not telling you is that it's not been shown in any group of people who are using their screens.""  The science into the harms from blue light is mostly done with retinal cells in a petri dish, he said, ""or taking a poor mouse and and shining a blue light ray intensely into their eyeball for hours on end."" Both Khurana and Garg told Marketplace there's no research that suggests blue light filtering lenses are necessary.  Phillip Yuhas, an assistant professor of optometry at Ohio State University, agrees. He said studies have shown people blink far less during computer use and that blue light filters have not shown any improved ""visual comfort"" for digital eye strain.  Khurana said if the problem people are having is from digital eyestrain, then blue light filters are doing nothing to address the core issue and ""could be doing more harm than good.""  But that hasn't stopped eyeglass retailers from promoting them. One optician told Marketplace  the blue filter lens is like an ""extra shield on top of your eyes to protect your eyes from harmful rays.""  The lenses can be purchased with or without a prescription and range in price from $20 to more than $100.     Global sales of the lenses reached $18 million US in 2019, according to Marketwatch.com, and are projected to exceed $27 million US by 2024.    Staring at screens for a long time can make eyes feel dry, tired and strained, but blue light is not the culprit, said Garg, and purchasing special lenses won't fix the issue. ""What's bothering [people] isn't the blue light. It's the fact that when they're staring at their screen a lot they're not blinking as often. ""That causes the eye to dry out, [and] when your eyes become dry, they become irritated and scratchy and tired.""  To deal with that, he recommends a simple fix. It's called  ""the 20-20-20 rule.""  Look at least 20 feet (six metres) away from your screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.  Blue light does wake us up and make us more alert, so too much late at night can make it hard to get to sleep. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends turning off devices or turning on blue light filters, a couple of hours before going to bed.  In the United Kingdom, claims like the ones heard in Canada by Marketplace producers aren't allowed. Opticians and eyeglass retailers risk being fined if they make unproven claims about blue light from digital devices. In 2015, Boots Opticians were reprimanded and fined 400,000 pounds for making ""misleading"" claims that blue light causes retinal damage.   Dr. John O'Hagan, an optical radiation expert who works for Public Health England's (PHE) centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, conducted a study on blue light from digital devices on behalf of the organization.  He analyzed the amount of blue light coming from various sources including the sky, lightbulbs, mobile phones and computer screens.  ""Blue light in our normal environment is not dangerous at all,"" O'Hagan told Marketplace ""The main source of blue light for us is from the sky and a nice sunny day."" The PHE study found that for smartphones, laptops and digital devices, the amount of blue light emitted was less than one per cent of the safe exposure level, even if stared at all day.  O'Hagan said that the light levels from a smartphone, tablet or laptop are ""considerably below the levels that we experience outside, even in winter."" We get about 30 times more blue light just by being outside, he said.  ""You could stare at your phone all day long, right above the face, and the amount of blue light is not significant,"" O'Hagan said.  ""There is no evidence that blue light from your mobile or other devices is harmful.""  Marketplace reached out to the four eyeglass retailers visited by producers.  Hudson's Bay Optical/Glasses Gallery said Marketplace was given wrong information when it comes to cancer and macular degeneration from digital blue light, and says it will be pulling all Vision Ease pamphlets and marketing materials immediately from all stores. It says all staff will be retrained in the coming weeks and it is ""committed to providing the very best experience for our customers."" Manufacturer Vision-Ease said they ""stand by their marketing materials"" and say the science around blue light is ""conflicting"" and ""ambiguous"" and more studies are needed.  LensCrafters said ""while we train our associates on all products, including blue light and blue IQ lenses, some inconsistencies are possible in how individual associates articulate this topic across our stores. We plan to reinforce our in-store training as the awareness around the potential risks of blue light grows."" Vogue Optical said ""optical science evolves very quickly"" and ""there is a high volume of ongoing studies on blue light, some of which point to damaging effects on the eye."" They also said they are putting considerable effort into educating staff to help educate consumers about what's available on the market and help them make the best choices.   Hakim Optical says there is evidence that blue light is damaging, and they ""will continue to respect and support the licensed optician's obligation to protect and educate the public with all available information and options related to their eye health care."" They also said ""there is no evidence of harm from the blue-light filter upgrade.""  Health Canada says prescription lenses are regulated through the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.   As the Food and Drugs Act ""prohibits false, misleading or deceptive advertising of a medical device, such as the promotion of claims without safety and effectiveness data,"" Health Canada said it will follow up with the optical chains to determine whether medical devices are being advertised or sold in Canada with unsupported health claims. The Ontario Opticians Association told Marketplace ""there is an overwhelming number of clients who have expressed satisfaction with their blue light filters, in that they reduced or eliminated headaches, fatigue, eyestrain and the like."" For people who are concerned about good eye health, Garg has some other suggestions — and they don't include lenses to block blue light.  ""Do things like take a break periodically, start quieting down before nighttime, eat a good diet, exercise and not smoke … all those things will help eyes way more than spending money on these blue blocking lenses.""  Sit about 63 centimetres (arm's length) from the computer screen. Position the screen so you are gazing slightly downward. Reduce screen glare by using a matte screen filter if needed. Take regular breaks using the ""20-20-20"" rule: every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet (six metres) away for at least 20 seconds. When your eyes feel dry, use artificial tears to refresh them. Adjust room lighting and try increasing the screen contrast to reduce eye strain. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing glasses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-blue-light-lenses-hidden-camera-investigation-1.5364678,[],N/A
71,Alex Kennedy,2020-01-25T18:36:47.568Z,State of emergency officially over in St. John's,"After eight days, the state of emergency in St. John's came to an end Saturday morning. The state of emergency was lifted at 6 a.m., allowing people out of their homes and businesses to open for the first time since a powerful blizzard hit eastern Newfoundland on Jan. 17. Mayor Danny Breen says the city is continuing to work toward getting things back to normal. ""We now move into a transition where we get the city back to normal operations,"" Breen told CBC News. ""We have a lot of snow removal left to do."" Although the state of emergency is lifted, a 24-hour a day parking ban remains in place outside the city's designated downtown. The city is continuing to to work on widening roads and sidewalks in order to help pedestrians get around. Work is also continuing in school zones, with the hope schools will be able to open on Monday. Metrobus and GoBus are offering free rides until Feb. 7, encouraging people to leave their vehicles at home, although some delays are expected and several detours are in effect. People from across the city are eager to get out of their homes for the first time since the state of emergency was put in place. Anne Hughes says she quickly found cabin fever setting in. ""For the first couple of days I felt a bit cooped up in the house,"" Hughes said. ""Not to be able to get out, it was really hard."" But thanks to some help from her neighbours, Hughes said she was eventually able to get out of her home and get some fresh air. ""I was able to walk down the street and up the street, and it was really good,"" Hughes said. ""That was wonderful."" Nancy Garland, owner of Clothes Minded Boutique, is happy to be open after the extended state of emergency. ""We were down quite a long time, and everyday we're without any sales we are majorly impacted,"" Garland said. ""So we are certainly happy to be back up and running today.""  Garland credits the city for all the work done over the past eight days. ""I feel the city has done an amazing job,"" she said. ""Every profession, the healthcare, the people out clearing our roads to make everything safe. I feel they did a fantastic job."" The eight days weren't a total loss for Shawn Dawson, a gardener at Barking Kettle, a local farm in Torbay.  ""It gave me time to make some new sauces … and come up with some new ideas,""  Dawson said. Barking Kettle usually sells their sauces at the St. John's Farmers Market, but worked with Simply for Life, a health food store in Torbay, to sell products while the Farmers Market was postponed. He said he came up with several recipes over the state of emergency, including a partridgeberry ketchup and a black currant barbecue sauce. Dawson said missing days at the Farmers Market can be tough for business, but he hopes businesses can work together to rebound from the storm. ""I think you'll see a lot of people, a lot of small businesses working together to try to get back on track.""   With the added hustle and bustle back on city streets, Breen said there is still much work to be done and advises the public to exercise caution. ""Everybody needs to be careful,"" Breen said. ""Everybody knows that they have to be responsible for each other, as we always are."" Downtown snow removal will continue today on Harbour Drive, New Gower Street, Water Street east of Prescott Street and Waterford Bridge Road, among other areas.

72,Ashley Burke,2020-01-24T01:04:23.048Z,TSB chair calls on Iran to take swift action on Flight PS752's black boxes,"Transportation Safety Board Chair Kathy Fox said today Iran needs to take action soon and make arrangements to analyze the black boxes from the crash of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 that killed 176 people. ""I think we're getting close to the end of what would be considered a reasonable period,"" Fox told CBC News regarding the flight recorders. ""There's obviously a lot of interest in what's on them. I think they need to take action sooner rather than later, given that we're already more than just two weeks past the time of the accident."" Iran admitted it ""mistakenly"" shot down the jet on Jan. 8 over the capital Tehran, just hours after Iran's forces fired missiles at Iraqi bases where U.S. troops were stationed. The attack was in retaliation for the U.S. killing a high-ranking Iranian military general. Of those who died in the crash, 57 were Canadian citizens and 29 were permanent residents. It's been more than two weeks since investigators started sifting through the wreckage of the airliner. But Iran still hasn't said where and when the plane's recorders will be downloaded and analyzed — a key piece of the puzzle in the search for answers, said Fox. Iran has asked Canada to help with the analysis of the flight recorders and two experienced TSB specialists are on standby to deploy. ""The issue here is we don't know if the data has been damaged,"" said Fox. ""I think the Iranians still prefer, if they can, to download the recorders in Iran. But if they're not able to, they wanted to assess the capability of the lab in Kyiv."" The plane's aircraft flight data and cockpit voice recorders are still in Iran, said the TSB. Fox said it's understandable that Iran would want to hang on to the recorders, since it's leading the investigation and the crash happened on it's territory. But if Iran doesn't have the capacity to analyze the black boxes, the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) rules say they have to send them to someone who does. ""Under ICAO they're supposed to dispatch those recorders under their custody and control to another state who can do it without delay,"" she said. Iran has granted Canada more access to the investigation than required under international aviation conventions. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the TSB are pushing for a higher level of accreditation to allow Canada to participate in all aspects of the investigation, to ensure the process is thorough and transparent.  Fox said that Iran is not sharing everything with the TSB about the case, but it is sharing ""a lot more information"" than it's technically required to deliver. ""They've been very collaborative and cooperative in sharing the information that they can,"" she said. Two TSB investigators travelled to Tehran after the crash and spent six days on the ground visiting the crash site, inspecting the wreckage and meeting with Iranian officials. This week, the TSB team spent two days in Kyiv for joint meetings with Ukrainian and Iranian investigators that included Iran assessing Ukraine's facility to analyze the plane's recorders. Fox said those two TSB investigators are headed back to Canada soon with details. But the TSB is only allowed to release information that Iran approves. It's not unusual for countries that don't have the facilities to analyze black boxes to send the recorders abroad. After the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, the Dutch Safety Board conducted the investigation but the black boxes were analyzed in the United Kingdom. After a deadly crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019, the recorders were downloaded in France. ""That's very common practice,"" said Fox.  Fox said investigators need a lab with sophisticated computers to analyze the recorders, which are roughly the size of bread boxes. When the aircraft flight data or cockpit voice recorders are damaged, the lab may need additional equipment. The U.S.-based electronics firm Honeywell, in this case, made the parts for the recorders, said Fox. Fox said that, according to the international rules, the crash probe will not lay blame. The black boxes can tell investigators what the plane's crew members were saying, if they had advance warning of the missile strike and what the aircraft was doing before and after the missiles exploded, said Fox. ""That's important,"" she said. ""Then you put that data together with the wreckage informational and that will give you a much better idea of what was going on.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-plane-crash-flight-752-canada-tsb-black-boxes-1.5438523,https://www.cbc.ca/news/iran-seeks-help-from-u-s-france-to-download-downed-plane-s-black-box-info-1.5434241 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-iran-black-box-ps752-1.5432527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847,N/A
73,Anonymous,2020-01-21T15:00:42.991Z,Why every Navajo baby's first laugh is celebrated,"Jaclyn Roessel sometimes offers a piece of advice to non-Navajo people: don't tickle a Navajo baby. That is, unless you want to get stuck with making dinner for the baby and their entire family. A Navajo baby's first laugh is sacred — it is a symbol of welcoming the child into the greater Navajo community. The person who makes the child laugh for the first time has been chosen as the one who welcomes them with a feast for them and their family.  ""As we all know, in Indigenous communities, family is a very big thing,"" Roessel said.  Roessel is the founder and director of Grownup Navajo, an organization that helps integrate Native American and Navajo teachings into museums, government departments and non-profits. The laughing ceremony is one of those teachings, but it's also something Roessel has first-hand experience with — she was the one who made her niece laugh for the first time. ""This whole ceremony is really meant to show the baby how we're supposed to be as Diné, as very generous people,"" Roessel said.  Unrefined rock salt is a key part of the meal, Roessel explained, and is eaten first as a reminder of the Diné's first meal and connection to the Earth. The child is also given a gift of turquoise. The child doesn't wear turquoise up until the laughter ceremony, when it's gifted to them. Roessel gifted her niece a turquoise necklace.  ""It's this beautiful moment, an exchange of also saying that this is how we honour our holy people,"" she said. ""They keep us protected because we wear this stone."" The stone also pays homage to the male part of the Diné people. ""We have this fluid identity … we believe we're both women and men, feminine and masculine,"" she said. ""We wear turquoise to honour the male side through Father Sky."" It's a special ceremony to Roessel — and one she was honoured to provide for her niece — but it can be harmful to the wallet. ""My aunties would tease, 'make sure you have a payday coming if you're going to be playing with the baby,' because you have to provide food,"" Roessel said. ""We believe that you do so with a very generous and open heart.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/stand-up-sketch-and-satire-the-rise-of-indigenous-comedy-1.5425646/why-every-navajo-baby-s-first-laugh-is-celebrated-1.5430265,[],N/A

75,Ariana Kelland,2020-01-24T18:43:10.504Z,RNC expert finds no problems with past homicide cases after DNA cross-contamination ,"The Royal Newfoundland Constabulary says a review of homicide cases from the last four years found no issues with the chief medical examiner's work. Forensics and property director Kathryn Moyse Rodgers was tasked with probing homicide cases from January 2016 to the present. Moyse Rodgers is a forensic scientist and DNA expert who joined the RNC last year. The police were asked to review the cases in October. The investigation was sparked after DNA cross-contamination was discovered by the RCMP forensics lab. When DNA from one homicide case was sent for testing, it turned up as a match to a second case. The specifics of those two cases have not been disclosed.  Steve Bragg was supposed to stand trial for first-degree murder in January, but because of cross-contamination in the unrelated cases, it was delayed indefinitely. Bragg is accused of killing Victoria Head, 36, and dumping her body near O'Brien Farm, off Mount Scio Road in St. John's. The Crown prosecutors in the case filed a last-minute application to delay the trial, citing the police investigation into the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.. The prosecutors received a report on Dec. 31, 2019, that ""indicates an issue with cross-contamination of DNA samples at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in two unrelated cases."" The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's role is to report, investigate and record deaths. The chief medical examiner is responsible for determining the cause and manner of death in homicide cases, and is often called on to testify as an expert witness. Dr. Nash Denic is Newfoundland and Labrador's chief medical examiner, but Dr. Simon Avis was in charge for the majority of the cases that were under review.  Bragg's case has no direct link to the cross-contamination. Const. James Cadigan, RNC media relations officer, said the force is ""not concerned"" that its cases will fall apart because of DNA issues.  In an interview last week, Justice Minister Andrew Parsons also said the blunder would not affect ongoing prosecutions.  Cadigan said the RNC does not expect the Bragg case to be delayed much longer.  However, Crown prosecutor Lisa Stead said no timeline has been determined yet. ""While the incident of cross-contamination involved a completely separate case, the Crown and defence are still assessing any ramifications in the the Bragg matter,"" Stead said. ""We intend to schedule the trial as soon as possible, but not before the Crown and defence are prepared to proceed.""

76,Chad Pawson,2020-01-26T00:31:09.655Z,"B.C. health officials say coronavirus risk remains low, despite new case in Ontario","As a man in his 50s receives treatment in a Toronto hospital for the coronavirus, health officials in B.C. are reassuring people that there are no cases in the province and medical professionals are prepared to deal with a case should someone be diagnosed. On Saturday, health officials in Ontario confirmed that the man, who is in stable condition at Sunnybrook Hospital, had recently travelled to Wuhan, China and fell ill upon his return. Lab results appear to show he has the coronavirus, which has sickened hundreds of people, mostly in Central China, and resulted in dozens of deaths. The virus has also been detected in several other countries, including the United States, where a Washington state man in his 30s was diagnosed on Tuesday. Ontario's health minister and chief medical officer of health were joined by several other officials during a Saturday news conference, where they presented details of Canada's first case of coronavirus. They said they were confident steps had been taken to prevent its spread and protect the public from the virus. Following the news conference, B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and the province's health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, issued a joint statement that mostly reiterated what the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said at a news conference on Friday. ""To date, there have been no cases of illness caused by the novel coronavirus in British Columbia and the overall risk to B.C. is still considered low,"" said the statement.

Centre for Disease Control has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus. Efforts are also being made to make sure adequate medical supplies are in place.  Health-care workers have been asked to be vigilant and to ask patients with respiratory symptoms to report their travel history. The majority of cases of the new coronavirus worldwide have been linked to people being in Wuhan, China. Dix and Henry are asking B.C. residents who may have been exposed to coronavirus — or who are experiencing symptoms associated with the disease, such as a fever and cough — to call their doctor, local health office, or 811.

77,Anonymous,2020-01-25T02:25:24.012Z,Republicans seem unmoved by Democrats' push for witnesses at Trump impeachment trial,"Republicans in the U.S. Senate appeared unmoved by the Democratic push for witnesses in U.S. President Donald Trump's impeachment trial despite persistent appeals from Rep. Adam Schiff and the other House prosecutors. Over three days of arguments, Democrats warned that the senators will live to regret not delving deeper into Trump's dealings with Ukraine. One of the managers, House judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, even told them it was ""treacherous"" to vote against gathering more evidence. Yet there's no indication the Democrats are moving closer to persuading four Republicans to break with their party in a critical vote expected next week — the minimum needed to reach a majority for subpoenas and extend a trial that seems on track for Trump's acquittal. ""As someone who has enjoyed really fairly strong working relationships with a lot of my colleagues, I've been struck by how little outreach and conversation there has been"" about calling witnesses, said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat who has often been at the centre of bipartisan negotiations. ""I understand that we are in a very partisan and divided environment, but I'm hoping that some conversations will begin. But so far there have been strikingly few."" House prosecutors argued Friday that Trump will persist in abusing the power of his office ahead of the 2020 election unless Congress intervenes to remove him. ""He is who he is,"" Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, told senators, accusing Trump of jeopardizing the U.S-Ukraine relationship in a way that benefited Russia just so he could take a political ""cheap shot"" at Democratic foe Joe Biden. ""You cannot leave a man like that in office,"" Schiff said. ""You know it's not going to stop. It's not going to stop unless the Congress does something about it."" Schiff also accused Trump — along with his attorney Rudy Giuliani and Giuliani's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman — of working to ""overturn a decades-long commitment to standing up to Russian aggression."" ""We're undermining the rule of law, we're undermining the principle 'you don't invade your neighbour,' we're undermining the key to our own success and for what? For help with a political campaign,"" Schiff said. Trump is being tried in the Senate after the House impeached him last month. He is accused of abusing his office by asking Ukraine for politically motivated probes of Biden and his son while withholding military aid from the country, a U.S. ally that was at war with bordering Russia, as leverage. The second article of impeachment accuses him of obstructing Congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to testify in the House probe. WATCH | Schiff says if the U.S. can't be trusted, it could soon find itself without allies: Most Republicans have solidified around the argument that the House should have sued for the witnesses who refused to testify in the House on Trump's orders, rather than looked to the Senate to compel their testimony. Others have suggested that the case hasn't been convincing enough. The central witness that Democrats are seeking is former national security adviser John Bolton, who was present for many of the episodes examined in the House's impeachment inquiry. Bolton, who often clashed with Trump, refused to talk to House investigators but has said he would testify in a Senate trial. Republicans have little interest. ""We have heard plenty,"" said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the Senate's No. 3 Republican. ""They shouldn't need any more information to make the final decision."" Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican who is in a tough re-election this year, also appeared to dismiss the idea Friday as he stood behind the closing doors of an elevator. ""We've heard from a lot of impeachment witnesses,"" Gardner said, referring to those who testified in the House. Republicans say privately that beyond the potential for damaging information to come out about Trump, they don't believe it would benefit themselves politically to hear witnesses. One top Republican aide, who requested anonymity to discuss internal party deliberations, said there's no political gain in working with Democrats — and no reward inside the Senate for tackling the idea. Those dynamics could certainly change in a fast-moving trial where evidence has continued to come out. Democrats are hoping for a dramatic moment similar to when the late Sen. John McCain unexpectedly voted in 2017 against legislation that would have led to repeal of President Barack Obama's health care law, killing the bill. Democratic prosecutors ended their presentation just before 9 p.m. ET, with Schiff in the well of the Senate making one final plea to senators to ensure witnesses are called to testify. ""Give America a fair trial,"" Schiff said. ""She's worth it."" As Democrats see it, they are only one or two votes away from a trial that could bring heaps of new evidence against Trump. There are 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats in the Senate, and a tie vote would mean the failure of a motion to call witnesses. The Republican resistance to hearing more evidence has been infuriating to Democrats who say the Republican party is trying to cover up Trump's wrongdoing. As Democrats pressed their case before skeptical Republican senators for a third day, the president's legal team was preparing its defence, expected to start Saturday. Trump, with his eyes on the audience beyond the Senate chamber, bemoaned the schedule in a tweet. After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud &amp; deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer &amp; their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V. Republicans have defended Trump's actions as appropriate and are casting the process as a politically motivated effort to weaken him in his re-election campaign. Eventual acquittal by the Republican-majority Senate is considered likely. With Chief Justice John Roberts presiding, Friday's arguments opened with Democrats wrapping up their presentation on the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, before turning to the second, obstruction of Congress. Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, a former army ranger, said the only reason Trump eventually released his hold on the nearly $400 million US in military aid Ukraine desperately relied on to counter Russian aggression was because he had ""gotten caught."" ""The scheme was unravelling,"" said Crow. The money for Ukraine was put on hold prior to Trump's July 25 call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that helped launch the impeachment probe, and released Sept. 11 once Congress intervened. WATCH | Rep. Jason Crow compares Trump's dealings with Ukraine to extortion: Drawing on historical figures, from the founding fathers to McCain to the fictional Atticus Finch, Schiff made his arguments emphatically personal. ""The next time, it just may be you,"" he said, pointing at one senator after another. ""Do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated?"" It wasn't just a policy dispute, Schiff argued, but ""one hell of a Russian intelligence coup"" as Trump chased ""kooky"" theories about Ukraine pushed by Giuliani that benefited Vladimir Putin at U.S. expense. ""This is Trump first. Not America first,"" Schiff declared. The impeachment trial is set against the backdrop of the 2020 election.

Edwin Dennis Proctor died Friday at the Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon of apparent natural causes following an illness, Correctional Service Canada said in a news release. Proctor was serving an indeterminate sentence for crimes he committed in 1979. On Oct. 18, 1979, Tracey Walsh, then 15 years old, and a friend were abducted and raped by Proctor outside Winnipeg. Proctor left the girls to die in a ditch. Both survived. Proctor had raped and killed Catherine Cluney, 21, a few weeks earlier. He was arrested and after years of hearings and court proceedings was convicted in 1995 of first-degree murder, attempted murder, rape and buggery in connection to the three cases. While the names of sexual assault victims are usually not published, Walsh has for years insisted that the media use her name.

Justin Towndale told CBC Radio's All In A Day. ""As a result, I think we should be looking at opportunities to promote ourselves to remote workers as an excellent hub to live, work and play."" Towndale recently tabled a motion he hopes will make the Seaway City a magnet for remote tech workers. ""Cornwall has a lot to offer,"" he said. There's its proximity to Ottawa, Montreal and the U.S., not to mention the ""very reasonable"" cost of living. Moving there would allow remote workers to pull in big salaries, but avoid the big-city costs normally associated with them, Towndale reasoned. Cornwall is already home to employees of major tech companies like Shopify, Towndale said. ""With technology, you don't really need to be that close to your office anymore."" All workers need is an internet connection. ""There's a different way of thinking these days,"" he said. ""You don't necessarily have to be in a major urban centre to have a really high quality of life.""   Towndale said the city's infrastructure is capable of supporting up to 60,000 people. Its current population is about 48,000. Achieving that goal will require some creative thinking, he said. For example, south of the border, Vermont is offering remote workers a $10,000 incentive to relocate to the state.

The movie The Grand Seduction tells the tale of residents of a small Newfoundland town who try to convince a visiting doctor to live there full-time. Now that story is being turned into a musical called Tell Tale Harbour by the Confederation Centre and artistic director Adam Brazier. Brazier said he's been developing the idea since 2016, but he soon realized he needed a songwriter from Atlantic Canada to write the songs for the show — so he reached out to Doyle. ""I really wanted this to be a celebration of Atlantic Canada. So finding an Atlantic Canadian voice … who not only has the tonality but understands the traditions and vernacular of Atlantic Canada … who better?"" Brazier said. Doyle said he was ""delighted"" to get Brazier's call. ""I was stoked,"" he said. Doyle said the ""big charm"" that made him want to be part of the project was the fact he has never done work like this before. ""It's a different challenge,"" he said Doyle said the best advice he received when it comes to writing music to a script is ""it's great to know what it can't be."" ""In this song we need to move the character from the bathroom out to the drug store and back to the hockey rink. OK, well that's what the song is going to be about then. It's limited, but it's also focused,"" he said. ""I'm learning as I go."" Doyle said because he doesn't come from the musical theater world, he hopes what he adds will be ""a breath of fresh air."" ""I just love getting in a room with people who have talents and skills I don't have and hoping I can contribute and that is super fun,"" Doyle said.

The musical is only in the beginning stages and another draft will be done by the end of the month. ""We're just going to keep pounding away at it, but it's our hope we can get this up on the stage sometime in the future,"" said Brazier. ""We're incredibly excited to be developing it.""

Cpl. Pedro Collier was hit with five criminal charges, including theft and possession and trafficking of stolen goods. He received a suspended sentence and one year of probation during an appearance in an Ottawa court in August. ""As a result of Cpl. Pedro Collier's conviction, the Canadian Armed Forces conducted an administrative review of the member's file to determine the most appropriate administrative action to be taken,"" said Department of National Defence spokeswoman Maj Amber Bineau. ""In this circumstance, the Review Authority's decision is to release the member from the CAF."" Bineau said Collier is in the process of being released and no further details will be made public. The thefts took place at the main base of Joint Task Force-2 (JTF-2) at Dwyer Hill, near Ottawa, between December 2015 and March 2017. Among the items stolen were C7 gun parts, a generator, batteries, clothing, ballistic sunglasses and cleaning supplies. Military Police said in a statement that those items were returned after Collier was confronted about the thefts last year. Before he was caught, he managed to sell online a solar charger, a jacket, a GPS device and other military equipment valued at about $4,600. That material was not recovered. Military police, working directly with special forces, received a tip in March, 2017 after items started appearing for sale. The file was handed over to the criminal investigation branch of the Canadian Armed Forces a few weeks later. Collier was charged on Oct. 28, 2018. Because weapon parts were among the stolen items, special forces conducted a review of its supply management procedures and reportedly found nothing wrong.

83,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-15T16:17:03.386Z,Pesticide on planes: Parents call for changes after cabin fumigated with passengers on board,"Rania Khunaysir didn't see it coming when she booked a last-minute Caribbean vacation for her young family. The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabin would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica, despite guidelines that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly.  ""Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a non-toxic insecticide ... I thought insecticide doesn't sound non-toxic,"" Khunaysir told Go Public about the family's flight last August. Khunaysir's husband Randy Beharry and their three-year-old daughter are both asthmatic. The couple's son, who was seven months old at the time, was also on the flight. ""I was worried about my kids."" Beharry said. ""My asthma triggered probably within minutes. I had a hard time breathing,"" The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strict rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly. ""I don't want to be inhaling this pesticide,"" Khunaysir said.  More than two dozen countries, such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada. The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease. The World Health Organization has said it has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended, but also says non-chemical methods need to be found.   The long-standing practice is raising concerns among some health experts. ""There is no such thing as a non-toxic pesticide,"" said researcher Chris van Netten, a professor emeritus with the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health. He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides ""not acceptable"" and said airline crew members and passengers need to be better informed and protected — especially children, older travellers and those with respiratory problems.  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk, Ont., flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed.  She said people on her flight in April 2018 were coughing and wheezing.  ""I think the public should have been aware ... that there is a spraying in these countries … and [told] a little bit more about the chemical they're spraying,"" she said. She now takes her own mask when she's travelling to hotter countries.  Harlene Hart from Newington, southeast of Ottawa, was on her way to Cuba on another Sunwing flight in February, a birthday present from her boyfriend, when the cabin was sprayed with pesticide about an hour before they landed.  ""Insecticide should be sprayed in a well-ventilated area,"" she told Go Public in an email. ""Not a sardine can with partially reused air."" What upsets her most, she said, is that she wasn't clearly notified before she purchased her ticket. She said she wouldn't have taken the trip if she had known. Canadian airlines are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will be sprayed with insecticide — despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who say the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks, skin irritations and long-term problems with the nervous system. Transport Canada said there's nothing it can do, but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose a ""foreseeable hazard.""  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek. It is unverified, but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the ""top-of-descent"" disinsection procedure, which involves spraying while passengers are on board.  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009 where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get ""advice from their own physician ... on whether they should travel to those destinations."" That advisory sets guidelines — not rules — saying airlines should notify passengers: • Before they purchase their tickets. • On the flight ticket itself. • Before boarding the aircraft. None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods.  WestJet points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to, and two other airlines that fly to these countries — Sunwing and Air Transat — say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask. Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airline's ""General Conditions of Carriage."" Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes.  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its ""Health Tips"" section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada.  However, passengers won't see that link if they book through third party websites like Khunaysir did when she booked her Air Canada flight. Van Netten, who has studied the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides, said the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabins isn't getting through. He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better. ""People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to.""  The practice of fumigating an airplane's cabin started decades ago. It's mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects — such as malaria and yellow fever — before entering certain tropical countries.  Twenty-seven countries require Canadian airlines to spray. Two methods are used, according to the Transport Canada website: spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplane's interior surfaces before passengers board. ""Both of them have their problems,"" van Netten said.  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on, noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system. ""Tingling in the fingers for instance — that's how it would start. And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment ... but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage."" The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin, a pesticide that's been approved by the World Health Organization for what's called ""disinsection"" on flights.  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying.  ""We get reports of a sore throat, sore eyes … lots of skin conditions,"" said Troy Winters, senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ""I've got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebody's hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction.""   He's concerned about the long-term effects of repeated exposure on airline staff, saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career. ""Recently I've started to see some reports of potential longer-term results and I'm concerned about potential long-term neurological effects.""  There are no industry-wide rules on what, if any, protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating.  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff. Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use, suggesting a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated.  The U.S. has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket.  The Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization Act also recommends the U.S. government work with WHO to find a ""safe, effective, and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft."" There are non-spraying methods being developed, like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction, but they are still in the testing stages.  WHO says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly, but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018, it said there is a need for new ""nonchemical"" methods. For now, travellers have few options — such as choosing to travel to countries that don't require spraying, travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying starts and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in. Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues, they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that they'd be sprayed.  ""I'm really surprised that they allow this to continue,"" Khunaysir said. ""I would've had no problem saying, 'Let's change our destination, let's go somewhere else, where they don't require that.'""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

George Daley, deputy minister for anglophone schools, took Cardy's place, leading groups through a series of four questions aimed at getting people thinking and talking. Participants were asked to come up with strengths and challenges within the education system and within the governance structure (district education councils, school districts and departments), as well as roles parents and communities should play within the system. Attendees ranged from senior citizens to high school students, with parents, grandparents, university students and teachers rounding out the crowd. They voiced concerns about issues such as the delivery of bilingualism, class sizes and a lack of student engagement. Eleanor Reiffenstein, a Grade 10 student at Tantramar Regional High School, said, ""I was not prepared enough to come to the high school and get started in the French immersion program."" She said there was a gap between what was expected in middle school compared to high school. Reiffenstein said she spent her evening at Sackville's town hall because she cares about her education and hopes to make it better for others.  Daley did his best to address issues, saying that violence in the classroom is, ""on my front burner."" Some said they were concerned about a lack of educational assistants and the low pay that EAs get. Daley said some EAs were acting as personal care workers because that's what was demanded of them.  They don't necessarily know how to deal with all the student demands, he said. The meeting lasted for more than two hours as the groups brainstormed answers to the questions, and a microphone was passed from table to table. Kate Crawford, a mother of two young children, said she attended because she wants to know what's happening in the school system. ""After hearing the back and forth, I am hopeful there would be systems change,"" said Crawford. Daley admitted there is already a 10-year plan in place for the coming changes to the school system, but he said, ""we're filling in the spaces on how we want to achieve particular parts of it and the information that is here tonight, it will contribute."" ""Whenever citizens get a chance to share and give us feedback, it always makes an impact, right?"" There are 11 other stops planned for the green paper tour. The next meeting will take place in Edmundston at Cité des Jeunes A.-M.-Sormany on Jan. 29. Cardy's green paper on education reform was published last fall.

85,Jessica Wong,2020-01-26T09:00:00.540Z,"Writers, producers warn streaming content boom is squeezing out Canadian creators","Scroll through your favourite streaming service and you're likely to come across some Canadiana, whether homegrown hits like Schitt's Creek and Kim's Convenience, or shows filled with familiar landmarks like The Expanse and The Handmaid's Tale. But amid the tidal wave of content coming from an increasing number of streamers, members of the Canadian film and TV industry are expressing concern about local storytellers being left out. This week, a government-appointed panel is set to release a long-awaited report on recommendations to modernize Canada's broadcasting laws. Industry veterans are eager to see if it will recommend that Netflix, Amazon Prime and other foreign companies streaming programming to Canadians contribute a portion of their revenues directly to funding Canadian-made projects.  ""We're now really focused on a lot of international content and that is fantastic — provided you can still provide some balance with your own stories and your own culture. That's really what's missing in the tale of all the new streamers,"" said Maureen Parker, executive director of the Writers Guild of Canada (WGC). According to the guild, scripted programming — such as dramas, sitcoms and kids' shows — commissioned by the major English-language private broadcasters has fallen significantly since 2014. The total hours WGC members were commissioned to work on scripted Canadian shows has plummeted since 2014, by between 61 and 82 per cent, depending on the broadcaster. Meanwhile, the production of U.S.-led film and TV shows in Canadian cities has skyrocketed, attributed in part to new programming for streaming services. Production by services such as Netflix and Apple TV Plus has increased 298.8 per cent since 2014, the WGC said. The Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) has seen a similar trend. In its 2018 annual economic report, for instance, it said Canadian television production dropped by $309 million and in-house productions by Canadian broadcasters, specifically, decreased $201 million.  Foreign service productions have become ""the largest single segment of the Canadian screen-based production sector,"" said the CMPA report. They jumped by 26.3 per cent to $4.77 billion in 2017-2018.  About three-quarters of these productions come from the U.S., where the copyright resides, the CMPA noted. As it stands now, the Broadcast Act requires all traditional broadcasters, cable and satellite providers, and others to contribute to the Canadian Media Fund (CMF), a key source of funding for Canadian content creators. The act currently does not require foreign streaming services to contribute.  ""The private broadcasters feel like they're up against the streamers, who have no regulatory requirements,"" Parker noted.  Watch | We ask Canadians how much more they'd pay to fund Canadian content: Netflix, the current streaming leader, argued against paying into the CMF last January in its submission to the broadcasting review panel. In 2017, the company vowed to pour $500 million into original, made-in-Canada programming and noted last year that it would ""significantly exceed"" that earlier pledge.  A Netflix spokesperson declined to offer additional comment to CBC News, beyond referring to its review panel submission a year ago. ""Netflix is not reporting how they're spending whatever they're spending,"" Parker said. Foreign productions shooting in cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary are a boon for the service economy in those respective cities, but they don't inject actual content by Canadian creators into a streamer's lineup, Parker said. Some industry veterans see a danger of the Canadian industry becoming ""a branch-plant economy"" rather than a hotspot where quality programming originates. They believe compelling foreign streamers to directly contribute to funding structures like the CMF is a key way to combat this. ""[If] you're just working on someone else's show and, one day, if it's cheaper to produce in Mexico or in the Ukraine, the production will get up and move to those studios. And you'll be left without a base of production, a base of intellectual property, a base of ownership that can carry on,"" said film and TV producer Martin Katz, a former chair of the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television. ""Netflix didn't makes Schitt's Creek ... Netflix bought Schitt's Creek after it was a beautiful, successful, smart, innovative and groundbreaking show. Same with Kim's Convenience. Same with Working Moms."" From Amazon Prime to Apple TV Plus and more, streamers are definitely spending to create their own original content. A new report projects that streaming leader Netflix, for instance, will invest more than $17 billion US overall on content in 2020, including on its original productions. Most often, however, ""we discover things on Netflix that were funded and supported by someone else,"" Katz noted. ""All those great Danish noir shows? Those weren't created by Netflix. They're created by a whole infrastructure in Denmark that is government-supported, local content creation."" Streamers ""are getting a great deal with access to our market,"" said Katz. ""All we're saying is they should be leaving something here and that thing that they leave here isn't an amount that they should make up on their own."" It's an argument that the U.S.-led streaming companies are also facing elsewhere. In Australia, officials have questioned whether streamers should be required to support local productions and operate under content quota rules closer to those followed by Australian TV networks. France is pondering legislation requiring foreign streamers to invest 25 per cent of their revenue from French subscribers into local content production. The European Union has given foreign video streamers until September 2020 to ensure that a minimum of 30 per cent of content available to EU subscribers is from the EU.  In response, Netflix has been vigorously expanding its European operations, including opening a large, 40-employee office in Paris this month (its fourth in Europe) and touting new French projects and partnerships.  Netflix achète plus de 200 films et préfinance entre 10 et 12 films par an en France, selon Sara May, directrice des acquisitions et co-productions Netflix France et Italie. <a href=""https://t.co/gOjaGAP6SM"">pic.twitter.com/gOjaGAP6SM</a> While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had previously dismissed the notion of taxing digital services, during the last election campaign he and all the major party leaders seemingly embraced the idea that international tech giants should contribute to Canada's economy.  The chair of Canada's broadcast and telecom regulator called it ""inevitable"" that foreign streamers will have to contribute to the production of Canadian content. ""Companies who are extracting a profit — they are participating in the Canadian market and deriving revenues — should be contributing,"" Ian Scott, chair of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, told The Canadian Press in a recent interview. But, the situation is not as simple as Canada introducing a so-called Netflix tax, he said.   ""The manner that they contribute is what's at issue."" The CRTC's Communications Monitoring Report, released this week, estimated that subscription-based video-on-demand services — including Netflix, Crave and Quebec-based Club Illico — had an estimated revenue of $2.5 billion Cdn in 2018.

Just after 2 p.m., one train was stopped at Tunney's Pasture station and eventually moved back to Belfast Yard, while another was still being examined by a technician at the uOttawa station two hours later, according to Troy Charter, the city's director of transit operations. The delays meant customers waited between five to 10 minutes for trains to arrive.  The interruption to Saturday's service was likely caused by a ""known electrical arcing issue that can trip a train's main circuit breaker, causing the train to stop,"" Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM) wrote in an email to CBC Ottawa late Saturday night. The company also said the problem has been part of an ongoing investigation that was known before Saturday. Video provided to CBC Ottawa from a passenger showed sparks coming off the top of one train. Replacement buses were being used between Rideau and St-Laurent stations for much of the afternoon and into the evening, but OC Transpo said trains were running from end-to-end by early evening. Riders reported delays of several minutes throughout the afternoon and vented their frustrations on social media. Finally made it to TP.

""When you watch the video you obviously can see what has occurred,"" said Brad MacConnell, deputy chief of Charlottetown police. ""Even as policemen, when we saw it, we were disturbed,"" said MacConnell, ""Our investigation led us to believe this was a case of road rage."" The video, shot Tuesday night on the bypass highway in Charlottetown, shows a car idling on the side of the road. The driver's side door is open and a man is standing beside it. The video shows a man jabbing his arms into the car and kicking, then slamming the door and walking away. A bystander can be heard screaming, and a man is heard groaning audibly. Police say a 79-year-old man in the car was left battered and bruised. He was treated at hospital and released. CBC has muted the audio on the video.  Police said the incident followed a collision.  ""No matter what precipitated this event, the level of violence associated to it, it doesn't make any sense,"" MacConnell said. Police say witnesses did the right thing by calling 911 and noting the license plate of the suspect's vehicle. ""We never ask anyone to put themselves in harm's way,""  MacConnell said.

89,Anonymous,2020-01-23T19:53:57.681Z,"Jim Lehrer, longtime PBS anchor and journalist, dead at 85","Jim Lehrer, co-host and later host of the nightly PBS NewsHour that for decades offered a thoughtful take on current events, has died, PBS said Thursday. He was 85. Lehrer died ""peacefully in his sleep,"" according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983, and more recently had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008. For Lehrer, and for his friend and longtime partner Robert MacNeil, broadcast journalism was a service, with public understanding of events and issues its primary goal. Lehrer was also a frequent moderator of presidential debates. ""We both believed the American people were not as stupid as some of the folks publishing and programming for them believed,"" Lehrer wrote in his 1992 memoir, A Bus of My Own. ""We were convinced they cared about the significant matters of human events. ... And we were certain they could and would hang in there for more than 35 seconds for information about those subjects if given a chance."" I am devastated to share news that my dear friend and cofounder of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewsHour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NEWSHOUR</a> Jim Lehrer died today at home. Sending love to his Kate and their family. <a href=""https://t.co/ZxNsCcaZBj"">https://t.co/ZxNsCcaZBj</a> In the trenches of electronic journalism over the decades, I met a lot of people. Few approached their work with more equanimity and integrity than Jim Lehrer. He was a gentlemen, and a helluva journalist. He will be missed. Tributes poured in from colleagues and watchers alike, including from Fox News' Bret Baier, who called Lehrer ""an inspiration to a whole generation of political journalists — including this one."" Dan Rather said ""few approached their work with more equanimity and integrity than Jim Lehrer."" And Jake Tapper of CNN called Lehrer ""a wonderful man and a superb journalist."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called him a ""champion for truth and transparency."" Just devastating news about Jim Lehrer passing. Jim was a patriot in every sense of the word. I sat with him at a dinner just before Christmas and he was so full of life, as compassionate as he was wise. He will be deeply missed. <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewsHour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NewsHour</a> <a href=""https://t.co/DZHPg1YadI"">https://t.co/DZHPg1YadI</a> The half-hour Robert MacNeil Report began on PBS in 1975 with Lehrer as Washington correspondent. The two had already made names for themselves at the then-fledgling network through their work with the National Public Affairs Center for Television and its coverage of the Watergate hearings in 1973. The nightly news broadcast, later retitled MacNeil-Lehrer Report, became the nation's first one-hour TV news broadcast in 1983 and was then known as MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. After MacNeil bowed out in 1995, it became The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. ""I'm heartbroken at the loss of someone who was central to my professional life, a mentor to me and someone whose friendship I've cherished for decades,"" Judy Woodruff, anchor and managing editor of PBS NewsHour, said in a statement. Politics, international relations, economics, science, even developments in the arts were all given lengthy, detailed coverage in their show. ""When we expanded to the hour, it changed from being a supplement to an alternative,"" Lehrer said in 1990. ""Now we take the position that if you're looking for a place to go every 24 hours and find out what's happened and get some in-depth treatment, we're the place."" Lehrer moderated his first presidential debate in 1988 and was a frequent consensus choice for the task in subsequent presidential contests. ""Anybody who would say it's just another TV show is a liar or a fool,"" he once said. ""I know how important it is, but it's not about me. It's what the candidates say that matters."" He also anchored PBS coverage of inaugurations and conventions, dismissing criticism from other TV news organizations that the latter had become too scripted to yield much in the way of real news. ""I think when the major political parties of this country gather together their people and resources in one place to nominate their candidates, that's important,"" he told The Associated Press in 2000. ""To me, it's a non-argument. I don't see why someone would argue that it wasn't important."" Naturally, Lehrer came in for some knocks for being so low-key in the big televised events. After a matchup between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, David Letterman cracked, ""Last night was probably the first and only that time Jim Lehrer [was] the most exciting person in the room."" But the real-life Lehrer — who had a tradition of buying a new tie for good luck before each debate — was more colourful than he might have seemed on PBS. On the side, he was also a novelist and sometime playwright. His debut novel Viva Max! was made into a movie starring Peter Ustinov. He did a whole series of novels about the adventures of an Oklahoma politician known as The One-Eyed Mack. Jim Lehrer was a legendary journalist and anchor. May he rest in peace.❤️ <a href=""https://t.co/9ddgNlPkEG"">https://t.co/9ddgNlPkEG</a> ""Hemingway said this, too: If you paid attention as a reporter, then when the time came to write fiction you'd have something to write about,"" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 1991. ""And it turned out I did. And I've got all these stories stored up after 30 years in the news business. And they're just flowing out of me."" As Lehrer turned 75 in spring 2009, PBS announced that the show would be retitled as PBS NewsHour later in the year, with Lehrer pairing up on anchor duties with other show regulars. He said he approved of the changes, telling The New York Times that having a pair of anchors would ""shake things up a bit,"" even as all sectors of the news business struggled to meet changing reader and viewer demands. Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1934, the son of parents who ran a bus line. In addition to titling his memoir A Bus of My Own, he collected bus memorabilia — from station signs to a real 1946 Flxible Clipper bus. Loved, of all things, buses. I did a piece for CNN in 1983 about a stunt driver who jumped and crashed old school buses. Phone rings. “Is this Keith? My name is Jim Lehrer...” Asked for a VHS copy of the story. A week later it’s him calling again “can’t thank you enough!” Jim Lehrer followed in his father's footsteps by serving in the Marines in the 1950s; he later claimed his and his brother's ""first foreign words were 'semper fidelis' and the first song we knew was the 'Marine Corps Hymn.' "" <a href=""https://t.co/BXEPtfuPIJ"">pic.twitter.com/BXEPtfuPIJ</a> After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines, later calling the experience so valuable that he thought all young people should take part in national service. ""I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death,"" he wrote. ""What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."" He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television for a Dallas nightly newscast. Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since former U.S. president Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.

Cole win 1st Grammys","A mix of newcomers and well-known acts reached their goals of winning their first-ever Grammy Awards on Sunday, including Tanya Tucker, J. Cole, Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Billy Ray Cyrus and late rapper Nipsey Hussle. Michelle Obama, Sara Bareilles, Rosalia and 21 Savage also became official Grammy winners when the show handed out trophies during its pre-telecast ceremony in Los Angeles. Gary Clark Jr. and Eilish's brother, Finneas, walked away as the most awarded stars, so far, taking home three awards each. Finneas — who co-wrote, produced and engineered his sister's debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? — won best engineered album (non-classical), best pop vocal album (shared with his sister) and non-classical producer of the year. ""My heart is beating so fast right now,"" Finneas said. ""This award belongs to my sister Billie for her trust and vision."" A number of acts won two awards in the pre-telecast, including Lizzo, Lil Nas X and Cyrus, Anderson .Paak, Lady Gaga, Tucker, Kirk Franklin and Jacob Collier. And Beyoncé, the most nominated woman in the history of the Grammys, won her 24th award. Nipsey Hussle, who will be honoured during the live telecast that began at 8 p.m. ET, has posthumously won best rap performance for Racks in the Middle, which features Roddy Ricch and Hit-Boy. Hussle's family, including his brother, grandmother and actress-fiancée Lauren London, accepted the honour during the pre-telecast. ""Nip did it, not just for the awards, but for the people,"" London said onstage. Hussle was nominated for two other awards: He lost best rap song to J. Cole and 21 Savage. The third award will be presented during the live show, where Hussle will be honoured with a tribute performance from DJ Khaled, John Legend, Meek Mill and others. The Grammy Awards pre-telecast ceremony, where most of the trophies are handed out, opened with a brief remembrance of NBA star Kobe Bryant, who was killed earlier in the day in a helicopter crash in California. ""Since we are in his house, I would ask you to join me in a moment of silence,"" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. said at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, referring to the arena where Bryant played for the L.A. Lakers. New stars like Lizzo, Eilish and Lil Nas X — the most-nominated acts Sunday — won their first Grammys of their careers and have a chance to win more, though a cloud loomed over this year's awards. Ten days before arguably the biggest night in music, the industry erupted when the Recording Academy announced it had put its recently hired CEO, Deborah Dugan, on administrative leave for alleged misconduct. Dugan and her lawyers fired back at the academy, claiming that the awards show is rigged. Tarriona ""Tank"" Ball of the New Orleans soul-funk band Tank and the Bangas, nominated for best new artist, said she's not letting the drama ruin the achievement for her band. ""I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be at, and I don't want anything taking away from all the nominees,"" Ball said. ""This is our moment. This is our time."" Alicia Keys is once again hosting the Grammys, which air live from the Staples Center. The show will be jam-packed with performances, including Ariana Grande, BTS, Camila Cabello, Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers, DJ Khaled, Rosalia, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, Tyler, the Creator, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, John Legend and Cyndi Lauper. The show will also include special tributes to Prince and longtime Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich, who is wrapping up his career with the show Sunday. Lizzo, who walked into the show the most nominated with eight, will also perform. Her major-label debut, Cuz I Love You, is nominated for album of the year along with projects from Grande, Lana Del Rey, Vampire Weekend, H.E.R., Bon Iver, Eilish and Lil Nas X. Lizzo's No. 1 hit, Truth Hurts, is also up for song and record of the year. Eilish, who will perform, also scored song and record of the year nods for her No. 1 hit, Bad Guy. Other record of the year nominees include Lil Nas X's Old Town Road, Grande's 7 Rings, Post Malone and Swae Lee's Sunflower, H.E.R.'s Hard Place, Bon Iver's Hey, Ma and Khalid's Talk. Taylor Swift was shut out of album and record of the year, but she did score a nod for song of the year — a songwriter's award. Her tune Lover is nominated against Truth Hurts, Bad Guy, Hard Place, Lady Gaga's Always Remember Us This Way from A Star Is Born, Lewis Capaldi's Someone You Loved, Lana Del Rey's Norman F--king Rockwell and Tanya Tucker's Bring My Flowers Now, which was co-written by Brandi Carlile. The Grammys will hand out roughly 10 awards during the live show. Most of the 84 awards are given out before the live show. Presenters this year include Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Billy Porter, Trevor Noah, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, Cynthia Erivo, Ava DuVernay, Shania Twain and Common. Drake, Shawn Mendes, Jessie Reyez and Alberta's Indigenous singing group Northern Cree were among the Canadian performers left empty-handed on music's biggest night in Los Angeles. All the Canadian contenders, who also included Michael Bublé and Daniel Caesar, were competing in categories that were presented before the live show. Steve Wood, co-founder of Northern Cree, didn't win best regional roots music album, which means the group is now zero-for-nine on the Grammys count. But he's not sweating another loss for the group, he said, because the Grammys offer an opportunity to shine in other ways. He's looking forward to showcasing First Nations cultures and fashion on a global scale. ""It's always a win for us when we represent our people in circles where we're getting our voice out,"" Wood said by phone shortly before stepping onto the Grammys red carpet.

91,Wawmeesh Hamilton,2020-01-26T15:00:00.172Z,"Urban Indigenous people forgotten in UNDRIP talks, say advocates","City-dwellers are being left out of consultations about the implementation of the UN Declaration of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) even though the majority of B.C.'s Indigenous people live in cities, according to the president of a group that advocates for urban Indigenous political interests in B.C.  Scott Clark, president of the Northwest Indigenous Council, says the majority of B.C.'s Indigenous people live in cities, yet their opinions and concerns are often not given as much weight as those living on reserves.  ""[Seventy-eight] per cent of Indigenous people live off-reserve, but we're being ghosted by the powers that be,"" said Clark. Last year, Clark says he tried attending a First Nations Leadership Council meeting with provincial government officials about UNDRIP, but was excluded. According to Clark, the council is made up of on-reserve groups but has no off-reserve representation. He says the incident highlights a crucial gap in consultations. Clark says he's spoken to a council representative, and hopes to meet soon to discuss off-reserve interests. In November, B.C. became the first jurisdiction in Canada to pass a law requiring the provincial government to align its policies and laws with the UN declaration.  What does 'implementing UNDRIP' actually mean? According to Métis lawyer Patricia Barkaskas, governments tend to consult with First Nations governing bodies or on-reserve umbrella groups like the B.C. Leadership Council. But urban Indigenous people have distinct concerns. Whether those concerns are included in consultations will determine how UNDRIP will apply to them. ""Governments, including Indigenous governments, have an opportunity to actually be accountable to Indigenous people in a way that includes all voices,"" Barkaskas said. ""Anything less than that is going to be deeply flawed."" UNDRIP consists of 46 articles ratified by the United Nations, and recognizes the basic human rights of Indigenous people and their rights to self-determination. In December, a month after the B.C. legislature passed Bill 41, the federal Liberal government announced that it hoped to pass UNDRIP legislation by the end of this year. Several UNDRIP articles revolve around land and traditional territory, including: But while urban Indigenous people don't live on their traditional lands, they still have inherent rights and specific interests that should be accommodated in UNDRIP application, Barkaskas says. More than 60,000 Indigenous people live in Metro Vancouver, many of them in East Vancouver. Collectively, they function similarly to an Indigenous community, and therefore should be consulted about policy, culture and even the environment, says Barkaskas. ""Why wouldn't our inherent rights to the environment be just as present if we live in an urban centre as if we live on what is ancestral and traditional territory?"" she said. Also, Indigenous rights are inherent in Indigenous people, and aren't relinquished when those people leave their First Nations, Barkaskas says. ""Whether that community is in an urban space or not doesn't diminish that inherent jurisdiction.""  In an urban context, Clark said implementing UNDRIP could mean creating designated urban Indigenous representatives on city councils, school boards and park boards.  In February, the Northwest Indigenous Council plans to host UNDRIP forums for urban Indigenous people in Victoria, Nanaimo and Courtenay. A report with final recommendations will be submitted afterward to the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples and key federal and provincial ministers. If Indigenous and non-Indigenous governments aren't going to accommodate the specific interests of urban Indigenous people, then they're discriminating against them, Clark says.  ""We won't see real change until the governments start actively working with off-reserve representative organizations to fully implement those changes."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/urban-indigenous-undrip-1.5436278,[],N/A

Dong, a Canadian citizen, was scheduled to fly back to Taiwan on January 27, but is now hunkered down at her relatives' home as the virus spreads. ""I'm worried so much, I can't sleep every day. Every day if she can't get out, she's [in] danger. She's my only daughter so I'm so concerned about that,"" Lu said. Forty-two people have died from the coronavirus, which now infects 1,400 people and has been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. Canada announced its first ""presumptive"" case of the coronavirus on Saturday.  Wuhan, a city with a population of about 11 million, has been put on lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading, a public health measure the World Health Organization called ""unprecedented."" Public transit in the city has been shuttered, and as of Saturday, officials had banned most vehicles, including private cars, from the downtown area. Speaking from her cellphone, Dong said she hasn't gone outside since the lockdown began, but from her windows she sees few people in the streets, all of them donning medical masks. ""I have no idea when I will be able to leave here,"" she said. ""I'm in a dangerous situation."" Dong says she now spends her days holed up inside, monitoring the news and WeChat, and checking in with her mother in Vancouver. Her family has begun stockpiling food. She's hoping Canada will move to evacuate its citizens from the region. ""I want to know what the government is going to do for Canadians in Wuhan. So far they haven't taken any action,"" she said. ""We can't just stay at home and hope that the officials help us."" The United States is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan. France has also announced plans to evacuate citizens. In a statement, Global Affairs Canada said it is ""closely monitoring the situation. We take the safety and security of Canadians abroad very seriously.""

There are currently 67 Canadians in Hubei who have registered with the Registration of Canadians Abroad Service. Registration with the service is voluntary and doesn't accurately reflect the number of Canadians in the region. Lu is now contacting American embassies, hoping her daughter can secure a seat on the American plane set to leave on Sunday, calling her plight ""urgent."" ""That's the only hope for her to get out.

A report by the city's comptroller said two employees had suffered psychological harassment at the borough office.

Here's what's changing,"The nearly century-old Woodstock Colonial Restaurant in Paradise is reopening at the end of the month under a new owner — who's making a few changes. Brendon O'Rourke is renaming the restaurant, which opened in 1927, the Woodstock Public House and making some additions to the menu, although much of the dining room's esthetic will remain the same. He said he's excited about what lies ahead. ""It's kind of more than I had anticipated, or more than I thought I would genuinely ever have. But here we are, about to embark on quite the adventure, I think,"" he said. ""I never really had the ambitions of having, you know, that small hole in the wall on Water Street or anything like that. I always wanted to be a little further outside of town."" O'Rourke said the restaurant will focus on tried and true Newfoundland recipes. ""If you look at what the food trends and who the popular restaurateurs are in town, they're not importing very much of their product at all. So that's going to be where I'm starting."" Part of that starting point will involve bringing game back to the menu. He said customers can expect moose, seal and ""everything from crab to mussels and squid."" Some things will remain exactly the same, like Mary's tea room, a chamber in the restaurant that, according to O'Rourke, has carried that name since the 1960s. He said he played with the idea of repurposing the room until he heard about its history.

The bank rate is two per cent and the deposit rate is 1.5 per cent. In a statement about the decision, the bank said ""the global economy is showing signs of stabilization, and some recent trade developments have been positive."" However, it also noted that geo-political issues have emerged ""with tragic consequences,"" referencing the crash of flight PS752 in Iran, which ended the lives of 57 Canadians and many others with ties to Canada. The bank said the Canadian economy has been strong but with mixed indicators since its last major update with October's Monetary Policy Report. ""The Bank now estimates growth of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Exports fell in late 2019, and business investment appears to have weakened after a strong third quarter.""  While some of the slowdown late last year is being chalked up to a strike at CN Rail and an outage at the Keystone pipeline, the central bank says the weaker figures could also signal that global uncertainty is affecting Canada more than previously predicted. The picture the bank painted in its report Wednesday was a sharp contrast from its last look at the economy, when a degree of domestic resilience remained in spite of weaker data points outside Canada's borders. There is ""considerable uncertainty"" about how long household spending may stay soft, the report said, as households are expected to be more cautious with their spending decisions and save more in the face of high levels of debt — all this despite a federal tax cut that kicked in on Jan. 1 and growth in wages. James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, said in a written statement that the rate decision was expected, but the dovish tone was not, indicating that ""the data could be signaling something more pernicious than its baseline forecasts assume."" Marple's statement said the bank's announcement was consistent with TD's expectations that there will be a 25 basis point cut in the overnight rate later this year.  ""A softening economic outlook alongside tighter financial conditions is a recipe for pushing the Canadian economy further below potential and weakening inflation, conditions the Bank of Canada will not ignore, as it made obvious today."" The report said ratification of the new North American free trade deal — a top priority for the Trudeau Liberals now that the U.S. and Mexico have completed their processes — and a partial trade detente between the United States and China should help stoke economic fires in Canada. Growth for 2021 is forecast at two per cent, up from the bank's October forecast of 1.8 per cent. The outlook for the economy could change if the Trump administration follows through on threats to slap tariffs on France, Brazil and Argentina.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-holds-interest-rates-steady-1.5435927,[],N/A

101,Jordan Gill,2020-01-24T12:25:12.666Z,Tiny Kincardine keeps a 'colony' of Scots alive,"New Brunswick has a lot of people claiming Scottish heritage, but a hamlet in the Upper St. John River Valley is probably the most committed to celebrating its connection to Scotland.  Kincardine, along with neighbouring Upper and Lower Kintore and Bon Accord, make up what's known as the ""Scotch Colony."" Kincardine is the cultural hub, with the church, old one-room schoolhouse and the Burns Hall acting as the local stomping grounds for concerts, plays and the annual Burns Night, held in honour of Robert Burns, Scotland's national bard. Kincardine's dinner is tonight, but many dinners elsewhere will be held Saturday, on the 18th-century poet's birthday. Darlene Morton said that even though Kincardine has changed demographically, its Scottish heart beats strong. ""There are only a few of us left now that are descended from the original settlers,"" she said.  ""But the people who have moved in are amazing, because a lot of them become part of it. Even though they might not have a drop of Scottish blood in them."" The community had an inauspicious beginning. It was founded by settlers largely from the Scottish county Kincardineshire. Many of them soon came to regret the trip. ""There were two boatloads of settlers that came in 1873 and in 1874, and when they got here they found it wasn't what was promised,"" said Morton. The settlement was the brainchild of Capt. William Brown, a Scot who wanted to develop a colony in New Brunswick. He and his business partners travelled to New Brunswick, which, like all of the Dominion of Canada, was desperate for immigrants. The province showed the group a number of locations, and Brown chose a tract of land on the St. John River between the Carleton-Victoria County line and the Tobique River. The province promised to clear lots for the newcomers and to build log cabins for them as well. On April 25, 1873, a ship set sail for New Brunswick with 530 Scots aboard. When they arrived in Victoria County in May they quickly realized what they were promised hadn't materialized. ""They were supposed to have houses prepared for them,"" said Garth Farquhar, the area's ""unofficial"" historian. ""I think there were only three ready, ""And one of those was underwater because it was in the early spring and Muniac [Stream] was high. So it was quite disappointing for them.""  The next year even more Scottish immigrants arrived in the area, exceeding 600 at one point. Some, not getting what they were promised, moved to other parts of Canada and the United States. But those who stayed behind stuck hard to their Scottish roots, building Presbyterian churches and starting Burns Day Celebrations. Burns Day, or Burns Night, celebrations are a staple of communities both in Scotland, and among the Scottish diaspora. A supper often includes the eating of haggis, a dish made of sheep organs, among other things, stuffed in a sheep's stomach and piped into the dining hall, where Burns's Address to a Haggis is recited. Kincardine forgoes this culinary tradition. The heart of the Burns Day Celebrations is Kincardine's Burns Hall, a small structure on what locals call the ""lower road,"" built in 1911 and funded through the sale of shares. Except for a few years when work had to be done on the building's foundation, the hall has held Burns Night ever since, along with a variety of other Scottish cultural events. Mavis Smith, who has lived in ""the colony"" all her 92 years, said Scottish culture and Robbie Burns were always present in her life. While she remembers the songs and dancing, she personally participated in ""dialogues"" or roasting of other townsfolk. ""Get up there and try to make it funny,"" said Smith.  ""Sometimes you talked about your neighbours and things you know and told stories, made up lies about them and see how they did enjoy it."" Like all of rural New Brunswick, Kincardine has changed over the years. The community is smaller, there are no open schools, and the churches are only open in the summer. The makeup of the community has also changed, boasting people with English, Danish, Swedish and even Japanese ancestry. But they, too, help keep the Scottish traditions alive.  Morton, whose grandfather built the Burns Hall, said the reason for that is simple: they're a fun group of people. ""We have a good time practising for Burns,"" said Morton.  ""We have a great choir and it's not a very well-behaved choir. The director, she has a hard time keeping us in line, but we have a lot of fun.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/kincardine-scottish-robbie-burns-1.5436500,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/robert-burns-day-statue-1.4503130 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/burns-night-2017-1.3949610,N/A

104,Michael Gorman,2019-12-18T10:00:00.750Z,N.S. won't protect land with 'globally rare' ecosystem that company eyes for golf resort,"In the tiny community of Little Harbour on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore sits 285 hectares of coastal Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. The name is misleading: it's not actually a provincial park and there are no obvious markings or trails to enter the coastal barrens and wetlands. But the headland, which has been managed as a park reserve, is notable for some of its characteristics. According to the province, it's one of nine sites in Nova Scotia with a ""globally rare"" ecosystem and home to several endangered species. For six years, Owls Head has been one of the provincial properties awaiting legal protection. But that changed last March when, after several years of lobbying by and discussions with a private developer who wants to acquire the land as part of a plan to build as many as three golf courses, the Treasury Board quietly removed the designation, according to records CBC News received in response to an access-to-information request. This sets up the latest situation in Nova Scotia where conservation and environmental protection efforts appear poised to collide with economic development interests as the developer hopes to bring the kind of tourist attraction and job opportunities to the Eastern Shore that Inverness is realizing from the Cabot Links and Cabot Cliffs golf courses. The decision to de-list Owls Head was made using a minute letter, which is protected by cabinet confidentiality and thus not available for the public to see. Government documents, however, make clear a plan which, until now, has been unknown to the public. Lighthouse Links Development Company, which is owned by American couple Beckwith Gilbert and his wife, Kitty, is behind the proposal. They already own 138 hectares of land next to the Owls Head property. Gilbert has a background in merchant banking and has been heavily involved in medical research. He was not available for an interview, but in an emailed statement he said the couple fulfilled ""a dream to own and preserve an unspoiled, natural ocean beach"" when they started buying land in Little Harbour 16 years ago. As he and his wife got to know the community, Gilbert said ""it became quickly apparent that additional employment opportunities in the area were needed to encourage people to move to the Eastern Shore, rather than move away."" The idea for one golf course blossomed into two or three after talking to architects, he said. ""They emphasized that multiple adjacent courses were necessary to achieve profitable operations. Since we didn't have enough land for more than one course, we approached the province and proposed acquiring their unused adjacent land."" Gilbert's vision, according to a letter sent on his behalf to then-natural resources minister Lloyd Hines's executive assistant in 2016, which CBC obtained, is for something similar to the Cabot resort or Bandon Dunes golf resort in Oregon. Chris Miller, a conservation biologist and executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, called the proposal ""deeply concerning."" Miller said the land is important because of how much there is, allowing for more extensive ecosystems than what is typically found along the coast and because so little of the province's coast is publicly owned and protected. ""It's a place where conservation values and nature need to come first and human and economic development is only within the context of protecting those values,"" he said. Like Miller, Nova Scotia Nature Trust executive director Bonnie Sutherland said she had no idea about the change in designation, which still has not been updated on the provincial website. Sutherland's organization was intending to include Owls Head as part of its 100 Wild Islands project, which aims to protect the archipelago off the Eastern Shore. About 85 per cent of that work is complete. ""We're very surprised and disappointed,"" she said. ""To lose that habitat is very significant."" Sutherland pointed to the endangered species known to live and, in some cases, nest on the land, including piping plovers and barn swallows. Other species of ""conservation concern"" known to be there, according to government documents, include the ruby-crowned kinglet and common eider. There are ""unique boreal and temperate plants and lichens"" and Owls Head is one of nine sites in the province with ""the globally rare coastal broom crowberry heathland ecosystem,"" said the documents. But Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin said the government was comfortable removing the designation because the land isn't a priority for legal protection. By removing the designation, the government can now have the land appraised and begin more formal negotiations for a potential sale, said Rankin. The final decision was made by weighing the option to protect with the potential for economic development in a rural area, he said. ""There isn't high biodiversity value when you compare [it] to other pieces of land that we've advanced [for legal protection],"" said Rankin. He said the decision would not affect the government's ability to reach its goal of legal protection of 13 per cent of all Nova Scotia land. The golf project has had the support of Central Nova MP Sean Fraser and Eastern Shore MLA Kevin Murphy. In August 2018, the company hired former provincial Liberal cabinet minister Michel Samson to lobby on its behalf. Owls Head isn't the only Crown land Lighthouse Links wants to acquire. The province is in negotiations with the federal government on behalf of the company to buy about 17 hectares of surplus Crown land next to Owls Head that's home to an automated light beacon and helipad. Ottawa would keep 0.09 hectares, including the helipad and light, and sell the rest to the province for $167,500. Originally the land was offered for $1, but that required the province to use it for a public purpose. Had the province not engaged Ottawa on the offer, the land would have gone to public sale. An order in council approving that negotiation was passed in August (unlike minute letters, orders in council are posted online). Rankin said he sees the company's proposal as a good opportunity and said any kind of development would still have to respect the applicable environmental regulations. ""I see golf courses coexisting with opportunities for protecting the environment,"" he said. Miller, who said such a development would irreparably alter Owls Head, disagrees. There remain about 90 properties with pending protected status from the Parks and Protected Areas Plan of 2013 and Miller has repeatedly called on the province to confer legal protection to all of them, a move that would result in about 14 per cent of Nova Scotia's land being protected. ""The government has been dragging its feet and this is exactly the problem,"" he said. ""The longer it goes before the legal designation is applied, the more and more likely that it's going to get chipped away and that one site here will get tossed [and] another site will get tossed. ""Some economic opportunity of this or that will come along and before you know it the entire plan is undermined."" A spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said officials are unaware of any other negotiations or requests from private parties for land on the Parks and Protected Areas list that hasn't been approved yet for protection.

105,Cody MacKay,2020-01-24T21:03:59.444Z,Wing and a prayer: How a P.E.I. beekeeper hopes to keep his hives alive this winter,"After months of research and studying, a beekeeper in Mermaid, P.E.I., is taking a few extra steps this winter to try and keep his hives alive. Troy Fraser has 15 hives huddled together along the treeline of a snowy, sprawling field near his home. Yellow and black speckles dot the snow drifts near and beneath the hives — the sight of dead and dying bees.  Seeing a scene like this is common in winter, he says, though, he's hoping to see less death as a result of some quilt boxes, candy boards and mouse guards installed in each hive. ""With fingers crossed and a lot of praying I'm hoping that at least 10 of these survive, given the statistics,"" Fraser said. ""If I get all 15 hives coming through winter, and I know three or four of them were definitely weak, there may be something to say about that."" The statistics he references are from an annual loss report by the Canadian Association of Professional Agriculturists. It studies and educates on beekeeping and has members across the country. The association's latest survey, released in July 2019, shows that reported winter losses of bee colonies on P.E.I. were the highest in the country, at 54.1 per cent. Second to P.E.I. was B.C. at 31.9 per cent. Moisture, as a result of weather, and starvation were the top bee killers in winter, as reported by the Islanders in that survey. Evidence like that led Fraser to build and install the additions to his hives. ""I can only speculate as to why other beekeepers have lost their colonies,"" Fraser said. ""Bees can handle the cold no problem, that's never an issue. They need proper ventilation."" Fixed on the top of each hive is what's called a quilt box, which is filled with wood shavings that absorb moisture created by the bees within the structure. Toonie-sized holes drilled into the side of box allow air in to dry out the moisture, so it doesn't drip back down into the hive. Meanwhile, a candy board, as it's called, has also been placed in the hives. Before winter, the bees store food in their hive but sometimes they may not store enough. The candy board acts as emergency feed for the cluster of bees, each one packed with pounds of sugar. ""Usually bees pack away enough food, but if the beekeeper knows a hive is small or underfed, a candy board is a good way to ensure they have enough,"" Fraser said. The hives also have a mouse guard — a thin metal plate with arched entrances at the bottom. It's wide enough for bees to come and go and tiny enough so rodents can't get in. The additions to the hives are an effort to counter each of the top winter threats facing bees. In that light, Fraser's boxes in particular act as a one-two punch ""insurance policy"" for his hives, he said, that'll hopefully lead to low mortality rates during the winter. He handmade the quilt boxes and candy boards at an approximate cost of $37 per hive. With 15 hives that's roughly $555 out of pocket, which isn't too hard to absorb for a smaller operation like his. Larger bee farms with over 100 hives may not be able to make that investment, he said, but he does have a neighbour nearby with that many who's taken an keen interest in what he's doing. Jeff Reissner has a 100-hive operation in Bethel, which is just a stretch from Mermaid. He knows Fraser from work, and the two bonded over their love for beekeeping.

He was with friends at a Gilmour Street Airbnb when intruders broke in around 7:30 a.m. and started firing. Three other people were shot, including a 15-year-old boy.  Akol, who was a recording artist, also went by the name FTG Metro.  The Ball 4 Metro event at La Cité was organized by Prezdential Basketball and The House Podcast, which is about the Ottawa neighbourhood where Akol grew up — Britannia Woods. People packed the bleachers in the gym. Many wore t-shirts with a picture of Akol and the word ""Metroworld"" written on them. A moment of silence for Akol was also held before the game. ""We're just providing an opportunity for as [many] people as possible to get into one location and heal,"" said Manock Lual with Prezdential Basketball, a training company that also does social outreach work.  ""When tragic things happen, you don't have the opportunity right away to express yourself. So this is an opportunity for everybody that has been affected by the situation to come here today and just express themselves through healing and through unity,"" said Lual.   Lual said he wants Akol's family to know the community is prepared to help. ""When this happened, I wanted to do something…we felt like we couldn't sit back,"" said Lual who has also worked with Akol's brother.  ""I think that he was a powerful soul for sure.""  ""He was the type of person that made everyone smile.

107,Tom Ayers,2020-01-24T10:00:00.958Z,CBRM committee under fire for discussions behind closed doors,"Cape Breton Regional Municipality is under fire again for possibly discussing public business in private. CBRM had to backtrack on its in-camera meeting practices in 2015 and 2018, and now questions are being raised over the municipality's agenda review committee. According to CBRM's agenda policy, meeting agendas are set by the agenda review committee. It consists of the mayor, deputy mayor and three senior staff and, under its terms of reference, the committee sets the agendas for council or committee meetings. However, no records of the committee's deliberations exist. Cape Breton University political scientist Tom Urbaniak said, under the Municipal Government Act, committees have to follow the same rules as council. ""If the agenda-setting committee is meeting as a committee, then the CBRM does have the obligation to tell the public when that meeting is happening and for that meeting to be open to the public,"" he said. In addition, Urbaniak said the agenda committee seems to be straying beyond its mandate. According to policy, the committee can add items to an upcoming agenda, defer them to a later meeting, or refer the topic to another committee or level of government. However, at a public meeting earlier this month, Mayor Cecil Clarke told councillors the details of a proposed youth council, contained in a staff issue paper, had been decided on by the agenda committee before coming to council. ""At the agenda setting, we talked about that in terms of definition and we defined youth to be any youth residing in the CBRM,"" Clarke told council. In interviews, the municipality's solicitor and chief administrative officer said the committee is not shaping policy. However, CAO Marie Walsh said the committee might make ""tweaks"" on wording or grammar. In an interview, the mayor said any changes the committee makes are simply to clarify the meaning. For example, he said, the agenda committee recently changed the wording of a staff report that said the proposed youth council could ask CBRM council for financial resources. Instead, the committee changed the wording to say the youth council could ask for support, to include the possibility of in-kind or other non-financial resources, Clarke said. ""So that's cleaning it up, as opposed to changing any of the fundamentals,"" he said. ""Any of that housekeeping that might come up when you're reviewing a document is meant, which it should be, so that when you consider it, it's in the best form possible."" Clarke said CBRM's agenda committee is not really a committee of council and does not have to be open to the public, and the Department of Municipal Affairs agrees. However, Urbaniak said council itself calls the agenda committee a committee, and he said that ""changes the game.""

First Nation to declare state of emergency","A string of drug and gang-related violence has prompted leaders of Onion Lake Cree Nation (OLCN) to declare a state of emergency. The community has experienced three deaths apparently connected to drug and gang activity in the last two months and there have been several high-speed chases and violent crimes. Officials at a news conference Friday said more needs to be done to address addictions, housing and other issues. But in the short term, the community needs more police to stop the violence. ""Right now, we are trying to deal with the immediate situation, how we can curb the fear among this nation,"" OLCN Okimaw (Chief) Henry Lewis said in a news conference Friday. The community of 4,000 people, which straddles the Saskatchewan-Alberta border just north of Lloydminster, already has 13 RCMP along with band security staff, but they're ""maxed out,"" Lewis said. Lewis said they need more police, especially ones with gang and drug expertise. Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) vice-chief Edward Dutch Lerat agreed safety must come first.. ""Every citizen of the nation deserves to greet each day knowing that their children, their families and their relatives are safe from illegal drug activity and violent crimes,"" Lerat said, pledging the FSIN's support. OLCN leaders say that in the space of a few hours on Tuesday, Jan. 21, RCMP were involved in a high-speed chase, a missing man's body was discovered and a stolen vehicle ran into the side of the OLCN Arena. RCMP are investigating the sudden death that happened in the community on Tuesday. The band held an emergency meeting and says it wants the government to help it create a gang strategy and increase police resources. ""The RCMP are working hard and trying their best but they need more help,"" said OLCN Okimaw (Chief) Henry Lewis in a release earlier Friday. ""Their resources are stretched too thin and our community needs the support of both levels of government before it gets worse.""  Lewis said they need more help to combat the gang activity in the community. ""This problem has been steadily increasing over the last year and it is now to the point that we are having three very serious and scary incidences happening in one day,"" he said. ""Everyone is stretched to their limits. We need the government to come to our tables and help us create a gang strategy and find solutions that will work for our nation. We need to increase policing resources, bring in external gang units or whatever is necessary to help our community members feel safe."" The government of Saskatchewan said it had discussions with the RCMP about the state of emergency declared in Onion Lake.  ""The RCMP have advised that the Crime Reduction Team has been deployed to the area to help address immediate public safety concerns,"" a statement from the province said.  ""As with any resident of Saskatchewan, Onion Lake Cree Nation residents have access to all provincially-funded services to address substance misuse, including detox, outpatient, inpatient and harm reduction services."" Onion Lake RCMP and the police force's senior management team in that detachment have been in contact with the band and are assessing their response to the situation according to a statement sent to CBC News.  Indigenous Services Canada said the department was made aware of the situation on Thursday.  ""ISC's Regional Executive Officer of Saskatchewan reached out to OLCN's leadership to identify immediate needs of the community and to confirm that additional mental health counselling and prevention-based supports are available under Non-Insured Health Benefits and Jordan's Principle,"" the department said in an emailed statement.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/onion-lake-cree-nation-gangs-violence-rcmp-1.5438817,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/onion-lake-second-degree-murder-charge-1.5334512 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/onion-lake-rcmp-death-in-custody-1.5319893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/diphtheria-onion-lake-1.5436957,N/A

The global streaming company attracted 125,000 paid sign-ups in Canada during the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 2019, helped by popular TV series The Witcher and acclaimed films Marriage Story and The Irishman. Yet, while the results were an improvement over the 96,000 Canadian subscribers who joined in the third quarter, the company's subscriber growth was down from the 218,000 new members who joined during the last three months a year prior. Part of that slowdown could be attributed to the arrival of both Apple and Disney which launched their hyped streaming services within days of each other. Disney Plus, in particular, left a solid impact on pop culture when its Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian sparked an obsession with viewers over the so-called Baby Yoda character on social media. Netflix says despite the widespread attention both new streaming platforms attracted, there was a ""more muted impact from competitive launches"" outside the U.S., including in Canada. Reed Hastings, the company's chief executive, downplayed the arrival of Apple and Disney, saying in a call with investors that before they showed up a formidable competitor for viewership already existed in global powerhouse YouTube. Spencer Wang, the company's vice-president of finance, suggested the notion of the streaming wars is overplayed by outsiders. ""I know it's exciting for folks to talk about — you know the clash of the titans and all that kind of stuff — but really the big thing that's going on is a transition from linear entertainment to streaming on demand entertainment, which is really, really big,"" he said. ""It's very similar to the transition the industry went through from broadcast to cable."" The latest Canadian figures were outlined as part of a broader commitment to provide its investors with a more extensive quarterly report that fleshed out data on growth in key countries. More detailed breakdowns of its regional membership numbers and revenue cover four regions — Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East & Africa; and U.S. and Canada. The North American region was the lowest membership growth area for the streaming company, which it attributed in its financial report to ""recent price changes and to U.S. competitive launches."" Canadian revenues were higher at $241 million US in the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2019, marking an increase from nearly $164.9 million in the same period a year earlier when the company was phasing in a price increase with users across the country. Overall, Netflix added 8.8 million worldwide subscribers during its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations. Netflix had said it expected to add 7.6 million subscribers, and analysts thought the service would fare even better. The increase pales slightly next to the 8.9 million subscribers the service added in the fourth quarter of 2018. A report released Tuesday by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on the state of the country's communications industry offered further insight into the popularity of Netflix in Canada. The 2019 Communications Monitoring Report outlines that subscription-based video-on-demand services — which include Netflix, Crave and Quebec-based Club Illico — generated $2.5 billion Cdn of revenue for the entirety of 2018. Netflix was by far the largest chunk of those revenues, representing 65 per cent, while Amazon Prime Video came in a distant second with an eight-per cent share of total revenues.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-canadian-subscribers-streaming-1.5435972,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/disney-plus-subscribers-1.5358047 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-subscriber-growth-slowing-1.5323517,N/A

""One of the reasons why I think the Huawei decision in the U.K. is actually pretty strong is because the U.K. has examined this equipment. The [National Cyber Security Centre] works really closely with Huawei and it identified a lot of what it called 'shoddy' engineering,"" Sullivan said. ""Its professional judgment was that Huawei was not deliberately manipulating this equipment...so Canada should really rely on its own technical authorities to make that assessment."" The Canadian government has been debating whether or not to allow Huawei equipment in Canada's 5G networks for more than a year, with Public Safety Minister Bill Blair saying Friday that talks remain ongoing. ""The conversation that we'll have with our Five Eyes partners is important, but my first and only real priority is the safety and security of Canadians and the security of our digital environment,"" Blair said. ""That's what we're focused on and those are the issues which will inform our decision.""  In response to whether the Trump administration — which has pressured the U.K. into endorsing a total ban — would view the position as a bold move, Sullivan disagreed. ""I think [it's] a real mischaracterization from many about what the U.K. has actually done, because it has limited Huawei access to U.K. networks dramatically,"" he said. ""This debate has come down to something like it's all or nothing. It's very binary."" Sullivan said that while focusing discussions about Huawei equipment on political arguments is necessary and understandable, it's taken away from the technical conversation underpinning the debate.  ""I think a lot of people are playing quite a zero-sum game here, that just banning Huawei is the golden ticket to securing 5G networks,"" he said.

Ptesanwin — or White Buffalo Calf Woman —  is one of the sacred creation stories told by the Lakota people. Stories in Time: PTE' SA WIN, a play based on the story, is being performed on stage Saturday night as part of Saskatoon's Winterruption festival. Choreographer Chante Speidel said she hopes the crowd will learn about Lakota history, but her main goal is to inspire by reviving the story of a strong, heroic Indigenous woman. ""For those small Indigenous girls in the crowd, this is their way of saying,  'Let's do this. Let's be powerful. Let's be exactly what Ptesanwin represents and all that she is,'"" Speidel said. She said the public is learning about the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women and their over-representation in Canada's prisons, but that Indigenous women are also rising up and overcoming barriers. ""Indigenous women are reclaiming their rightful spots, taking places of power again in their communities and elsewhere,"" she said. Before and during production, the cast and crew consulted extensively with elders and spiritual leaders. This included a 19th-generation pipe carrier from the U.S., said artistic director Don Speidel. Speidel said it was important to tell this story, particularly with all the divisions in modern society. ""It relates to climate change.

113,Wallis Snowdon,2020-01-23T18:09:26.560Z,"Fracking to blame for earthquakes, seismic 'clusters' in central Alberta","An earthquake that sent tremors through central Alberta last spring — rattling homes in Red Deer and temporarily knocking out power in parts of Sylvan Lake — was caused by fracking, an investigation by provincial regulators concludes. A report by researchers with the Alberta Geological Society and the Alberta Energy Regulator examined two earthquakes near Red Deer, one on March 19, 2018, and another on March 2, 2019. Investigators determined that nearby fracking operations triggered both earthquakes and also induced other ""small clusters"" of seismic events in the area with tremors up to a magnitude of 2.0.  Fracking or hydraulic fracturing is a way of extracting natural gas that involves injecting fluid into a well under high pressure to fracture the gas-bearing rock and release the gas inside. The practice has been linked to most large earthquakes in Alberta and B.C. interior in recent decades.  Some U.S. residents have sued oil and gas companies over injuries and damage to homes caused by fracking-induced earthquakes. Still, such earthquakes are rare and because they're a relatively recent phenomenon, they are little understood, prompting questions about why they arise in some places and not others. The 2018 earthquake was 3.13 in magnitude and the ""shaking from the event was felt by some,"" the study said.  The earthquake in 2019 was significantly stronger with a magnitude of 4.18. There were reports of property damage and the ""shaking from the event was felt by many,"" the report said.  The epicentre was located about 12 kilometres south of Sylvan Lake, where the seismic activity is typically dormant, researchers said.  ""Recent events were large enough to be felt by nearby residents in Red Deer, who were between four to 10 kilometres away,"" reads the report.  ""The observation of these events in a typically seismically quiescent region was suspicious, considering the recent development of the Duvernay East Shale Basin.""  The earthquake was reported to the Alberta Energy Regulator by Calgary-based oil and gas operator Vesta Energy.  At the time, the regulator ordered Vesta Energy Ltd. to suspend hydraulic fracturing operations at the site in order to protect the public and the environment. It also ordered the Calgary-based company to submit a report on recent seismic activity in the area and specific fracturing data for the well site. The regulator has also ordered Vesta to file a plan to eliminate or reduce future seismic activity from fracturing. The report suggests further investigation is needed on the operations causing the increase in seismic activity.  For instance, previous research found that earthquakes in the Cardston region in southern Alberta were related to fluid from nearby operations flowing into fault lines. ""At least 13 new clusters of induced earthquakes are recognized,"" the study said. ""Our next steps were to better understand why this region may be susceptible to these events through comparisons to other regions where geological proxies for seismogenic potential have been identified.""  The company's website said it operates in the Joffre Duvernay shale oil basin in central Alberta and had 84 producing wells on-stream last year. ""Vesta operates in areas with potential for seismicity, and continues to take the necessary precautions to ensure compliance with Alberta Energy Regulator,"" the company said Thursday in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""Vesta has sophisticated monitoring equipment placed throughout its operating perimeter to detect seismic activity, and works with the AER as needed to report any detections of seismic events in the area.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/earthquakes-red-deer-alberta-fracking-1.5437690,[],N/A

The recently launched Wild Outside program is designed to connect teens aged 15 to 18 with the outdoors with the aim of developing conservation initiatives in their hometowns. The Canadian Conservation Corps targets those aged 18 to 30 and aims to help participants gain hands-on conservation experience and the opportunity to connect with CWF partners across the country. Wild Outside — a free program — launched earlier this month in Charlottetown, Halifax, Calgary and Toronto.  ""We just want to get youth excited about nature and conservation,"" said Irene MacAulay, Charlottetown's youth leadership specialist with the federation. ""For those youth that are already excited about nature and conservation we want to give them the tools to make an impact."" The plan is to spread the program to 16 more cities and more than 1,000 young Canadians this year. ""Starting off we're going to be doing some pretty regular conservation projects like making bat houses and doing litter cleanups,"" she said. Then participants will have the opportunity to connect with climate leaders in the region to see what particular organizations are looking for, MacAulay said. ""It'll be like a collaboration between like maybe scientists who actually know what is going on and youth who can see creative ways to fix problems."" She said there will be skating, biking and kayaking available to participants. For Charlottetown, she said the group is looking for 10 to 15 participants. ""Bigger cities have bigger groups,"" she said. MacAulay said more people are spending time on cellphones and less time outside and at the same time are becoming ""more and more stressed out about the environment."" ""We want to give them like an outlet for all this stress and anxiety about climate change,"" she said. The Wild Outside program requires participants to dedicate 120 hours over a year. MacAulay said the program wants to hold onto participants as long as possible, but people can take part for shorter periods of time. MacAulay was part of the Canadian Conservation Corps program earlier this year and through that she decided to take on her role with the Wild Outside program. ""We did a sea-kayaking adventure in Tofino. That was a big part of the conservation corps, that was 10 days,"" she said. She said after that the group spread out across Canada for various projects.

115,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:51:09.229Z,Trump administration OKs building Keystone XL pipeline on federal land,"The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump approved a right-of-way allowing the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline to be built across U.S. land, federal officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday, pushing the controversial $8 billion US project closer to construction though — court challenges still loom. The approval signed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt covers 74 kilometres of the line's route across land in Montana controlled by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said Casey Hammond, assistant secretary of the Interior Department. The 1,905-kilometre pipeline would transport more than 132 million litres (830,000 barrels) of crude oil daily from Western Canada to terminals on the Gulf Coast. Calgary-based project sponsor TC Energy said in a court filing that it wants to begin construction in the next several months, but that's sure to face more legal challenges. First proposed in 2008, the pipeline has become emblematic of the struggle between economic development and curbing the fossil fuel emissions that are causing climate change. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama rejected it, but Trump revived it and has been a strong supporter. The stretch approved Wednesday includes all federal land crossed by the line, Hammond said. Much of the rest of the route is across private land, for which TC Energy has been trying to get permissions to build on. Opponents worry burning the tar sands oil will make climate change worse, and that the pipeline could break and spill oil into waterways like Montana's Missouri River. They have filed numerous lawsuits. Hammond said Interior officials and other agencies have done a thorough review of the line's potential effects on the environment. He said TC Energy had provided detailed plans to respond to any spill from the line. ""We're comfortable with the analysis that's been done,"" Hammond said. Another oil pipeline in TC Energy's Keystone network in October spilled an estimated 1.4 million litres of oil in eastern North Dakota. The company's critics say a damaging spill from Keystone XL is inevitable given the the length of the line and the many rivers and other bodies of water it would cross beneath. An attorney for environmental groups that have sued to overturn Trump's permit for the line said they will ask the judge in the case to issue an order blocking the new approval. ""We know President Trump's permit was unconstitutional, and we have every confidence that the federal courts will set aside these approvals,"" said Steve Volker, who represents the Indigenous Environmental Network. U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana praised the administration's move. ""Trump and his administration are delivering on their promise to get this critical infrastructure project moving after years of unnecessary delays,"" the Republican lawmaker said in a statement. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana initially denied a request from environmentalists to block construction in December, because no work was immediately planned. But he also has ruled against the project, including a 2018 decision that stalled the line and prompted Trump to issue a new presidential permit for Keystone XL to cross the U.S.-Canada border. In Nebraska, the state Supreme Court removed the last major obstacle for the project in August when it ruled in favour of state regulators who had approved a route for the pipeline in 2017. Opponents had argued that regulators didn't follow all the procedures required by state law.

116,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:25:06.821Z,Psychiatrist testifies about 'rape myths' at Harvey Weinstein trial,"A forensic psychiatrist with expertise in rape trauma took the stand as a prosecution witness at former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's Manhattan rape trial on Friday, explaining why some sexual assault victims do not report attacks or avoid their abusers. Barbara Ziv, who also testified for prosecutors at entertainer Bill Cosby's 2018 sexual assault retrial, said popular views of sexual assault were often coloured by ""rape myths,"" including that rape usually occurs between strangers. Ziv said most victims of rapes and sexual assaults know their attackers, do not fight back during the attacks, and maintain contact with their attackers. She also said some resist coming forward promptly because they feel ashamed or fear retribution. ""They're hoping that this was just an aberration,"" said Ziv, who teaches at Temple University in Philadelphia. Ziv's testimony could help prosecutors show jurors why some women who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct might have stayed in contact with him after it occurred. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting two women, Mimi Haleyi and Jessica Mann, and other charges that could put him in prison for life if he were convicted. The trial is expected to last into March. Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fuelling the #MeToo movement. Weinstein has denied any nonconsensual sex, and his lawyers said in opening statements on Wednesday that emails from his accusers would show they maintained warm relations. The trial is widely seen as a watershed moment for #MeToo, in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct. On cross-examination, Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis confronted Ziv with her testimony in a separate case where a student sued her school over an alleged sexual assault. According to Cheronis, Ziv testified for the defence that had the student been conscious she could have spoken up against her attacker. But Ziv said the comment was taken out of context. Cheronis also asked Ziv if a woman could view a consensual encounter years later as nonconsensual because she had come to regret it. ""Anything is possible,"" Ziv answered. ""It's not usual."" On Thursday, actress Annabella Sciorra from The Sopranos testified that Weinstein had violently raped her in her home in the early 1990s, and then harassed her for years. While that alleged conduct occurred too long ago to support a separate rape charge against Weinstein, prosecutors hope it will show that Weinstein is a repeat sexual predator, the charge that could put him in prison for life. Sciorra testified that her encounter with Weinstein left her depressed, causing her to drink heavily and cut herself, and unable to tell her family what had happened. Under questioning from another of Weinstein's lawyers, Donna Rotunno, Sciorra acknowledged that she had not reported the alleged rape to authorities or sought medical help. ""At the time, I didn't understand that it was rape,"" she said. Cosby has been appealing his conviction and three- to 10-year prison sentence from his 2018 retrial.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-trial-sex-crimes-expert-1.5438883,https://www.cbc.ca/news/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5416145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-trial-sciorra-testimony-1.5437876 https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/actress-testifies-weinstein-raped-her-1.5438717 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,N/A
117,Philip Drost,2020-01-25T21:33:23.230Z,Tracadie the latest community to allow ATVs on streets,"ATVs are allowed on certain streets in Tracadie starting Saturday and the New Brunswick ATV Federation hopes it paves the way for more communities to do the same.  ""We're trying to make a provincewide provincial trail, which means we're trying to connect all the towns, all our clubs together, and basically be able to take vacation,"" said Roger Daigle, federation president. ATV drivers are often limited to the province's trail system, which can make it difficult to get through a town. In Tracadie, drivers will have to follow the normal rules of the road. They'll have to follow existing traffic patterns and keep to the right. Like someone driving a motorcycle, they will have to use hand signals to communicate with other drivers. Tracadie isn't the first community to allow ATVs on its roads. Bathurst started doing it in 2019. Luc Foulem, the spokesperson for Bathurst, said it's been going well. ""It's an added bonus, it's an added incentive for people to come into town, so you do get increased traffic,"" said Foulem. Foulem said the city hasn't gotten the numbers back yet, but he believes there has been a spike in people coming through the community. Daigle said it's a big victory for the federation when a new town allows ATVs access to roads, but his eyes are on the road ahead.  He said Edmundston was one of the first to open up its roads over a year ago. Other communities that allow ATVs on some streets include Blackville, Sussex, Shippagan, Miramichi, Dalhousie, Sackville, according to Daigle. There are others as well. More communities are planning to open their streets, Daigle said. ""New Brunswick is just on the verge of being one of those places, one of those destinations, where [ATVs are] going to be a big part of tourism,"" said Daigle. He wants to see Moncton, Saint John and Fredericton allow ATVs on some of their roads as well.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/tracadie-atv-roads-1.5440606,[],N/A
118,Aly Thomson,2020-01-24T20:44:47.767Z,Man convicted in 'atrocious' stabbing death maintains innocence,"A man convicted in the stabbing death of Nadia Gonzales in Dartmouth, N.S., more than two years ago maintained his innocence Friday as he was sentenced to life in prison. A jury found Calvin Joel Sparks and Samanda Rose Ritch, both in their 20s, guilty of first-degree murder in December following a six-week trial in Nova Scotia Supreme Court. The conviction carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years. In handing down the mandatory sentence, Justice Christa Brothers said Gonzales, 35, was stabbed approximately 40 times in her head, neck, back and legs at an apartment building in Dartmouth on June 16, 2017. Brothers said her body was then stuffed into a black duffel bag. ""The sheer number of stab wounds … inflicted on Ms. Gonzales suggests a degree of brutality that is almost, and is, unfathomable,"" said Brothers. ""This was a violent, horrific and atrocious attack."" During the trial, the Crown had argued Sparks enlisted Ritch's help to kill Gonzales — a mother of two girls — after his drug-dealing business relationship with her soured. Both Sparks and Ritch addressed the court. Looking toward Gonzales's family and friends in the gallery of the courtroom, Ritch apologized. ""I'm learning a lesson and I'm learning it hard,"" she said. ""All I can do is ask forgiveness from her family and from the Lord."" But Sparks maintained his innocence.  ""I am not a murderer,"" said Sparks, adding that witnesses lied and that the jury did not treat his case fairly. ""I am going to fight for my innocence."" Seven victim impact statements were submitted as part of the sentencing hearing. Six were read aloud in court. Kaylee Gonzales, the victim's teenage daughter, cried as she told the court her mother will never get to see her graduate, get married or have children. ""Being 15 and my mom getting ripped away from my life is the worst thing that will ever happen to me,"" she said. ""She is my world and always will be."" Gonzales's mother, Irene Gonzales, said her life will never be the same. ""It's a daily struggle not to fall into a deep depression,"" she said through tears.  ""Our family is haunted day and night with the memory of what they have both done.... Her life was not for either of them to take away."" Other family and friends described Gonzales as a loving mother, sister, daughter and friend who cared deeply for those around her. Crown lawyer Robert Kennedy said it has been a difficult 2½ years for the Gonzales family and Sparks's comments were disappointing. ""It's unfortunate in circumstances like this, where in the Crown's view the evidence was overwhelming in relation to Mr. Sparks's guilt, that he is not expressing any degree of remorse or accountability for his actions,"" Kennedy said outside of court. Sparks and Ritch were credited with 952 days for time spent in custody. Sparks was also convicted of unlawfully causing bodily harm in relation to stabbing injuries suffered by John Patterson, who was with Gonazles at the time of the killing. Sparks was sentenced to four years in prison for that charge, to be served concurrently with his life sentence.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nadia-gonzales-stabbing-murder-sentencing-calvin-sparks-samanda-ritch-1.5439636,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forestry-loans-credit-union-contractors-1.5439410 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/n-s-man-charged-with-human-trafficking-1.5439612 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/doctor-manivasan-moodley-misconduct-patients-cape-breton-1.5439368,N/A
119,Mike Crawley,2020-01-24T09:00:00.711Z,How the hospital in Christine Elliott's riding copes with overcrowding,"When Health Minister Christine Elliott needs to see Ontario's hallway medicine problem in action, she doesn't need to travel very far, as one of the province's most overcrowded hospitals is in her riding.  Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket is one of Ontario's largest, with 502 beds. It's also among the hospitals most frequently filled beyond capacity, according to an investigation by CBC News into the hallway healthcare situation province-wide. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health show that Southlake was over capacity for all but seven days in the first half of 2019. In that time period, the hospital's average daily occupancy ran at 110 per cent. That did not improve in the second half of the year, according to figures provided by the hospital, averaging 113 per cent. A visit to Southlake this month reveals patients housed in a range of what are officially called ""unconventional spaces,"" including a former exercise gym. Here the beds are separated by portable surgical screens, the makeshift nursing station is a collection of desks and tables mostly covered with medical supplies, and there's no bathroom, so patients have to walk down the hall.  Patients who spoke to CBC News in the exercise room said it was better than staying in Southlake's crowded emergency room, but less than ideal.  ""The elderly people, it's got to be real tough on them,"" said patient Ron Dane, who spent two days in the ER before getting an overflow spot in the gym. ""Obviously, there's a long way to go to get up to the standard of care that we should really expect.""  The nursing manager who covers the overflow areas at Southlake doesn't disagree with him.  ""This is not the optimal place to be providing care,"" said Tammy Rogers, who also manages the rehab and neurological units' discharge planning group. ""We don't have the same access to the equipment as you would on a set-up acute medical floor.""   Rogers praises her nursing team for their dedication.   ""I am forever thankful to them for the work that they do every day,"" she said during an interview in a kitchenette that's become the latest spot to put patients, a space that staff call the pantry.   ""I know it's not easy for them to come here to work when we're opening up a pantry or putting patients in the hallway, that's not why they became a nurse,"" she said. ""They give it 150 per cent. They still provide excellent care to our patients and I'm sure at the end of the day they're not always happy with what's happening.""  Rogers said there have been patients in the hallway on her floor daily for the previous two weeks.  No one on Southlake's staff is content with the overcrowding, from the nurses to the hospital's chief executive.  ""It's a very difficult situation for patients,"" said Arden Krystal, the hospital's president and CEO.  ""When I see patients in areas such as our gym, I think about how would I feel if that was my Dad in that bed,"" Krystal said in an interview with CBC News.  ""I wouldn't feel that good about it. I would be disappointed.""  The perpetual overcrowding at Southlake means hospital staff are daily putting anywhere from 20 to 50 patients into spaces that were not intended for patient care.  But that's not the only way the hospital tries to cope with the demand for beds.  Like many hospitals in Ontario, Southlake has large numbers of older patients occupying beds who don't actually need acute care, but can't leave the hospital because they need more care than they can receive at home. They're known as ""alternate level of care"" patients (ALC).  Last March saw the launch of a program called Southlake@home, designed to provide enough support to ALC patients outside the hospital walls so that they could be discharged more promptly. The hospital partnered directly with home-care providers, a community support service agency, and family doctors to ensure the necessary services were made available. The program has helped more than 200 patients make the transition out of the hospital, and has reduced their re-admission rates.  ""We've had great success with that,"" said Krystal. ""But no sooner do we get some people home than there's a whole pile more waiting to come in."" The key challenge for Ontario hospitals, said Krystal, has been figuring out how to cope without additional bed capacity. ""No matter how great a job we do in moving people into the community and keeping them healthier, the sheer growth that we've had in Ontario means that we need more hospital beds,"" she said.   The number of acute-care beds in the province has essentially remained the same for 20 years, while the province's population has grown by three million.  Elliott — who is the Progressive Conservative MPP for Newmarket-Aurora as well as Premier Doug Ford's health minister —  says the government would like to see the Southlake@home program replicated in other hospitals around the province. ""We recognize the difficulties that hospitals are experiencing,"" Elliott said in an interview. ""I'm sorry that anybody has to receive health care in a hallway. They should be in a hospital bed in a hospital room.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hallway-medicine-hospital-southlake-regional-1.5437444,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-mental-health-1.5436476 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hallway-medicine-hospitals-overcrowding-northeastern-ontario-1.5437347 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/hallway-medicine-unfortunate-reality-for-guelph-general-hospital-1.5435015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-general-hospital-health-care-over-capacity-1.5436703,N/A
120,Anonymous,2020-01-25T01:52:36.917Z,Province sets up special website dedicated to China's coronavirus outbreak,"New Brunswick's Department of Health has set up a special page to inform residents about China's coronavirus outbreak.  With cases continuing to rise, the virus has killed 41 people and sickened hundreds.  The New Brunswick website offers insight about the virus and how it's been identified.  ""The current situation is evolving,"" the website says. ""More information is expected to emerge in the coming days and weeks."" No cases of the virus have been confirmed in Canada. The federal Public Health Agency has assessed the public health risk associated with the coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV, in Wuhan, China, and considers it low for Canada and Canadian travellers. The coronavirus family includes the common cold as well as viruses that cause more serious illnesses, such as the SARS outbreak that spread from China to more than a dozen countries in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people, and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS, which is thought to have originated from camels. In an email to colleagues within the department, Chief Medical Officer of Health Jennifer Russell said the Government of Canada, provinces and territories, have ""multiple systems in place to identify, prevent and control the spread of serious infectious diseases into and within Canada."" She said additional border screening measures are also being implement at major international airports. ""We continue to actively monitor and prepare for this evolving situation and engage with federal and other provincial public health authorities,"" she said in the email. On Dec. 31, a ""cluster"" of cases of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China. But the cause has been confirmed as a new coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans, which is known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus or 2019-nCoV. Meanwhile, France confirmed Friday two cases of the deadly virus — the first in Europe. U.S. health officials announced earlier in the day that a woman from Chicago who travelled to China is the second U.S. case. The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or people with connections to the city, but scattered cases have occurred beyond the mainland. South Korea and Japan both confirmed their second cases Friday, and cases have been detected in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.  The World Health Organization (WHO) decided against declaring the outbreak a global emergency for now. The declaration can increase resources to fight a threat but its potential to cause economic damage makes the decision politically fraught. Cases of the virus are likely to continue to rise in China, but it is too soon to evaluate its severity, WHO officials said Friday. The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest X-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.  According to the World Health Organization, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/coronavirus-virus-special-page-china-1.5439949,[],N/A

124,John Last,2020-01-24T14:45:12.215Z,N.W.T. government reps take 4 hours of questions at hearings on Sahtu's caribou herds,"The second day of hearings on how to manage the hunting of caribou in the N.W.T.'s Sahtu region saw an exhaustive four hour questions and answer session with representatives from the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The department is responsible for enforcing quotas on the caribou harvest determined by regional management boards. It's just one participant in the hearings, hosted by Colville Lake and organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board. Heather Sayine-Crawford, the manager of wildlife research and monitoring for Environment and Natural Resources, and Brett Elkin, director of wildlife, answered questions from Indigenous leadership for four hours following a short presentation. Two wildlife biologists were also present. Sayine-Crawford and Elkin frequently consulted a lawyer in answering questions on local enforcement, harvest regulations, and the protected status of many caribou herds. Caribou is a staple food source in the region, but several herds have seen a steep decline in size. A number are considered to be species at risk, though some delegates questioned whether the herds can be treated as distinct The group took more than two minutes to confer before responding to the first question. David Codzi, president of the Ayoni Keh Land Corporation, asked why Deline's local harvest management plan, approved in a similar hearing in 2016, has still not been recognized in law. ""We're continuing to consider this issue,"" Sayine-Crawford eventually answered, echoing language in written submissions sent weeks earlier. Colville Lake Chief Wilbert Kochon followed, contesting the department's low count of caribou, which allows it to implement a limit on the caribou harvests under terms set out in the Sahtu land claim. ""A lot of people are going to be hungry now, because we can't give them any meat,"" he said. ""That kind of hurts me."" ""It's our livelihood. For you it's just a job. It's a big difference."" That elicited a more personal reply from Sayine-Crawford. ""The importance of caribou to people in the N.W.T., to people in the Sahtu, is not lost on me,"" she said. Sayine-Crawford, herself Dene, said she was not ""as immersed"" in her culture as others who spoke, and was still ""re-learning."" But she stood by the department's assessments of the herds. ""I know we get questions sometimes. But I stand by them,"" she said. ""I couldn't stand here and tell you all this without standing behind those numbers."" Toward the end, the panel's voices were breaking as they explained the personal significance of their work. ""It's difficult to hear someone say it's just a job,"" said wildlife biologist Jan Adamczewski, recalling Kochon's comment. ""When we get [caribou survey] numbers back and they're not good ... you feel it here,"" he said, gesturing to his heart. The Environment Department's caribou tags have been rejected once before, at a similar meeting in 2016. Some communities have sent back the tags issued to them ever since. That resulted in some confusion at the hearing over whether untagged hunting is illegal in the Sahtu. Local officers said few Indigenous hunters use the metal tags issued by the department anymore. At the hearing, the government panel acknowledged an interim agreement means the permission of the local band is generally enough.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearing-environment-department-1.5437640,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearings-1.5435406,N/A
125,Catharine Tunney,2020-01-26T18:03:26.711Z,Ransomware attack on construction company raises questions about federal contracts,"A construction company that's won millions of dollars worth of contracts with the military and other federal departments has been hit by a ransomware attack — raising questions about how the federal government does business with outside firms open to cyberattacks. Ransomware attacks involve malicious software used to cripple a target's computer system to solicit a cash payment. Last month, a group known as Maze — infamous for publicly shaming victims until they pay up — claimed to have run a successful strike against the Toronto-based company Bird Construction, stealing 60 GBs of data. ""Bird Construction responded to a cyber incident that resulted in the encryption of company files,"" wrote a company spokesperson in an email to CBC. ""Bird continued to function with no business impact, and we worked with leading cyber security experts to restore access to the affected files."" The company wouldn't say whether they paid their cyber-assailants — something police forces warn against. A company spokesperson said government officials were notified at the time of the breach. While it doesn't appear that any secure government files were compromised in the hack, the Bird case raises concerns about how secure government contracts are as the number of ransomware incidents multiplies. Between 2006 and 2015, Bird scored 48 contracts with the Department of National Defence totalling more than $406 million. Bird also helped build the RCMP's Surrey detachment headquarters and has done work for Public Services and Procurement Canada. Christyn Cianfarani, president of the Canadian Association of Defence and Security Industries, said Canada could learn from the United States and Britain, countries that have taken steps to ensure the security systems of all government contractors are locked down — even those not dealing with classified information. ""When we look at the major hacks that have occurred, especially on the defence side, where you know fighter aircraft information was stolen — it wasn't stolen from the prime contractor, it was stolen in a tiny, tiny shop supplying widgets,"" she said, citing the 2017 theft of sensitive information about Australia's defence programs through a government contractor. ""Whether they're done by nation states or by criminal organizations or by rogue actors, it's a characteristic of these kinds of attacks to get to governments using businesses as the point of entry, especially ... small businesses that tend to be the most vulnerable."" Cianfarani said Canada needs to start working on its own cyber security certification program for vendors. Apart from federal work, Bird also has worked on renovations at multiple Ontario Provincial Police detachments and a wastewater treatment plant in Wood Buffalo, Alta., and helped to build Calgary's new emergency operations control centre. The company also has held contracts with oilpatch and potash companies, including Suncor. A spokesperson for the RCMP said the police service is aware of the hack but would not say whether it's investigating. Public Services and Procurement Canada, which oversees how the government buys goods and services, has different levels of security clearance depending on whether a contractor has access to classified information. ""The government of Canada does go a long way to do that when there is sensitive information in play. When there's not sensitive information at play, companies do need to realize that this is a growing [trend],"" said Aaron Shull, managing director and general counsel for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. A spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada said the department is working to ensure all companies are properly vetted. ""Ransomware and the impacts of this type of attack are monitored by Public Services and Procurement Canada in collaboration with other government security agencies,"" said spokesperson Stéfanie Hamel. ""Public Services and Procurement Canada is working closely with relevant departmental stakeholders to ensure that, as part of the procurement process, companies it does business with have gone through intensive screening and meet all of our security requirements before any contract is granted."" Shull said there's little recourse for government departments once their confidential information is caught up in a cyberattack. ""The problem, of course, is that once a company has been breached it's a little bit like trying to nail the barn door shut after the horse is already gone,"" he said. ""The tools that are available to the federal government to penalize these companies are unsatisfactory. You're going to end up with a lawsuit for breach of contract or negligence, or something like that."" The Bird Construction case is just the latest in a series of ransomware attacks hitting Canadian networks — a series that includes attacks on a number of Ontario municipalities, including Woodstock, Stratford and The Nation. The RCMP has reported an uptick in ransomware attacks and a recent survey of Canadian organizations found the vast majority (88 per cent) had experienced a data breach over the last 12 months. Brett Callow, a security analyst with the anti-virus software firm Emsisoft, said any stolen data could be used to perfect a future scam. He said implementing a bolstered audit system could help the government identify information that has been put at risk.  ""If data has been stolen, there's obviously no way of getting it back. The most you can do is pay the criminals for a pinky-promise that they will not use that data,"" he said. Both DND and the RCMP said they follow Public Services and Procurement Canada's directions when it comes to contracts for goods, services and construction. ""The protection of information is a priority for the Department of National Defence,"" said Jessica Lamirande.

Canadians across the country were encouraged to salvage whatever waste materials they could, including metal, rubber, paper and rags, which were then recycled into various items for the war effort. The call for raw materials also extended into the High Arctic, where Inuit communities were encouraged to collect bones that were then transported south and used in the manufacturing of ammunition and aircraft, as well as in fertilizer to grow food. Attagutsiak's family was among those who helped with that effort, and even now she remembers collecting bags full of dogs that had died from disease, as well as walrus and seal bones, at the behest of a local Catholic priest who told them of the war. Eighty years later, she is the last known survivor of Inuit who contributed to those efforts and will be recognized at a ceremony organized by Parks Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que. While Attagutsiak says her family at that time knew little about the rest of world, they understood that their way of life was under threat and felt compelled to help however they could.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuk-elder-honoured-second-world-war-1.5440653,[],N/A
127,Mark Ting,2020-01-12T17:00:00.634Z,High returns or recession: What does 2020 have in store for your money?,"It's that time of year when investment analysts break out their crystal balls and issue predictions for what the upcoming year will bring for financial markets. This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy — conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.  Forecast: No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains. U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.   Forecast: Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019. Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared — markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.  Forecast: Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities. Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring, I believe that other international factors such as U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a good time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments that are more defensive. As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio. Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions. Forecast: Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets. Overall, I'm expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and I believe that stocks will outperform bonds. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

128,Hannah Thibedeau,2020-01-22T22:06:02.264Z,Businessman Rick Peterson is taking a second run at the Conservative leadership,"The Conservative leadership race is getting its first Western Canadian candidate: Edmonton-based venture capitalist Rick Peterson, who ran and lost to Andrew Scheer in 2017. CBC News has learned Peterson filed his papers with the party on Tuesday. His team is now collecting the 1,000 signatures from Conservative members he needs to enter the race by the Feb. 27 deadline. ""We cannot have a Conservative leadership race without a voice from the West,"" Peterson told CBC News. ""I am an outsider. I am not an MP but, on the other hand, I've got some business experience that we're looking forward to bringing to the table. And it's vital."" Peterson will formally announce his candidacy next week at High Arctic Energy Services, an oilfield services company near Edmonton. The choice of location is symbolic: Peterson is planting his flag as the party's western-based champion of the energy sector. ""The grassroots of the party are in Western Canada,"" he said. ""So the Conservative Party has to take a leadership role. And has to continue taking a leadership role on the resource file. ""And my candidacy from the heart of the resource sector, from Western Canada, will be a strong, bold platform of policy ideas, including the resource sector, in both official languages across the country."" Peterson said he'll also be pitching policies on carbon pricing for large emitters, digital privacy, deregulating the banking and telecom sectors, helping students with their loans and eliminating corporate income taxes. Peterson is fluently bilingual. He has family in Quebec and said that he and his team will devote a ""big part"" of the campaign to building support there. ""I have a grandson, he is Quebecois. Born a year ago and he's giving me one more reason to come back to Quebec on an ongoing basis. I can't wait to see him,"" he said. ""A big part of our campaign is going to be in Quebec. I was lucky to have lived in France for 10 years as a young man so my French is pretty good."" Peterson said he'd hoped to back Rona Ambrose's leadership bid. The former interim Conservative leader confirmed today that she's not running. ""We're in. We're all in. Once you launch, you can't back out,"" Peterson said. Peterson finished at the back of the pack in 2017 — 12th out of fourteen candidates, with just 0.7 per cent of the vote by the time he was eliminated. Peterson said he knows the current race could be a tough one for him as well, with party heavyweights like Peter MacKay, Marilyn Gladu, Pierre Pollievre and Erin O'Toole primed to run. ""They have the advantage of name recognition. They have an advantage of a network, I'm sure, across Canada,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to be the only candidate who has to meet a payroll, who's hiring and firing people, who's working in the private sector. So we all have our strengths, we all have our weaknesses. So I'm going to be highlighting the fact that I can understand the economy and jobs and making sure that the Conservative Party is at the forefront of creating jobs and employment in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rick-peterson-conservative-leadership-1.5436247,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rona-ambrose-conservative-leader-decision-1.5436775 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/derek-sloan-conservative-leadership-1.5436227 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808,N/A
129,Anonymous,2020-01-24T21:37:03.115Z,"Glass found in Brady Francis's hoodie, hit-and-run trial told ","Fragments of glass were found in Brady Francis's hoodie and jeans, according to a forensic chemist who testified Friday in the fatal hit-and-run trial of Maurice Johnson. But Kimberly Kenny, a civilian member of the RCMP, said she couldn't link these to the pickup truck belonging to the man on trial.  The 22-year-old Francis was found dead in Saint-Charles, north of his community of Elsipogtog, on Feb. 24, 2018.  Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death.  Kenny, who has a PhD in analytical chemistry, was the first defence witness to testify as the trial resumed Friday  afternoon in Moncton Court of Queen's Bench. She works for the RCMP forensics laboratory services in Edmonton and testified via video conference. Kenny examined some of the clothes Francis was wearing the night he died, particularly his hoodie, jeans and a piece of fabric from the hoodie. She told the court she was looking for the presence of any foreign paint, plastic or metal in those items so she could make a comparison with a paint sample and the grille from Johnson's vehicle.  The RCMP forensics lab no longer conducts glass analysis, so she wasn't able to determine exactly where the glass came from, Kenny said. But she said the tiny fragments could indicate Francis struck a windshield the night he died. The small pieces of glass could also be connected to a ""non-vehicle,"" which could be any object made of glass, such as a container, Kenny said.    She couldn't tell when or how the fragments got onto his clothing, she said. Through a microscope, a black coating could be seen on some of the pieces. ""It means they are very small, not uncommon to be less than one millimetre in size,"" Kenny said. Also on Francis's hoodie, Kenny said, were five metal fragments, dried blood, thin flakes of skin, dirt, debris and plant material, which could be grass.   Kenny testified that she was unable to find any polymer from the hoodie on the grille of Johnson's truck. Defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux asked her if there was any trace of paint from the grille, found on Francis's hoodie? But Kenny said there wasn't. However, she did say there were two black plastic fragments in the pair of blue jeans Francis was wearing that were similar to the black polycarbonate grille on the vehicle or other similar material. She also noticed a few ""red-brown"" smears on the chrome finish of the vehicle. She said it could've been blood but she's not qualified to identify it.  Earlier in the day, the Crown withdrew a motion to include a police report as evidence. Prosecutor Pierre Gionet told the court the police report wasn't a necessary part of the Crown's case. Speaking in French, Gionet said the evidence was initially going to be used as ""an aid"" to RCMP Const. Mathiew Richard's testimony. Richard, the Crown's last witness, testified that he analyzed security video from two buildings along Saint-Charles Road South, where Francis's body was found. In a gas station video, Richard said he saw a light-coloured pickup truck travelling east between the Saint-Charles gas station and the home of Louis Daigle. The truck was similar to the 2003 GMC Sierra seized from Johnson. The video time code read 9:40 p.m, but Richard said the security camera ran about 7.5 minutes fast and he adjusted the time — 9:33 p.m — based on his cellphone. Dozens of people from Elsipogtog First Nation packed the courtroom to show support for the Francis family as the Crown wrapped up its case. Court is scheduled to resume Monday at 9:30 a.m. The defence is expected to call two or three witnesses. The trial, which began on Jan. 13, is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-9-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5438633,[],N/A
130,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-24T21:33:25.239Z,Champagne 'cautiously optimistic' about Canada's bid for UN Security Council seat,"Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said today he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about Canada's chances of winning a coveted seat at the United Nations Security Council. In a conference call with reporters during an official visit to Morocco and Mali, Champagne said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the support voiced by African leaders for Canada's bid for a 2021 membership. ""I think people recognize that Canada can play a positive role in the world ... one which is based on values and principles and a leadership, I think, African nations and those I have been talking to would certainly welcome,"" he said. Canada is ramping up its diplomatic efforts to secure a two-year seat on the 15-seat council. Five are held by the permanent members — the United States, China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — and each permanent member has the power to veto any council resolution. With its relatively smaller contributions to global peacekeeping and international development assistance, Canada is seen as facing a tough challenge from its competitors, Ireland and Norway. Norway is the largest foreign aid donor per capita. According to the most recent figures, Oslo delivers roughly 1 per cent of its Gross National Income (GNI) to development assistance, while Ireland contributes 0.32 per cent. Canada donates 0.27 per cent of its GNI. Still, Champagne said he is ""cautiously optimistic."" ""Every campaign is obviously hard, but I think the more and more that Canada talks about its bid to the UN Security Council, the more ... I see people wanted Canada to play a leading role in providing the positive leadership,"" he said. Canada put forward its candidacy in 2016, about a decade after Ireland (2005) and Norway (2007) announced they were running. As of September 30, according to government estimates, Canada had spent nearly $1.9 million on the campaign for a Security Council seat. That sum does not include the salaries of the 13 government employees appointed to work full-time on Canada's bid. Countries need the support of at least two-thirds of the General Assembly to get elected to the council. Roland Paris, a professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, said it's tough to get a read on Canada's chances without tracking every country's position on the vote. He believes Canada still has a ""realistic shot."" ""However, it will take a concerted diplomatic effort, including the type of outreach that the foreign minister is now conducting. Hopefully it's not too late,"" he said. Paris said the efforts are worth it, as the Security Council remains ""the most important table in international politics."" NDP foreign affairs critic Jack Harris said landing a UN Security Council seat would be ""an important step toward rebuilding Canadian leadership on the world stage."" ""Unfortunately, the Liberal record on foreign policy, from low levels of international aid to abysmally low peacekeeping numbers, may make it hard for Canada to win against countries like Ireland and Norway who are also competing for the seat,"" he said in a statement to CBC. ""They have more progressive foreign policies and have more to show for their commitment to international peace and security. If the federal government is serious about reclaiming the seat, a step like implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples would be a good start."" While in Mali, Champagne met with President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta and other ministers, as well people in leadership roles with the MINUSMA peacekeeping mission. Champagne announced $79 million in funding for eight projects and the deployment of two police trainers to the peacekeeping school in Bamako, Mali. In Morocco, Champagne met with Prime Minister Saad al-Din al-Othmani to discuss building stronger bilateral relations on economic growth, trade, education, gender equality and development.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/champagne-diplomacy-africa-un-security-council-1.5439634,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-united-nations-security-council-1.5344319 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/canada-as-a-middle-power-in-an-upended-world-time-for-a-foreign-policy-reset-1.5372192 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-israel-no-position-change-1.5390275 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/top-diplomat-zeid-ra-ad-al-hussein-takes-us-inside-the-backrooms-of-global-diplomacy-1.5395342,N/A
131,Jason Proctor,2020-01-23T22:43:30.152Z,'Right needs to be done': Meng Wanzhou's lawyers make final pitch to judge,"A lawyer for Meng Wanzhou made a final pitch against extradition Thursday to the B.C. Supreme Court judge tasked with weighing the Huawei executive's fate. But Richard Peck told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that Meng's defence team was asking for more than just a legal victory. ""This is the kind of case that tests our system,"" Peck said as he wrapped up his arguments. ""It's not so much for us a matter of standing here and saying we want to see justice done. We say right needs to be done."" Holmes concluded the four-day hearing by thanking both defence and Crown lawyers for their work and reserving her decision for a later date. She gave no indication as to how long it might take. Meng was arrested at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018, on a stopover from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina. The United States wants Meng extradited for allegedly lying to HSBC about Huawei's control of a company accused of attempting to sell computer equipment to an Iranian telecommunications company. American prosecutors argue the bank put itself at risk of fines, prosecution and the loss of reputation by relying on Meng's alleged lie to continue providing finance to the Chinese telecommunications giant. Meng is living under house arrest in one of two multi-million dollar homes she owns in Vancouver. As part of a $10 million bail agreement, she wears a GPS monitoring bracelet on her left ankle and is trailed everywhere by a team of security guards. This week's hearing — which marked the first formal stage of the extradition process — was held to determine if Meng's alleged conduct would amount to a crime if it had happened in Canada at the time the U.S. gave Canada the authority to proceed with the extradition: the principle of so-called ""double criminality."" Meng's lawyers spent the first two days arguing that the whole case comes down to economic sanctions the U.S. reimposed against Iran in 2018 when it left an international deal meant to stall the Islamic republic's nuclear ambitions. Canada doesn't have those same sanctions and so, the defence claims, Meng's alleged lies would be harmless north of the border because a bank in Canada wouldn't risk anything by dealing with a company that did business in Iran. The Crown then spent half a day arguing the case was one of fraud, plain and simple, and that the issue of sanctions was essentially a red herring. Crown lawyer Robert Frater said the central elements of fraud are a misrepresentation resulting in risk of loss. And if the existence of foreign sanctions came into Holmes' decision, he said it should be as a means to understand the context of the risks that HSBC would be taking by providing finance to a company on the wrong side of U.S. law. Peck and co-counsel Scott Fenton provided a brief reply to the Crown's arguments Thursday, taking issue with Frater's contention that fraud and risk of deprivation could still occur ""where there is no possibility of loss."" ""This is an oxymoron,"" Fenton told the judge. ""No possibility of risk means no loss at all."" They also told Holmes that she could consider the value of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in making her decision — a response to the Crown's contention that weighing concerns about values associated with sanctions law was a concern for the minister of justice, not a B.C. Supreme Court judge. Both the Crown and the defence say the case is unique. But as to why, they disagree. ""It's unique because in our submission, it's a pose,"" Peck told Holmes. ""It is a pose or posture where fraud is being tendered as the essence [of the alleged conduct] and, in fact, sanctions busting or sanctions violations is the essence ... It's unique because our standards have changed with respect to this very issue. It's extraordinary in that sense."" Holmes allowed Meng to move out of the prisoner's dock in the high-security courtroom where the hearing was held so that she could sit alongside her counsel and follow the arguments through a translator. If Holmes decides the bar of double-criminality is not met, then the extradition proceedings will come to an end and Meng would be free to return to China, barring an appeal. But if the Crown is successful, further court dates have been set in June for Meng to argue that she is being used as a political pawn and that her rights were violated at the time of her detention and arrest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-huawei-criminality-1.5437989,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/who-paid-for-the-fake-protest-outside-meng-wanzhou-s-hearing-we-still-don-t-know-1.5436448,N/A
132, KRISTA BRODA,2020-01-20T12:48:49.717Z,"After 10 years in Regina, I've realized there's nowhere else I'd rather be","I recently marked a decade since I became an honourary Saskatchewanian. My younger self would never have believed it. I was lucky enough to be raised on Vancouver Island. I had never owned a winter jacket or heard of a block heater and I could go an entire summer without a mosquito bite. There was no greater thrill than waking up to hear school was cancelled because there was snow in the forecast. It was paradise.  Having family from coast to coast allowed me to travel throughout Canada. I was always proud that I had been to ""every province in Canada, except Saskatchewan."" People understood. I had seen all of the provinces that needed to be seen. As anybody not from Saskatchewan would tell you, I wasn't missing much.  In August 2009, I happened to be in Calgary for a football game when the Riders came to town. At this point, I only knew of one person from Saskatchewan I had met in my entire life. They were like mythical creatures to me. Every once in a while there was a wholesome story in the news, or some obscure town was named the Coldest Place on Earth for a day, but Saskatchewanians were rarely seen out of their natural habitat.  That August long weekend, Rider fans descended on McMahon Stadium by the thousands. They were loud, they were green, and they made sure that everybody knew exactly where they came from. I had never seen anything like it.  Sitting next to me in Section X was a charming guy that had just driven in from Regina. Between his chirps at Henry Burris, he proudly told me he grew up in the village of Grayson, population 167. His dad was a farmer and his hometown was having a fundraiser soon to raise money for a new curling rink. He was every cliché I had ever known about the province. I was in love with him by half time.  My first trip to Saskatchewan came a month later for the Labour Day Classic. My expectations were very low.  My new love had made a bold claim that Regina's Italian Star Deli has the best sandwiches in the world. If nothing else, I'd at least get a half-decent meal.  He also told me that Taylor Field was fun and the pink lemonades were second to none, but it was really old, very cramped and the bathrooms didn't have hot water. He severely downplayed the magic that happened inside those crumbling walls.  My first time at the old stadium would easily make the top five best days of my life. I had never experienced an atmosphere so electric and so fun. I met dozens of people that day, each one more friendly and welcoming than the last.  I remember thinking to myself several times throughout the game that people are really lucky to live here but, oddly enough, everybody seemed to already know that. They truly believed that they lived in one of the best places in Canada. After that weekend, I was starting to believe it too.  After a few more trips to Regina — and more Italian Star Deli sandwiches than I'd like to admit — I started to pick up on the quirks that maybe only an outsider could see.  The language they spoke was different than other provinces. I had a lot of questions about grid roads and sloughs and RMs (rural municipalities), and why everyone gave me a two-finger wave over their steering wheel as soon as I left a paved road.  When winter arrived, I remember asking why perfectly good extension cords were littering the parking lots. I soon learned those were just Saskatchewan snow snakes.  The people of Saskatchewan are as unique as the sunsets. I couldn't get enough. I had fallen in love with the province and the province loved me back. It felt like home.  On Nov. 30, 2009 – the day after the heartbreaking Grey Cup loss – I made the biggest and greatest decision of my life. I moved to Regina.  I went on to marry that charming small town boy from Section X of McMahon Stadium. We raise our boys here, and they love where they live as much as we do. Those over-the-top-friendly people that I met that day at Taylor Field went on to become some of my best friends.  I feel lucky to have had a front row seat to watch Regina blossom into a vibrant city full of creative entrepreneurs, world-class local shops and restaurants, and a craft beer scene that could rival anywhere in North America.  So, Saskatchewan, please consider this my thank you for welcoming me with open arms and showing me – quite literally –  how to speak your language.  There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

134,"Karissa Donkin, Jacques Poitras",2019-11-25T10:00:00.602Z,Former Joi Scientific employee says he debunked technology NB Power spent millions on,"A former employee of Joi Scientific said he debunked claims the company made about its hydrogen technology but quit after being unsatisfied with the company's response to his findings. NB Power is facing an end-of-year deadline to prove the Florida startup's hydrogen technology works, or the provincial government will pull the plug on the utility's Florida lab, which costs about $20,000 a month to run. The company has claimed it has found an efficient way to generate hydrogen from seawater on demand, something that would be a major innovation. NB Power and the Regional Development Corporation spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas has maintained the technology has ""potential."" ""We had independent validation and measurements, but there were parts that could not be measured,"" Thomas said at a legislature committee on Nov. 1. ""Some assumptions had been made. We're now back into an area where it's still promising but not to the same levels as we initially thought."" But according to Austin Walker, who worked at Joi Scientific as a lab technician between 2018 and 2019, the technology, or mechanism, as it was often called, is nothing new. ""They always said, 'the mechanism is doing this or that,' but there was never actually a defined mechanism,"" Walker said. ""There was always just vague theories."" The company was always keen to differentiate its technology from electrolysis, an established process that uses electricity to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen, Walker said. Electrolysis is considered wholly inefficient for power generation. But Walker said he proved to company executives that its technology is essentially just electrolysis by another name. That would make the company's claim of 200 per cent efficiency impossible, Walker said, because it would violate a law of thermodynamics that says ""you cannot create energy just kind of out of nowhere."" Walker was only 21 years old when he started at the company, fresh out of school, in the fall of 2018. Yet, he said that he was able to determine over the course of just a few months that the company's technology was nothing new. He had just finished a bachelor's degree in biology, with a minor in chemistry, at East Central University in Oklahoma when he was hired at Joi Scientific in October 2018. His job ranged from doing ""basic chemistry experiments to just learning more about the technology"" under the direction of the vice-president of science. Before his job interview, Walker reviewed Joi Scientific's website and its promotional materials. One marketing video, which claims that ""Joi Scientific has solved the problems that have kept hydrogen from being widely used for energy,"" caught Walker's eye because the video's claims sounded like ""perpetual motion,"" he said. ""Our patented extraction process takes a tiny amount of energy to start a chemical process, making enough hydrogen to power the process itself and generate plenty more for use in fuel cells and engines and boilers,"" the video says. Walker assumed he was the one who didn't know enough about the subject, especially since the company is based in the Space Life Sciences Center at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. ""I kind of had a healthy dose of skepticism right from the start, but it wasn't until about one or two weeks in that I really kind of was like, 'OK, yeah … something's not right here,'"" Walker said. Walker said the company came up with a slideshow for investors that includes a bullet-point list of reasons why its technology was not electrolysis. CBC News has not seen that list. ""I would look at that list of things and be like, 'None of that really makes sense, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact opposite in my own experimentation,'"" Walker said. A few months into his job at Joi Scientific, Walker began testing the bullet points from the list during his lunch breaks and said he was able to disprove one point in ""20 minutes at most."" In May, about two months after he began doing experiments to test the company's claims, Walker said, the company allowed him 15 minutes to present his findings at a staff meeting.  He said he was able to prove all but one point wrong. He also used part of his presentation to explain how electrolysis works. ""A lot of people didn't grasp the full weight of what I had said, so what I did after that is I went to people individually and kind of explained things,"" Walker said. He said these people included Robert Koeneman, the company's president and senior vice-president of technology. ""I went with Rob out to get drinks and kind of explain to him all of my thoughts in detail, to the point where I knew I had done my best to explain to him why everything was wrong,"" Walker said. On a call in midsummer, Joi Scientific told its shareholders that its technology didn't work as previously described, according to a record of the call obtained by CBC News. On that call, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy admitted the company had been calculating power incorrectly. But Kennedy didn't mention Walker's findings in May that Joi Scientific was performing electrolysis and didn't have groundbreaking technology. Walker is the second former Joi Scientific employee to raise concerns about the company's technology. He is also one of at least eight Joi Scientific employees who are no longer with the company. At its height this year, the company had about 20 employees, according to interviews with former employees and a review of LinkedIn profiles.  In addition to Walker, the departures included two executives who were in charge of science and engineering. NB Power declined an interview request for this story. Joi Scientific also declined an interview request. In an emailed statement, vice-president of marketing Vicky Harris said the company ""remains as committed as ever to continuing our work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" She said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. Her statement didn't elaborate on the delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. Even though there were reportedly third-party verifications of Joi Scientific's technology, Walker believes people often ""take it for granted that you know what you're talking about."" ""Those third-party companies couldn't spend a month of testing like I did to check every little thing,"" Walker said. ""They had to take some of the stuff on faith and, yeah, I think that's probably how that happened."" In addition to operating a lab in Florida in the same building as Joi Scientific, NB Power has been sending its own employees, plus some engineers from Stantec, to work with Joi's technology. A spokesperson for Stantec declined an interview request to talk about its work on the Joi Scientific project. ""We are not authorized to speak to this matter, as per our agreement with our client,""  Stantec spokesperson Ashley Warnock wrote in an email. Expense reports show at least nine NB Power employees, including Thomas, have travelled to Joi's headquarters since 2016.  But it's not clear whether NB Power's own testing ever flagged any of the same issues Walker found during his lunch breaks. According to an Oct. 26, 2016, briefing note from NB Power, Joi Scientific's hydrogen production system is ""consistently repeatable"" and Joi's ""methodology used to evaluate the system's production ratio is reasonable and justifiable."" ""NB Power observed input to output ratio results which exceeded 100%,"" the briefing note says. It goes on to say the test results and data were consistent with claims made by Joi Scientific and ""with previous observations made at Joi Scientific at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [in August 2016]."" It said NB Power's technical representative, an unnamed senior nuclear physicist, ""has spent approximately 24 hours of lab time with the system"" and ""has gained sufficient knowledge to understand the system's operation at a basic level and has confidence that the technology could be readily transferred to NB Power.""  Speaking to CBC News in May 2019, Thomas was a believer. ""We have seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,"" Thomas said. Earlier this month, Thomas acknowledged the technology hasn't reached 70 per cent efficiency but maintained it still has ""potential.""  Walker became frustrated after attending a meeting with shareholders in May, where he said the company didn't mention any of the problems he said he raised earlier that month. ""It just seemed like they weren't even trying to portray the actuality of the company's situation, and I just felt that was kind of unethical,"" Walker said in an interview. ""Especially when some people were talking about continuing to invest more money into their company.""  Thomas, who sits on Joi Scientific's board, also attended that meeting, according to Walker. Walker described the tone as positive and said shareholders heard ""vague empty promises"" that he felt the company should have known wouldn't pan out.  ""I thought that there was just a line that crossed for me,"" he said. Walker said he quit his job later that day. He believes NB Power needs to audit things better before putting money in and suggested the utility should have sent electrochemists to assess the Joi Scientific technology. NB Power didn't respond to a question about how many, if any, electrochemists were sent to evaluate Joi's technology before it was licensed. ""I thought that the investors and people have a right to know how much their money is being wasted, especially if it's a government-run power company like it is in New Brunswick,"" Walker said.

Det'on Cho Nahanni Construction Corporation, owned by the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, will run operations on the Nechalacho rare earth mineral project between the Dene communities of Dettah and Lutselk'e. It was announced at the Annual Mineral Exploration Roundup mining conference this week in Vancouver. Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina said the signing marks a transition from the first nation being ""passive witnesses to major projects to being key participants."" Cheetah Resources' Nechalacho project is moving toward small-scale production of rare earths like neodymium-praseodymium, which can be used in wind turbines.  Mining is slated to begin this year at the project, subject to approval at the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board.  Det'on Cho competed for the project, which will create roughly 20 and 25 jobs with six months of employment each year for three years, according to president and CEO Paul Gruner.  Asked how many jobs will directly benefit members of the first nation, Gruner said it will be a ""best effort"" and that the company is already seeking out potential candidates. At the low end, 50 per cent of hires will be Indigenous, but it's more likely to be 75 per cent, said Gruner. The quarry operation needs drill blasters and equipment operators for a crusher. A plant separates waste from rare earths, which are then loaded on to a barge for processing in southern Canada. The project will also have a shoulder season for winter road construction, providing access to the site.  Gruner said Det'on Cho's involvement is an opportunity to increase worker capacity to get into larger scale opportunities in the future. Yellowknives Dene chiefs signed a letter to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board supporting the project. Cheetah Resources adviser David Connelly said in an email that the agreement could be ""the first time in the N.W.T. and Canada that all mining operations will be contracted to an Indigenous firm, enabling them to be a miner on their own lands."" A recent agreement between Canada and the U.S. to reduce their dependence on Chinese-sourced rare earths, factored into Cheetah's investments in the Northwest Territories, said Connelly.  Jason Snaggs, the Chief Executive Officer for the Yellowknives Dene, said there is a desire to achieve similar agreements with other development operations. If there is high enough mineral potential at Nechalacho, the first nation is poised to have an economic role in an expanded mine. The small-scale projects are about finding customers for a rare earth project. Once the material is mined and processed, it would likely be sold to companies like Australia-based Lynas or to Europe and Japan, said Geoff Atkins, managing director of Cheetah Resources Corp. The material could be used in electric vehicles and high strength magnets, said Atkins.  The company will start moving equipment on an ice road in February. The project awaits regulatory approval, but the company is confident enough to start moving equipment, said Atkins. N.W.T. industry minister Katrina Nokleby applauded the agreement. ""I'm really glad to see that we're moving away from Indigenous involvement being cutting a cheque for the use of someone's name to actual ownership and partnership,"" said Nokleby. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ykdfn-nechalacho-agreement-1.5437975,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/rare-earth-agreement-1.5417128 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/thor-lake-investment-1.5023912,N/A

Sardelis lives less than five minutes away from her mother Voula, but the home prevented Sardelis from seeing her, using sections of Ontario's trespass law. ""For 316 days … I was banned from entering the home,"" she said. ""You have no idea of the toll it's taken."" She could call, but her mother's hearing is poor and she often couldn't understand what her daughter was saying.  ""All I could hear was her fears or concerns. And I couldn't even soothe her."" Sardelis was banned from City View Retirement Community under Ontario's Trespass to Property Act. So-called trespass orders allow private property owners to limit who can come onto the premises and, some experts say, are being increasingly used to keep out family members who complain about conditions in retirement and long-term care homes. It's difficult to know how often homes ban or restrict family members, since families have to breach the trespass order for there to be any record of it. WATCH: Daughter banned from visiting 97-year-old mother at retirement home. Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto, estimates she gets calls about trespass orders in long-term care homes and retirement homes at least once a week.  ""Generally, what happens is that it's a family member who is in visiting their family member and they get upset,"" she said. Marketplace reviewed over a dozen cases of family members from provinces across Canada who say they believe the homes were trying to silence them for advocating on behalf of their loved ones. ""The person maybe raises their voices and the home says, 'Well, that's it. You're not coming anymore, because we see you as a danger,'"" said Meadus. WATCH: Voula Sardelis waves to her daughter on the sidewalk outside her retirement home. ""If [the complainants] were really a danger, they should be calling the police. So if they were actually threatening someone, that's what they should be doing, ""But instead, what they're doing is to try to control their premises, trying to stifle people from complaining and trying to stifle people from speaking out on behalf of these very vulnerable seniors."" The home told Marketplace they prohibited Sardelis from visiting her mother because she was ""aggressive"" towards staff. But she believes she was banned for speaking out and filing complaints about the living conditions at the home which she felt were intolerable. Meadus said in Ontario, homes do not have the right to ban residents' visitors. When it comes to retirement homes, residents who pay to live on the property have a right to receive visitors they choose ""without interference,"" she said, citing case law established in Cunningham vs. Whitby Christian Non-Profit Housing Corp. That case found that banning guests of a tenant would contravene Section 23 (1) of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, which entitles a tenant to ""quiet enjoyment"" of their space. Meadus says in the case of long-term care, they have the same rights under Section 3 (14) of the Long-Term Care Homes Act, which states that every resident has the right ""to receive visitors of his or her choice … without interference."" The home says it ""disagrees"" with that analysis and that it has the right to ban anyone deemed to have breached its ""zero-tolerance abuse"" policy. Meadus has been invited to train Toronto's police officers on how to deal with calls from retirement and long-term care homes that try to use Trespass to Property Act against family members. ""When we talk to police officers, they're surprised and they're usually very grateful that we've provided that information to them. That's not something that they're trained for generally,"" she said. Meadus says often the families she has heard from have negotiated for restricted visits, agreeing to only come into the home during certain hours or under certain conditions.  That was the case for Susan Macaulay, who says her mother's Quebec long-term care home threatened to ban her, and ultimately issued restrictions on her visits. ""I was a thorn in the side of the managers,"" she said. ""They threatened on several occasions to not allow me to see my mother."" Macaulay said the home sent her a letter stating that she would only be allowed to visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. — the two hours of the afternoon when her mom was normally asleep. She said she tried to explain to her mother, who had dementia, why she wasn't going to be visiting as much. ""If I don't come to visit, it's not because I don't want to,"" she recalls telling her mother.  ""I thought that if they stopped me from coming to see her, she would never know why I didn't come."" Macaulay faced restrictions on her visits to her mother for 18 months, until her mother died. In Ontario, the Trespass to Property Act doesn't allow people who have been issued a ban to fight it. Once a notice or verbal warning is given to someone on the property, the only way to fight the ban is to go back to the property and wait for the owner to call the police. Meadus says most of the time, families don't challenge the order, because they would have to get arrested to do so.  But for Mary Sardelis, her fear of being arrested wasn't enough to stop her. In March 2019, she went into the retirement home even though she was banned and waited for the home to call the police and arrest her. She hoped that this way, she would be able to bring the matter before a judge. The police were called, and Sardelis was charged under the Trespass to Property Act. ""Someone had to do something,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it will just keep going on and on and on."" But in October, Sardelis found out she wouldn't have to go to court after all. Her lawyer met with the home's lawyers, after which the prosecutors dropped the charges. The home told Marketplace it will let her visit as long as she follows their rules. Although her battle is seemingly over, Sardelis said on behalf of her mother, she'll continue to advocate for other family members in her community who have been banned from visiting their loved ones. ""I'll do whatever it takes to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" she said. ""I will not stop.""

139,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-12-09T01:00:00.670Z,Car owner forced to replace engine twice within weeks despite safety recall,"A B.C. man says he's in ""disbelief"" after learning he'll have to swallow the cost of replacing his SUV's engine — not once, but twice, within weeks — despite the vehicle being part of a major recall that was issued before the breakdowns. And he's not the only one facing thousands of dollars in repair bills for vehicles under recall. In June, Rick Lingard's 2011 Hyundai Tucson's engine seized and died while he was driving down a major highway near Cranbrook, B.C. ""They showed me the engine after they took it out and there was a hole in it. It was destroyed,"" said Lingard, who lives in Nelson.  He paid more than $7,000 to replace it, opting for a used engine with 40,000 kilometres on it, through an independent mechanic, after a Hyundai dealership quoted him more than $10,000 for a new one. A few weeks later, it happened again. ""The same kind of high-pitched rattle-y sound … and then all the lights came on again and — boom! I was in disbelief,"" he told Go Public. Then, another twist: Just three days after the second catastrophic engine failure, Lingard got a recall notice describing the same problem. The recall was issued in February, but the notice didn't arrive in the mail until August. Lingard says no one at two Hyundai dealerships he'd contacted about his engine breakdowns mentioned anything about a recall. ""To me, it's just irresponsible to the core,"" he said. Transport Canada could easily fix the problem, according to one automotive consumer advocate, by forcing Hyundai to cover Lingard's costs. But the federal agency, says George Iny of the Automotive Protection Association, tends not to use the full extent of its powers.  The agency also has the power to force recalls — under changes made last year to the Motor Vehicle Safety Act — but has never used it.  ""Transport Canada is a bit like an out-of-shape person who just got a gold-plated membership to the gym. That doesn't automatically put you in shape,"" said Iny. ""Transport Canada needs to act more assertively."" After getting the recall notice, Lingard submitted his receipts to Hyundai Canada. It rejected the claim, saying his first engine failure was due to ""insufficient engine maintenance, not the recall"" because Lingard didn't do sufficiently frequent oil changes prior to 100,000 kilometres of driving, and didn't provide receipts for subsequent changes.  The company says he changed his oil every 20,000 kilometres instead of every 12,000 as required by the manual. After the warranty expired, Lingard says he stopped going to the dealership for oil changes.  Iny says using oil changes as a reason to deny claims is common but puzzling.  ""The fact that you didn't keep records of oil changes doesn't make you negligent. That's just an invention,"" Iny said. ""It's not a valid reason for refusing coverage.""  He says both Kia and its part-owner Hyundai have admitted, in some cases, that such engine failures stem from metallic debris left inside during the manufacturing process.  In those cases, ""whether you did oil changes or not,"" Iny said, ""the debris was already there."" Lingard's recall notice doesn't mention debris.  Hyundai Canada also denies responsibility for Lingard's second blown engine because, according to a spokesperson, the engine was not ""provided, installed or inspected by a Hyundai dealer."" When Go Public asked why his recall notice took months to arrive, and why no one at the company told Lingard about the recall, it didn't respond.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they, too, are being left out of the recall. Scott Wild and his wife Donna Stewart, of Cambridge, Ont., experienced the same dangerous breakdown as Lingard, when the engine of their 2013 Kia Sportage suddenly failed at high speeds on June 4. Their mechanic also found a hole had been blown in the side of the engine and it needed to be replaced. ""I said, 'You can't be serious … this vehicle has 140,000 kilometres on it and it's finally paid off,'"" Wild said. That's when the couple discovered there's a recall on the 2013 Kia Sportage, but their specific vehicle isn't covered. Kia told them their vehicle identification number was not listed under the recall.  ""It was really weird, "" said Wild. ""What happened to our vehicle is exactly the same as what happens to all the vehicles that are on the list."" Kia Canada told Go Public that the couple's vehicle had an MPI (""multi-point injection"") engine — and only those with GDI (""gasoline direct injection"") engines are part of the recalls.  What's the difference? When Go Public asked, the company didn't answer. But independent mechanic Chris Solodko, in Hamilton, told Go Public he's repaired dozens of both types and, in his opinion, their engine problems are almost identical. ""They all have the same noise, the same problem. One [type of engine] is running on a high pressure and the other one is running on a low pressure,"" he said.  Transport Canada told Go Public it has received 65 complaints of engine failures not covered by the Kia and Hyundai recalls since March and says it is investigating whether more vehicles should be added. Iny says they have to move faster. ""There is a pattern here. What we need of the carmakers is an open mind that the complaints that fall outside of the group are not just turned down but that they are looked into,"" he said. Wild and Stewart ended up selling their vehicle for parts, then joined one of at least four Canadian, engine-related class-action lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai. The lawsuits have not yet been certified by the courts.  Both Hyundai and Kia have been dogged with engine failure and fire complaints and lawsuits in Canada and the U.S. Hyundai and Kia have recalled almost 500,000 vehicles in Canada for engine-related defects since 2015, due to manufacturing debris that could cause the engines to fail. The problem can also cause fires. Millions of other vehicles have been recalled in the U.S. and, in October, the companies agreed to set aside $758 million US to settle related class-actions in the U.S. and South Korea, pending approval by the courts. Iny is hopeful a U.S. settlement might mean one is coming for drivers in Canada, but it could be a while before that happens — if at all. ""We would want total parity,"" he said. In the meantime, Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a safety-related problem with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Wild and Stewart have filed complaints with Transport Canada. They are waiting to see what the agency decides. ""Zero compassion. Zero empathy. Zero everything,"" Wild said about his interaction with Kia staff.

""The tents located on this property have become a hazard to public safety,"" said Logan. But Dennis Robertson, who stayed in his tent during recent the recent bitter nights, had one simple question for the province: why now? ""You had a whole year to hand this out, or even start the eviction,"" said Robertson.  ""Why kick us while we're down?"" An emailed statement from the Department of Social Development said the choice to evict the residents from the tent city was made for their own safety. ""There is no heat or running water available at this site and given the extreme cold in recent days, we are encouraging these individuals to take advantage of the beds available at one of the three shelters in the city,"" said the department.  Warren Maddox, the executive director of Fredericton's Homeless Shelters, said both the men's and women's shelters have capacity. Joan Kingston, chair of the city's Community Action Group on Homelessness, said the out-of-the-cold shelter can house 25 people at once, but 40 different individuals have used the shelter at various times. The tents sprang up last May after a winter shelter closed. It has carried on through this winter, despite the creation of an emergency shelter again this year.  At least nine residents spent Thursday morning packing their belongings into totes provided for them. The Social Development Department said it has ""offered to provide storage space to the individuals who had been living in the tents to store their belongings until more permanent accommodations can be found."" Robertson said he has his own storage locker, but other residents aren't so lucky and are concerned they will never see their belongings again if they are given to the province. Residents gave different reasons for why they chose the tent city over shelters, but many, including Robertson, said the vibe of the out-of-the-cold shelter has changed from last year. ""There's been a little bit of favouritism, a lot more stealing, a lot more disrespect,"" said Robertson. Robertson said he plans on trying to set up a tent in another location and said he'll try to help as many people as he can.

""We evaluated the value for Canada, as a brand, in association and attributed to stories that were run either on TV news, radio, digital and print news, as well as Facebook and Twitter,"" said Smallwood. Apex searched for every reference to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in those sources from January 1, 2020, until 2 p.m. ET on January 22, 2020. The firm used these references to calculated the equivalent brand value, which Smallwood describes as the ""earned media value"" — essentially, how much value an organization would spend or receive if it was paying for advertisements, marketing and similar public relations.  So how much exposure Harry and Meghan have added to ""Brand Canada"" in 2020? The results surprised Smallwood.  ""It came out to be over $28 million in value,"" he said. ""It was definitely on the higher end of what we expected."" Specifically the marketing firm calculated that the value to Canada's brand from all the coverage between Jan. 1 and Jan 22, 2020 was $28,211,991. Toronto jewlery designer Sue Henderson, owner and designer behind Suetables, experienced a version of this ""brand value"" in November 2019 when the Duchess of Sussex wore the company's products in public. ""I woke up from a text from our marketing manager on November 19th,"" said Henderson. ""She wrote: 'IT HAPPENED' with a screen shot of Meghan Markle wearing two of our necklaces. The two 10-karat gold zodiac charms worn by Markle represented Harry and Archie's astrological signs. ""I've always been a fan of Meghan Markle,"" said Henderson. ""I had been trying to get her to wear our jewlery for years when she was on Suits.""  The jewelry designer told The Cost of Living she was most excited by the worldwide attention, which thrust her designs onto the international stage just from being worn by — and seen on — Meghan Markle. ""Within two days we were all over the world. We had over 30 articles written about us. The coverage was crazy,"" said Henderson. ""I knew it would create a buzz, but we're a small Canadian company. We thought our Canadian followers would go, 'Oh, that's really cool! We'll buy more of that.' But it was the international component that we just didn't expect."" Henderson said the sales lasted for weeks, including sales boosts on November 2019's ""Black Friday"" and through the Christmas period. The designer told CBC Radio that online sales from the end of November increased by 150 per cent, and that their typical online team grew from just one person to ten. ""Any random person that ever said to me, 'Hey, you know if you ever need any help...' I'm like, okay, you're a full time [gift] wrapper,"" said Henderson, who also said visitors to the Suetables website increased by more than 700 per cent. Henderson and her team were over the moon when Markle wore one of the charms again, in a recent visit to a Vancouver women's centre. There are many other ways the Sussexes could bump Canada's economy. ""I mean, they're gonna show pictures of the house that they're staying in, the scenery around it, so it will be a high profile location for people to visit in a tourism scenario and then this should help the real estate in that area,"" said Apex Marketing's Eric Smallwood. The marketing expert compared the effect on real estate to what happened with famous locations U.S. presidents vacationed in. ""Kennebunkport, Maine, is a good example, where the Bushes would reside. The Kennedys with Martha's Vineyard. All those are high profile [locations] but also high real estate and it keeps growing,"" said Smallwood. Harry and Meghan could have lived anywhere, but they chose Canada. And that means almost every time the world talks about the famous couple, they'll hear about this country and what the Sussexes are doing here. That will draw attention to Canada, but also create potential ""brand value"" for any businesses the couple choose to patronize. ""They're going to be Canadian royalty in a sense,"" said Smallwood. ""Not technically, but they will be. When they cross the country and do whatever business they're going to be doing. You know they're going to be followed. They're celebrities."" Right now, Canada spends around $62 million a year on the Crown, according to the Monarchist League of Canada. Canadians do pay for the Queen's representatives here at home. That ranges from the Governor General in Ottawa and all the office's supporting departments to the provincial lieutenant-governors. We also cover costs when members of the Royal Family come to Canada for official visits, such as when the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge came to Canada for eight days in 2016 to help celebrate the country's sesquicentennial.

""Every friend I have came over to help,"" said MacDonald with a laugh, noting this was her fourth move in six years. Her new print shop, Deep Hollow Print, is in her home in North Alton, in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. The letterpress process involves putting movable type on a press bed. You fill the spaces between the type with other material. Once that's locked and ready to go, you put ink on the press. The paper is pressed down onto the letters to create the print. Some presses use electricity, but MacDonald's doesn't. She uses elbow grease and oil. Video produced by Wesley Booth, Hilary Drummond, with help from Kyle Bernard, for CBC. Music: The Basin Brothers. The walls of MacDonald's studio are plastered with letterpress she's made or collected. There's the twinkle of string lights and wooden letters that all could tell a story. This is a place where she creates and hosts house concerts. Some music has been recorded here too. In this digital age, MacDonald said there's a resurgence of people wanting something more tactile and warm, like vinyl records. Her letterpress posters have this feel. ""They're warmer, they're friendly, they're human, "" she said. ""You can tell in all their imperfections that, you know, somebody has touched them to make them."" MacDonald specializes in gig posters, but also creates album covers and concert tickets. She's won two East Coast Music Awards for her work. She also does projects for local businesses, like the bags for North Mountain Coffee, and makes art prints. Some of her work is graphic design. MacDonald was born in Nova Scotia. She moved to the United States when she was young, but came back home about 10 years ago to work at Gaspereau Press. She was interested in book publishing and binding at the time, but developed a love for letterpress. Her letterpress education also took her to Nashville, where she interned at Hatch Show Print, which is famous for it's circus and minstrel show posters. A lot of famous performers had posters printed there, including Elvis Presley and B.B. King. ""Eventually, they sort of become the face of the country music industry down there,"" said MacDonald. She experienced that history first-hand. ""I used an h that was used on an old Hank Williams poster,"" said MacDonald. While at Hatch Show Print, she worked on posters for the likes of Willie Nelson. His manager would even send them Krispy Kreme doughnuts sometimes. ""Love Krispy Kreme donuts,"" said MacDonald. A lot of MacDonald's work is inspired by Nova Scotia. She said the Annapolis Valley is a very supportive community. Most of her clients are local, and the music scene in the valley and the province has been good for her business. A lot of her clients like to come to her shop to see the process, and sometimes they even help her print the work. MacDonald said she would eventually like to hold printing workshops. ""It's hard to get started when you don't have the space, you don't have the equipment, so you kind of rely on kindness of other older printers to help you out,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285,[],N/A

It was damaged in a fire at the church in 2017. But Jason Barnsley, a restoration specialist from Calgary, says it can be rebuilt. It needs a new console and wiring, but the rest of the organ's parts survived the fire.  This past week, Barnsley and his small crew of three were at the church in Whitehorse dismantling and boxing up the many pieces of the mechanically complex, century-old organ. They'll spend the coming months restoring the various parts in Calgary. ""It's like a jigsaw puzzle constructed by a crazy person,"" said Barnsley. ""I actually know where everything goes, but if a layperson were coming into this they would go, 'I think you're nuts trying to put this all together ... there are a million and one pieces here.'"" Barnsley can even guess what started the fire inside the organ — its aging control centre. ""Those are all modern now, using solid-state control systems versus the original hardwiring and a lot of electricity, which is ultimately what caused it to catch fire — because there was so much wiring inside,"" he said. He says the pneumatic pipe organ's inner workings are as complex as those of fine Swiss watch. Barnsley says the organ's analog electrical systems were ahead of their time when it was built in 1926. He compares it to ""very early, early computing."" The pneumatic pipe organ's 762 individual pipes plus numerous parts originally made their journey from Pennsylvania to Whitehorse 40 years ago. Whitehorse church members had seen an ad in a magazine, and ended up buying the organ for a dollar. The organ's previous owner, a church in Pennsylvania, wanted the organ to have a northern home. The organ filled Trinity Lutheran with glorious sound for decades — and it's hoped that will continue soon. Once all the parts are at Barnsley's shop in Calgary, he'll fix it up with modern wiring. It will likely be returned to Whitehorse and rebuilt in about a year. ""We are hoping that by revitalizing the pipe organ we will be able to offer a really fine instrument in an intimate concert venue to the larger Whitehorse community,"" said Deb Bartlette, a minister at Trinity Lutheran Church.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/pipe-organ-restoration-yukon-1.5440294,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-pipe-organ-fire-trinity-church-1.4048645,N/A

It's a province-wide emergency fund, committed to helping professionals who work in culture, arts and entertainment.  Board co-chair Jenn Brown says people working in the arts often don't have the luxuries of other sectors, like benefits or salaries, so losing a full week of work can be devastating.  ""It's meant to be a one-time means of support really, when a crisis happens,"" said Brown.  In the past, the CAPE fund has been employed when an artist experienced a medical emergency in the family, when someone experienced a house fire or an accident.  It's the first time it's been used to help artists who have been impacted by a winter storm.  ""This [was] a state of emergency, we are a fund created to assist people in times of emergency ... we really thought that served our mandate and our mission,"" Brown said.  The CAPE fund has allocated $10,000 to allow up to 40 applicants to receive a one-time payment of $250.  ""In less than 24 hours, we had 11 applications come in ... the first applications came in maybe 20 minutes after we first released the call,"" Brown said.  If the need turns out to be greater than 40 applicants, Brown said the board will re-assess the plan.  ""We've had theatre productions which have been shut down, we've had people lose gigs, we've had film productions shut down, we've also had arts and cultural organizations shut their doors, and what that means is that there's no money coming in at the end of the week,"" said Brown.

146,Kelly Crowe,2020-01-24T09:03:49.903Z,Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses,"For a few hours on Thursday, it appeared the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had spread to Saudi Arabia with reports that a nurse in Asir was infected.  But it was a case of mistaken virus identification, quickly corrected. The unfortunate nurse was actually infected with a different but equally frightening coronavirus: MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS-CoV), which made the leap from animals to humans in 2012, creating a brand new human disease. It was a vivid reminder that for almost a decade there has been a threat from another highly pathogenic never-before-seen virus. MERS was only the second coronavirus ever known to leap from animals to humans and cause a deadly illness. The first of these notorious bugs was SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS-CoV), which swept the world in the spring of 2003, killing nearly 800 people, including 44 Canadians. With scant information about the novel virus that has just emerged in China, experts are reviewing the experience of SARS and MERS for important clues about what to expect. ""The interesting thing about this is that we're really not sure which way it's going,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""We first thought, well, there really wasn't much transmission from human to human."" Now that it's clear the virus can spread between people, Fauci said the next question is how easily it will spread. ""The real question right now is will it get better at going in what we call 'sustained transmission' from human to human. Because if it doesn't, then we have a very good chance of pretty quickly getting our arms around it and, by public health measures, essentially stopping it."" Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, is a veteran of the SARS and MERS outbreaks, and he's blunt about the current situation. ""This is a bad disease. It makes people very sick and it can kill you. And so I think that is an important combination. But  the ultimate case fatality rate is still yet to be determined."" In other words, experts still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, with a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""I know how this picture is starting but I don't know how it ends. And so I think that's the question we're all asking,"" said Osterholm. The SARS and MERS viruses followed different paths. SARS began in China in the fall of 2002 and spread around the world quickly. By spring 2003, it had travelled to 37 countries including Canada, sickening more than 8,000 people. Still, SARS lacked the ability to spread easily between humans. ""It never really developed the capability of having sustained vigorous transmission from person to person,"" said Fauci. ""There was clearly person-to-person transmission but it wasn't like influenza. You had thousands of cases but not millions of cases."" And after nine frightening months, SARS was extinguished, apparently forever. ""SARS was actually a huge public health success in that we were able to control, contain and eliminate that virus,"" said Dr. Catharine Paules, who co-authored a new paper with Fauci about coronavirus infections published this week in JAMA. ""But then in 2012 we had the emergence of a second animal coronavirus in the human population."" MERS first appeared in Jordan in 2012 with cases showing up in 27 countries over eight  years. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control states that all of the MERS cases are linked to travel or residence in countries around the Arabian Peninsula. There was a major outbreak of MERS in a South Korean hospital in 2015 where 186 people were infected and 36 died. So far, public health agencies have been able to limit the human-to-human spread of MERS but they have not been able to eradicate the virus. That's because MERS has become the camel version of the common cold. ""The camels will be sneezing or coughing and they sort of sneeze or cough this virus onto people; that's how we think it's transmitted,"" said Paules. In the case of SARS, animal-to-human transmission was eliminated when live-animal markets stopped selling small mammals, including palm civets, which were found to be carrying the SARS virus. ""Once we realized that palm civets were the primary animal species transmitting it to humans, and the markets were eliminated, we literally shut off the faucet of new infections coming into humans,"" said Osterholm. The animal reservoir for the new virus is so far a mystery. Experts are extremely skeptical about early reports of an association with snakes. ""I know there was a recent publication that came out about snakes, but that's hotly being debated right now as we aren't even sure that reptiles can get infected with coronaviruses,"" said Paules. ""I think many of us thought that that was in error and not likely to be the source,"" said Osterholm. ""But at this point, we have no data otherwise from the Chinese to know what might have been the animal reservoir."" ""If you want to put some money on it, you'd get a bat involved,"" said Fauci. ""SARS went from the bat to the palm civet cat to the human, and MERS went from the bat to the camel to human. I don't have any idea what the animal is for this one but I would not be surprised if a bat was involved somewhere."" There are also major questions about the transmissibility of the new virus. Scientists still don't know how the virus spreads, although Fauci said environmental tests revealed traces of the virus at the market in Wuhan, China. ""They did environmental samples and it was able to be seen on some of these inanimate objects in the fish market,"" he said. ""Though no one has yet done the definitive experiment of seeing whether it stays alive on a doorknob or not; I wouldn't be surprised if it did last for a limited period of time on inanimate objects."" Fauci said it appears to take about six days for someone who has been infected to show symptoms, but it's not clear whether the virus can be spread by someone who does not appear to be sick. ""But there are anecdotes; for example, the individual from Seattle who got infected does not remember coming into contact with anyone that was sick, nor does he remember coming into contact with any animals, nor did he feel that he had any exposures. Yet he got infected."" A grim aspect of all three diseases is the phenomenon of the super-spreader — a person who, for some reason still not well understood, is able to infect a large number of people. ""That's one of the big mysteries,"" said Osterholm.  ""Super-spreaders have been individuals who have been severely ill and even people who've been moderately ill. Why they're putting out so much virus is just not clear."" In the case of MERS, Osterholm said one person in a South Korean emergency room was able to infect 82 people in 2015. In the case of SARS, one super-spreader in Beijing was responsible for a chain of infections in 76 people. It's been reported that one man in Wuhan infected 14 hospital workers, which could be the first evidence of a super-spreader in this outbreak. But because it happened during surgery, the infection could be related to the surgical procedures. ""I think we have to still be a little bit careful, because this individual actually had had surgery, and any time you intubate somebody, you know you may very well have induced a higher rate of spreading the virus,"" said Osterholm. One of the encouraging aspects of the SARS story is that the virus was contained, said Osterholm, pointing to Canada, where most of the more than 400 infections and 44 deaths happened in and around Toronto. ""While Canada suffered miserably because of what was going on in Toronto, there weren't even any cases in Calgary, and Winnipeg,"" he said. ""So what we need to get people to understand is that we can't say this isn't going to come to every country in the world. It's unlikely, but it could. But when it does, it's going to likely be largely an institution-based outbreak like a hospital."" ""So that just helps give people a sense that we're not all going to die from this,"" he said. At her hospital in Hershey, Pa., Paules is part of a team that trains regularly to respond to an emerging viral threat. She said some of the strategies developed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks are already being used, including the closing of animal markets and airport screening. ""Some of those things have been able to get up and running very quickly, probably because of the lessons learned from SARS,"" said Paules. China was able to sequence the new virus and get that critical genetic code to the world quickly. Diagnostic tests have been developed, which means cases can be identified and isolated to contain the spread. ""I think some of the things from SARS and MERS that have really helped us here is how quickly the Chinese authorities were able to globally circulate the sequence of this virus,"" said Paules, who echoes Osterholm's point that most people don't have to worry about this virus. ""I would be concerned if I was in some of these areas in China. I would not myself probably decide to travel to any of those areas right now. But here sitting in my office in Hershey, Pennsylvania, I have a low concern that this virus is going to impact me personally, although I'm concerned for the global community.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562,[],N/A
147,Kathleen Harris,2020-01-27T02:07:04.732Z,"Health officials expect more coronavirus cases, but say risk of outbreak in Canada remains low","Federal health officials expect more cases of the coronavirus, but say the risk of an outbreak in Canada remains low. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said officials at all levels of government are working with hospitals and international partners to prevent and respond to potential infections.  ""We're working actively to limit the spread of the virus,"" Hajdu said at a news conference in Ottawa Sunday morning after the first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus was reported in Toronto. Hospitals have an ""incredibly strong"" system to prevent and control infections, she said. Hajdu said much has been learned from the SARS virus in 2003. Since the first cases of this novel coronavirus were reported in China in December, the federal government has been in close contact with the provincial health authorities and international players to share information in a ""collaborative, responsive"" approach. WATCH: Health Minister Patty Hajdu on the federal response to coronavirus Hajdu said there is considerable misinformation being spread about the virus which ""belies the reality"" that the risk to Canadians remains extremely low. CBC News has reported that misinformation and unverified claims about the virus have been circulating on social media. While the government does not expect a chartered plane is necessary to evacuate Canadians from the Wuhan region where the outbreak began, Hajdu said Global Affairs Canada stands ready to provide support services for any Canadian trying to leave China. CBC News has learned that one Canadian will be on board a flight chartered by Washington to fly diplomats and Americans out of Wuhan. A government official said 67 Canadians are registered as being in the affected region, but because registration is voluntary, the figure does not give a complete picture of Canadians in Hubei or in China. Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said despite the fact the number of cases in China is increasing, the export to other countries remains low and the risk remains low in Canada. Tam said the reported case Saturday was ""not unexpected."" Canada confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus in Toronto on Saturday after receiving lab results. The patient, a man in his 50s who had recently travelled to Wuhan, China, is isolated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and is now in stable condition. ""The health system is on alert to detect potential cases and to respond promptly when they are confirmed,"" Tam said. ""It shows that our systems are working."" The case is ""presumptive"" until it is formally confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Tam said she expects the formal results of the test to confirm the virus within 24 hours. She said the man experienced symptoms on board China Southern Airlines Flight CZ311, but he apparently did not report those symptoms. Health officials are now tracing fellow passengers who were seated close to the patient — in a two-metre radius — to determine if others are affected. Family members of the patient are also being closely monitored and in self-isolation. WATCH: Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam on the coronavirus According to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), coronaviruses most commonly spread from an infected person to others by air through coughing or sneezing, close personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, or by touching an object or surface contaminated with the virus, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands. Coronaviruses are a family of diseases that range from a common cold to more serious diseases such as SARS. The federal health department's website says symptoms of most coronaviruses are usually mild to moderate and can include a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat and/or fever, as well as a general feeling of being unwell. Looking for a comprehensive plan and full resources from the federal government to contain this novel <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronoavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#coronoavirus</a>. The NDP will cooperative in every way to help keep Canadians safe. <a href=""https://t.co/stRsWSH48u"">https://t.co/stRsWSH48u</a> Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, agreed that the first case in Canada was not unexpected, and that other cases in Canada are likely. He said it's possible that other passengers on board that flight could have transferred to flights to other provinces. The health agency's protocol is to follow up on those persons for possible symptoms over the next 14 days. The number of infections worldwide now exceeds 2,000 cases, most of them in China, which reports 56 deaths. Dr. Jerome Leis, an infectious diseases specialist at Sunnybrook, said people who are acutely ill should go to hospital, but said those with mild symptoms should reach out to public health authorities. ""We completely understand that there's a lot of anxiety and questions in the general public, and that is very understandable. I want to be absolutely clear that individuals who have questions or anxiety, the first reflex should not be to go to an emergency department,"" he said. ""The first point of contact should be with public health if there are questions or concerns."" Air Canada announced Sunday it is extending its ""goodwill policy"" to allow passengers to make alternate travel arrangements during the affected period. People can change their flight free of charge to another date or another destination, or can cancel a flight for a full refund. Risk mitigation measures now in place include messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports reminding travellers to advise border officials if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. WATCH: Why finding viral cases is easier now: ""While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health-care professional if you have travelled to an affected area of China, and develop flu-like symptoms,"" Hajdu said. Officials said the man took a flight on Jan. 21 from Wuhan to Guangzhou, then from Guangzhou to Toronto, arriving on Jan. 22. He is believed to have travelled ""privately"" from the airport to his home. Officials do not believe he took public transit. They have not said what part of the city the man lives in. Upon arriving, he told family members he felt ill and called 911. Officials say paramedics took all necessary precautions ""right from first contact"" until the hand-off to the hospital's emergency department on Jan. 23, officials say. It is not clear how lethal the new coronavirus is or even whether it is as dangerous as the ordinary flu, which results in 12,200 hospitalizations and about 3,500 deaths in Canada annually. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said provincial health officials are putting full resources to the virus, and will be staying vigilant and informing the public ""every step of the way."" ""It's something I feel we have a good handle [on] and we're ready, but we want to see the extent of this,"" he said Sunday in Toronto. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne issued a statement Sunday reminding Canadians to pay attention to travel advisories warning against non-essential travel to Hubei, China, including the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou. Canadians already in the region should register with consular officials, which will give them access to the latest updates from the government, he said.  ""We understand the concerns of Canadians in the region and those of their families and loved ones. We are in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground,"" Champagne said in the statement. ""Canadian consular officials are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with local authorities and our international partners to gather more information and provide support to the extent possible. Canada does not have a consular presence in Wuhan."" Transport Minister Marc Garneau's office said the department has set up a dedicated team to support and respond, and has activated the Emergency Co-ordination Centre. On Friday, Transport Canada officials held a teleconference with the Public Health Agency of Canada and airline representatives, and reminding the carriers they are required, under the terms of the Quarantine Act, to report ill passengers. Transport officials have also been in regular contact with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) to discuss contingencies and readiness plans.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-tam-health-china-1.5440950,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-coronavirus-preparedness-1.5439033 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-buses-1.5440899 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,N/A

149,Stephanie Levitz,2020-01-25T22:00:50.648Z,'I don't have anything to add': Scheer declines to address use of party funds for private school fees,"Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer declined Saturday to shed any light on lingering questions about the use of party money to pay for his children's tuition, an issue that threw his party into turmoil just as he announced his decision to step back from the leadership job. Scheer wrapped up meetings with Conservative MPs and senators to strategize for the return of the House of Commons, saying that his remaining months in the top job will have the dual focus of holding the minority Liberal government to account and laying the groundwork for the next election. A report commissioned into why the Conservatives didn't form government in the last election, despite a myriad of challenges for the Liberals, will help guide some of that work, he said Saturday, though parts of it no longer apply. ""This is a report to me, that obviously in many cases is not going to be relevant next time because a lot of it was about me, issues that happened in the campaign and advice to me about what I might want to do differently next time,"" he said. ""Clearly, I won't be leading the party into the next election, so some of those findings are irrelevant, but I will be sharing the key recommendations about structure, some of the lessons learned this time, with the next leader."" He said issues to work on include how the party recruits candidates and what tools were used in the campaign that weren't as good as their opponents. Scheer announced in mid-December that he would resign as leader as soon as the next one is elected, a date that's now been set as June 27. When he made the decision, he cited no longer having the heart for the full-time commitment the job requires, given the toll it was taking on his family. But the move came as allegations surfaced that his use of Conservative donors' money for tuition payments for his children was unknown to several of the party's most senior members, including former prime minister Stephen Harper. That set off a fight between the party's national council and the overseers of the Conservative Fund, which controls the party purse strings. Harper had been on the Fund's board at the time. The longtime executive director of the party left over the issue, leaving a gaping hole in party management just as they needed to spool up a leadership contest. Harper later left the Fund's board, giving no public reason. On Saturday, Scheer said the issue of his own expenses remained an internal party matter and refused to explain the situation at all. ""This is a party with many checks and balances between different aspects of the party and it's being handled that way,"" he said. ""I don't have anything to add on that."" Buzz grew around the leadership race Saturday. Former Conservative cabinet minister and MP Peter MacKay officially launched his campaign at an event in his old riding of Central Nova, while current MP Erin O'Toole posted a video to social media previewing his own campaign launch on Monday. Scheer said leadership races are exciting, but pose challenges because candidates debate their various points of view on issues out on the campaign trail. ""My job is to make sure our parliamentary caucus stays focused on the common ground that does exist between all Conservatives,"" he said. ""That will be where will be highlighting wasteful spending, higher taxes and fiscal mismanagement that the Liberals have been so closely identified with so that's what we're going to focus on here and the leadership candidates will all make their case to the members.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/personal-spending-a-party-matter-scheer-says-1.5440731,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/baird-scheer-conservative-2019-election-1.5426800 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-race-won-t-distract-party-in-a-minority-government-scheer-1.5438815 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oponents-colleauges-bid-scheer-farewell-1.5394710 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/scheer-resigns-1.5393803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-mackay-officially-launches-bid-for-conservative-leadership-1.5440587,N/A
150,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-07-08T18:29:27.210Z,"Mother who watched son burn to death in SUV fire joins calls for answers from Kia, Hyundai ","When Carol Nash heard screams for help, she rushed out of her apartment in her nightgown and found her SUV burning in the parking lot — but couldn't get close enough to save her son, sitting in the driver's seat. ""I could not do anything except stand there and watch him die,"" Nash told Go Public. Keith Nash, 48, burned to death on April 19, 2017, in his mother's 2014 Kia Soul while the vehicle was parked outside her low-rise apartment building in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother says Kia has never contacted her to explain what happened. She was devastated when she learned the company issued a recall for the SUV for a potential fire risk in February — two years after her son died. ""I suffer on a daily basis with this because I have no answers,"" she said.  Since 2015, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have recalled more than three million vehicles in North America over concerns the engines could fail at high speeds or burst into flames. A Go Public investigation revealed other models weren't on any Canadian recall lists when drivers experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires. After the CBC News investigation, both Kia and Hyundai vastly expanded the number of recalls in Canada. Hyundai is a part-owner of Kia. Automobile safety advocates and vehicle owners accuse the two companies of downplaying fire and engine failure reports and taking too long to roll out recalls, raising questions about when they first knew of the safety issues and whether more vehicles might still pose a risk. ""We now have multiple years of reports of these catastrophic engine failures and the very slow reaction from the companies,"" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The automakers say they are on top of the problems and are working with Transport Canada to address them. The official cause of death for Keith Nash was smoke and gas inhalation. Fire investigators believe the blaze started in the engine area, but weren't able to determine the exact cause.  In an email to Go Public, Kia suggests that fentanyl and heroin found in Nash's system may have rendered him unconscious and unable to get out of the burning car. The auto giant also says Nash may have caused the fire by simultaneously pressing down on the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle was in ""drive"" mode, causing the transmission fluid to ignite — an issue unrelated to the recall issued two years later, the company says. Go Public put that to Hamilton mechanic Chris Solodko, who has repaired dozens of Kia and Hyundai vehicles following engine failures. He says it's very rare for transmission fluid to catch fire. According to Solodko, Nash would have had to apply an enormous amount of pressure to the brake while holding the accelerator down to keep the SUV from moving and causing the transmission fluid to heat up to the point of catching fire. Carol Nash isn't the only one who wants answers.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they've experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires with vehicles that aren't part of any recall.  Robert Mitchell recalled getting a panicked phone call from his 30-year-old son Ryan on Aug. 11. Ryan told him he was driving the family's 2016 Hyundai Elantra down one of the busiest highways in the Toronto area — the 403 — when the engine seized and started to smoke before bursting into flames.  ""I don't think that a car — any car — should blow up and burn like that,"" Robert Mitchell said from the family's home in Mississauga, Ont. Mitchell's insurance company paid for the destroyed car. According to Transport Canada, the fire started in the engine compartment, but the cause is unknown. Another Hyundai Elantra, a 2018 model, is at the centre of a fire investigation in Windsor, N.S. On March 27, an Elantra that had been parked in front of a duplex for hours burst into flames. The fire spread to the building, but the families inside escaped unhurt. Video of overnight fire that destroyed century old home in Windsor but two families escape via dramatic rescue.<a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCNS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCNS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/0Rj84mGTtv"">pic.twitter.com/0Rj84mGTtv</a> Hyundai Canada and Transport Canada didn't confirm the cause of the fire. Transport Canada says the investigation is now in the hands of a private insurance company. Kia and Hyundai are now facing a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and at least two in Canada over the engine breakdowns and fires. The recalls issued so far cover certain Hyundai and Kia models produced after 2011, mostly involving a variety of safety concerns around what are called Theta-II engines. In some cases, the recalls address mechanical issues that could lead to engine failure. In others, software is installed that gives drivers advance warning of an engine problem.  Levine says his organization is seeing other types of engines breaking down or burning. He points out, for example, that Nash's Kia Soul — which was recalled in February — and the Hyundai Elantra don't have Theta engines. ""It's certainly troubling that it's going on at least several years ... these non-crash fires across a variety of makes and models, not only the Theta-II,"" he said. Go Public asked both Kia Canada and Hyundai Canada when they first knew about the engine defects, but neither company answered the question. Hyundai Canada was asked if it had a fix for the engine problems, but again, it didn't respond to the question directly. In an email, Hyundai Canada told Go Public that over the past 10 years, there have been 12 cases of engine fires determined to be a result of an issue with the vehicle itself. ""We stand behind the quality of our products and continuously work to ensure the highest safety standards for our customers,"" spokesperson Bianca Pettinaro wrote. She says the company has issued notices for all the vehicles that could be affected and is keeping an eye on the issues.   In another email, Kia Canada spokesperson Mark James wrote, ""A vehicle engine failure or fire can occur due to any number of complex factors, including inadequate maintenance, arson, or some other non-vehicle source, all cases must be carefully evaluated by trained technicians to determine its cause."" He says Kia has a strong safety record and promptly reports safety-related defects to Transport Canada. Hyundai and Kia are now being investigated by regulators in several countries — including Canada and the U.S. — over safety defects that may have led to engine failures and fires not caused by crashes.  Nearly 540,000 Hyundai and Kia vehicles are now under recall in Canada due to risk of engine failure or fire. Transport Canada is investigating whether more models should be part of the recalls after getting approximately 200 complaints about engines since 2014. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. is investigating engine failures and fires in certain model years. As of the end of March, the regulator had received more than 3,000 complaints of fires not related to collisions, including 103 injuries and one death. Those are the kind of answers Carol Nash is looking for — and that need to come from the automakers involved, she says.  ""I just don't want this ever for any other parent or any other mother to go through what I went through on that day."" Last November, both Kia and Hyundai refused to testify at a congressional hearing that was scheduled to look into the engine fires. That hearing was cancelled after the automakers declined to attend.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

151,Payam Akhavan,2020-01-11T09:00:00.411Z,Belonging and grief: What the Iran air disaster reveals about the inextricable ties that bind us together,"This column is an opinion by Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University, a former UN prosecutor at The Hague, and the 2017 CBC Massey Lecturer. He was born in Tehran and left Iran in his childhood, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1980 at the outset of the Islamic revolution and violent persecution of the Baha'i religious minority to which he belonged. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. On the outskirts of Tehran, the fragments of what was once a journey of many dreams lie scattered against a bleak landscape. Amidst the twisted metal and clothing littering the scorched earth, there is a single red shoe of a child. It has a pretty bow, slightly singed by the flames that engulfed Flight PS752 in its last moments before it crashed from the sky in a great ball of fire, bringing to a sudden end so many stories yet to be told, so many joys yet to be discovered. The little shoe made me think of one-year old Kurdia, whose parents Evin and Hiva had taken her halfway across the world, from Canada to Iran, to celebrate a wedding. Persian weddings, we jokingly say, need a football stadium to accommodate the guests. How many adoring grandparents and elders, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends must have smothered little Kurdia with affectionate kisses, seeing her for the first time, not knowing that it would also be the last. It seems to be the fate of people in the Middle East to suffer. Some weeks earlier, hundreds of Iranian youths were shot on the streets of Tehran for protesting corruption, crying for freedom, and their loved ones were arrested for mourning their loss. Mothers and fathers have been killed by barrel bombs in Idlib and Aleppo, standing in a bread line to appease the unbearable pain of hunger. And it is only a matter of time before we witness, yet again, those desperate to flee such horrors, drowning in the depths of the Mediterranean while trying to cross the forbidding sea in rubber dinghies, in search of a better world. And now, the grim sight of a long succession of body bags amidst the wreckage of the aircraft that carried so many on their way home to Canada, the country that opened its doors to them, answering their dream of a better future. One tries to be philosophical at times like this. ""Death is our wedding with eternity,"" the great mystic Rumi wrote. It is difficult to reconcile that wisdom with the horrors the hapless passengers must have experienced in their final moments. Yet, just as weddings are a communal experience that teach us what it means to belong, so too communal grief and mourning shows us, in the hour of darkness, the astonishing light of the human spirit; the inextricable ties that bind us together. In ""Tehranto"" and Montreal, Windsor and Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, Halifax and London, across this vast space we call Canada, people have lost family and friends, neighbours and colleagues, teachers and students. This isn't just another horrible thing happening ""out there,"" in that other world of suffering that momentarily intrudes on our lives of privilege, trivialized by a tweet or fleeting Facebook post, soon to be forgotten. Now it is happening to ""us,"" we who call ourselves Canadians, who imagine belonging as something that is beyond the bonds of blood and soil; a transcendent connection built on a shared humanity. The flag flies at half-mast at my university in Montreal, as it does across other campuses through the country. Many on that ill-fated flight were professors, researchers, and students, part of Iran's massive brain drain as accomplished and ambitious youth settle here in our midst to start new lives. On my mobile phone, there are numerous e-mails and text messages from fellow Canadians, expressing sympathy and concern, mourning the loss that has become ours for the simple reason that we have come to live in the same place – a wonderful and precious place where, amidst grief and suffering, compassion reigns supreme. Just as joyous celebrations define who we are, communal bereavement — healing together, whether it is with our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were here before us or with the recent immigrant returning home from a previous home — teaches us what it means to be human. What it means to be Canadian. It unites us at the core, gives us a deeper identity, emancipates us from the superficial divisions and distractions that we confuse with true meaning. ""Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes,"" Rumi wrote, ""because for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no separation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-air-disaster-iran-canada-1.5421028,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-flight752-crash-timeline-1.5419572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-ukrainian-plane-crash-canada-reaction-1.5418648 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265,N/A

153,Anonymous,2020-01-26T12:00:31.044Z,Dementia caregivers could access 24-hour support through new app created at U of S,"Almost one in every four people in Canada are caregiving for a family member or friend, and the stress of looking after someone can become overwhelming. But researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are working on a project to alleviate the pressures of what can sometimes be a 24-hour job, especially for caregivers of people living with Alzheimer's or dementia. They've developed the Caregiver Self-Compassion and Support App, a mobile app for caregivers that's now in the testing phase. The app features a series of podcasts that provide support and resources for caregivers, project lead Donna Goodridge told The Morning Edition on Friday. ""I think that we've begun to show that it is really helpful for people that are dealing with the day-to-day challenges of being a caregiver,"" said Goodridge.  The app is based on the idea of mindful self-compassion. Nathan Reis, a PhD student in kinesiology and researcher on the project, said this idea is a ""kind, understanding way of treating yourself."" The podcasts, said Reis, use this idea to walk listeners through steps to achieve self-compassion.  ""It can be ... a coping strategy or even a self-attitude,"" he said. Goodridge's participation in the project comes from personal experience. She cared for her mother, who had dementia, for almost 10 years.  ""We never know when ... we might need a break from caregiving,"" she said. ""I was not prepared at all ... for the overwhelming emotions [and] all of the challenges I faced on a day-to-day basis."" Reis said ideal candidates would be primary caregivers of people with dementia. Participants would test out the app and provide feedback afterward.  While technology can be daunting for some, Reis said the group has attempted to make the app as user-friendly as possible. There's also support available to users from Reis and other students if needed.  Goodridge said she hopes the app will be of use to people who can't get immediate access to in-person resources, as it's available around the clock. She added that it's been developed with Saskatchewan in mind, as all of the resources available on it are Saskatchewan-based.

Nestlé is partnering with Merit Functional Foods and Burcon NutraScience to supply protein from peas and canola that will be used in food and beverages. The plant-based protein industry is booming with meat and dairy alternatives being carried by many restaurants and grocery stores, and much of that comes from peas. ""It is large and growing rapidly. If you look online, you'll see all sorts of people trying to make estimates of how large it will grow. It's a huge opportunity,"" Burcon CEO Johann Tergesen said. ""And it's not only something — products — that are good for you in terms of health, they are good for the planet as well."" All the peas and canola will come from farmers in Canada, and a significant amount will be supplied by Manitoba producers, he said. Burcon, a developer of protein extraction technology, has been operating for about 20 years just off McGillivray Boulevard in south Winnipeg. In 2019, it established Merit, which manufactures those proteins into commercial ingredients. Merit is currently building a 94,000-square-foot production facility in Winnipeg that is scheduled to open in fall. It will produce multiple plant proteins with specific applications for food and beverage products, Tergesen said. There will be about 85 employees when the plant opens but Tergesen said there are already expansion plans for a total of about 240 employees. It made sense to locate the new Merit plant in Winnipeg, Tergesen said. ""We'll use a huge amount of electricity and Manitoba has some of the lowest hydro electricity rates in the world, an excellent and skilled workforce and access to the peas and canola right there,"" he said. ""There's many reasons that make Manitoba a perfect location for doing this.""

157,Anonymous,2020-01-25T03:22:59.473Z,U.S. House investigators given tape of Trump calling for ambassador's ouster,"An associate of Rudy Giuliani has provided congressional investigators with a recording of U.S. President Donald Trump saying he wanted to get rid of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, whose ouster emerged as an issue in the president's impeachment, his attorney told The Associated Press on Friday. The Giuliani associate, Lev Parnas, attended a small dinner with Trump at his Washington hotel in April 2018. Joseph Bondy, Parnas' lawyer, said he turned over to the House intelligence committee a recording from the dinner in which Trump demands the removal of Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. The recording, which was first reported by ABC News, appears to contradict the president's statements that he did not know Parnas, a key figure in the investigation. It came to light as Democrats continue to press for witnesses and other evidence to be considered during the Senate impeachment trial. ABC News reported that a speaker who appears to be Trump says on the recording, ""Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it."" Parnas and associate Igor Fruman worked with Giuliani on a push to get Ukraine to announce it would investigate former vice-president Joe Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. On the recording, the two tell Trump that the U.S. ambassador has been insulting him, which leads directly to the apparent remarks by the president. The White House denied any suggestion of presidential wrongdoing. ""Every president in our history has had the right to place people who support his agenda and his policies within his administration,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. Yovanovitch, who was viewed as an obstacle to probes into Biden and his son Hunter, was not recalled from her position until the following April. She said the decision was based on ""unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives"" that she was disloyal to Trump. Parnas appears to say on the recording: ""The biggest problem there, I think where we need to start, is we gotta get rid of the ambassador. She's still left over from the Clinton administration."" He later can be heard telling Trump. ""She's basically walking around telling everybody, 'Wait, he's gonna get impeached. Just wait."" House investigators have been working to document an almost yearlong effort on the part of Parnas and Giuliani to have Yovanovitch removed from her post. Parnas and Fruman were recently indicted by the Southern District of New York on charges including conspiracy to commit campaign finance fraud. Both have pleaded not guilty. Democrats seized on the recording as further evidence of Trump's involvement. ""If this is additional evidence of his involvement in that effort to smear her, it would certainly corroborate much of what we've heard, but I'm not in a position yet to analyze that, not having looked at it,"" Rep. Adam Schiff of California said. Parnas has done a series of interviews in recent days in which he has asserted that Trump was aware of the plan to remove Yovanovitch. Trump has distanced himself from Parnas, and the president's supporters have questioned his credibility and motives. ""I don't know Parnas other than I guess I had pictures taken, which I do with thousands of people,"" Trump said last week. ""But I just met him. I don't know him at all. Don't know what he's about, don't know where he comes from, know nothing about him. I can only tell you this thing is a big hoax."" The Associated Press has not reviewed the recording. The president is being tried in the Senate after the House impeached him last month, accusing him of abusing his office by asking Ukraine to probe the Bidens while withholding military aid from a U.S. ally at war with Russia. The second article of impeachment accuses Trump of obstructing Congress by refusing to turn over documents or allow officials to testify in the House probe. Republicans have defended Trump's actions as appropriate and are casting the process as a politically motivated effort to weaken him in his reelection campaign.

159,Anonymous,2020-01-23T11:31:37.196Z,"Windsor partnership with Amazon Ring doorbell could do more harm than good, experts say","Privacy experts, including a University of Windsor law professor, say they're concerned about the possibility of Windsor establishing a partnership with U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon and its Ring surveillance doorbell subsidiary.  Amazon's Ring is a video-enabled smart doorbell that allows users to see in real-time anyone who comes to their doorstep. The technology also contains a microphone and speaker that allows users to communicate with anyone on the other side of the door.  When combined with the Neighbors app, Ring doorbells allow users to share video footage with anyone else in their community, while also allowing users to start conversations about what's going on in their neighbourhoods.  Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens previously said that he looked into Ring products as a law enforcement tool, calling them a ""very effective, very smart tool."" He added that should Windsor pursue Ring surveillance, the Rose City would be the first Canadian city to utilize the system.  University of Windsor Faculty of Law assistant professor Kristen Thomasen, however, believes Ring ""raises a number of issues about surveillance in the community."" ""Some of the big concerns are that it's going to increase the amount of surveillance of public spaces,"" she said.  And while Ring products are marketed as providing an additional layer of safety for neighbourhoods and communities, Amazon in the U.S. has also partnered with more than 400 law enforcement agencies to distribute Ring systems as a means of improving community safety.  ""There's an important conversation to be had around whether we want to introduce this kind of surveillance network that also is corporate,"" said Thomasen.  She added that having neighbours or community members easily share security camera footage can also have troubling implications if combined with implicit biases about who is considered suspicious.  ""On top of all of that, the video footage that is recorded by Ring can then be shared with the police,"" she said. ""So this might lead to increasing policing over issues that would be non-issues if there wasn't video footage."" Thomasen also expressed concerns about the fact that Amazon currently develops facial recognition technology.  ""Is this footage going to be used for targeted advertising for tracking people? How is Amazon going to make use of this evidence?"" she said.  Chris Gilliard, an English professor and privacy scholar at Macomb Community College in Michigan, said products like Ring security cameras ""produce sort of a heightened sense of anxiety about people you don't think should be in your community."" ""In many instances of people having these cameras or participating in neighbourhood watch apps … a lot of the incidents that are reported are of people in a community reporting people that they see who they don't think belong in their community,"" he said. ""I don't think it's accidental that oftentimes, these are black and brown folks."" Gilliard said ""I don't think more cameras mean more safety.""

The teachers' bargaining committee has been in talks with the government trustee bargaining committee through conciliator Ernie Peltz for four days.  ""We hadn't moved very far, if at all, on the issues that are important. And so we ended up deciding that conciliation just wasn't a success,"" said Patrick Maze, president of the STF.  Conciliation was set up after nine months of failed negotiations, which ended in November.  The teachers want salary increases of two per cent, three per cent and three per cent over a three-year agreement. This follows two years with no increases. They also want changes to class size and composition. Maze said classrooms are overloaded with students and those with special needs don't get the attention they need because teachers are too busy ""putting out fires."" ""We would want to make sure that every student has the highest quality education possible and unfortunately under the current classroom situations that's not being offered to them,"" Maze said.  In the fall Education Minister Gord Wyant said was not willing to include class size and composition in an agreement with the union. He argued it would take away the ability to respond to individual situations. Maze said the province seems to be unwilling to come to an agreement for financial reasons.  The STF reinstated it's offer to divert $20 million in annual contributions to the teachers' health plan to address student needs if matched by the provincial government. Maze said the government didn't explore the offer. Minister of Education Gordon Wyant said the government's bargaining committee felt that progress was being made toward solutions on a number of items. ""The [committee] awaits the report from the conciliation panel and continues to look forward to future negotiations with the Teacher's Bargaining Committee,"" Wyant said in an statement emailed to CBC.  The teachers' bargaining committee will work with the STF Executive to decide what to do next.

163,Anonymous,2020-01-24T12:44:56.522Z,Critics lambaste PCs for 'politicizing' SEED program,"Critics admonished the New Brunswick government for giving politicians more say in its provincial student employment program — influence, they say, that opens the door for abuse.  The Progressive Conservatives announced changes to the Student Employment Experience Development, or SEED, program that scrap the lottery for placement vouchers in favour of students applying directly to approved employers, which have been limited to non-profit organizations, First Nations and municipalities. Employers can apply for SEED funding, and each MLA, regardless of party affiliation, will be allowed to recommend 22 placements in their riding. Labour Minister Trevor Holder said earlier this week the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour will have the final say over employers, but critics believe putting politicians back in the process is wrong. Green Party Leader David Coon said he's ""very unhappy"" with the decision. ""It's patently unacceptable to involve MLAs in making decisions about summer student job funding,"" he told CBC News.  ""I fought hard in 2014 and early 2015 to convince the government of the day to replace that process and I was successful. They agreed with me that it had no place in modern day New Brunswick and now the [PC] government has brought it back."" Coon said there are no criteria for which employers can be recommended and history shows the program can be abused. ""In the bad old days, some of the worst examples that I heard about where some MLAs told non-profits that, you know, they would get the funding if they hired this person or that person should they get the funding,"" Coon said. He continued: ""I'm not saying the majority of MLAs are going to abuse it that way, but it opens it up to that and we've certainly seen it in the past."" The previous Liberal government installed a system in which high school and post-secondary students entered a draw for placement vouchers and interested employers would then have to find a student with a voucher. Liberal MLA Roger Melanson, a cabinet minister in the previous government, said Thursday it was designed to allow students to work in their field of study. Holder said that system meant some unlucky students never received a placement, and it also created a disadvantage for rural employers and some non-profits that relied on students to run summer programs because there weren't enough nearby students with vouchers. ""In my view we have finally taken the politics out of it and treated every region around the province equal, regardless of how the people in that area voted,"" Holder told reporters on Tuesday. ""And I think this will go a long way to de-politicizing this process."" The New Brunswick Student Alliance, which previously lobbied to have MLAs removed from the program, criticized the changes following the announcement, saying department officials were better suited at identifying job opportunities. In a followup statement, executive director KJ Conyers-Steede said the changes will limit the variety of available placements, especially those interested in the business sector.  He said the alliance was concerned with renewed political involvement and fewer placements overall. ""We view these changes as a step in the wrong direction by politicizing the post-secondary sector,"" the statement said. ""Student issues are being ignored and convoluted in a system that prioritizes political wins over resolving the real concerns of students."" Mario Levesque, a political science professor at Mount Allison University, said giving MLAs a voice in the process is ""simply wrong."" ""It does leave room for politics to enter the decision-making process again, which is unfortunate,"" Levesque said. 'I think that you would want to try to eliminate politics from it altogether.""  The labour minister said he trusts MLAs to understand their district's priorities and that it's part of the government's ""strategy to empower MLAs,"" but Levesque said that's ""silly."" ""MLAs here are having the power to choose the people and what positions [they] get in their own riding. That's political interference in the summer jobs program,"" he said. ""That should not be acceptable and not allowable at all. That's pure partisanship and, in our democratic society, wrong actually."" Both Levesque and Coon said the placements shouldn't be spread evenly throughout the province since there's more need in the cities.  The Green leader said it should be up to the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour to develop criteria for placements.  The PC changes also include fewer job placements — down 200 from the 1,400 jobs last summer. The Tories say that by keeping the budget steady at $5.5 million but focusing on non-profits and First Nations, there are fewer dollars to go around. The government covers 100 per cent of placements in those areas, whereas the private sector received a 50 per cent subsidy. Municipalities also take on half of the cost.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-student-jobs-mlas-political-interference-1.5438493,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-changes-student-employment-1.5435534,N/A
164,Bob McDonald,2020-01-24T21:44:28.595Z,A slingshot to space,"A private startup company called Spinlaunch could be the first to throw a payload into space rather than use a rocket for primary propulsion. The company has said that it's received millions of dollars in funding, and a prototype launch contract from the U.S. Department of Defence for its technology. The company is apparently developing a kind of spinning slingshot that will hurl projectiles up from the ground at high velocity in an attempt to lower the cost of spaceflight. Spinlaunch was founded several years ago, and has been remarkably secretive about its technology. The small amount of information they've released indicates that they will use a ""mass accelerator"" to fling a dart-shaped vehicle at incredible speeds into the sky. A chemical rocket would then be ignited to finish boosting the vehicle into space. It is, in essence, the same principle used by ancient hunters who swung a sling around their head faster and faster then released it at the right moment so their projectile stone would fly off at great speed toward their intended prey.  There are many technologies they could be using, but the company hasn't said what they are. It could be a circular electromagnetic rail gun, or some kind of giant rotating centrifuge. Whatever the mechanism, the idea is to reduce the cost of delivering payloads to space through the use of a new technology. This will not be for human spaceflight. The g-forces involved spinning an object that fast would be far beyond what the human body could withstand. Most likely this will be appropriate for small (and presumably pretty robust) satellites.  The idea of reaching space without a rocket is not new. In 1686, Isaac Newton's famous book Principia he envisioned a cannon on a mountaintop to demonstrate the principle of achieving orbit. If a cannon could be fired at high enough speed, the curve that the cannonball follows would match the curve of the Earth so it would fly all the way around the planet and return to strike the back of the cannon an hour and a half later. Newton wasn't proposing this method for spaceflight, but he did demonstrate how the laws of gravity and ballistics could be used to reach orbit by giving an object a mighty initial push, rather than using the more constant propulsion of a rocket..  Later, in 1865, science fiction writer Jules Verne wrote From the Earth to The Moon in which an enormous cannon dug straight into the ground blasts a capsule containing three passengers all the way to the moon. Interestingly, he located the launch site in Florida, where the actual moon launches took place and Verne's capsule closely resembled the Apollo Command Module which also carried 3 astronauts. One hundred years later, the U.S. and Canadian defence departments cooperated on a project called HARP (High Altitude Research Project) to study the ballistics of spacecraft re-entry.  They used modified naval guns which fired massive 402 mm diameter projectiles to high altitudes.  Fired from a test site in Yuma, Ariz., one of their shells reached a record altitude of 180 kilometres, which qualifies as space, but it was not travelling fast enough to reach orbit. The project was eventually cancelled but the remains of one of the guns used in the tests can still be seen in Barbados today. The biggest problem facing projectiles launched from the ground is that they have to be launched at very high initial speed, on the order of many thousands of kilometres per hour and many times the speed of sound, to reach space. And to stay in space, they have to go even faster. In fact, to achieve low Earth orbit, they have to make it to space still travelling at about 28,000 km/h. That means they have to launch at even higher speeds. The projectile passes through the thickest part of the atmosphere as soon as it leaves the device, when it is travelling at its highest velocity. So air resistance and air friction are at their peak right at the beginning of the flight, slowing the projectile down and heating it up almost instantly.  As a result, any payload inside the projectile must withstand tremendous G-forces at launch and temperatures of thousands of degrees before it even reaches space. Spinlaunch recently obtained funding to break ground at Spaceport America in New Mexico, home to the space tourism company Virgin Galactic. There are tremendous obstacles to overcome if they want to throw an object into space from the ground. However, given how complex and expensive conventional rockets are, if it works, this simpler slingshot method could cut the cost of putting a small satellite into orbit considerably.  It is interesting that an old idea of simply throwing an object really fast and really high might still be used to get off the planet.",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/a-slingshot-to-space-1.5439638,[],N/A

""I'm a huge horror movie fan and to see some representation in the horror genre is really cool,"" said Jay Soule.  Soule, also known as Chippewar, is known for politically driven installation pieces that draw attention to issues facing Indigenous people across Canada. He also has a clothing line and paints his own interpretations of classic film posters by indigenizing the titles and images.  He was approached by Elevation Pictures to create a teaser poster for Barnaby's new film, which premiered last year at Toronto International Film Festival.  The film's premise is that an apocalyptic zombie virus is sweeping the nation and the only people who seem to be immune are part of a fictional First Nations reserve. As people flee to the reserve, the main characters have to decide whether to let outsiders in, risking their own safety. The film and its title offer a commentary on colonization and the concept of blood quantum as a measure of one's indigeneity. Soule said he's probably seen the film four or five times and has created three pieces, one for a TIFF zine and another for the cover of NOW magazine. The latest rendition will be used for promotional purposes leading up to the film's theatrical release in April.  For Soule, a horror genre lover, the film was already in his wheelhouse of interest.  ""It was hand in hand with already what I'm doing with indigenizing classic film,"" he said.   Under his pseudonym Chippewar, Soule recreates classic film posters with an Indigenous spin, like turning The Breakfast Club into The No-breakfast Club or Back to the Future into Back to 1491. For Blood Quantum, ""I went for that old grindhouse-style poster from the late '70s when the posters were still hand-drawn,"" he said. Barnaby said he wasn't familiar with Soule's work prior to being introduced by Elevation, which surprised him.  ""What he does with posters, I do with films,"" said Barnaby.  The Mi'kmaw director said he's very happy with Soule's work on the teaser poster.  ""It looks like a kickass action movie,"" he said.

170,"Vera-Lynn Kubinec, Kristin Annable, Caroline Barghout",2019-12-18T11:00:00.347Z,Suspended Winnipeg truck driver training company failed to act with 'honesty and integrity': MPI,"A Winnipeg truck driving school was given the longest training suspension in Manitoba Public Insurance's recent history, after the Crown corporation found the school was using an unauthorized instructor and an unauthorized truck, and had failed ""to act with honesty and integrity."" Longview Driving School was one of five schools offering training to obtain a Class 1 licence — which allows drivers to operate semi-trailer trucks — that were audited last year. Those audits came as MPI moved toward implementing mandatory truck driver training in response to the 2018 Humboldt Broncos bus crash. Longview was handed a five-year suspension by Manitoba Public Insurance, effective November 2018. ""MPI called me and told me 'your licence is suspended,' and I'm, like — wow,"" said Jitender Singh Dhalan, who was a part owner of Longview and a permitted driving instructor. ""I know I did mistakes,"" he said. ""I do regret these things."" The company has since been dissolved, but Dhalan is now working as an instructor with a different driver training company in Winnipeg, Blue Bird Class 1 Training Centre Ltd.  Manitoba Public Insurance regulates driver training companies under the provincial Drivers and Vehicles Act, said MPI spokesperson Brian Smiley.  He would not specify what prompted the audit specifically of Longview or the other four schools, saying only that a tip came in. Longview was the only school that was sanctioned, while ""conversations"" were had with the other four driving schools, said Smiley. ""Sanction was the last resort,"" he said.  ""There's expectations on these driving schools. They are teaching people how to drive. They're also accepting money. They're a business. So there's expectations for them to be honest and acting with integrity."" MPI found Longview had committed eight violations: Truck driver training courses were not a requirement for getting a Class 1 driver's licence in Manitoba until September 2019. Along with other provinces, Manitoba made the training courses mandatory for new truck drivers in the wake of the April 2018 crash between a semi and the Humboldt Broncos' bus, which killed 16 people and injured 13 others aboard the Saskatchewan hockey team's bus. There are 16 registered driving schools in Manitoba that are authorized by MPI to provide this training — including Blue Bird Training Centre. Smiley said that in the first 11 months of this year, 3,853 drivers in Manitoba took their Class 1 road test. About 36 per cent passed the test. Both Smiley and Dhalan said people began scrambling to get their Class 1 licences before the mandatory training requirement came into effect in Manitoba. ""[We] started getting busier and busier and busier,"" said Dhalan. ""And we got a lot of students.… More busy that I can handle myself."" That led to Longview cutting corners to keep up with the demand, he said.  The company allowed someone without an instructor's permit to help train the students, Dhalan said. It also brought in another truck that wasn't approved to be used for training.  The situation led to a falling out with his business partners, Dhalan said. ""I told them we need to get the permit. And there was no permit."" After the suspension, Dhalan began instructing at Blue Bird Training Centre. Company records show the training centre was incorporated in November 2018 — the same month Longview was suspended.  Dhalan said his brother-in-law owns Blue Bird Training Centre. Company records show Dhalan and that same brother-in-law are listed as directors in two other companies — Blue Bird Transport Holdings and Blue Bird Transport Ltd.  Smiley said an owner of a driving school suspended by MPI would be prohibited from opening up another school.  However, the audit did not give MPI any cause to sanction Dhalan as an instructor, Smiley said.  ""That individual was allowed to keep their driving instructor permit. So that tells me that that individual, by our evaluation, is able to continue on,"" Smiley said. When asked how many students trained at Longview, Dhalan said he wasn't sure, but estimated about 200. He said he's proud of his work as an instructor. ""When you come to me, you're going to learn,"" Dhalan said. ""I want you to learn and to be a good driver."" The Manitoba Trucking Association says there's a need for enforcement of driving school regulations, especially in light of a shortage of truck drivers across North America. ""Regulations are only effective if there's oversight and enforcement,"" said association executive director Terry Shaw. ""So we absolutely encourage oversight and enforcement of any regulation, especially those when it comes to driver licensing or road safety.""

171,Anonymous,2020-01-26T18:37:55.963Z,Turkish teams hunt for quake survivors as death toll hits 38,"Working against the clock in freezing temperatures, Turkish rescue teams pulled more survivors from collapsed buildings Sunday, days after a powerful, 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the country's east. Rescued survivors wept with gratitude for their efforts. Turkish authorities said the death toll rose to at least 38 people from the magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck Friday night. Turkish television showed Ayse Yildiz, 35, and her two-year-old daughter Yusra being dragged out of the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in the city of Elazig, the epicentre of the quake. They had been trapped for 28 hours. The quake also injured over 1,600 people, but at least 45 survivors have been pulled alive from the rubble so far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told a news conference Sunday in Istanbul. More than 780 aftershocks rocked the region as over 3,500 rescue experts scrambled through wrecked buildings to reach survivors, working around the clock. Rescue teams concentrated their efforts in the city's Mustafa Pasa neighbourhood and the nearby town of Sivrice. One rescued couple was reunited with a Syrian student who had helped to dig them out of their collapsed home with his hands. ""He is our hero and angel,"" a weeping Dudane Aydin said of Mahmud al Osman in an interview on Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency. Her husband Zulkuf added: ""When I saw the light of Mahmud's phone, we started shouting for help. Then we knew we would get out."" He said Mahmud helped him out but when the student tried to rescue his wife her leg was trapped by debris. ""Some locals held Mahmud by the legs and stretching toward my wife he worked to save her. After saving my wife, he tried to help others,"" the man said. As overnight temperatures dropped to -5 C, emergency teams set up more than 9,500 tents for displaced residents and distributed 17,000 hot meals. The agency said 76 buildings were destroyed and more than 1,000 were damaged by the quake. Unmanned aerial drones were being used to survey damaged neighbourhoods and co-ordinate rescue efforts. Friday's powerful quake hit just minutes after a woman gave birth at a private hospital in Malatya. It struck as a midwife put clothes on the newborn. No injuries were reported. WATCH | A midwife remains calm while caring for a newborn during the quake The Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency said 20 of the aftershocks measured magnitude 4.0 or above, including a 4.3-magnitude quake that hit the neighbouring province of Malatya on Sunday morning. Erdogan said every effort was being made to find survivors and promised to house displaced residents as soon as possible. ""Turkey has begun to heal the wounds of this great disaster in unity, togetherness and coming together,"" he said. At least 104 people were receiving hospital treatment after the quake, 13 of them in intensive care, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu promised financial help for the victims of the quake. He then attended the funeral of five members of the same family — a married couple, their daughter and two grandchildren — with other ministers and officials. The 12-year-old boy was buried in the same coffin as his baby sister. ""You arrived two months ago. I wish you had stayed a little longer,"" the children's father, Serhat Aslan, said of his daughter. On Saturday, the president visited the disaster zone to inspect the rescue operation, meet with injured people in the hospital and attend the funeral of a mother and son. Erdogan also condemned what he called a ""smear campaign"" on social media by those questioning the Turkish government's preparations for earthquakes. A prosecutor in Ankara has opened an investigation into social media posts about Friday's quake. Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey, which sits atop two major fault lines. Across Turkey, there was an outpouring of support for the quake victims. Some soccer clubs announced they would donate the receipts of their weekend matches while fans of the Fenerbahce soccer club threw scarves and hats onto the field during a game in Istanbul, chanting ""Cold Elazig, Fenerbahce is with you!"" Quake victims were taking refuge in tents, mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories. Authorities warned people not to return to homes that could be unsafe. A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometres southwest of the epicentre, was evacuated due to quake damages, with more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails. Friday's main quake hit at 8:55 p.m in the city that lies 565 kilometres east of Ankara. It's not the first time that Elazig has seen a fatal quake — a magnitude 6.0 earthquake killed 51 people there in 2010. Turkey's worst quake in decades came in 1999, when a pair of strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey, killing around 18,000 people.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/earthquake-eastern-turkey-aftershocks-1.5441015,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/earthquake-eastern-turkey-1.5440545 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/earthquake-eastern-turkey-1.5440232,N/A
172,Anonymous,2020-01-24T05:04:46.361Z,Actress Annabella Sciorra testifies that Harvey Weinstein raped her,"Actress Annabella Sciorra confronted Harvey Weinstein from the witness stand Thursday, telling a jury in a quivering voice that the burly Hollywood studio boss barged into her apartment in the mid-1990s, overpowered her and raped her as she tried to fight him off by kicking and punching him. She said that a month later, she ran into him and confronted him about what happened, and he replied: ""That's what all the nice Catholic girls say."" Then, she told the jury, Weinstein leaned toward her and added menacingly: ""This remains between you and I."" ""I thought he was going to hit me right there,"" Sciorra testified. At other points in the 1990s, she said, Weinstein sent her packages with Valium and a box of chocolate penises and turned up early one morning at her Cannes Film Festival hotel room door ""in his underwear with a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other."" She said he eventually left after she started frantically pushing buttons on the room phone to summon help. The 59-year-old actress became the first of Weinstein's accusers to testify at his trial, where the movie mogul whose downfall gave rise to the #MeToo movement is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his New York apartment in 2006 and raping an aspiring actress in a hotel room in 2013. Weinstein is not charged with attacking Sciorra, whose accusations date too far back to be prosecuted. Instead, she testified as one of four additional accusers prosecutors intend to put on the stand to show that the powerful Hollywood producer had a pattern of preying on women. Weinstein, 67, could get life in prison if convicted. Weinstein, the executive behind such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. Recounting an accusation she said she kept largely secret for decades, Sciorra testified that after raping her, Weinstein went on to try to perform oral sex on her, saying, ""This is for you,"" as her body ""shut down."" ""It was just so disgusting,"" she said. She said she started to shake: ""I didn't even know what was happening. It was like a seizure or something."" WATCH | Actress tells Weinstein trial that he raped her in the early 90s: The defence tried to seed doubts about Sciorra's allegations, and she gave a slightly different version under their questioning, testifying that when the producer initially pushed her onto her bed, ""he was kind of, in a friendly way, trying to cajole me"" into having sex. She refused and soon found herself trying to get him off of her, she said. Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno noted that Sciorra never went to police or a doctor about the alleged rape. ""At the time, I didn't understand that that was rape,"" Sciorra said. Rotunno also suggested that Sciorra's judgment and recollection were clouded by drinking. The actress said she remembered having only a glass of wine with dinner and had kicked a Valium habit that developed after Weinstein sent her pills. In opening statements on Wednesday, another Weinstein lawyer, Damon Cheronis, argued the encounter was consensual, not rape, saying Sciorra once told a friend that she ""did a crazy thing and had sex with Harvey Weinstein."" The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. Sciorra drew acclaim for her part in Spike Lee's 1991 movie Jungle Fever and her role as a pregnant woman molested by her doctor in 1992's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle the next year. She later appeared on The Sopranos. Sciorra first made her allegations in a New Yorker article in 2017. She said she met Weinstein at an industry event in Los Angeles in 1990 or 1991. By 1993, she had starred in one of his company's movies — the romantic comedy The Night We Never Met. She said the rape happened in late 1993 or early 1994, after Weinstein dropped her off from a movie-business dinner and then appeared, uninvited, at her door a few minutes later. Sciorra said afterward, she started to cut herself and feel she didn't want to leave her house. At the same time, she said, she struggled with understanding that what happened to her was a crime. ""I thought he was an OK guy. I felt confused. I felt like I wished I never opened the door,"" she said. She said she told no one at first, not even her brothers. ""I wanted to pretend it never happened. ... I wanted to get back to my life,"" she told the jury. She did not come forward publicly until 2017.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-trial-sciorra-testimony-1.5437876,https://www.cbc.ca/news/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-trial-metoo-1.5416145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-1.5418742 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/annabella-sciorra-alleges-rape-weinstein-1.4377160,N/A
173,"Morgan Modjeski, Creeden Martell",2020-01-23T22:21:38.432Z,"Unifor wants province to force both parties back to bargaining, government non-commital","Unifor president Jerry Dias has called for Premier Scott Moe and his government to intervene in the ongoing labour dispute between the union and the Co-op Refinery Complex, but the government is non-committal. The union also asked that a new, separate independent mediator be assigned to the case, as negotiations have been unsuccessful so far with the currently appointed mediator.  ""We continue to encourage both parties to return to the bargaining table where the provincially appointed mediator can assist parties in negotiating an agreement,"" Don Morgan, Minister of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety, said in an emailed statement. The government also re-emphasized that a provincial mediator has been in place. Morgan's statement remains unchanged, even after the union clarified it wants someone new, a government spokesperson added.  The union says it's willing to bargain, as does the Co-op Refinery Complex, but the sides have provided two seemingly opposing conditions. Co-op is adamant the union must remove fencing and what it calls ""illegal blockades"" before it returns to the bargaining table, according to Brad DeLorey, director of communications at the refinery. ""We'll take down our fencing as a sign of good faith when they get rid of all the scabs out of the camp that are doing our members' jobs,"" Scott Doherty, national representative for Unifor, said. DeLorey replied that, just as unions have a right to picket in a legal and fair manner, the refinery also has the right to continue operations with the work of replacement workers. Unifor National President Jerry Dias met with Regina's police chief Evan Bray Thursday to discuss tensions that have formed between the Co-op Refinery Complex and Unifor since about 800 refinery employees were locked out on Dec. 5, 2019. ""Chief Bray will not be holding a media scrum, but he described the meeting as productive,"" read a statement from Elizabeth Popowich, RPS spokesperson.  ""[Bray] said the two had a frank conversation focused on public safety and exchanged contact information for future communication.""  Dias said at a news conference Thursday morning that Regina Police Service officers had been violent while arresting 14 Unifor members Monday. ""Though the chief will describe Monday as an act of responsibility by the police that were there, those that were on the picket line witnesses something much differently. We witnessed violence,"" he said. ""People were pushed around. Women were pushed around. Women were told to get out of the way or they'll push them out of the way."" Dias also claimed that one Unifor members was sent to hospital and that seniors on the picket line were pushed around by police. In a Facebook video on Wednesday, Regina police chief Evan Bray denied the allegations, saying officers acted with ""respect and professionalism and patience."" Dias quoted Martin Luther King Thursday, saying the union would be doubling down on its efforts and would not surrender to rules he said systematically put working class people at a disadvantage.  ""[King] had a saying that always stuck with us. His saying was: 'One has not only a legal, but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.'""  Co-op says the arrests were the result of illegal blockades that were put up around the refinery to stop the flow of traffic. ""Unifor continues to use illegal blockades as a bullying tactic and has brought in extra people to help them to it,"" a statement released Wednesday said. ""Today's actions by Unifor represent yet another violation of the court injunction."" The dispute between the two parties mainly comes down to pensions. A previous contract included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan. The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive. In the Facebook video, Bray said he's reached out to Unifor to organize a meeting with Dias. ""It is my hope that we'll be able to have a face-to-face meeting with their president and representatives in the next couple of days and ultimately get an understanding of what our role is, and obviously, what their role is and what it is they're hoping to accomplish,"" Bray said. He said the Regina Police Service's main focus is community safety and to investigate allegations of criminal complaints, of which he said there are several. Dias stressed Thursday that the only way the dispute will be resolved if if the two parties return to the bargaining table. He said that on Tuesday night, Unifor told Co-op they would be willing to ""remove and dramatically alter"" preconditions the union had. He said this was a condition that Co-op had put in place in order for the company to get back to the bargaining table. In a statement issued on Thursday, Co-op confirmed it has been in discussions with the union about returning to the bargaining table. Co-op said it has always been willing to return to the table, but won't if the blockades remain. ""The CRC has stated consistently that meaningful negotiations require Unifor to drop their pre-conditions regarding no changes to the pension plan,"" the statement said. ""In light of Unifor's escalation in the past week, and the Court of Queen's Bench orders and the recent contempt of court ruling, the CRC believes Unifor should respect the court and comply with the court order regarding access to the refinery. The Company will not return to the bargaining table while Unifor maintains an illegal blockade.""  Unifor was fined $100,000 for actions on the picket line in December of 2019. Co-op says it's pleased the union has been fined.

175,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-15T17:58:55.890Z,'I did not kill her': Justice officials withheld report signalling no homicide while Alberta man sat in prison,"Butch Chiniquay was only months into a lengthy prison sentence in the death of his girlfriend, Charmaine Wesley, when senior officials in Alberta's Justice Ministry obtained a report that might have exonerated him. An initial autopsy had found that Wesley's 2011 death was a homicide, and that her injuries were ""inflicted trauma."" Chiniquay was charged with second-degree murder. But a later medical report written in November 2012 by a panel of expert pathologists concluded that there was no adequate evidence of homicide and that Wesley's injuries in a car accident were a possible cause of her death. An investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate has found that report, commissioned by Alberta Justice, was never provided to Chiniquay or his lawyer. In a recent interview, The Fifth Estate host Mark Kelley showed Adriano Iovinelli, Chiniquay's lawyer, the previously undisclosed medical finding. ""Why am I seeing this for the first time?"" Iovinelli said. ""You're not going to get [his] period of incarceration back."" Chiniquay, 34, said he feels vindicated by the new revelations. ""I am being honest, and I am telling the truth, and I am innocent,"" he said during an interview at his home on Stoney Nakoda First Nation, 60 kilometres west of Calgary, where he now lives after being released from prison. ""I did not kill her."" These revelations come as part of a six-month The Fifth Estate investigation that found senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of a medical examiner in Calgary a decade ago. At issue were some of the autopsies performed by Dr. Evan Matshes, a forensic pathologist working out of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Calgary in 2010 and 2011. After concerns were raised about some of his findings, Alberta Justice launched an inquiry into whether or not there had been miscarriages of justice relating to autopsies. Alberta Justice eventually decided to hire an external review panel of three U.S. forensic pathologists to assess Matshes's work. The panel later stated their opinion that Matshes had made ""unreasonable"" findings in 13 of 14 cases reviewed. Five of those cases were related to criminal charges. Yet The Fifth Estate has learned that in several criminal cases, those findings were not provided to defence lawyers or their clients, and that the report was buried for years by Alberta Justice — even as the incarcerated were serving their sentences. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Iovinelli said that it is up to Alberta Justice to explain why those reports were not released to defence lawyers. ""This is a significant difficulty that has to be addressed by the government, it just has to be,"" Iovinelli said. Alberta Justice declined repeated requests to speak to The Fifth Estate. Eric Tolppanen, the head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement that information was provided to defence lawyers ""where required"" and that they are ""confident"" that they met their ""disclosure obligations."" Tolppanen did not elaborate about what, if any, disclosure was provided or to whom. Legal experts consulted by The Fifth Estate say Alberta Justice was required by law to disclose any relevant documents to defence lawyers. ""It's not a question you have to give any thought to at all,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada and an expert in wrongful convictions cases. ""Alberta Justice has a lot to answer for."" Internal email correspondence shows that Alberta Justice acknowledged it must ""disclose to the defence what we know."" Court records also show that Greg Lepp, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, and now a provincial court judge, acknowledged Alberta Justice had a ""constitutional"" obligation to disclose the results of the expert review to defence lawyers. Alberta Justice also stated the findings of a medical examiner was often ""critical to the outcome of court cases."" ""The deputy (minister) is particularly concerned about whether there is someone in prison,"" Lepp said in a 2012 email to several senior justice officials. Tolppanen said that Chiniquay's lawyer Iovinelli was aware that ""additional disclosure regarding Dr. Matshes was available"" and that Iovinelli told Alberta Justice he did ""not require this further disclosure."" Iovinelli bristled at that suggestion. ""At no time was I ever told that there was a peer review done that indicates that this is not a homicide,"" he said. ""And more importantly, if they had that in their hand, why didn't they do something about it?"" Matshes declined to speak to The Fifth Estate.  ""I stand by my work,"" he wrote in a statement. ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent."" Alberta Justice began looking into Matshes's work in early 2012 after an insurance company raised concerns about one of his accidental death autopsies. Internal records show officials were most concerned about possible wrongful convictions. A panel of three forensic pathologists was selected to review several of Matshes's autopsies, including cases that had already led to second-degree murder charges. One case involved 18-year-old Shelby Herchak, who was described in news headlines as a ""baby killer."" In 2010, she was charged with second-degree murder after her 26-day-old son Daniel died of blunt-force trauma to the head. Herchak later accepted a plea deal for manslaughter and served more than five years in federal prison. The original report by Matshes stated there were multiple injuries to Daniel's head, including one that was seven to 15 days old. To the police, that meant intent. Herchak was charged with second-degree murder. ""That medical examiner deemed me a monster,"" Herchak said in a recent interview at her home in Calgary's south end. No one told Herchak that senior officials in Alberta Justice — including some who are now judges — had initiated that review of Matshes's work. Her son's autopsy was among the cases reviewed. That report could have been critical to Herchak's defence because it questioned two key facts the Crown asserted to the judge ahead of her sentencing. The expert review panel disputed that there was evidence of that earlier injury to Herchak's infant son, Daniel. They also raised concerns that Matshes may have mistaken a natural separation in a newborn's skull, which is not fully fused, with a fracture. The possibility there was a single injury to Daniel's head would have fit Herchak's assertion that she dropped her baby after waking up suddenly. ""I did not kill my son. It was an accident. I dropped him,"" Herchak said. Alberta Justice was provided the new evidence contradicting Matshes's report long before her murder trial was to begin, yet did not disclose it. Lockyer said Alberta Justice has no justification for burying the report, and it was obligated to provide it. ""You have three pathologists who have reviewed the case and reviewed the original autopsy and all three of them are agreed that the original autopsy report was erroneous, wrong,"" Lockyer said. Without that evidence, Herchak told The Fifth Estate she agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""To go through trial on a second-degree murder charge knowing that the medical examiner, all the stuff that he said, the judge and the jury would have believed him over anything that I said,"" Herchak said. ""I just gave up, I couldn't do it anymore, I didn't want to go to jail for life."" In January 2012, Chiniquay also agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter to avoid going to trial on his second-degree murder charge. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Lockyer said the accused's decision to agree to a manslaughter plea bargain is not unusual in the circumstances. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada … that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge,"" he said. The Fifth Estate showed Herchak a copy of the expert review panel report for the first time — seven years after it was written. ""Who in their name would bury a piece of paper so far down to make sure that nobody saw it, and send someone to jail for 5½ years? And with the name 'baby killer' for the rest of her life,"" Herchak said. In his statement, Matshes told The Fifth Estate he has been the victim of ""personal vendettas"" and ""local politics."" In a series of letters and emails to Alberta Justice in 2012 and 2013, Matshes and his lawyers asked that the findings of the review panel be set aside. Initially, Alberta Justice vigorously defended its process and the findings of the report. Officials with the ministry said they were concerned about possible miscarriages of justice and the impact on murder cases. Then in November 2013, Alberta Justice conceded in court that Matshes was not properly consulted. Both parties agreed to set aside the expert panel report. A judge formally approved the agreement and issued an ""order to quash."" At the same time, Alberta Justice told the court that it was ""integral"" that they continue their probe of Matshes's work. ""The minister also asserts that the administration of justice demands a new external review panel be conducted,"" said Marta Burns, then senior legal counsel and now a superior court judge with Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench. Alberta Justice did not respond to The Fifth Estate's queries about why that second review has not taken place, six years later. ""Nothing has happened,"" said Butch Chiniquay's lawyer Adriano Iovinelli. ""Who dropped the ball?"" In an email, head Crown prosecutor Eric Tolppanen said that because of the decision to ""quash"" the report, the findings are therefore ""inconsequential."" Matshes is now suing Alberta Justice, his former boss in the medical examiner's office and the expert panel members for $30 million for defamation. The Fifth Estate obtained the expert review reports and other related documents from two court actions initiated by Matshes against Alberta Justice. The Fifth Estate asked forensic pathologist Dr. John Butt for his opinion of review panel findings and related court documents. ""What this suggests to me is that there is a significant problem with the work that was done by Dr. Matshes,"" said Butt, who has helped develop medical examiner legislation across Canada. ""My understanding now is that the justice department swept this whole thing under the rug."" Some of the most senior members of Alberta Justice, including the then-ministers, were involved with and co-ordinated the review of potential miscarriages of justice relating to those autopsies. The review of Matshes's work was directly under the purview of Greg Lepp, now a provincial court judge, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service. ""We have a constitutional obligation to disclose anything that affects the case[s] to defence counsel,"" Lepp said in sworn court testimony in 2013. ""And we also have an obligation as prosecution service to consider this situation and determine what steps, if any, we're going to take in relation to these cases."" Reached at his office in Edmonton's provincial court, Lepp said he could not discuss whether disclosure had been provided. ""You're just going to have to pursue those enquiries elsewhere since it's just not advisable, it's not a good course of action for a judge to comment on what happened prior to his appointment,"" Lepp said. He added, ""the [justice] department's responsible for the decisions that were taken years ago."" Marta Burns, the former senior counsel for Alberta Justice and now a judge, declined to respond to questions in a statement sent by her spokesperson. ""In her capacity as litigation counsel with the legal services division, Justice Burns was not charged with making disclosure to defence counsel,"" the statement said. ""Decisions in this regard are made by the Crown Prosecution Service."" Tolppanen, the current head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, did not respond to questions about why the second review panel was never convened — after his ministry said justice required it happen. Doug Schweitzer, the current Alberta justice minister, also declined a recent request for an interview with The Fifth Estate. ""This matter predates the minister's time in office,"" his spokesperson said in an email. While the charge goes back almost a decade, Herchak said she is still living with the consequences of a miscarriage of justice. ""Why would you just shuffle the paperwork deep down and, like, destroy someone's life?"" Herchak said. ""That's my life, right there, that could have changed. But instead, I have this to deal with.""

In Dartmouth, N.S., that place was called the TeleVillage. An initiative of the regional telephone company MT&T, it was tested in 1995 in 120 suburban homes that had been specially wired to enable it. ""Welcome to MT&T's TeleVillage,"" said a robotic woman's voice as a TV displayed a screen with a graphic of a car on a road leading to a distant collection of buildings. A menu listed what lay within. The menu boasted eight options. Like any village, this one included a theatre, food, shopping, and banking. ""From this main menu you'll be able to travel to a variety of sites around the village without ever leaving your home,"" the voice continued. Reporter Paul Riley, with CBC Halifax's 1st Edition, was getting a demo.  ""It's interactive television, which moves television from being passive where you just sit and watch it,"" said MT&T's David Murphy. ""You can ... actually use the television to communicate."" Riley said the essential equipment was a small grey box that sat atop the TV and an infrared remote, to give access to various services such as... ""On-demand movies,"" said Murphy, navigating to a menu of seven movies. Among them was the Michael Keaton vehicle The Paper and the Italian comedy Silence of the Hams, which the website Rotten Tomatoes gives a 0% rating and describes as ""an episodic parody of classic thrillers and horror movies."" Three of the movies were free, but the other four listed would each cost $3.95 to rent. ""Rather than having a certain timing for the movie, it's whenever you want to watch it,"" said Murphy. There was also a restaurant in the TeleVillage. ""Right now we've got Greco Pizza,"" said Murphy. ""Everything that's available on the Greco menu is available through the TV."" The menu took Murphy through the process of ordering a pizza and offered the option of pickup or delivery. Riley seemed incredulous of the whole system. ""Basically you're telling us people are not ever going to have to leave their homes,"" he said. The menu even showed an ""audio jukebox,"" but that wasn't explored or explained further. ""I won't say that,"" said Murphy. ""I think it frees you up for other pursuits outside."" In the meantime, said Riley, it was going to be ""five to ten"" years before on-demand movies and ordering food via screen became more widespread.",https://www.cbc.ca/archives/with-interactive-tv-restaurant-delivery-was-just-clicks-away-1.5429942,[],N/A
177,Anonymous,2020-01-23T19:39:04.974Z,Greenpeace loses Norway Arctic oil lawsuit appeal,"An Oslo appeals court approved Norway's plans for more oil exploration in the Arctic on Thursday, dismissing a lawsuit by environmentalists who had said it violated people's right to a healthy environment. The verdict upheld a ruling made by a lower court, rejecting arguments by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group that a 2015-2016 oil licensing round that gave awards to Equinor and others had breached Norway's constitution. ""The verdict is unanimous,"" the Borgarting Appeals Court said in its written decision. Greenpeace immediately said it would appeal the case to Norway's supreme court. Beate Kristine Sjaafjell, a law professor at the University of Oslo, said the supreme court may give a clearer answer on whether handing out new licenses violates Norway's constitution. ""It should not evade the big question of whether continuing with oil and gas exploitation contributes to dangerous climate change and conversely whether doing that is in line with Norway's expressed commitments to contributing to staying within the Paris agreement goals,"" she added. The lawsuit is seen as part of an emerging branch of law worldwide where plaintiffs seek to use a nation's founding principles to make the case for curbing emissions. The green groups cited article 112 of Norway's constitution, which guarantees the right of current and future generations to a healthy and sustainable environment, as well as the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming. ""The court's verdict is a big step in the right direction, and the reason is that the right to a healthy environment according to the constitution is acknowledged by the court of appeal,"" Greenpeace Norway chief Frode Pleym told reporters. ""The court of appeal also acknowledges that the emissions from Norwegian oil burned abroad are relevant,"" he added. Oil and gas extraction has helped make Norway one of the wealthiest nations on earth, with a $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund stemming from petroleum income. The government gave out ten Arctic exploration permits in the contested 23rd licensing round, including three in the southeastern part of the Barents Sea, near Norway's border with Russia. Norway's energy ministry welcomed the verdict. Oil companies have already drilled exploration wells in some licences, but have not made any significant discoveries. Aker BP plans to drill a well in one licence later this year. A win at the appeals court could have set a precedent for other climate cases globally, while limiting exploration by western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, the plaintiffs said at the outset of the trial. But while environmental groups said more petroleum resources had already been discovered than could be exploited without breaching the Paris goals, the government argued that any decision to drill was for parliament to make, not the courts. There has been a surge in climate-related lawsuits in recent years, with campaigners viewing even unsuccessful litigation as an effective way of pressuring governments to be more ambitious about averting climate catastrophe. Over 1,500 climate-related cases were brought in 28 countries, mostly in the United States, between 2007 and 2020, according to Joana Setzer, a fellow at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics. Most defendants are governments, but lawsuits are increasingly targeting big oil and gas companies, she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/greenpeace-loses-oil-appeal-norway-1.5437657,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-drilling-appeal-norway-1.5349086 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/norway-court-arctic-drilling-1.4472884,N/A

The 20-year-old mother went missing in 2010 from the Leduc area. Her remains were discovered two years later in the same area. In a media advisory Friday, RCMP Alberta advised that they received a tip on Jan. 20, 2020, from a U.S. man alleging his father may have been involved in Tuccaro's death. ""The RCMP continue to seek information on the Amber Tuccaro case but caution that erroneous information can have negative effects to the investigation and to the well-being of the family,"" Police are reviewing the information, but say the Tuccaro case remains under investigation.  Investigators have already discounted the man's tips about his father's alleged involvement in other homicide and missing persons cases, stated the news release. In August 2010, Tuccaro flew to Edmonton from her home in Fort McMurray, Alta., and booked into a hotel near the airport with her 14-month-old son and a female friend. She was never seen alive again. Her skull was found in the bush two years later. In 2012, police released a cellphone recording between Tuccaro and the man who gave her a ride. ""You'd better not be taking me anywhere I don't want to go,"" Tuccaro can be heard telling the man. In July 2019, RCMP issued an apology to Tuccaro's family for mishandling the early investigation into the young woman's disapearance.

The city is offering free rides on both until Feb. 7 to encourage people to leave their vehicles at home.   The city said there will be detours on bus routes, and drivers are asked to be cautious and expect it to take longer to get around.  ""I want to thank the public for their cooperation and patience during this time,"" Breen said Friday afternoon. ""It's been very trying and difficult time, not only the for residents, but for businesses and employees who were adversely impacted and I really want to thank them for their support and for their patience as we dealt with this.""   The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District hopes metro-area schools will be open Monday. The district announced Friday afternoon that bus routes may be temporarily adjusted, and parents and students should check the district's website, where all changes will be listed on Sunday. District CEO Tony Stack said the school district continues to work with the province and the city to determine if snow clearing has been sufficient enough to open all schools. Stack said some schools in St. John's may remain closed on Monday.  Breen said the snow clearing effort moved over 4,000 truckloads of snow so far with no plan to stop just yet. The mayor added safety is still a number one priority even after the state of emergency is lifted. ""Everybody is going to have to play their part in this, and the drivers and people driving cars are going to have to take their time. They're going to have to be aware that there's people out on the road,"" Breen said. ""This is not the time to be going out to have a look around and see what the snow is like."" Breen added sidewalk clearing in the city has begun, with school zones having priority. While the state of emergency will be lifted, the snow-clearing work isn't over, Breen said, and will continue around the clock with no timeline yet for when it will be finished. Meanwhile business owners in the metro-area have been struggling after being shuttered for more than a week. Dave Hopley is heartbroken he can't pay his employees for scheduled days they missed during the state of emergency in St. John's, but says he just doesn't have the money.  The co-owner of Rocket Bakery got choked up as he explained why his workers will go without much-needed wages over the past eight days. ""It's stressful on them and it's stressful on us,"" he told The St. John's Morning Show. ""We're one of the businesses that won't be able to afford to pay our staff for missed time."" Hopley said each day their two locations were closed, they lost $5,000. Rocket Bakery has been allowed to open since Wednesday as a food store, selling bread, milk and pastries. They are not allowed to sell prepared foods, however, until the state of emergency lifts on Saturday morning. Hopley said the devastating losses could have been avoided, if the city had loosened the restrictions during the state of emergency. Pedestrians weren't technically allowed out in the streets, but it was a rule that wasn't strictly enforced. Downtown was teeming with pedestrians while businesses were not allowed to open. ""It doesn't seem to make sense to close everything down completely. Let's be a little bit more strategic about it next time,"" Hopley said. Premier Dwight Ball told reporters Thursday the province is looking at all federal programs to find a way to help affected workers, but acknowledged there is no legal requirement to pay workers during a state of emergency. On Friday, Federal Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair said the province has asked about financial assistance to help those affected, and that Newfoundlanders can count on the federal government's support. ""I'm very pleased with the collaboration that took place, and we got resources that they required out there,"" he said, adding Ottawa is ""going to do our very best to be there for them."" Blair didn't say how much financial support will be available, though there is a program and criteria in place and discussions are underway. Brenda O'Reilly is one of the best-known business owners in downtown St. John's. Speaking at her Yellowbelly Brewery on Friday morning, she began to cry as she spoke about the efforts she saw across the city during the past week. The Canadian Armed Forces have been active in St. John's since Monday, digging out people who are trapped inside their homes. ""If they show up tomorrow, we'll certainly buy a drink for them,"" said O'Reilly. The economic impact for downtown business owners is especially bad for this storm, since most didn't enter the winter on a strong footing.

The ministry has yet to respond to a follow-up question about what and how old those indicators are.  Algonquin Anishinabeg Grand Chief Verna Polson says the population data the ministry is using is years out of date.  ""My understanding is the last time they did a study was 20 years ago,"" said Polson. ""It's so outdated that we need to be part of the decision making now."" The ministry has announced that it is carrying out an aerial survey of moose in the reserve this winter in collaboration with the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council.  Desmarais also said the reduction of the sport hunt this winter will help facilitate that survey.  ""The MFFP is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the Algonquin chiefs and shares the same objectives with regard to the importance of ensuring the conservation of the resource and it's sustainability for present and future generations,"" said Desmarais. Other measures could be put in place moving forward based on the results of the population survey, she said.  Last week, the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council issued a press release saying chiefs were disappointed by Quebec's refusal to act on a moratorium and said it will continue to push for one.  Verna Polson said her officials are cooperating with government officials for the aerial survey.  ""Our nation is ready and willing to work in collaboration,"" she said.

181,Steve Silva,2020-01-24T15:34:55.425Z,Entire Yukon Quest rules committee resigned after disagreement about racer's penalty,"All six people on the Yukon Quest rules committee resigned last year after the event's board decided against their recommendation to disqualify a racer whose dog team tested positive for a drug, CBC News has learned. ""I just felt that they didn't have the respect for the rules committee that they needed to,"" said Karen Ramstead, former chair of the committee, adding that the board didn't communicate its logic well enough. The racer in question was Brian Wilmshurst. ""The drug present was norketamine, a metabolite of ketamine — a schedule III controlled drug,"" reads a four-page letter, dated June 21, that the committee sent to the presidents of the event's Alaska board and Yukon board, which form a joint board. Ramstead said the committee recommended that Wilmshurst be disqualified and not get any prize money. There were no other recommended sanctions, and he would be free to race in the event again, she added. The board fined him $3,262.10 US, which was also the amount he won for finishing the race in 13th place. Wilmshurst was ""abIe to 'buy himself out of' a positive drug test by paying back his winnings,"" reads the letter. John Dixon is the president of the board of Yukon Quest International Limited, based in Alaska. He described its recommendation for disqualification as ""too severe."" He said he believes the drug ended up in the dog's bloodstream unintentionally through tainted meat. ""We looked at, sort of, the commonality in the past of finding these drugs in horse meat. A lot of times these drugs were used to euthanize horses that are then fed to dogs, so we believe that it wound up in the dog's bloodstream that way,"" Dixon said. CBC attempted to contact Wilmhurst for this story, but did not hear back. In the letter, the committee said it was concerned that this situation could happen again — not to any specific racers — and, if the organization allowed it, possibly result in a legal challenge. ""We were also not only dealing with the individual situation before us but having to be aware of the precedent we were setting for the organization as well,"" Ramstead said. The committee's letter referenced part of one of the Yukon Quest's rules: ""Fines or penalties levied for violations of this rule shall be based on the seriousness of the offense and will be assessed after completion of the race. The Rules Committee will be responsible for assessing these penalties."" Dixon said the rules committee has an advisory role. ""Basically, there's some leeway there in what we can do in a situation where we have a positive drug test,"" he said regarding the rules. The board takes a case-by-case approach, Dixon added. Banned substances being found in dogs in sled-dog races in the region is ""rare,"" and he said he could only think of two other incidents, including one in a different race, in recent years. Shayna Hammer, executive director of the Yukon Quest International Association (Canada), said on Tuesday that there's an acting rules committee in place.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-rules-committee-resigned-1.5438687,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-sisters-races-1.5435216,N/A
182,Ian McKechnie,2020-01-25T09:00:00.675Z,Harry and Meghan media circus has Canadians missing the point of the maple monarchy,"This column is an opinion by Ian McKechnie, a graduate of Trent University, a member of the Monarchist League of Canada, and a freelance writer and historian in Lindsay, Ont. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. ""...The strength of human feeling is still the most potent of all the forces affecting world affairs. Over all nations – as a North American historian has written – over all nations is humanity."" These words came from a speech King George VI delivered in London on June 23, 1939, shortly after he and Queen Elizabeth [the Queen Mother] returned from their cross-country tour of Canada. They were words that most of the world needed to hear at the time, a world just as deeply fraught with uncertainty and instability as it is today. As the King and Queen crisscrossed the country by train, Canadians saw in their sovereign someone who transcended differences in politics, language and regional identity. Speaking before Canada's Parliament, the King said: ""It is my earnest hope that my present visit may give my Canadian people a deeper conception of their unity as a nation."" More than 80 years later, our unity as a nation is once more being called into question in some quarters, and our shared humanity is being overlooked as we shout at each other from either side of the partisan fence, eager to apply a litany of labels to people whose views we dislike or distrust. And meanwhile, King George VI's great-grandson is moving to Canada with his wife and son. Since Harry and Meghan made their surprise announcement a fortnight ago, there has been a torrent of questions voiced across the land. Where will they live? What will they be doing? How much will it cost? With the questions have come the inevitable articles asking whether constitutional monarchy has a future in this country. All but lost in the media circus surrounding this latest royal development is serious reflection about why the Crown matters in contemporary Canada. As partisan echo chambers become louder and louder, and as politicians in both Britain and Canada push the boundaries of acceptable constitutional behaviour, the monarchy may become – as former Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson once said – ""the last bulwark of democracy,"" an institution that provides sound leadership without the partisan filter that has taken its toll in public conversation and political debate. The problem is, we don't pay nearly enough attention to the Crown; when we do, we don't take it particularly seriously. For the past half century or so, we've been taught by columnists, school textbooks, and politicians that the Queen and her representatives are ""only ceremonial and symbolic figureheads,"" as though their words and actions lack any purchase in reality. We therefore pay scant attention to what the Viceregal officeholders – the Governor General and Lieutenant Governors — have to say, despite the fact that their role can help facilitate ""constructive participation in our democracy."" David Johnston, while he was governor general, set about establishing the Rideau Hall Foundation to promote ""learning, leadership, giving and innovation"" among Canadians – all of which are vital parts of democracy. If democracy means more than simply casting ballots in a first-past-the-post contest, if it means also empowering people to play meaningful roles in strengthening their communities, then surely such initiatives are worth talking about in classrooms and columns. We've also convinced ourselves that the Crown is the ultimate symbol of colonialism, and so haven't always paid attention to the role successive governors general and lieutenant governors have played in fostering reconciliation. James Bartleman, while lieutenant governor of Ontario, worked to strengthen the bonds between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, and also raised awareness about empowering Indigenous youth through his promotion of literacy. Russ Mirasty, appointed as the first Indigenous Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan last summer, has said that his role is all about building relationships – something that is vital to the process of reconciliation, and something partisan politics alone can't achieve. Tellingly, we have bought wholesale into unsympathetic portrayals of the Prince of Wales, largely ignoring his important contributions to public discourse. One need only peruse some of his speeches or take a look at the outstanding work being done by the Prince's Charities Canada to see that there is much more to Prince Charles than what tabloid journalism tells us. And civic literacy, or rather, illiteracy, remains a problem in Canada. Millennials may now make up the largest cohort of eligible voters, but are they acutely aware of what the Queen's representatives can do to protect our democracy if a government refuses to step aside after losing a vote of confidence or an election? What was unthinkable a generation or more ago has become a worrying possibility as politicians on both sides of the pond play fast and loose with long-established constitutional traditions. As Harry and Meghan prepare for a move to Canada, let's not allow tabloid fodder to obscure the very real benefits the Crown provides in fostering national unity and upholding our democratic inheritance.

183,Steven D'Souza,2020-01-21T20:55:22.413Z,'This is going to be very ugly': Weinstein defence may use prevailing myths about rape to his advantage,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. When opening arguments begin Wednesday in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul's behaviour will be put under a microscope. But so, too, will the actions of his accusers, and some psychologists worry that outdated myths about rape will be used to discredit them. ""I think this is going to be very ugly,"" said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus in the women and gender studies department at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and predatory sexual assault against two women. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Fitzgerald said the defence may employ a tactic commonly used in sex assault cases: turning the focus from the accused to the accuser and playing on misconceptions about victims. One line of defence in such cases is to suggest the rape didn't really happen or that it wasn't really rape. ""They are going to try and capitalize on myths,"" Fitzgerald said. One of the accusers in the trial, who hasn't been identified, alleged Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in 2013. On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers announced they want to use friendly emails the accuser sent to the former producer after the alleged assault in a bid to convince jurors that any contact was consensual. ""There's direct communications between Harvey and women, always friendly, sometimes romantic, that would lead, I think, any reasonable person to think that the claims are untrue,"" Weinstein's lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told ABC News. Fitzgerald, who has written about rape myths and workplace sexual harassment, said there are decades of studies detailing how women behave in certain situations after being sexually assaulted, and the reasons behind that. ""Lots of people remain in contact with their abuser for a whole variety of reasons,"" she said. ""In some cases, because he has a lot of power and he can hurt you."" Trauma psychologist Joan Cook said it's disheartening to already see indications from Weinstein's team that it will be relying on an outdated understanding of how victims of sexual assault behave.  ""There's a lot of ways that men and women who have been sexually violated respond, and it's not the way we think,"" Cook said. ""Most don't go to the police; most don't confront their abuser; and many don't disconnect for various reasons.""  Watch: Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, talks about the defence's strategy Many survivors are in shock or numb after the assault, so they stay silent, Cook said, because what happened to them may not register right away or because they're afraid of the personal and professional consequences of cutting off contact. ""It's not surprising to me at all that people would have kept in touch with [Weinstein],"" said Cook. ""He owned Hollywood, so if you wanted to function there, weren't you going to still try and maintain a connection?"" That was among the reasons Dominique Huett said she stayed in touch with Weinstein, even after she alleged he sexually assaulted her in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2010. She was the first Weinstein accuser to file a civil claim against him. ""I emailed him after the assault happened, but that doesn't mean the assault didn't happen,"" Huett told CBC News. ""It just means I was trying to regain some sense of control back over what he did."" Huett's allegation falls within the statute of limitations, and she hopes charges can still be filed in California for her case. ""I think the old rhetoric of blaming the victim is very outdated at this stage,"" said Huett. ""I think the #MeToo movement kind of exposed how women are not, you know, liars."" Huett is a member of the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers who have come together to amplify the experiences of sexual assault survivors. In addition to questioning the motivation and actions of the accusers, Weinstein's defence is expected to call two experts to testify about memory. The judge, however, limited the scope of their testimony and denied a defence request to have them testify about a phenomenon called ""unwanted voluntary sex."" Cook said the understanding among researchers used to be that memory was fixed and unchanging, but today, it's recognized that the fact that an assault victim's recollections may change over time isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. ""The truth is, memory is much more fluid, and memories can change, and they can be altered over time,"" Cook said. The prosecution will be calling Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist at Temple University in Philadelphia who is an expert on rape and sexual assault trauma. The Manhattan district attorney's office is hoping Ziv can counter some of the myths around sexual assault, including why victims often wait to disclose their assault. Ziv gave such testimony in the second trial of Bill Cosby, who was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a Canadian woman who met Cosby while working at his alma mater, Temple University, in the early 2000s. The prosecution also hopes the four additional women who will be allowed to testify even though their allegations against Weinstein haven't resulted in charges will help establish a pattern of behaviour similar to how the testimony of other women did in the Cosby retrial. The question of how deeply the message of the #MeToo movement has permeated society was an undercurrent during the contentious two weeks of jury selection. Judge James M. Burke cautioned jurors that the case was not a referendum on the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment or women's rights. In narrowing down the jury pool, the prosecution accused the defence of ""systematically eliminating"" younger white women, who are more likely to be aware of #MeToo and possibly sympathize with Weinstein's accusers. In the end, seven men and five women were chosen. Six of the men and two of the women are white.  How educated the jury is in rape myths will be crucial in determining the outcome, Fitzgerald said. ""That's always what's critical in rape cases — the jury has to be willing and able to see through these things,"" Fitzgerald said. The flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, which followed a New York Times exposé in October 2017 that sparked the #MeToo movement, ignited an international conversation about women's experiences. But Fitzgerald says she doesn't think public awareness has progressed as far as people want to believe it has. Fitzgerald worked as a psychological consultant for Anita Hill and her legal team in 1991, when Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Fitzgerald called that moment the first great awakening for American society in the debate over sexual misconduct. She said after that, however, society forgot the lessons learned about women's experiences, and the issue fell out of the national conversation. But with high-profile stars now speaking out, she hopes there will be a more permanent reckoning with the issue on national scale. ""I think it's going to be more powerful this time, and it's going to be more widespread and more lasting.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,N/A
184,Don Pittis,2020-01-23T15:35:02.431Z,Millionaires at the World Economic Forum are demanding higher taxes: Don Pittis,"A group of rich people from the United States want governments to raise their taxes. Yesterday, Patriotic Millionaires, the exclusive U.S. club that also includes billionaires, released a letter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that the global rich add their names to a new plan to make the world a better place through global tax reform.  If you own a house in Vancouver or Toronto and are considering signing on — you may not be rich enough. Membership requires a minimum annual income of a million U.S. dollars or assets of five million.  Tax evasion has reached epidemic proportions &amp; contributed to extreme inequality.<br><br>At one of the most obnoxious displays of privilege that is found on the world stage, we're proud to release 'Millionaires Against Pitchforks'<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WEF20</a><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxTheRich?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TaxTheRich</a><a href=""https://t.co/1rEj0530OS"">https://t.co/1rEj0530OS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/l97DGbQhJ5"">pic.twitter.com/l97DGbQhJ5</a> The Davos letter addressed to ""Our Fellow Millionaires and Billionaires Across the Globe,"" appears to be just the latest move to draw media attention to the idea that at least some of the world's richest people think the growing gap between rich and poor is a problem. The PR move, however, has not garnered much coverage in the world's billionaire-owned media. Certainly, governments worried about lost tax revenue have repeatedly struggled to devise global plans to prevent corporations and wealthy individuals from hiding their money offshore — with limited success.  ""Extreme, destabilizing inequality is growing across the globe,"" says the letter released in Davos. ""Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment."" Like Bregman, signatories to the new letter say extreme inequality is driving the world toward a crisis point. In fact, they warn the rich of a potential uprising by the poorer classes. The threat of revolution, they warn, creates a tradeoff between ""those who prefer taxes and those who prefer pitchforks."" As the shortage of signatures on the document may show, if a popular uprising to overthrow the rich is brewing, elites believe they can handle  it. All around the world, including in Canada, Britain and the United States, political parties that favour tax cuts and leaving tax havens alone get the vast majority of financial support from donors. Rather than sign documents to raise their taxes, even the moderately rich often vote with their wallets to make sure taxes stay low. Those donations, often used for campaign advertising, represent money well spent. In the United States, the populist Trump garners support from many poor voters who believe they are opposing government elites; many of the less well off seem willing to vote against their own best interests. In the U.S., lower middle class and poor Trump supporters effectively voted against their own medical coverage. Opponents of pro-tax campaigns often suggest that those who want to pay higher taxes should do so, but of course that would just make the shirkers richer in relative terms. Yesterday's letter is unlikely to be more successful than previous campaigns, including a 2019 effort by the self-described Patriotic Millionaires to persuade government to raise taxes on the rich in New York. At that time, Patriotic Millionaire member Abagail Disney, heir to part of the Disney fortune and a well known advocate of progressive causes, was backing the tax increase.  ""New York will always be New York,"" she said. ""There's no other place like it, and millionaires are concentrated here because of that."" Polls of people across the global wealth spectrum, including U.S. viewers of Fox Television, have shown a majority would like to see higher taxes on the rich. Many of the world's richest people, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and financier Warren Buffet, have complained that the tax system is unfair. But until people are willing to elect governments that promise to raise taxes, changes are unlikely. Despite a widening gap between the richest and everyone else, there are few signs of people sharpening their pitchforks.  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-poloz-1.5436058,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5436112/patriotic-millionaires-urge-the-rich-to-pay-higher-and-fairer-taxes-1.5436119 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fighting-the-corporate-tax-tricks-that-lead-to-inequality-1.2666148 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-media-fake-news-rutger-bregman-1.5027881 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4769851/ontario-pc-voter-worried-about-family-s-future-without-basic-income-pilot-1.4769853 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inheritance-tax-canada-1.4771304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inversions-panama-revenue-quandary-1.3521358 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/paradise-papers-rent-capitalism-tax-havens-1.4389079,N/A

On Tuesday, Halifax regional council will vote on a staff recommendation to provide a one-time contribution of $250,000 that would go toward the non-profit's purchase of 2203 Gottingen Street and 2268 Maitland Street. ""I'm very pleased, it's great news that city staff is recommending funding,"" Sebastien Labelle, executive director of the co-op said Saturday. ""Obviously, I won't feel totally relaxed about it until the vote goes through and it's fully confirmed."" The estimated cost of the project is $1.21 million, which includes building and land purchase expenses, construction and development costs, contingency and administration and fundraising support. This is down from an original estimate of nearly $6 million. In June, the co-op got a $250,000 commitment from the municipality that hinged on the group receiving financial assistance from other levels of government. At that time, council supported the project unanimously. LaBelle is hoping for the same outcome on Tuesday. ""I feel very positive about all this, and this will unlock other avenues for funding and financing partners,"" he said. LaBelle said the co-op is an important part of the city's north end. He said there are many people who care about the future of the space. ""More than anything, it's a space, a place of gathering, a place for celebration and expression and coming together to witness talent in our community and talent from elsewhere coming to our community,"" he said.

188,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:53:14.614Z,Monty Python performer and director Terry Jones dead at 77 ,"Terry Jones, a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, has died at 77. He had been suffering from dementia. Jones's agent said he died Tuesday evening. In a statement, his family said he died ""after a long, extremely brave but always good-humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD."" In 2016 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which gradually robbed him of the ability to write and speak. Jones's wife, Anna Soderstrom, and children Bill, Sally and Siri, said ""we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades."" With fellow Britons Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and American Terry Gilliam, Jones formed Monty Python's Flying Circus, whose anarchic and surreal humour helped revolutionize comedy. Jones wrote and performed for the troupe's TV series, which ran over five years on BBC and was later picked up in the U.S. by PBS, and their films. Jones directed Monty Python's Life of Brian, with a co-director credit with Gilliam on Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life. He went on to direct the non-Python films Personal Services starring Julie Walters and Erik the Viking starring Cleese and Tim Robbins. He also wrote books on medieval and ancient history, presented documentaries, directed films, wrote poetry and wrote the script for the Jim Henson-directed fantasy film Labyrinth. In 2014, the group reunited for a series of shows at London's O2 Arena, one of which was later filmed, entitled Monty Python Live (Mostly). ""His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programs, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath,"" they said. Chapman died in 1989 of cancer, while Neil Innes, the musician often known as the ""seventh Python"" for his contributions to their songs and sketches, died in December. Palin paid tribute to his longtime colleague in a statement given to Britain's Press Association, while on social media Cleese, Idle, Gilliam and British comedians Stephen Fry and David Walliams were among those remembering Jones fondly. ""He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian — writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have,"" said Palin. You will be very missed old friend. I feel very fortunate to have shared so much of my life with Terry. <a href=""https://t.co/4oNANoIeB2"">pic.twitter.com/4oNANoIeB2</a> ""So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him,"" added Idle. ""Terry was someone totally consumed with life … a brilliant, constantly questioning, iconoclastic, righteously argumentative and angry but outrageously funny and generous and kind human being … and very often a complete pain in the ass,"" said Gilliam. ""One could never hope for a better friend."" ""It feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently away … Two down, four to go,"" said Cleese. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones attended Oxford University, where he began writing and performing with fellow student Palin. After leaving university, he wrote for seminal 1960s comedy series including The Frost Report and Do Not Adjust Your Set before Monty Python's Flying Circus was formed. Jones's roles with the troupe included playing the mother of Brian, a hapless young man who is mistaken for Jesus. He delivered one of the Pythons' most famous lines: ""He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy!"" In Meaning of Life he portrayed Mr. Creosote, the corpulent fine dining patron who at first refuses a ""wafer-thin mint"" after his meal but then consumes it, exploding on his fellow restaurant goers. I loved him the moment I saw him on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963. So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him.

That's all that separated Mikael Kingsbury and his long-time rival, Ikuma Horishima, in the men's moguls final at a World Cup event in Mont-Tremblant, Que., on Saturday. ""Without saying it felt good to get my revenge, I'm just happy I was able to remain calm at the top of the hill and follow my plan to the letter,"" said Kingsbury. The Canadian freestyle skier scored 86.80 points on his final run to secure the gold medal. Japan's Horishima took silver (86.60) and France's Benjamin Cavet placed third (83.99). WATCH | Kingsbury's 58th career World Cup win: Kingbury, who was the last to go in the super final, watched Horishima's performance right before it was his turn. He knew exactly what he needed to do in order to be triumphant. ""I maybe cut about a half-second on Ikuma, which to me was the difference,"" said Kingsbury. ""Those guys, Ikuma and Ben, elevated their game up and scored 86 points, and I noticed they both had times of 23 seconds. ""I knew I had the advantage of being the last to go, and that I would need to cut my time by half a second to move in front. So, after my first jump, I made sure to straighten my skis for about 20 metres and after that I knew I just had to maintain that rhythm all the way to the end. And that's what I did,"" said the 27-year-old, whose final run clocked in at 22.46 seconds. This victory was the third of the season for Kingsbury following the ones he earned in moguls at an event in Ruka, Finland, and the other in dual moguls in Thaiwoo. Thanks to his latest victory, Kingbury also increased his lead atop the World Cup moguls standings to 60 points, ahead of rival Horishima. The only other Canadian moguls skier who reached the final, Gabriel Dufresne of Repentigny, Que., finished in 12th position. On the women's side, France's Perrine Laffont recorded her third straight World Cup victory by securing the moguls gold at Mont-Tremblant on Saturday — her fourth win in as many events on the World Cup circuit this season. Laffont soared past all her opponents with a run of 82.14 points. She placed ahead of Kazhakstan's Yuliya Galysheva (80.99) and Russia's Anastasiia Smirnova (80.18). Like Kingsbury, Laffont increased her lead in the World Cup standings on Saturday. With a total of 400 points in moguls, she now leads her closest competitor, Galysheva, by 218 points. WATCH | Kingsbury gets emotional boost from Canadian fans: Justine Dufour-Lapointe, who last year won the bronze medal at Mont-Tremblant, appeared bitter with her fifth-place finish in Saturday's super final. The 25-year-old Canadian, who was searching for her second podium of the season after finishing third in moguls in Thaiwoo, seemed to let her emotions briefly get the best of her. ""I don't regret anything, I gave it all I had. It wasn't easy in the final, and I knew I needed to increase my level for the super final. But once there, I skied cleaner and I executed my jumps to near perfection. So, after all that, I simply think the judges didn't want to see a Canadian on the podium today,"" said Dufour-Lapointe. ""Honestly, I don't know what more they wanted,"" she added in reference to the judges. ""I did all I could to give the crowd what they came to see. So, I'm just really disappointed to have finished in fifth."" Canadian Valerie Gilbert was beaming after finishing the competition in eighth, and for good reason. ""I am really happy — this is the best result of my career. All of you know that I am coming back after a sabbatical year, so I couldn't have asked for more,"" said the native of Sainte-Adele, Que. ""This result seems to say: 'Watch out! Valerie is here, and she is back in the game. So be weary,""' said Gilbert with a smile. Her compatriot, Toronto's Berkley Brown, failed to complete her run in the final after a nasty fall following her second jump, which caused her to finish 16th. Meanwhile, Justine's older sister, Chloe Dufour-Lapointe, failed to get beyond Saturday morning's qualification stages.

The Live in Langley Chinese Association cancelled its gala, which was also sponsored by the Township of Langley, as fears rose after authorities detected Canada's first case of coronavirus on Saturday in a patient who had travelled to Toronto from Wuhan, China. Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Sunday that the risk of infection is low and Canadians should not worry about contracting the virus in a casual setting, urging people to take normal precautions but otherwise continue their lives. Vancouver's Spring Festival Parade, said to be one of the largest Lunar New Year celebrations in North America, carried on.⁠⠀ Vancouver resident Jason Ng attended the Lunar New Year celebrations with his wife, father and three-year-old son to watch his other five-year-old son dance in the parade. ""It was something kind of in the back of our heads,'' Ng said of the virus. ""It wasn't a huge concern.'' Another spectator, Ethan Donnelly, said he works at the University of British Columbia and a coworker who is from China skipped this year's celebrations for fear of the virus. ""We want to celebrate, but better safe than sorry,'' he said, gesturing to the mask he wore during the parade. Though some donned the surgical masks at the event, experts advise against them, saying the ones widely available at drug stores aren't particularly effective and noting that repeatedly adjusting them with unwashed hands can actually exacerbate risk of infection. Ella Lewis-Vass, who also works and studies at the university, said she believed those who were most concerned about contracting the virus likely stayed home. The illness has sickened at least 1,975 people and killed 56 in China, but it remains to be seen whether it's as dangerous as the common flu, which kills 3,500 people every year in Canada alone.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-lunar-new-year-1.5441077,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-tam-health-china-1.5440950 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-toronto-update-1.5440853,N/A
191,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-28T16:10:35.194Z,"'Companies knew they had a big problem': Kia, Hyundai owners say they were knowingly sold defective vehicles ","A group of vehicle owners is going after two major automakers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, claiming they were knowingly sold defective vehicles then left to pay for losses and repairs when the engines failed or caught fire.  In a lawsuit filed this week, Hyundai and Kia are accused of intentionally concealing the defect from buyers of vehicles with Theta, Nu, and Gamma engines. ""When complaints came ... [owners] were told 'gosh we haven't heard of that happening. Isn't that weird?' And in fact the companies knew they had a big problem,"" Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who is heading up the lawsuit, told Go Public. The class action was filed in Court of Queen's Bench in Regina on Monday, but has yet to be certified by the court. It names Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and their American counterparts — Hyundai Motors America and Kia Motors America. None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court. A Go Public investigation revealed concerns about Hyundai and Kia engines failing at high speeds or spontaneously bursting into flames — putting some drivers and their passengers into life-threatening situations and leaving others with thousands in repair bills. Consumer and safety advocates have criticized the South Korean automakers for taking too long to issue recalls of too few models with the Theta-family engines. The recalls started in 2015 and are still rolling out. ""Their difficulty is that they can't fix the problem. They don't know what to do about the problem. So a recall where there's no fix is really no recall at all,"" Merchant said. Go Public asked Hyundai if it had a fix for the engine problems, but it didn't respond to that question directly. Merchant says the proposed class-action suit involves 37 Hyundai and Kia owners, and seven different models ranging in years from 2011-16 — but he expects the number of drivers and vehicles involved to grow once word gets out about the lawsuit.  The legal action is also looking for compensation for owners with the problematic engines who haven't had failures or fires, but are facing a loss in vehicle value. ""For the vast majority of people, they're not going to have a safety problem. And many of them are going to be compelled to continue to operate these vehicles because they can't afford the hit of getting rid of them. So they're entitled to financial compensation that flows from having a vehicle that's significantly depreciated,"" Merchant says. Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and Kia Motors America all told Go Public they do not comment on any current or pending litigation. Hyundai Motors USA responded to Go Public's questions about the latest Canadian lawsuit with a general statement.  ""Nothing is more important than the safety and security of Hyundai customers,"" spokesperson Michael Stewart wrote in an email. ""Hyundai actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision engine fires, with all of our vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects … Hyundai quality and safety is among the best in the industry.""  Go Public continues to get complaints from Hyundai and Kia owners, who say they are interested in joining a class-action suit if it means the automakers would have to take responsibility. Marnie and Adam Nelson contacted Go Public after seeing previous engine stories. The couple's 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe caught fire while it was parked in their driveway last March. They bought it six months earlier and paid more than $50,000 for the SUV. They contacted Hyundai's head office by email to report the fire and ask for a refund on the extended warranties they had purchased, but say no one followed up to investigate. Instead, the couple says most of their messages to head office were ignored and the local dealership was only interested in getting them to buy a new vehicle. ""As soon as they [the dealership] found out we weren't going to come back in and buy another car, we were persona non grata, they wanted nothing to do with us. No return calls — nothing,"" Adam said. ""They should be standing behind their products better,"" Marnie told Go Public.  The dealership declined to respond to Go Public's questions about the couple's situation directly, referring us to head office.  Hyundai says its records show the Nelsons went directly to their insurance company to report the fire and only reached out to the company for a refund on an extended warranty they had purchased for the vehicle. The couple says they received a partial refund. The company wrote in an email to Go Public that its policy is to investigate every case of a fire, ""that we are aware of and requested to investigate to determine if the cause is attributed to neglect, abuse, environment or the product itself."" The Nelsons say their fire was never investigated by the company. The company did reach out to the couple after Go Public inquiries.  The engine in Daniel Roukema's 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe didn't burn — it died in 2016 while he was driving on a highway near Toronto. He says he had to pay about $9,000 to replace it. When he asked the company to cover the cost, Roukema says it refused and blamed his lack of upkeep for the engine failure, which he denies.  Two recalls were issued for the vehicle after he paid to replace his engine. ""I think the way they've handled the situation is absolutely abhorrent … we [owners] ought to be compensated,"" he said. Hyundai did not respond to specific questions about Roukema's case, but said ""if a customer previously paid for repairs in advance of a recall being issued, and it is determined that the repairs required were a result of a recall, Hyundai will reimburse the customer for the recall-specific repairs to their vehicle."" Hyundai says it will soon launch what it calls a microsite that aims to answer questions for customers affected by recalls. In Quebec, the Automobile Protection Association and a group of Kia owners are suing Kia for compensation for alleged engine problems with the 2010-15 Kia Forte. Fires are not part of that class-action lawsuit. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September. The transportation authority is asking owners who have had problems to contact the department.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

192,Anonymous,2020-01-26T23:42:42.229Z,"NBA legend Kobe Bryant, daughter Gianna killed in helicopter crash","Kobe Bryant, the 18-time NBA all-star who won five championships and became one of the greatest basketball players of his generation during a 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, died in a helicopter crash Sunday. He was 41. Bryant, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, died in a helicopter crash near Calabasas, Calif., according to reports. The crash happened around 10 a.m. local time, about 50 kilometres northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Alex Villanueva, sheriff of Los Angeles County, said there were nine people listed on the flight manifest and that everyone aboard the helicopter was killed, but did not identify any of the victims. However, the city of Calabasas announced Bryant's death via Twitter. It is with great sadness that we learn of the death of Kobe Bryant and four others in a helicopter crash in Calabasas. The aircraft went down in a remote field off Las Virgenes around 10:00 this morning. Nobody on the ground was hurt. The FAA and NTSB are investigating. Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer said the helicopter was a Sikorsky S-76 and it was not known what caused the crash. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sent a ""go team"" of investigators to the site. NTSB generally issues a preliminary report within about 10 days that will give a rough summary of what investigators have learned. The Sikorsky S-76 ""is generally regarded as a good helicopter with a good safety record,"" said Gary C. Robb, an aviation attorney in Kansas City who wrote a textbook on helicopter crash litigation. ""But parts fail, parts break. Anything can happen."" The crash occurred several miles from Mamba Sports Academy, Bryant's basketball training complex in Thousand Oaks, Calif. Bryant, who had four daughters with his wife, Vanessa, dedicated himself to boosting women's sports in his retirement. Bryant lived south of Los Angeles in coastal Orange County for much of his adult life, and he often used helicopters to save time and avoid Southern California's notorious traffic. Even as a player, he often travelled to practices and games by helicopter, and he kept up the practice after retirement as he attended to his business ventures. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued the following statement today regarding the passing of Kobe Bryant <a href=""https://t.co/P88GwIwmYV"">pic.twitter.com/P88GwIwmYV</a> Bryant retired in 2016 as the third-leading scorer in NBA history, finishing two decades with the Lakers as a prolific scorer with a sublime all-around game and a relentless competitive ethic. He held that spot in the league scoring ranks until Saturday night, when the Lakers' LeBron James passed him for third place during a game in Philadelphia, Bryant's hometown. ""Continuing to move the game forward (at) KingJames,"" Bryant wrote in his last tweet. ""Much respect my brother."" Bryant had one of the greatest careers in recent NBA history and became one of the game's most popular players as the face of the 16-time NBA champion Lakers franchise. He was the league MVP in 2008 and a two-time NBA scoring champion, and he earned 12 selections to the NBA's All-Defensive teams.

James later teamed up with Bryant on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team in Beijing. ""He had zero flaws offensively,"" James said. ""Zero. You backed off of him, he could shoot the 3. You body him up a little bit, he could go around you. He could shoot from mid-range. He could post. He could make free throws. ... He was just immortal offensively because of his skill set and his work ethic.""

Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest as an upstart rookie, and the Lakers gradually grew into a team that won three consecutive championships. Bryant and Gasol formed the nucleus of another championship team in 2008, reaching three straight NBA Finals and eventually winning two more titles.

193,Evan Dyer,2020-01-24T16:57:11.226Z,Flames of blame: how climate change could upset the race to lead the Conservative Party,"Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's tone was measured. But his words were as blistering as an Australian bushfire as he denounced his successor as leader of Australia's main right-centre political party, confusingly named the Liberals. He ""could not explain"" why Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to meet with experts or take the bushfire threat seriously, despite warnings from scientists. ""It's just not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would or should act in a national crisis like this."" ""How many more coral reefs have to be bleached? How many more million hectares of forest have to be burned? How many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong?"" asked Turnbull. Then he twisted the knife in his colleague —who has already been publicly shamed for taking a family vacation as Australia burned. ""Rather than doing what a leader should do,"" Turnbull said, Morrison ""downplayed it and at times discounted the influence of climate change, which is just nonsense from a scientific point of view. So that's misleading people."" ""When your house is burning around you, that'll change your point of view in a hurry,"" said Marilyn Gladu, the only Canadian Conservative leadership candidate with a background in science (she's a chemical engineer). ""We need to get a sense of urgency without waiting for the house to burn down."" Gladu said the leadership race should be an opportunity for the party to re-think its approach to the climate file. ""I think it needs to be a topic because it's clear that the policy that we brought on climate change didn't resonate with Canadians in the election,"" she said. ""And so, if we're going to win the next election, we've got to come to Canadians with a credible offering."" Gladu said the Conservative Party under Andrew Scheer presented policies that left Canadians wondering ""how is that going to reduce the footprint? And how much is it going to reduce it by? ""People want to see a chart that says, 'Here are the Paris targets, and here are the different contributors that we will eliminate in order to achieve that target.' That's really what we need to do in order to have a credible plan."" Scheer failed to explain during the campaign how a government led by him would meet Canada's Paris targets — and wasn't even able to say what Canada's Paris target is when asked for the number directly at a campaign stop in Quebec that was dedicated to climate policy. That allowed the Liberals to pose as the champions of climate action, although their own plan also falls short of the Paris target — which itself falls short of what scientists say is needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. The Conservatives have seen consensus positions in the party on some issues change rapidly.  When leadership candidate Richard Décarie called homosexuality a ""choice"" on Wednesday, it quickly became clear that opinion was no longer an accepted part of the CPC consensus. From a stance opposing gay marriage — a position once shared by all federal parties — they have moved to acceptance. After the election loss, it was that issue that finally led to the undoing of Andrew Scheer as leader after two party stalwarts called him out for his unwillingness to attend Pride parades, in an op-ed article they wrote for the Globe and Mail.  Jamie Ellerton, who's served the party in various roles including as ""wagonmaster"" of the 2019 Scheer campaign, was one of the authors of that Globe article. He said that the party might find a change of course on climate more difficult than its shift on LGBTQ rights. ""The party at its core continues to be opposed to any new tax, and I think the carbon tax is going to continue to be very unpopular,"" he said. ""What you saw in Ontario was that this was an issue that Patrick Brown wanted to run on, and the party quickly one-eightied [turned around] in the leadership race that replaced him."" Patrick Brown's experience backing a revenue-neutral carbon tax was similar to that of federal Conservative MP Michael Chong, who placed fifth in the 2017 leadership race. Chong described his proposal for a carbon tax, offset by a large cut to income taxes, as a ""credible, market-based, conservative solution to reduce emissions."" Some small-c conservative economists agree with him. But to the party's rank-and-file, any proposal that included the word ""tax"" likely remains anathema, said Ellerton, who shares that view. ""Carbon taxes themselves are probably dead in the water, but electability is going to be a huge part of the conversation as to who the next party leader will be,"" he said. ""And it's clear that Canadians are looking for some kind of action and policy from their government."" Ellerton said the signs of a changing climate are becoming more visible to people, citing the frequent overspilling of the Don River in his own hometown of Toronto. ""This is an issue that Canadians are increasingly concerned about,"" he said. ""This is an issue that came up a lot for Conservatives at the door, that didn't pass muster to earn the confidence and a mandate from Canadians."" One dilemma the party faces is that the last two elections have seen a marked westernization of its caucus and its base. It now draws a disproportionate number of votes from Alberta and Saskatchewan, a region of the country that is an outlier in terms of attitudes to climate change — and where more livelihoods depend on the oil and gas industry than in other parts of Canada. During the federal election campaign, some reporters travelling with Andrew Scheer noticed a difference in tone when he spoke about energy and climate in the Prairie provinces, compared to other parts of Canada. In his public appearances in Ontario or Quebec he sometimes spoke about climate change as at least a problem to be managed. Over the course of two days visiting Edmonton and Regina, Scheer denounced the carbon tax and environmental activists, while never uttering the words ""environment"", ""climate"" or ""emissions"" except in response to media questions. In the 2020 leadership contest, however, so far the party's main candidates are from Ontario and points East, and the rules are designed to avoid giving weight to the Western vote.  At the start of the 2019 campaign, the Conservatives were still unsure of the threat they faced from Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada. In 2020, that question has been answered, and a new leader who feels less threatened from the right might feel safer moving towards the centre on climate policy. But such a move might lead to tensions in Alberta, where the provincial government has invested millions in a ""war room""-style Canadian Energy Centre — panned as a ""Twitter troll farm"" by the NDP opposition. (CBC News contacted the CEC for this story but the organization did not choose to comment.) ""Does the party want to win in 2019?"" Michael Chong asked in 2017. ""I think it does. If Conservatives don't have a credible policy on emissions, a credible policy on climate change, we cannot win the 2019 election."" No current CPC leadership candidate is proposing the party flip on carbon taxes, but like all politicians — like their counterparts in Australia — they remain at the mercy of events. The Conservative Party leadership vote on June 27 comes at the height of wildfire season. Gladu said it's getting increasingly difficult to deny the evidence of climate change, although she acknowledges that some in the party might still like to try. ""There are still those who may not appreciate the climate change situation that we have in the world,"" she said. ""But we should be seeing a change in opinion because we're seeing an increase of floods, of wildfires, a lot of extreme weather events. We know the permafrost is melting, we know the ocean's pH is rising. ""Certainly, as we see these undeniable facts come forward, people's views will evolve."" Meanwhile, there's movement at the provincial level — where some Conservatives who had boldly united to fight carbon taxes before the election muted their opposition afterwards. ""People voted for it, so we in New Brunswick have to find a way to make it work,"" said Premier Blaine Higgs as he somewhat sheepishly announced his resignation from ""The Resistance."" In Australia, while the federal government resists even setting a target for after 2030, all six states have already committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Fires and floods have a way of focusing minds —even changing them. In 2018, Malcolm Turnbull announced that his government would not, despite promises, put an emissions target into legislation. Who would have thought then that, 18 months later, the former PM would be calling for a ""Green New Deal""? ""The wicked self-destructive idiocy of climate denialism must stop …. Above all, we have to urgently stop burning coal and other fossil fuels.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-conservative-leadership-1.5438454,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/schweitzer-live-carbon-tax-newser-calgary-1.5411487 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-party-brand-survey-1.5411086 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-canada-2019-federal-election-1.5405360,N/A
194,Matthew Kupfer,2020-01-25T09:00:00.284Z,"Hate crime unit's return met with appreciation, hope","Members of Ottawa communities that have been targeted by hate crimes are welcoming the Ottawa Police Service's decision to bring back a unit dedicated to fighting those offences. The force announced this week it was reintroducing the hate crime unit, less than a year after confusion arose over whether one ever existed in the first place. Sahada Alolo, co-chair of the Community Equity Council, said she hasn't reported hateful incidents she's personally experienced as a Muslim woman of colour. She said the existence of the dedicated unit will change that. ""Not only will I report it, I will actually encourage people to report it,"" Alolo said. ""Once we have the numbers and people have the data ... a lot more can be done to change."" There were 110 reports of hate crimes in Ottawa last year, the police service said, up from 104 in 2018 and 95 in 2017. The force is adding two new specialized hate crime investigators to the security and intelligence section. In their announcement of the dedicated unit, Ottawa police said they will accept online reports from people who witness hate incidents or graffiti. Alolo said the council and community stakeholders have been calling for the return of a dedicated unit, and said the fact that happened is a sign police are listening. ""It's a win-win for both sides,"" she said. ""The police [will have] the resources to do their job well and the community [is] beginning to trust that the police is on their side and working to cap hate."" Rev. Anthony Bailey, coordinating minister at Parkdale United Church, said the announcement shows police are taking hate incidents seriously. Bailey was among the signatories to a letter welcoming the police announcement, along with the Canadian Anti-Hate Network and 613/819 Black Hub.  His church was also one of the religious institutions targeted in a racist graffiti spree in 2016. ""I think making it acceptable for people to report what they've experienced is absolutely essential,"" Bailey said. Bailey said people are sometimes reluctant to come forward because they don't believe they'll be taken seriously or potentially face language barriers. He said he's waiting to see if the dedicated unit will help address that reluctance. ""We'd like to see the promised results and the promised responsiveness,"" Bailey said. Rabbi Aytan Kenter, senior rabbi at Kehillat Beth Israel — also the target of racist vandalism in 2016 — said his community is feeling more vulnerable after recent attacks on U.S. synagogues. He said he hopes the new unit will provide a point of contact when the community seeks protection during large gatherings, such as the High Holy Days. ""We're not alone as Jews in feeling the sense of fear in relation to crimes that are based upon who a person is — and what it is they believe, or who they love,"" Kenter said. In May 2019, after racist graffiti was scrawled on a black Ottawa family's home, the force somewhat confusingly said it never had a dedicated unit to fighting hate crimes. It was a perplexing statement, given that there were multiple reports billing the hate crime unit as the first of its kind in Canada when it was created in 1993. On its 15th anniversary, former mayor Larry O'Brien heaped praise upon it — even declaring Jan.15 ""hate crime awareness day"" in the capital. That confusion led former interim chief Steve Bell to tell CBC News the unit was ""renamed or moved over to the security and intelligence"" section in January 2017.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hate-crime-police-force-ottawa-reaction-1.5439673,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hate-crime-police-force-ottawa-reintroduced-1.5438272 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-police-hate-crime-unit-1.5130282 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/steve-bell-ottawa-police-hate-crime-unit-response-1.5135199,N/A
195,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:18:38.451Z,Quebec to comply with ruling that struck down assisted death provisions ,"The Quebec government will comply with a court ruling striking down parts of its medical aid in dying legislation, the province's health and justice ministers announced Tuesday. The province will allow a provision stating those seeking a medically assisted death must be ""at the end of life'' to simply disappear from its legislation, the ministers said, without making any further amendments to the proposed law. The decision means more people will qualify for a medically assisted death, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said, reminding reporters that patients will still have to meet the law's five other criteria to qualify. ""They have a choice,'' McCann said. ""That's the spirit in which we made the decision — the self-determination that a human being who has met all those five criteria ... will have a choice.'' Last September, Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and a section the Quebec law that states people must ""be at the end of life,'' which prevented access to medical assistance in dying for some. The case was brought by two Quebec residents — Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon — who did not meet the criteria and had their requests for assisted death turned down by doctors. Both suffer from incurable degenerative diseases, and lawyers argued the condition that a person's natural death be ''reasonably foreseeable'' before they can receive medical assistance in dying was overly strict. Gladu suffers from post-polio syndrome and medication no longer helps alleviate her pain, the court heard. Doctors gave her about two to three years to live due to her pulmonary condition. Truchon has cerebral palsy. Three of his four limbs were not functional at birth, and he just lost the use of the fourth, but he could continue to live for many more years. The two launched a legal action against the federal and provincial governments, claiming their right to life, liberty and security — guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms — was infringed. Baudouin suspended the application of her judgment until March 11 to give federal and provincial legislators six months to modify the laws, while granting exemptions to Gladu and Truchon to seek medical aid in dying during this period if they satisfied other legal conditions. Neither the federal or provincial governments appealed the decision, although the federal government has not yet announced exactly what it intends to do. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly. The government launched public consultations on the issue. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel said her federal counterpart, David Lametti, is expected to brief provincial ministers this week in Victoria, B.C. ""Theoretically, as long as the federal criteria exists, it applies, so it's in effect until March 12,'' LeBel said, adding it's unclear if the federal government will seek an extension. The chair of the commission that oversees end-of-life care in the province is confident that despite the change in wording, there won't be a flood of people lining up for medical assistance in dying. ""The commission is not afraid that on March 12, the demand will increase tremendously,'' said Dr. Michel Bureau said. ""That's not what we believe.'' But LeBel said the time was right for Quebec to make its announcement, noting the province is about to embark on consultations to broaden the criteria on Jan. 27. ""We've taken our decision so it was the time to announce it,'' LeBel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890,N/A

""I think LGBTQ is a Liberal term. I don't talk about people that way,"" the former Conservative staffer told CTV's Power Play Wednesday night. ""Do you think that's a choice or do you think it's biological?"" asked host Evan Solomon.  ""I think it's a choice,"" responded Décarie. ""How people are behaving, it's one thing. I think government has [the] responsibility to encourage the traditional value that we have had for the past years."" I vehemently reject this message. I will not serve under someone whose leadership pitch is that someone's sexuality is something to be ""fixed"". I am full on tired of this type of shit defining the conservative movement in Canada. Giddyup, you're going to have to go through me. <a href=""https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc"">https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc</a> A number of Conservatives who are expected to run for the leadership were quick to distance themselves — and the party — from Décarie's stance. The Conservative Party voted to end its official opposition to gay marriage in 2016, more than a decade after it was legalized. ""Being gay is not a choice and nobody should be running for office on a platform to roll back hard-won rights,"" tweeted former cabinet minister Peter MacKay after a clip of the interview began racking up thousands of views online.  Erin O'Toole, another former cabinet minister who is musing a bid, called Décarie's statement ""ridiculous,"" and Sarnia MP Marilyn Gladu, who like MacKay has publicly signalled a leadership run, said it was ""unacceptable."" Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre, who had been expected to make a run for the top job until today, said Décarie does not speak for Conservatives. ""Being gay is not a choice. Being ignorant is,"" he tweeted.  In a followup interview with CBC on Thursday, Décarie apologized for offending people and said he didn't understand the visceral reaction to his comments. ""I was told that I was offensive, and if I've been offensive in the eye of some people I'm sorry about that,"" said the the former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper. ""Those who are very liberal should be joining Mr. Trudeau."" Décarie said that, if he's elected prime minister, he'd work to ""clarify"" same-sex marriage in Canada. ""I think it's important that marriage should be exclusive to men and women and all other unions are civil unions,"" he said. Décarie said that while he's received a lot of backlash over the past day, a number of social conservatives have reached out in support. ""There are many social conservatives in our party and many Canadians want [a] true conservative voice to speak and stand up for them. So I feel I am their voice and we'll see who will be elected,"" he said. ""The so-cons are mobilized and they feel that I could be representing them."" It remains to be seen how much sway the social conservative wing will have on picking a leader to replace Andrew Scheer, who had his own socially conservative leanings. Both Décarie and Ontario MP Derek Sloan, who announced his intentions to run on Wednesday, are pitching themselves to the social conservatives in the party. In the 2017 leadership race, with the help of groups like Campaign Life Coalition, former MP Brad Trost came in fourth place in a field of 14 candidates.

This includes raising one's arms and waving them in the air, using noise makers and throwing sticks.  If a wolf displays aggressive behaviour, anyone nearby should back away slowly and not turn their back on the wolf.  Our officers have the <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/JamesBayWolf2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#JamesBayWolf2020</a> contained in James Bay.

198,Paige Parsons,2020-01-24T13:00:00.900Z,'Heartbroken': Mother says daughter still waiting for reading with 'Mom's a Medium' star,"Candice Lemay was at a loss for how to help her young daughter. The teenager, whose father had died unexpectedly when she was a toddler, was struggling. Finally, the mother from Tofield, Alta., struck upon the idea to give her daughter a chance to speak to her dad, through the aid of a psychic medium. Lemay did research and discovered local psychic medium Carmel Joy Baird — something of a celebrity in the medium world, having starred in a two-season run of the reality show Mom's a Medium.  Lemay paid $525 for a 30-minute appointment with Baird on May 2, 2017, booking her daughter, now 15, in for a session on Nov. 23, 2018. But, like other clients of Baird who shared stories of frustration with CBC in 2018, Lemay said the reading was cancelled and has yet to be rescheduled.  In an interview, Baird defended her business practices despite the long delays for clients, maintaining that she is following the terms and conditions they had agreed to. Lemay said she has exchanged a number of emails with Baird's staff asking about rescheduling, and has also asked for a refund. She said it has been hard to watch her daughter's hopes dashed. ""She actually still asks if she'll ever get it, and I pretty much tell her no. She is heartbroken by it, because she really wanted to talk to her dad."" Over a year after the original appointment date, Lemay said she's at a loss about what to do. ""I just don't want anybody else to make this mistake,"" she said. ""I'm not asking for my money back. I gave up on that. I just don't want anyone else heartbroken like my daughter is."" In an interview in June 2018, Baird blamed medical and family issues for the delays. She claimed she was making changes and planned to introduce a new refund system. She stopped accepting new bookings for readings, so she would be able to catch up. But in an interview with CBC last month, Baird said she decided not to give refunds after all, citing advice from lawyers, and argued that the policies outlined in her terms and conditions protect and offer flexibility for clients who have scheduling issues arise due to their own health or other concerns. ""It's a different type of business,"" Baird said. ""There isn't anything like this. It's not like your stores, or your products. You only have one person."" Baird said she is working through her waitlist, and stands by a number system she implemented to manage the bookings, as well as her offer that clients who are waiting for a reading can instead use the ""credit"" for the amount they've paid to purchase something from her online store. ""I feel like I've done everything I can to be very black and white, and very fair,"" Baird said. In an email on Dec. 3, 2018, Lemay was told she was No. 1,539 on Baird's reading waitlist. In May 2019, when she asked for an update, a staff member told Lemay in an email that there were still about 1,400 people waiting for readings. Baird said she is continuing to experience health challenges but expects she will be through the list by the end of 2020.  She said she finds it frustrating that people don't reciprocate the empathy and understanding she extended to them as she deals with a loss in her family and ongoing health issues.  ""Sure, I think I'm guilty of trying to help too many people at once,"" she said. ""But I think I'm innocent of saying that 'I'm a fraud, or that I have bad intentions, or that  I'm a bad person, or that I'm wrong.' I think I've asked for patience and time, and understanding and empathy for my own grief and journey."" Lemay said she wasn't aware of the terms and conditions when she paid — including that Baird could opt to do the reading by phone rather than in person. But a copy of an email interest form Lemay filled out in October 2016 shows that the terms and conditions were available to her.  In a chain of emails shared with CBC, Lemay repeatedly asked Baird's staff for updates on her daughter's appointment, and asked for a refund multiple times. ""A refund is not possible. Our lawyers have instructed us to stand by our policies,"" an employee wrote in response on Nov. 8, 2019. The employee offered to help Lemay use her $525 credit for a different purchase, and told her that otherwise she would be in touch when the number for Lemay's daughter's reading comes up.  In other messages, Baird's employees advised Lemay by email that people waiting for readings would have the option to use the money they paid in advance  as credit toward anything Baird sells in her online store. In an email Tuesday, one of Baird's employees claimed that offering credit to Lemay amounts to giving her a refund. A number of courses and products are advertised on Baird's website, such as the $800 ""Personal Psychic Pen Pal Service,"" which allows buyers to ask Baird two questions per month and receive responses for a year. Another option is a $99 ""Manifesting Magic"" online course. Baird also hosts events: a general admission ticket to a two-day event scheduled for June at Baird's ranch is $200, though customers can also upgrade to a ""platinum"" $600 ticket.  Baird and her staff claim that most of her clients are happy with the service they've received, despite the long waits. Baird's Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile is not accredited, but reports 119 complaints over the past three years. In the past 12 months, 25 new complaints were closed, most about having appointments cancelled and not rescheduled, or stating that the company fails to respond to communications asking for refunds.The BBB has maintained a ""pattern of complaint"" alert on Baird's profile outlining the persistent issues consumers have had in receiving requested services. ""...while the company has responded to the pattern outlining its corporate policy terms and conditions, the underlying causes of the pattern remain unresolved to BBB's satisfaction,"" a spokesperson said in an email. In an email to CBC, one of Baird's employees claimed that a Better Business Bureau employee told them the agency is ""supporting"" Baird's policies, and also claimed to have been told that Baird is operating within provincial guidelines and legislation for businesses by Service Alberta — the provincial ministry that oversees consumer protection issues. BBB president and CEO Seanna Lawrence said by email that she reviewed the BBB's communications with Baird's business and found nothing to suggest her staff indicated they support Baird's policies. ""BBB did one more than one occasion, encourage the business to update its policies, indicating that it would be better for the conciliation process between the business and consumers,"" Lawrence said. In an email, Tricia Velthuizen, press secretary to the minister of Service Alberta, said the department could not comment on Baird's claim that the policies follow provincial rules. In an earlier statement Velthuzien confirmed the department is ""aware of this ongoing issue."" In response to CBC queries in 2018, Service Alberta confirmed that it has investigated several complaints against Baird in recent years. However, no enforcement action has been taken against Baird, according to a search of Service Alberta's enforcement database.  An Edmonton police spokesperson confirmed that its economic crimes investigators received one complaint about Baird in 2019, but referred all inquiries to Service Alberta. A search of court records found Baird has never faced charges. Service Alberta did offer the following tips to consumers looking to purchase what they described as ""these types of services"": Lemay said she approached CBC because she doesn't see how authorities can do anything about her issue with Baird. Despite everything she has been through, she still believes a reading from a different service provider will help her child.  ""I believe in it,"" she said. ""One hundred per cent believe in it. I think a word from my daughter's father would change her mind in life, which I think she needs.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/mother-says-daughter-still-waiting-for-reading-with-mom-s-a-medium-star-1.5436347,[],N/A
199,Colin Butler,2020-01-24T10:00:00.056Z,A London program that turns Indigenous women into warriors needs a financial lifeline,"A game-changing program for Indigenous women is in jeopardy thanks to cash crunch. Staff at Positive Voice program are looking for a new financial lifeline to continue their work turning peoples' lives around.  The program at London's Nokee Kwe Native Education Centre has been turning wall flowers into warriors since 2016. The seven-week course teaches women to overcome trauma, find self-confidence, get an education and embark upon a career to take control of their lives.  Now the program is in jeopardy after a one-time, two-year, $216,500 grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation that has run its course. ""It's heart breaking and sad. It's discouraging,"" said Mina Antone, a graduate of Positive Voice. ""This program that was put together has helped so many people like myself.""  Antone found the program two years ago, when her life was at a major crossroads. She had just fled an abusive relationship. Her mother and a sister had died in a house fire. Antone was looking for a fresh start for herself and her three children.  ""Before the program I was pretty depressed,"" she said. At first Antone wasn't sure what to make of the course. So she sat in the back of class and listened to the others share their stories.  ""I could relate to a lot of them,"" she said. ""They were going through the same things I was going through.""  The reason Antone could relate is because violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada happens on a scale and severity much higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts. According to federal Department of Justice statistics from 2014, Indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to be sexually assaulted than non-Indigenous females. Indigenous women and girls are also far more likely to experience domestic violence. While three per cent of non-Indigenous women reported being assaulted by a current or former spouse, among the Indigenous population that number is 10 per cent.  With hundreds of unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women in Canada, police are overwhelmed and under resourced to do much about it.  It's not easy being an Indigenous woman in this country, which is something that became plainly obvious to Mina Atone as she sat quietly listening to the other women from the back of her Positive Voice class.  She learned she wasn't alone and she opened up because she realized for the first time, her story mattered.  ""I started to become more confident in myself. I started to take chances and make mistakes and have a little more faith in myself.""  Two years later, Atone is a teacher. She teaches Oneida language classes at both Nokee Kwe and H.B. Beal Secondary School.  ""It's always been a dream of mine,"" she said, wiping away tears. ""After going through this program and finding the confidence to move forward, I became one of those great people at the front of the classroom.""  The trick turning the lives around of women like Mina Atone to ""break down their walls,"" according to Danielle Hill. Hill is not just a graduate of the program herself, she now works as one of its facilitators.  Those walls have been built up by women over many years because many of feel as if they are under siege from all sides with fear of a violent spouse, other women – even the authorities. She said most Indigenous women don't even realize they're doing it.  ""We're just so used to having things taken away from us, like losing our children with one call,"" she said. ""It may not even be true what people are saying but there's still that fear that we may have our children taken by [the Children's Aid Society]."" ""We're used to having to protect everything we have,"" she said. Once women realize that Positive Voice is a safe space, they lower their defenses and learn they don't have to go on struggling alone. They can go to the group with their problems, help other women in their community and find strength as role models for women and girls in their family.  It helps end cycles of violence, abuse and fosters a sense of independence, something Mina Antone is trying to teach her daughter Natasha.  ""She's 13 and she said to me 'mom, people don't get to live the dream and there's no chance for anything great to happen' and it kind of upset me because there's always hope.""  ""So I looked at my daughter and I told her, 'you can't sit there and say there's no hope and nobody gets to live live their dream because I am living the dream.""  ""I didn't think I was ever going to and here I am,"" she said. ""People can do remarkable things, as long as they have faith in themselves."" Hill said that faith is what she and other organizers of Positive Voice are trying to keep in mind as they look for a financial lifeline, something that's crucially needed if they want to keep changing lives like Atone's for the better.  She said hopefully they can find the money to not just continue the program, but expand it.  ""We want to see this evolve. We have so many ideas moving forward,"" she said. ""We just have no money to do it.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-ontario-positive-voice-women-1.5437838,[],N/A
200,Erica Johnson,2019-09-30T00:00:00.921Z,"Toronto-area man out $2,775 after e-transfer fraudsters impersonate him on email","A Toronto-area contractor says it was ""pretty creepy"" to discover someone had hacked into his email and impersonated him — convincing customers of his family-owned granite countertop business to send thousands of dollars via e-transfer.  The fraudsters then stole the payments. ""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont. ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'"" Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.  Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.  ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there."" Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit. By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.  To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775. ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable."" Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.  Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite. Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit. ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good."" Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked — moving money from point A to point B — and that it was not going to investigate. ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess."" Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in a statement said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly."" Interac would not address Sinani's — or other customers' — concerns. Interac is a private company and Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders. Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what — if anything — it was doing to help trace the money, but in a statement said funds sent ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover."" York Regional Police are investigating.  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buy and share email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts. ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems, said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.  ""It's turning into an arms race."" Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites — from the local library to pizza delivery — and any one of those databases can get hacked. ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out."" Heywood says hackers then use bots — custom software — that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers. ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" — such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and — ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer."" So Interac's e-transfer system, he says, is only as secure as users' email and passwords. On the heels of a Go Public story published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank. ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.  ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system."" Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, says Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries. Vijayaraghavan, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfers directly from bank to bank — using only a bank code and a person's account number.  ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system."" Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authentication — a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address. Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work. ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks."" Popa, the cybersecurity expert, says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers — and the auto-deposit option — is if the government forces them.  He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place. ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians."" Sinani the contractor, says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.  But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient. ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""

201,Stephanie Myles,2020-01-26T15:59:38.920Z,"Raonic continues deep Aussie Open run, sets up showdown with Djokovic in quarters","Milos Raonic is into the Australian Open men's singles quarter-finals for the fifth time in the last six years. The 29-year-old Canadian backed up a straight-sets upset of No. 6 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas on Friday with a 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 win over Croatia's Marin Cilic in the fourth round Sunday afternoon. ""I did a lot of things really well. I had the idea of how I wanted to play and I was happy I could execute and sort of live up to that,"" Raonic said. As a reward, Raonic will get an opportunity to do something he hasn't yet been able to accomplish in his career: beat Novak Djokovic. The defending Australian Open champion defeated No. 14 seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 later Sunday to set up a showdown with Raonic in the quarters. Djokovic has a 9-0 career record against the big-serving Canadian. WATCH | Raonic rolls into quarter-finals: Cilic, part of Raonic's generation of players and also a mainstay in the top 10 for many years, has struggled over the last 12 months and watched his ranking tumble out of the top 30. The 2014 US Open champion was hampered by a lower back issue Sunday, exacerbated by the four hours and 10 minutes he needed to upset No. 9 seed Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in the previous round. But there wasn't a lot he could do as Raonic put on another serving clinic. The Canadian fired 35 aces, bring his total through four matches to 82. No one has broken his serve, and only two opponents have even had opportunities. Chile's Cristian Garin went 0-for-3 in the second round; Cilic went 0-for-4 on Sunday. WATCH | Djokovic wins to set up date with Raonic: The fourth-round matchups Monday: No. 1 Rafael Nadal vs. No. 23 Nick Kyrgios, No. 4 Daniil Medvedev vs. three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka, No. 5 Dominic Thiem vs. No. 10 Gael Monfils, and No. 7 Alexander Zverev vs. No. 17 Andrey Rublev. Against Djokovic, five of the nine meetings have gone three sets. But only one of those has come in the last five years. ""I'm going to have to serve well, clearly. And then I think I'm going to have to get my return at a high percentage, make him play a lot of those points, and then try to be efficient on my service games,"" Raonic said. During his on-court interview after the victory over Schwartzman, Djokovic echoed similar sentiments. ""One of the key elements will be how well I'm returning, and how confident I am on my service games,"" Djokovic said. ""I'm really glad to see Milos healthy and playing on a really good level again. He's a great guy, we speak the same language, and I'm glad to see him in the quarters."" On the women's side, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova became the first player to advance to the quarter-finals. She rallied from a set and a break down to win 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-2 over Maria Sakkari. She'll next play top-ranked Ash Barty, who is through to the Australian Open quarter-finals as she attempts to become the first Australian woman to win her national championship since Chris O'Neill in 1978. Barty beat American Alison Riske 6-3, 1-6, 6-4 at Rod Laver Arena, breaking Riske's serve in the final game when Riske double-faulted on match point. WATCH | No. 1 Barty keeps rolling: As part of Australia Day honours, the government awarded 23-year-old Barty the ""Young Australian of the Year"" award for her strong 2019 on the circuit which saw her rise to No. 1 in the rankings and win the WTA Finals as well as her first Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros.  ""I think end to end was very different,"" Barty said. ""The breeze is always a little bit different at court level than it is kind of up in the stands. Tonight was stronger than the other days. ""It was just about adapting and trying to work through it as best as you can. It was important to try and hold and stay and fight for every point from the end where you were against the wind, and make the most of it when you were with the wind."" Sofia Kenin has beaten 15-year-old Coco Gauff 6-7 (5), 6-3, 6-0 to reach the quarter-finals of a major for the first time. The No. 14-seeded Kenin got early service breaks in all three sets, including the first game of the match against Gauff, who took out defending champion Naomi Osaka in the third round and seven-time major winner Venus Williams in the first. Kenin will next play Ons Jabeur of Tunisia who advanced after defeating No. 27 seed Wang Qiang. ""I was just so happy to have won. It was a tough match,"" said Kenin. ""I knew [Gauff was] playing well. I was just really happy with the way that I was able to handle my emotions and just fight through every point."" Gauff pulled off her only service break of the match in winning a tight first set, but Kenin buckled down and controlled the final two sets in the two-hour, nine minute victory. ""I knew it was a few minor details,"" Kenin said. ""I felt like I wasn't returning so well. I missed a few opportunities. Of course, she served really well."" Roger Federer rallied after a tough opening set to beat Marton Fucsovics 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 and reach the Australian Open quarter-finals, extending his record to 57 trips to the last eight of a major. No. 3-seeded Federer survived a grueling five-setter against John Millman in the third round, when he was two points from defeat before winning the last six points of a super tiebreaker, and appeared fatigued late in the first set Sunday against Fucsovics. WATCH | Federer survives scare: But he went on the offence, breaking the No. 67-ranked Hungarian's serve twice in the second set and three times in the third to establish a winning lead. The 20-time major winner will next play Tennys Sandgren, an American who reached the quarterfinals for the second time in three years at Melbourne Park by beating No. 12-seeded Fabio Fognini in a heated four-setter. Meanwhile, Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski and partner Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia advanced to the quarter-finals of the women's doubles tournament. The No.6 seeded duo defeated American Hayley Carter and Luisa Stefani of Brazil 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 in the third round on Sunday. By reaching the quarters, the 27-year-old Canadian matches her best result in women's doubles at the Australian Open. In her only previous quarter-final appearance in Melbourne back in 2018, Dabrowski and former partner Yifan Xu of China fell to the eventual runner-ups — Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina. Dabrowski, currently ranked eighth in the world in doubles, has a new partner in Ostapenko for the opening Grand Slam of the year. She split with Xu after last season. Dabrowski and Xu's best result at a Grand Slam was a runner-up showing at last year's Wimbledon.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/tennis/australian-open-milos-raonic-marin-cilic-round-of-16-1.5440771,[],N/A
202,Anonymous,2020-01-22T20:46:49.552Z,"Risk of new coronavirus spreading to the North low, say territories' top doctors","Health officials in the Northwest Territories and Yukon say the risk of the new coronavirus spreading to the territories is probably low. Dr. Kami Kandola, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer, said her office is monitoring the situation and that right now, the majority of reported cases globally are related to exposure in Wuhan, the city in mainland China where the virus was first reported. There are no direct flights to Canada from Wuhan, said Kandola, and Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports are screening travellers who are at risk.     ""It's just important that the initial ports of entry won't be through Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — it will be through these larger cities,"" she said.  The coronavirus belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging in severity; from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), says the Public Health Agency of Canada. Coronavirus is not currently as serious as SARS, said Kandola, but it's likely the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases. As of Jan. 20, 282 cases of the virus were confirmed, and six people had died, according to the World Health Organization. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the United States, and all are linked to people who had travelled from mainland China.   ""The situation right now, from the Public Health Agency of Canada is that the risk is extremely low,"" said Kandola. However, she added, that can change with the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, when millions of people travel around China and abroad.  ""We don't know what the situation is going to be after that,"" she said.  Kandola urges people travelling between Canada and China to look at travel advice issued by the Canadian government. In Yukon, chief medical officer Brendan Hanley said the risk of seeing the virus in Yukon is ""probably fairly low,"" but said it's worth being vigilant. ""I mean, look how kind of random it was that it showed up in Seattle. It's something we need to be vigilant for, prepared for ... We don't want to miss that case, should it arrive,"" he said. At the Nova Hotel in Yellowknife on Tuesday, tourists expressed mixed feelings about the coronavirus outbreak.  Sandy Lee, a traveller from San Francisco with roots in Hong Kong, said she's ""getting nervous.""  ""Hopefully we can prepare,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I don't know, because now Chinese New Year is coming up [and] people will be going back to their own region to visit their relatives."" Bing Yem is a visitor from Toronto whose family is originally from mainland China.  ""We can manage the situation ... no worries,"" he said, adding he believes China's government will be able to control the situation. ""Our friends in China, they still travel,"" he said. The symptoms of coronavirus mimic other common viruses, such as a fever, coughing and shortness of breath, said Kandola.  She said people can protect themselves and others by washing their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds, and by coughing and sneezing into a tissue or their elbow. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.  While the risk of catching the new virus is low, other viruses, such as influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are circulating around the territory. Kandola said people with cold- and flu-like symptoms should stay home, and if their symptoms are severe, they should go to the emergency room. Front-line health practitioners are being told to ask patients about their recent travel history to Wuhan, said Kandola. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/coronavirus-nwt-risk-1.5435448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-tlicho-region-whooping-cough-1.5428641,N/A
203,Adam Miller,2020-01-22T10:50:27.511Z,Key things to watch for in the coronavirus outbreak,"As the coronavirus outbreak continues in China and beyond, key questions remain about the nature of the virus and how quickly and easily it can spread between people.  Here's a look at some of the potentially serious turns the outbreak could take. Human-to-human transmission is the spread of an illness from an infected patient to a non-infected person. There are two types of this transmission: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission. Infections among health-care workers strengthen the evidence for this,"" the WHO in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" WHO officials will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to discuss what recommendations should be made to manage it. ""The key issues here are what is the extent of human-to-human transmission and how easy is human-to-human transmission?"" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.  ""That's going to be a factor into how widespread this ultimately gets.""   Health officials will also be watching closely to see if the virus changes as the outbreak continues, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.  ""Viruses evolve and mutate, and they may start to take on new attributes and characteristics that either make them more easily transmissible or make them more deadly,"" he said.  ""The reality is that the longer that it's out there, the more it will evolve.""  Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said if the coronavirus mutates into something more contagious, that would be a ""significant concern"" similar to the way in which SARS evolved. McGeer said the initial clusters of patients infected with SARS in early 2003 were associated with open-air markets in China, much like in the current coronavirus outbreak, with limited transmission from person to person.  ""Then over the next couple of months, the virus evolved into a virus that was more transmissible person to person, but more transmissible person to person when people were seriously ill,"" she said.  ""If that process is repeating itself, and the virus is changing, then we may be moving from one problem to a completely different problem. So far that's not what it's looked like, but I don't think you can be sure about it."" McGeer added there haven't been many reports of transmission to health-care workers, aside from the reported 15 cases of medical staff in Wuhan, which she said concerns her about the potential for the virus to change.  ""They must have followed up with health-care workers after the initial cases in December, they didn't see transmission and now they've found transmission,"" she said.  ""It does raise the concern that this is a virus that is changing and if it's a virus that's changing then that's a whole new set of issues. There's nothing we can do except wait to know what's going to happen."" Another concern is the possibility of a ""super-spreader,"" a highly infectious patient who can spread the illness to many people at a disproportionate rate to other carriers.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said super-spreader events were ""pivotal"" in the spread of SARS worldwide in 2003.They defined super-spreading as transmission to at least eight people.  One super-spreading event was identified early in the epidemic in Beijing, where a patient with an onset of SARS two months after hospital admission was the source of transmission to 76 patients, including 12 health-care workers and several hospital visitors.  Prof. Gabriel M. Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said Tuesday the ""critical issue"" in controlling a coronavirus epidemic is to make sure that super-spreading events are controlled quickly.  ""It is absolutely critical that public health authorities recognize a super-spreading event in the very earliest stages,"" he said during a media availability. ""Before it goes absolutely explosive.""  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said the possibility of a super-spreader is top of mind for health officials worldwide.  ""There is also the possibility of super-spreading events. The global community is very familiar [with] what has happened with SARS in the past and this is something that is on our radar,"" she said during a press conference Tuesday. ""That is possible, and what we need to prepare ourselves for."" Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot that uses data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world, said outbreaks are like fires, and infected individuals are like embers.  ""They may land in one location where they happen to just trigger a big outbreak, and it may have to do with a super-spreading event,"" he said.  ""A super-spreading event does not mean that it is limited to the epicentre in Wuhan; it could catalyze multiple new epicentres.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A
204,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:50:06.497Z,Saskatchewan lab joins global effort to develop coronavirus vaccine,"As Canadian public health agencies prepare to deal with a new viral illness, a specialized lab in Saskatoon is using its research on different strains of the coronavirus to help develop a vaccine. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, also known as VIDO-InterVac, has received permission from the Public Health Agency of Canada to focus on the threat. ""People need to work together and collaborate and share the information,"" said its executive director, Volker Gerdts. The deadly coronavirus, first linked to a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has been connected to 26 deaths and infections in hundreds of people. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States have each reported at least one case of the virus. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada and officials say the risk of an outbreak remains low. About five or six people in Canada are being monitored, including those with a travel history to the Wuhan area and with symptoms of the illness. Respiratory samples are being sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. ""Emerging diseases arrive and, because of all the travel we do and the connectiveness we have right now, the world becomes smaller and smaller and there's a better chance for these pathogens to quickly spread around the globe,"" Gerdts said. The Saskatchewan lab was developed in the wake of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2003 to ensure that Canada could be prepared for emerging disease and illness, he said. Researchers there have spent a significant amount of time focusing on pathogens like coronaviruses. Gerdts said they've successfully developed a vaccine for coronavirus strains in cattle and pigs. ""We have expertise in working with them."" While coronaviruses are relatively small, they are known for mutating and jumping species, which is why they cause so many problems. Gerdts explained the coronavirus strain in pigs had not been seen in North America until two years ago. But within a year it had affected 10 million of the animals. Colleagues in China have made the outbreak-specific coronavirus genome sequence available to researchers around the world, Gerdts said. His lab is now using it to hopefully find a way to help. The lab also has clearance to handle samples of the pathogen and is attempting to get samples from China or the U.S. If that's not possible, it will order synthetic gene fragments. The goal is to have the first vaccine candidates ready for testing in animals within six to eight weeks, Gerdts said. But human trials are at least a year away. Gerdts said Canada has taken a leading role in developing vaccines, including one for the Ebola virus, and there's a need to have more capacity to manufacture them here. If his lab had a manufacturing facility that he's been advocating for, he said production of a coronavirus vaccine for human testing could happen quicker. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Canadian research is part of a global effort and will be shared with the World Health Organization. ""We currently do not have a specific vaccine against this novel coronavirus,"" she said. ""With a global effort on preparedness, I think that's something that we need to strive for.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/vido-intervac-working-on-coronavirus-vaccine-1.5439118,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/quarantine-coronavirus-1.5438652,N/A

207,Benjamin Blum,2020-01-27T01:41:32.572Z,"For Canadian basketball, Kobe Bryant was both an icon and adversary","Kobe Bryant achieved international stardom during his storied NBA career — but his impact on basketball in Canada was particularly unique. Bryant — who was killed in a helicopter crash Sunday in Calabasas, Calif., along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others — was simultaneously an inspiration to countless Canadian athletes who would go on to professional careers and a tormentor of the country's NBA teams as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers. Here is a look at Bryant's relationship with basketball in Canada — both as a friend and a foe — as tributes to the late basketball icon continue to come in. Before the recent success of the Toronto Raptors, yellow jerseys adorned with either the No. 8 or 24 were ubiquitous whenever Bryant came to town. But Bryant's most iconic moment against the Raptors came in Los Angeles in 2006, when he dropped 81 points on Toronto. Bryant's 81 are the second-most points scored in an NBA game, behind only Wilt Chamberlain's 100 points scored as a member of the Philadelphia Warriors in 1962. The performance is even more stunning due to the fact it came a month after Toronto held him to just 11 points. Even games at what was then-known as the Air Canada Centre could have been mistaken for Lakers home games due to Bryant's transcendent stardom. And for Raptors fans, who for years were starved for any semblance of celebration, a missed shot at the buzzer by Bryant in 2010 was cause for celebration. Bryant — who owned a 24-9 record against the Raptors — would go on to finish his career as the third-highest scoring player in league history, a mark that was surpassed by current Laker LeBron James on Saturday. Watch: Kobe Bryant's last game in Toronto But what about Canada's other NBA team, the late Vancouver Grizzlies? Well, Bryant notched his first-career triple-double in 2001 against the team, which later relocated to Memphis. Bryant was an 18-time NBA all-star during his career, and his final all-star appearance in 2016 was cause for celebration. The festivities were held in Toronto that season, and the weekend for all intents and purposes turned into the Kobe show. Watch: Kobe Bryant honoured before final NBA All-Star Game After the video aired in the arena, NBA legend Magic Johnson took the microphone to laud Bryant even further and eventually introduce a second tape of Bryant's moments, with the retiring Los Angeles Lakers great narrating parts of it and other All-Stars offering him words of thanks. Bryant then addressed the crowd, as they chanted his name at a deafening level. Bryant said he's ""been extremely fortunate to play the game I love and be in the NBA for more than half my life."" He ended his remarks by saying, ""Thank you so much — and now I've got to go get loose."" Bryant checked out of the game with just over a minute remaining, leaving to a standing ovation, hugs from players, and more chanting of his name. The West easily defeated the East by a whopping score of 196-173. Throughout his 20-year career, Bryant left his mark on many basketball players whom eventually made it to the NBA — including several Canadians. Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray grew up in Kitchener, Ont., idolizing the five-time NBA champion. Murray, who was drafted seventh overall by the Nuggets in 2016, told the Denver Post that he admired Bryant's famous ""Mamba mentality."" ""It was his drive to win, it was his never give up on plays, his confidence level in himself and what he could do, his belief in his team, just everything,"" Murray said. After learning of Bryant's death, Murray tweeted: ""I'm trying to process but I just can't man."" Surreal day. Every inch of the Pepsi Center has gone quiet. Every person flipping through their phone or shaking their head. Here's the moment Will Barton informed Jamal Murray about the news. <a href=""https://t.co/D46C6pH4yV"">pic.twitter.com/D46C6pH4yV</a> Toronto's Andrew Wiggins has said he watched Bryant's game voraciously as a child and modelled his game after the star. Wiggins, who plays for Minnesota, would wind up scoring on his idol during a game in February 2016. After knocking down a fadeaway jump shot with Bryant defending, Wiggins — who was drafted No. 1 overall by the Timberwolves in 2014 — turned to him and said: ""I got that from you."" Andrew Wiggins backs down Kobe Bryant, nails fadeaway <a href=""https://t.co/gjlzN4YXlf"">pic.twitter.com/gjlzN4YXlf</a> The admiration was mutual. After a game against the Timberwolves in 2014, Bryant said that playing against then-19-year-old Wiggins was ""like looking at a reflection of myself 19 years ago."" Bryant even had a few Canadian teammates during his illustrious career — notably Rick Fox, who won three consecutive titles in Los Angeles with Bryant in the early 2000s. Fox, a small forward from Toronto, was a solid contributor during the team's title run in 2000 and developed into a key starter for the Lakers' next two championship victories. Reserve centre Robert Sacre, a one-time member of the Canadian men's national basketball team, also played for the Lakers during the latter part of Bryant's career. But the highest-profile Canadian to share the court with Bryant was two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash. While a member of the Phoenix Suns, Nash and Bryant faced off three times in the NBA playoffs, with the Suns winning two series. At the end of his career, Nash elected to team up with Bryant in Los Angeles, but injuries to both players limited their on-court time together. ""My heart is broken for Kobe and his family,"" Nash tweeted on Sunday. ""I'll never forget the battles but what I really admired was the father he was to his girls.

208,Anonymous,2020-01-25T20:00:00.853Z,"Bonavista homes at risk if seawall is not repaired, says mayor","The mayor of Bonavista says immediate action is required to prevent the destruction of homes in his community, following damage to infrastructure suffered during Friday's blizzard. John Norman told CBC that his town needs quick help from the federal government before things get worse. ""This is something that can't wait. In select locations now we need action in the coming months,"" said Norman on Wednesday.  ""Otherwise we really have a chance of losing actual property and structures in some cases."" A seawall protecting properties and land in Bonavista failed in six different locations Friday, during a storm that saw winds reaching 164 km/h and more than 75 centimetres of snow. Norman estimates the cost of repairs at over $1 million. He was in contact with the area's MP, Churence Rogers, before Friday's storm but says the situation is all the more urgent now. ""In a couple of cases, many feet of land behind where the sea walls once stood is now vanished,"" Norman said Wednesday.  He said in their old community, many people live close to the water — and getting closer, as some homes that were once 30 or 40 feet away from the ocean now have its waves lapping about five feet from their fence lines.  ""We are getting more and more serious storms. We need to deal with that, we need to plan as a municipality for that,"" Norman said, and that means finding money to rebuild a stronger sea wall that can withstand the current intensity of storms. The winds from Friday's blizzard battered towns across the Bonavista Peninsula. John Fisher, who operates the Fishers' Loft Inn in Port Rexton, measured wind speeds of 160 km/h on his property, and figured the real speeds were even higher. ""We have a professional weather anemometer here, and you know it's all brass and all the right stuff, and I believe it's very, very reliable, but it only goes as far as 160, and it was hard against the needle,"" he said. ""We think we had a much stronger blow than that."" Fisher said the storm did bring deep drifts to Port Rexton — and Friday felt like ""living in a fog"" — but no permanent damage to the community. ""We looked at our roof from time to time and just wondered. But, no, everything was fine,"" he said, adding most of the houses in his rural community use a strong wood clapboard siding. He said local businesses quickly reopened after Friday's storm, and people in his community were well stocked. Twenty minutes north on the highway, the Town of Trinity Bay North — encompassing Port Union and Catalina — opened a warming centre at its fire hall after a prolonged power outage. Some buildings were left with damage as a result of the wind speeds, including the Union House Arts gallery located in the Sir William Ford Coaker Heritage Foundation buildings in Port Union. Jane Walker, who operates the gallery, said the high winds blew snow into the building's attic vents. She said the snow eventually melted, and started leaking inside. ""We had about two feet of snow get its way into the attic,"" she said. ""We had to tear out part of our ceilings in the studios to get it out and start drying out the attic."" No art was damaged, Walker said, as there was no exhibition in the leaking room. ""Both of the artists jokingly said that if their artwork had been damaged in that way they would have just gone with it,"" she said. ""It's all part of the experience of being on an artist residency during the megastorm of the century.""  Walker is asking homeowners in the area to check their attics for water damage. She said snow also made its way into the attic in the home of one of her board members. Walker works in Port Union but lives in Bonavista, so she saw the effects of Friday's blizzard in two communities. She was forced out of her home Friday, and when she returned, she wasn't faced with snow — but a wall of ice that blanketed her home, that she called ""beautiful."" ""I'm arty like that, I guess but it was gorgeous,"" she said. ""It was sparkling!"" She said her home took a beating, but the ice hasn't caused any permanent damage. ""It melts off. It's startled me a couple of times in the middle of the night hearing big chunks of ice fall off of the side of the house, but no damage, so I'm really lucky in that way.""

Government figures from 2019 reveal the Dawson Creek area has six caribou herds, but their numbers have declined from 800 to about 220 over two decades. Blair Lekstrom was appointed by Premier John Horgan nine months ago to bridge tensions between local groups, including backcountry enthusiasts and Indigenous nations, over government plans to save the threatened herds.   Lekstrom's role was to be an intermediary between the B.C. government and people in B.C.'s Peace region who feared saving endangered caribou would kill  hundreds of jobs in mining and forestry.  Hunters and snowmobilers  feared they  would lose their access to the backcountry. Now, Lekstrom says the B.C. government is refusing to listen. And so, he's quitting. ""It's staggering,"" he said of the NDP's position.  Lekstrom, now a city councillor in Dawson Creek, says he spent months speaking with people in the region, including municipal governments and industry. The province implemented an interim moratorium on the recovery program when Lekstrom produced a report calling for more local government involvement. But Lekstrom said all but one of the 14 recommendations he proposed to government have been rejected. ""You know, I would consider John [Horgan] a friend of mine. But you know we ... are at opposite ends on this one. I'm going to try and not impact a friendship ... but it is absolutely astounding to me."" Lekstrom said B.C. refused to allow elected leaders from the Peace have a say on a key working group, the Caribou Recovery Table, where major decisions were being made. And he was told the caribou plan that generated so much controversy would not change. ""The premier responded ... stating that there was no intent to change the document's text in any way,"" said Lekstrom. He said B.C. appears poised to proceed, without considering the significant socio-economic impacts on the northeast. ""It's unheard of in my political career,"" he said. Lekstrom calls himself ""an eternal optimist."" But he says he's not optimistic about the caribou initiative.  ""[With] no changes coming, I am not sure how the population up [in the Peace] here is going to handle this,"" he said. In a written statement to CBC, Premier John Horgan thanked Lekstrom ""for his important work."" Horgan said BC wants to protect both caribou and the ""livelihoods of people who live in the Peace."" He said government has been working hard to ensure local governments ""have a larger role,"" but his government can't unilaterally make changes to the caribou recovery plan, without the approval of their federal and First Nations partners.

Mohan Karki's parents, who don't speak English and require assistance to travel, were found almost 12 hours after being dropped off at a service counter at the Vancouver airport — just not by the airlines responsible for assisting them during their trip, WestJet and Cathay Pacific.  ""We were thinking they were somewhere in the corner of the airport ... not knowing where to go,"" said Karki. ""My parents told me, 'We never left this place' … 12 hours they were there. They tried to communicate with some other people, passersby, and nobody responded to them. Maybe they couldn't understand what they were saying."" On Feb. 23, Chhaya and Narayan Karki, aged 66 and 69, were on the final leg of a trip from their home in Kathmandu, Nepal, to visit their son and his family in Edmonton, with a stopover in Vancouver.  Mohan Karki said Cathay Pacific told him it delivered his parents to the WestJet customer service counter at the airport, and WestJet was to transport the pair to the gate for their final flight to Edmonton.  When his parents failed to arrive, a worried Karki spent hours on the phone trying to track them down. They didn't have a cellphone. ""For about six or seven hours, I kept on calling both airlines, but they never found my parents,"" he said.  Karki then called the RCMP. It took officers 20 minutes to find the couple, located just steps from the service counter. The couple had placards with Karki's name and phone number, in case of an emergency. No one responded when they tried to get help by holding them up, he said. According to an Ontario-based advocate for people with disabilities, services for those who need assistance travelling are ""unreliable and inconsistent"" because airlines are allowed to set their own rules — instead of being told to meet specific standards. ""It is appalling treatment … the regulator should make it clear that [airlines] can't pass the buck to each other,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. Thanh Phan shares that frustration; the same thing happened to his 76-year-old mother at the same airport. In August, Niem Thi Le, who has trouble walking and doesn't speak English, was left in a wheelchair for eight hours after being dropped off at the wrong departure gate by WestJet. Le was on her way home to Hanoi, Vietnam, after visiting family in Victoria. WestJet was supposed to connect her with China Southern Airlines for her next flight. ""My mom told me that the wheelchair attendant just left her there without talking to anyone.… I was shocked … this is a human being,"" Phan said. An employee with another airline eventually noticed Le sitting alone, found someone who could speak Vietnamese and brought the woman to the China Southern Airlines counter. That airline contacted Phan and suggested he call WestJet to find out what happened. He did, asking if someone could help his mother until he could get there himself. ""I said, 'Could you please help her give her some food and drinks.'... They said, no, they didn't do anything wrong and that's not their business,"" Phan said. He called China Southern Airlines back and it agreed to help, bringing Le a hamburger and a drink. Phan complained to customer service and WestJet apologized, saying it would review its internal process. But he said the airline never got back to him to explain what happened. WestJet also told him travellers who don't speak English shouldn't be travelling alone, he said, though they offered him a $100 travel voucher. ""It's very frustrating because they blame passengers, and they did not think that is a serious problem."" Both Phan and Karki are still demanding an explanation from the airlines involved in their respective cases.  ""We sincerely apologize for the stress and worry that these guests and their families experienced,"" WestJet's media relations manager Lauren Stewart wrote in an email to Go Public. ""The nature of these incidents is serious, and we are in touch with both airline partners involved to investigate and make enhancements to our processes to prevent this type of incident from happening again. We are also reaching out to the families involved.""  The airline says it provides mobility assistance to more than 900 guests per day. Cathay Pacific told Go Public it was sorry to hear what happened to the Karkis, adding it followed ""standard operating procedure"" when it delivered the couple to WestJet staff and exchanged wheelchairs. ""The proper turnover to WestJet was made by our staff. Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing this situation with WestJet and we will apply learnings from this experience to future transitions between our airlines,"" wrote Julie Jarratt, the airline's communications director. Lepofsky, who is blind, said he's had his own problems travelling. ""I dread entering Canadian airspace if I'm travelling alone … not because the service is always bad, but because it's not reliably and consistently good."" Airlines have a duty to accommodate passengers with disabilities under Canada's human rights laws, he said. But when that doesn't happen, it's tough to figure out where to turn for help. ""There are multiple agencies involved,"" Lepofsky said. ""The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Transportation Agency — and you could be kicked from one to the other, trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. ""The Canadian Transportation Agency, where you're often kicked to, does not, from the perspective of people with disabilities, have a good track record in this area."" The CTA says it's aware some of the standards are out of date and a binding set of rules is needed. Until now, accessible transportation has been governed by mostly voluntary codes of practice.  The agency has proposed new accessible transportation regulations for airlines and all travel providers. The new rules would be legally binding and impose penalties up to $25,000 for non-compliance. And if another proposed law passes, the Accessible Canada Act, that fine could jump to a maximum of $250,000. ""They need to make sure that passengers don't fall between the cracks,"" said Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency. Under the CTA's proposed rules, airlines would have to provide people who need assistance a place to wait, near personnel who can assist them and will ""periodically inquire"" about the person's needs. Airports would be responsible for providing assistance from curbside to check-in, while the airlines would be responsible from check-in to boarding.  Streiner said the proposed recommendations would have helped in both cases. The agency plans to have the final regulations published before summer and hopes to have the majority of requirements in place in about a year. ""Persons who require wheelchair assistance, including older Canadians, absolutely are covered by these regulations,"" Streiner said. ""We want to make sure that there's no confusion about who's providing assistance and that people aren't left without assistance."" As for Karki, he said that the next time his parents visit, he won't leave them in the hands of the airlines. Instead, he'll try to match their itinerary with other Nepali-speaking travellers. After hearing from Go Public, WestJet called Karki last week, promising an explanation once it looks into what went wrong. Phan said WestJet has yet to follow up with him, adding that his mother is now afraid to travel and will no longer come visit.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

212,Taylor C. Noakes,2020-01-15T23:26:45.604Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan: Welcome to Canada, but pay your own bills","This column is an opinion by Taylor C. Noakes, an independent journalist and public historian from Montreal. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. It's remarkably easy to become financially independent, as Prince Harry and Meghan say they want to do, when other people pay your bills. Doubtless this will be a crucial lesson in Ontario's new high school financial literacy course; there's no better way to keep your money than by not having to spend it. Just ask any Canadian billionaire, whose tax rates have decreased over the past 20 years while their share of total income skyrocketed over the same time period. It's remarkable, too, that news of Meghan, Harry and Archie's planned Brexit to Canada has really only led to a single central question: will Canada pay their security costs? Not ""why are we maintaining this antiquated, obsolete and fundamentally undemocratic institution,"" but rather how much more are we willing to fork over for Monarchy Lite? If the Sussexes are coming to Canada at least in part because they're looking to be more financially independent, they should pay their own security costs. Even without the estimated £82.4 million ($140 million Cdn) the royal family will receive this year from British taxpayers through the sovereign grant, the couple has an estimated net worth of £18 million and receives another £2.3 million annually from Prince Charles. What's particularly curious here is that the Sussexes are in fact doubling down on the monarchy even though they appear to be moving away from it. They're quite literally in the process of attempting to trademark ""Sussex Royal"" in an application covering Canada and Australia, as well as noted bulwarks of British monarchism the European Union and United States. So while they're ostensibly stepping away from their public functions as senior members of the royal family, there are no plans to move away from the fortune to be made from branding and marketing their royal likeness on everything from coffee cups to beach towels. In other words, they're not taking a step back from the monarchy, they're bringing the monarchy to Canada on a semi-permanent basis, seemingly as part of a major product launch. (This ain't your grandma's royal family, it's new and improved!) As much as we might be tempted to feel bad for the embarrassing elements of Harry's family, or the nauseating racism of contemporary British society directed towards Meghan, we mustn't forget the Sussexes are fundamentally a business for whom the taxpaying public pays most if not all of the bills. And though it may appear the couple are fleeing the salivating hounds of Fleet Street, they are in fact imposing themselves on a people they have little in common with. According to some poll numbers, about half of Canadians think our relationship with the royal family should end once Queen Elizabeth dies, and more than 60 per cent believe the royals should have no role in Canadian society and culture. The monarchy in Canada is a lot more than just the occasional visit and some ceremonial relationships between princes and military units. It's also the governor general, the lieutenant governors and several properties that serve as official royal residences, such as Quebec City's Citadel and Ottawa's Rideau Hall. The rough estimate is that maintaining the monarchy in Canada exceeds $50 million annually, a considerable sum to spend on ceremonial frivolities in a country that still has trouble providing safe drinking water to rural communities. Complicated as disentangling Canada from the monarchy would be, that's also quite a lot of money to spend on unelected officials with the power to disrupt the normal functioning of Canadian democracy. Cuddly newborns and photogenic princesses aside, the monarchy is a symbol of the genocidal imperialism that all but annihilated the rightful heirs and stewards of this land. Canadians pumping money into the monarchy in 2020 makes about as much sense as Americans who defend the Confederacy: just because it's historic doesn't mean it's worth celebrating or spending money on. Moreover, far from encouraging a greater appreciation of our national history, our fascination with the celebrity circus that is the British monarchy occludes the reality that anti-monarchists, like William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, were trying to sever our ties with the Crown a full 30 years before Confederation. That an unfortunate number of Canadians can more easily identify latter-day, second-tier foreign royalty than explain what the Rebellions of 1837/1838 were about is demonstrative that the monarchy is a bit of a historical black hole.  It's time to move on and for precedents to be set. Meghan, Harry and Archie are welcome to immigrate to Canada. They just have to get in line like everyone else, and prove they won't be a financial liability.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/meghan-markle-hideout-this-b-c-property-believed-to-be-where-royals-are-1.5427722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-and-prime-minister-giddy-about-harry-and-meghan-s-possible-move-to-b-c-1.5425727 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-family-jobs-europe-harry-meghan-1.5427405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,N/A
213,Anna Desmarais,2020-01-23T15:05:15.057Z,Hay River to host N.W.T.'s 1st Arctic Winter Games archery trials,"Twenty archers in the Northwest Territories are set to compete in Hay River this weekend for a spot in the Arctic Winter Games' first archery competition. Archery isn't an official sport of the games, but it could become one. The Arctic Winter Games International Committee is interested in incorporating other events, so for these games, for the first time, they approached a host city about their regionally important sports.  Ian Legaree, the technical director of the Arctic Winter Games' International Committee, said Sport Yukon and members of the Whitehorse Host Society in 2017 recommended adding archery and freestyle skiing to the 2020 sports roster. Legaree said the board chose to add archery because both small and large communities were interested in the sport. No one had recommended archery prior to 2017 because, as Legaree put it, it's still an emerging sport across Canada.  In an email to CBC News, a spokesperson for the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games confirmed that this will be the first time for archery in the games. So far, five regions out of nine have said they will be sending a team of archers to Whitehorse, including Northern Alberta, the N.W.T, and Yukon.  Greenland and the Yamal region of Russia will also send archers to this year's games. The N.W.T.'s team will be decided this weekend, after archers compete for the highest number of points over two rounds. Athletes at the trials will shoot 30 arrows each per round (known as a 300 round). The closer they get to the bull's-eye, the more points they get. Athletes will also be evaluated on their attitude and coachability.  At the Arctic Winter Games, the archers will compete over multiple days in individual and mixed team events, followed by a head-to-head elimination round.  Over the last eight to nine years, archery has been rising in popularity in the N.W.T., said Aaron Wells, executive director of Aboriginal Sports Circle NWT. To boost participation in the sport, the Aboriginal Sports Circle has held archery workshops in partnership with schools and gym teachers in all 33 N.W.T. communities.   This is not the first time the territory has sent archers to important sporting events. N.W.T. archers have participated in the North American Indigenous Games for at least a decade, and last year, four young archery athletes represented the territory for the first time at the Canada Winter Games.  Wells said archery has roots in Indigenous communities in the North — hunters used it to sustain their families.  ""There's always been some sort of interest in … bow hunting for generations in the territory,"" he said. Wells said the expected turnout of 20 athletes for this weekend's trials in Hay River is a good starting point that could show the international community that there's interest in archery.  Archery has been tentatively selected as a sport for the 2022 Arctic Winter Games in Wood Buffalo, Alta.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-archery-trials-nwt-1.5437084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/n-w-t-archery-tournament-takes-aim-at-growing-the-sport-in-the-north-1.4710270 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-dog-mushing-future-northwest-territories-1.5364048,N/A
214,John Gushue,2020-01-25T14:36:25.828Z,We had a stunning blizzard — but no Emergency Measures Organization,"If you go to the Newfoundland and Labrador government's web page for emergency services and click on News Releases, you get a 404. That is, an empty page, an error. By the way, the stream of news releases, advisories, statements and other material that one might have expected to see from Emergency Services doesn't exist on some other part of the government's website. It doesn't exist at all. In fact, to the surprise of some people, what used to be called EMO — the Emergency Measures Organization; you may remember former commissioner Fred Hollett as the voice of government emergency response for many years — is gone in name if not in function. What's left is now part of the Department of Municipal Affairs and Environment. Apart from what was said on Twitter or in front of media microphones, there has been precious little said, at least in an official capacity,  on behalf of the entire government. There's no criticism for the first responders and the others who dealt with the crisis — everyone from firefighters to phone operators, plow operators to utility workers — and the hefty burdens they carried. Some of them put their own safety on the line, especially in the most challenging hours.  The bigger problem is the absence of co-ordination. This blizzard has exposed some remarkable weaknesses within the provincial government, as well as how well municipalities were able to work together … or not. First, let's look at the Newfoundland and Labrador government's website. On Jan. 16, the day before the storm, government issued an advisory about storm preparation. Believe it or not, the government did not post a single news release for seven days. On Thursday, we were given a heads-up that Premier Dwight Ball would have something to say. Ball, of course, did talk to the media during the intervening days — as well as he should have. So did Municipal Affairs and Environment Minister Derrick Bragg. Bragg has come across as concerned, but it's also obvious that he is just a few months into his first cabinet job. What's been missing from the provincial government is this: a sense that someone there is in charge, that there was a co-ordinated response out of the gate. Instead, the government deferred to the individual municipalities. Surely the cities and towns are autonomous, but there was no single point of contact for them to go to, and the decision-making was hardly uniform. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen has pointed out during the week that it has been frustrating to have a piecemeal approach to a problem that not only extended beyond metro-area boundaries, but which actually covered a large part of eastern Newfoundland. (The harshest winds, for instance, were felt in Bonavista.) Other things have been exposed. For instance, the legislation governing states of emergency in St. John's is 35 years old. [In a prior version of this column it was mistakenly said that the city's emergency plan documents were that old, and that is not accurate.] But the biggest gap has to be at the provincial level. A number of us noted the absence of EMO or equivalent, especially in the early days of the blizzard and the aftermath. There was no obvious co-ordination, but we did have confusion. Independent MHA Paul Lane, whose district of Mount Pearl-Southlands straddles two cities, told us earlier this week about how confusing it was for him (presumably someone who himself would be fielding constituent calls) to figure out who was in charge of what. We did not have someone like former EMO commissioner Fred Hollett, a fire commissioner who stepped seamlessly into the emergency measures role when required. We had the City of St. John's saying pharmacies would close, and then we had Health Minister John Haggie saying they would open. We did not receive much technical information from a common source of authority. Instead, we needed to hunt it out — but more often had to rely on what a politician would tell us. (This is another stellar example, by the way, of the risk to the public's right to know that comes with the provincial government's stubborn habit of always having a politician handle interviews. Not that many years ago, we had access to subject experts. Now we must rely on non-experts and their ability to recall what they have been told.) An emergency operations centre, set up in MCP's building on Major's Path, opened on Monday — three full days after the blizzard started, two days after the military was called in. Even then, it did not provide the single point of contact to guide the province.  There are other gaps. The ""frequently asked questions"" section on the emergency services page is all about one subject: catastrophic flooding on the west coast, which happened two years ago.  The government at least was present on Twitter. The Department of Transportation and Works had excellent updates in the early stages, and it was valuable. Other departments followed suit. But as anyone who knows social media well can tell you, most Canadians never use Twitter. Many of the people who started an account don't use it. The audience for these tweets was not nearly as wide as people who love Twitter believe.  As well, it's fair to assume that many of the vulnerable people who were dug out of their homes by Canadian Forces troops this week are older and not on social media. (Community volunteers reported that many seniors do not have internet access.) The government's communications strategy — if there was one — did not meet their needs. The Emergency Services Act gives the provincial government the ability to call a regional emergency. For whatever reason, the Ball government chose not to do this.

215,Paul Palmeter,2020-01-23T12:44:40.090Z,Eagle watch draws birds and tourists to tiny Nova Scotia community,"If the eagles around Sheffield Mills could talk they would likely call Malcolm Lake the chicken man. When Lake pulls into the open Nova Scotia field with several dead chicken carcasses in buckets, dozens of large eagles can be seen in nearby hardwood trees anxiously awaiting his arrival. ""They know my vehicle and as soon as I get up there and open my door I can hear them begin to chatter away in the trees,"" said Lake. Lake collects dead chickens from several nearby poultry farms. After he throws the carcasses into the field the eagles keep their distance until Lake walks away. Then they slowly begin to approach the dead birds in the snow, before long dozens of eagles come out of the trees to feed. ""The most I've ever counted here was 92 eagles the week before last,"" said Lake. ""I've had up to 80 eagles here in the last seven days."" Lake feeds the eagles twice a day from late December to late March. He's excited for the 29th annual Sheffield Mills eagle watch which begins this weekend. ""It actually goes back to the '80s when the eagles were an endangered species in this county,"" said Lake. ""Back then the Nova Scotia government asked the farmers to throw out their dead chickens to give the juvenile eagles a better chance to survive the winter, the rest of the year they fend for themselves."" Last year eagle watch saw more than 5,000 people gather in the area to witness the majestic birds perform their amazing aerial displays as they descend on the field. Many of the visitors are amateur photographers who come from far away to see the eagles. Ron and Jane Todd are from Framingham, Mass. They honeymooned in Nova Scotia 40 years ago and this week they drove 12 hours so they could see the eagles up close. ""You don't often see something like this, so many bald eagles,"" said Jane Todd. ""We know we'll see something different each time."" The Todds are staying at a nearby bed and breakfast. Eagle watch is spread out over the next two weekends and has a big economic spinoff for the area. ""Eagle watch will bring in a lot of different people to the community that we don't normally see,"" said Jason deGraaf, who operates a local gas bar and convenience store in nearby Canning. ""It's going to be quite a busy two weekends for us."" The eagle watch festivities include pancake breakfasts and entertainment at the local community hall. All money raised will stay in the community. ""It's crucial for us, for our community hall, as it's our main fundraiser,"" said Meg Hodges, a member of the Sheffield Mills Community Association. ""It kind of keeps the lights on and the roof on and makes it available to our community, so without eagle watch we probably wouldn't have our hall.""

217,Anonymous,2020-01-24T14:00:00.623Z,This year's Arctic Winter Games will have a Pride House,"This year's Arctic Winter Games (AWG) in Whitehorse will feature something new — a ""Pride House"" for young people. ""It's kind of aiming to be a safe space for LGBTQI2S+-identified athletes, and especially for these Arctic Winter Games we want to focus on making sure that that space really is safe,"" said Mia Val, who works for the AWG host society and sits on its inclusion committee. Val said the first Pride House was at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, and they're now common at major sporting events. It's a first for the Arctic Winter Games, though. The host society partnered with Queer Yukon, a local advocacy group, to organize Pride House. It'll be set up in a semi-private space at Yukon College from March 16 to 20. Sofia Fortin, volunteer coordinator for Pride House, says it'll be a meeting place for young people. She's also hoping to organize some activities, like movie nights, and have other support and resources on hand. ""The main idea is that it's just a safe place for youth to come hang out in their off-time during the games,"" Fortin said. ""They know it's a place where they're not going to face discrimination, they're not going to face any bullying, they're just going to get lots of support and love for who they are."" Fortin says it could be especially great for young people visiting from small communities who don't always get to meet others like them. She also said it's not just for youth who identify as LGBTQI2S+. ""Certainly, allies would be welcome but basically anything that's unfriendly or hostile is not welcome,"" Fortin said. Volunteers for Pride House are still needed, she says. They would work a few hours at a time, either in the early afternoon, or late afternoon and evening.  Anybody interested needs to register as an official Arctic Winter Games volunteer before Jan. 31. All games volunteers must fill out a criminal record check form.

218,Jon Hernandez,2020-01-26T05:34:27.729Z,We spent a day taking rideshares in Vancouver. Here's what we learned,"After years of waiting, James Su didn't get to test out his Uber license the day the service launched in Vancouver. His wife wouldn't let him. ""It was Chinese New Years Eve,"" he said, laughing. ""[She] stopped me from going out."" But on Saturday, he made up for the lost time, taking to the road at 9 a.m. PT and barely finding time for a break for the next six hours. CBC News spent the day taking rideshares across Vancouver, chatting with drivers like Su, who say there is demand from eager passengers. Here's what we learned from taking rides around town. If you can't beat them — join them. That's the attitude of one Uber driver, who asked not to be named fearing repercussions from his employer at a Vancouver-based taxi company. ""Nobody can fight with technology,"" he told CBC News, which agreed to protect his identity. ""We couldn't get Uber here because of politics and power, but the funny thing is, nobody can fight it — there is nothing more powerful than technology. So, I wanted to be ahead of the game."" He said the choice was made easier by complaints people have about the taxi industry. ""I was trying to give very good service to people [as a cab driver],"" he said. ""But people have a very bad impression of the taxi industry, no matter how good you are."" ""I believe in the end, most of the taxi drivers are going to switch to this. They have no choice,"" he said. The Vancouver Taxi Association said Friday its members are extremely upset with the Passenger Transportation Board's (PTB) decision to approve ride-hailing. It says the new service will be devastating to the taxi industry and those who work in it. The association is pursuing a judicial review of the PTB's decision and asking the board to regulate the number of ride-hailing vehicles in the same way it restricts the size of taxi fleets. Lyft driver Donald Chang took to the streets shortly after the service officially launched in Vancouver on Friday. He said he worked for about three hours and made just over $100. He was hoping to have earned more. ""I don't think it's what I expected, the price isn't that high"" said Chang, who bought a new vehicle so he could become a rideshare driver. It's a sentiment echoed by James Su, who expects he'll average about $300 per day. ""I just [drove] a South African couple from Richmond to East Vancouver, and that only gives me $17,"" he said. ""It was a long trip — I think it should have been over $20."" Su would like to see a lower commission taken by ridesharing companies. He says Uber takes about 25 per cent of each fare. Lyft's driver fees vary. Ride-hailing services use demand pricing, as opposed to fixed taxi charges. Both companies are eager for more drivers and currently offering a $500 bonus for those who sign up. The shortage can be noticeable when hailing a ride, with wait times sometimes exceeding 15 minutes. Despite being available across Metro Vancouver, numerous Uber requests by CBC News expired before the app was able to assign a driver. Lyft has limited its operations to the core of Vancouver to optimize its service. Still, drivers say it's early yet for the service and expect there will be more cars on the road day by day — and plenty more passengers, too. ""I think it's going to get a lot busier in the future,"" said Chang.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/we-spent-a-day-taking-rideshares-in-vancouver-here-s-what-we-learned-1.5440805,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/surrey-uber-cease-operations-1.5440527 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/here-s-some-of-what-s-wrong-with-b-c-s-taxi-system-1.4755494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lyft-uber-vancouver-1.5439182 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/timeline-uber-vancouver-1.5439522,N/A

An Alberta biologist is refusing to be a gloomy Gus, however, and says there is an upside. ""There was a significant killing of mountain pine beetle in those areas as a result of these very low temperatures,"" Janice Cooke at the University of Alberta told The Homestretch. ""We are seeing patches where we see better than 95 per cent death, so less than five per cent are living in these areas. We will know for sure when May rolls around and surveys are done."" That's two years of help in the fight against those devastating little critters that ravaged much of British Columbia and parts of Alberta in the 2000s. ""From last year, we had a nasty winter as well, and we saw in those May surveys confirmation that a lot of beetles had been killed."" Currently in Alberta, mountain pine beetle are concentrated east of Jasper and around Hinton. ""We also see them trying to make their way into the jack pine of the boreal forest, in the east-central part of the province,"" Cooke said. The mountain pine beetle are tricky to deal with because they spend their entire life underneath tree bark, forcing the province to take a scorched-earth approach. ""The province surveys for beetle-attacked trees in the autumn, creates maps and sends crews in the winter who fall them on the spot and burn them to kill all the larvae.""

Been wronged and you're not the only one? Contact Go Public Shortly after his mother's death, he complained to Alberta's office of Protection for Persons in Care (PPC) , which recently issued a report, obtained by Go Public, describing Josephine's slow deterioration due to the staff's neglect. As a result, says the report, she experienced ""serious bodily harm"" leading to her death. ""I used to work in the financial world and for a lot less than a life we would have our licenses stripped if we … didn't follow protocol,"" said Dana, 57. ""Doesn't seem like the health industry has any consequences to something like this."" Markham, Ont.-based ​​​​​​Extendicare — one of the three largest nursing home chains in the country, with 96 homes in four provinces — has not been fined in this case. Alberta and Nova Scotia are the only two provinces in the country where regulators can issue fines when nursing home operators don't meet standards of care, although Go Public has learned that neither province has ever done this. A prominent seniors' advocate says financial penalties are the swiftest way to ensure nursing home operators keep residents safe, and she's urging other provinces and territories to grant regulators the ability to hit nursing home operators in the pocketbook when they fail in their duties. ""We need to ensure that there is a quick and unequivocal system in place to bring operators into compliance,"" B.C.'s seniors' advocate Isobel Mackenzie told Go Public. ""And I think that's fines — a monetary penalty."" . Dana says in the months leading up to his mother's death, he and other family members spoke to Extendicare Viking staff many times about her repeated bladder infections, which he says exacerbated her dementia symptoms. ""Her cognitive ability was greatly affected. She would sleep a lot — even fall asleep mid-sentence sometimes,"" he said. ""It was a lack of care."" He recalls helping his mother out of her wheelchair three months before she died and looking at its seat cushion. ""It looked kind of an odd shade of black,"" he said. ""I reached down and touched it and it was soaked in urine. It was as though you took a sponge out of the tub.""  He says when he and other family members asked staff to help their mother get to the bathroom, or change her foul-smelling diaper, it would often be hours before a nurse or aide responded. Another nagging concern for the family — that Josephine's water glass was often several feet away from her wheelchair. ""She couldn't reach it,"" said Dana. ""We always thought Mother was thirsty."" Family members raised their concerns two months before Josephine's death, in an October 2018 meeting with nursing home staff. They later learned those concerns were never recorded in their mother's care program.  ""The nurse said he was just too busy to do that type of paperwork,"" Dana told Go Public.  A month later, his mother became increasingly weak, was often incoherent and slept for long periods of time. On Nov. 22, 2018, he insisted that she be transferred to hospital. The PPC investigation into Josephine's death found:  The report also noted that, in the weeks leading up to her death, a computer system at Extendicare Viking issued a dozen alerts, noting changes in her condition —  but none was reviewed by a nurse or care aide. Among other things, the alerts signalled: The report does not include any details of interviews with managers, but a nurse told investigators: ""We often don't have time to read [the alerts] or review charting."" Another nurse said: ""We are supposed to check the alerts … but this is difficult [due to workload]."" Two aides also said they didn't have time to check the alerts. Do you work at a nursing home and have information the public needs to know? Contact Go Public confidentially Josephine's family doctor had concerns she put in a letter last February to Alberta's Ministry of Health. ""I do believe …  that Josephine's needs were neglected, not on purpose but due to staff shortages and lack in experience,"" wrote Dr. Marna Hagan, who went on to say that her concerns about staffing were not new.  ""This is not the first time I feel there was a lack in care and experience,"" at the Viking location, wrote Hagan. ""Shortage of staff and experience is lacking."" The province's investigation also reported concerns about staffing and training, noting that employees needed better education about nutrition, hydration and monitoring infections.  It also directed the facility to develop policies that ensure staff review and respond to computer alerts. It gave the facility until Feb. 29 to comply. If it doesn't, it could potentially face fines.  Dana points out that Extendicare is a for-profit business that answers to shareholders. It is partly funded by Alberta Health Services (AHS). ""They're caring about their profits … I don't think you can have profit and care in the same sentence,"" he says, adding that Extendicare's CEO received total annual compensation of about $4 million last year.  According to AHS, there were 273 allegations of abuse at seniors' homes it funds between April 2018 and March 2019. Most were determined to be unfounded, but many still prompted suggestions for improved care.  Extendicare's head office declined a request for an interview with Go Public, and would not comment on Josephine's case.  Instead, a spokesperson for the Viking facility wrote that it is ""very sorry"" about her death and that she is ""dearly missed by the team and residents."" Spokesperson Darlene Thibault also said Extendicare Viking has ""taken steps to address the situation"" and is working ""to provide the highest quality of care, dignity and safety to our residents."" Thibault would not elaborate on what has been done to ensure other residents aren't neglected, and would not address concerns that the home is not adequately staffed. Read Extendicare's statements to Go Public Outside of Alberta and Nova Scotia, the only options available to regulators when nursing home operators put residents at risk is to shut down the home — rarely done, as it can displace hundreds of people — or put it under government management — a lengthy and rare procedure, though it was recently done to three homes owned by Retirement Concepts in Victoria, B.C.  ""It's very frustrating,"" said Mackenzie, the seniors' advocate, who says it's time to introduce financial penalties across the country so nursing homes don't just focus on the bottom line.  ""You need to ensure in publicly funded nursing homes that the contracted operators are operating in the public interest,"" she said.  She points out that publicly funded nursing homes in the U.S. have been subject to fines since 2002. ""Just because something is unpopular with some people doesn't mean it isn't the right thing to do,"" said Mackenzie. ""And we have to remember that our duty is to the protection of the people who we have entrusted to that care home."" Dana says it's hard to deal with the grief of knowing his mother's death may have been preventable, and that Extendicare didn't pay a financial price. ""People go to jail for treating their pets in the same way,"" he said. ""It's pretty shocking that nothing [no fine] has happened.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

221,Anonymous,2020-01-26T09:00:00.880Z,Gatineau fire service falling behind in long-term care home inspections,"The Gatineau, Que., fire service has failed to meet its own inspection standards for publicly run residential and long-term care centres, according to documents obtained by Radio-Canada under access to information. The documents show the fire department is supposed to conduct inspections of the Centres d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée (CHSLD) every three years, according to municipal regulations.  However, half of the city's long-term care centres haven't been inspected in at least five years. One of those facilities,   CHSLD Renaissance, hasn't been inspected in seven years.   The Centre intégré de santé et de services sociaux de l'Outaouais (CISSSO), which manages the city's eight centres, says its fire prevention technicians carry out regular inspections, including annual checks of fire alarm systems and sprinklers. However, the fire service is also supposed to conduct inspections of fire alarms, sprinklers and evacuation routes, and also make sure buildings are accessible. The lack of inspections between September 2010 and September 2019 is a breach of municipal fire safety regulations, as mandated by Quebec's ministry of public safety. The documents show that CHSLD La Pièta in Hull has not been inspected since 2014, while the most recent inspection at CHSLD Renaissance in Gatineau dates back to 2012. CHSLD Vigi de l'Outaouais was inspected in 2017, but that was over seven years since its last inspection.  Inspections at residential and long-term care facilities are particularly important as it's more difficult for seniors to evacuate during emergencies. That's also the case for hospitals and private seniors' residences, which must also be inspected every three years in Gatineau. Inspections usually take three to four hours. Writing up documentation afterward, including issuing infraction notices, can take an additional six to eight hours. Gatineau fire inspectors have issued around 20 infraction notices to CISSSO since September 2010.  Only once in that time did fire officials confirm to the health authority that the infraction had been corrected. This was for an inspection follow-up at CHSLD Vigi de l'Outaouais. Anthony Savard, chief of prevention at the Gatineau fire service, says while seniors in Gatineau's long-term facilities are safe, his department is playing catch-up when it comes to municipal inspection standards. Savard said the delay in inspections is due to the major disasters that have recently hit the region — like the floods in 2017 and 2019 and the tornado in 2018 — which caused the organization to re-prioritize their resources.  Workers from 10 Quebec seniors' residences go on strike Savard added that since CISSSO has its own in-house fire prevention technicians, his 12-person team focused its limited resources on inspecting private seniors' residences. The lack of regular inspections, however, has seniors' associations in the region concerned. Marc Desjardins, director of la Table de concertation des aînés et des retraités de l'Outaouais, a group that represents seniors, said the delays are alarming and unacceptable. The Quebec Federation of Senior Citizens also said it wants more frequent inspections from the Gatineau fire department. Stéphane Pleau, the director of technical services and logistics with CISSSO, said annual inspections of fire alarms and sprinklers are carried out for each CHSLD by its own inspectors.   ""It is our primary responsibility. We are, of course, assisted and supported by the fire department, but we have our own much tighter protocol for doing our inspections,"" he said. In addition to the annual inspections, CISSSO also conducts regular inspections of the centres, ensuring the doors are properly closed and there's no congestion in the corridors, among other things.   This spring, the Gatineau fire department will table its risk assessment plan. The guidelines that require CHSLD inspections every three years may be under review during this process.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-fire-inspections-long-term-care-homes-1.5435609,[],N/A
222,Jorge Barrera,2020-01-23T18:32:00.589Z,"First Nations voices in support of Coastal GasLink project silenced by fear, says LNG Canada official","A senior corporate official with the joint venture behind an LNG terminal project that would eventually ship natural gas from the Coastal GasLink pipeline says First Nations people who support the project are being silenced by ""bullying and intimidation."" Susannah Pierce, director of corporate affairs for LNG Canada, the joint venture behind a planned LNG export terminal in Kitimat, B.C., said fear is keeping many First Nations people who are benefiting from the energy project from voicing their support.  Pierce penned an email to her friends and colleagues last Friday voicing her frustration with the tone of debate around the Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline that is facing opposition from the Wet'suwet'en nation's hereditary leadership. The email was posted on LNG Canada's website on Monday.  In the email, Pierce said she was ""shocked"" by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination's call last month to stop three major projects in Canada, including Coastal GasLink, until they get full buy-in from affected First Nations.  ""At the same time as the comments of the committee chairperson became known, I continued to hear about First Nations' members who fear speaking up in support of CGL as they are concerned about further retribution, bullying and intimidation,"" wrote Pierce. LNG Canada is a $40-billion joint venture to export natural gas from a terminal in Kitimat. Five companies from five countries created LNG Canada: Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi Corp., Petronas. PetroChina Co. and Korean Gas Corp. TC Energy Corp began the $6.2 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline project to connect to the LNG Canada terminal.  Tensions are again rising in northern British Columbia in the face of a court injunction against any continued physical obstruction of work on the Coastal GasLink pipeline. RCMP enforcement of an interim injunction last January at a fortified Wet'suwet'en checkpoint led to 14 arrests and there are growing fears of a repeat police operation.  ""What I am worried about is people being afraid to speak of the things they want because of the bullying and intimidation online,"" said Pierce, in an interview with CBC News.  Pierce said she wrote the email as a way to express personal support for First Nations people who back the project but fear speaking out.   ""There are people on the other side of that Internet and there are people … working in the field and there are people who are trying to make a living,"" said Pierce.  ""I want people to feel I understand that. I know what they are going through. I know that puts me out there. I am also trying to say I will stand there with you .... I am here to support you and you are not alone."" Crystal Smith, the elected chief councillor for the Haisla nation, whose territory includes the site for the LNG Canada terminal, said she's been barraged by personal attacks through social media calling her a ""colonizer"" and for supporting the oppression of her people.  Smith, whose nation has agreements with LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink, said the personal attacks began in force following the RCMP action in neighbouring Wet'suwet'en nation territory last year.  ""I see personal comments directed at myself, referred to as a colonizer and supporting suppressors of our people,"" said Smith.  ""Our nation has received a huge backlash in the last year in terms of our support of the project and being referred to as a sell-out."" Smith said she's also received gutter-level attacks accusing her of ""having affairs with CEO's of companies."" Smith shared one message with CBC News she received over Facebook messenger last January. ""You're an apple and a sellout,"" said the message, referring to the slur where someone is accused of being Indigenous on the outside and white on the inside.  ""This is colonization. You are stepping away from reconciliation and turning it to assimilation."" Smith said her nation struggled with the decision to support the natural gas project and it created tensions within the community and within families. In the end, she said the nation decided that it was in their best interest to support it.  ""I truly feel passionate and I truly feel that what we are doing is the right thing as a nation,"" said Smith.  ""For too many centuries our First Nation communities haven't had a solution as to how we are going to end the poverty and the suicide rates, not having hope for the future and staying with the status quo,"" she said.  ""Whether you are elected or hereditary, we have a responsibility to our people to improve the quality of life for our members, regardless of where they reside...and I believe the solution is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our people."" Karla Tait, who is director of clinical services at a healing centre at the Unist'ot'en camp which is part of the Wet'suwet'en nation opposition to the project, said it's the government that is creating the tensions.  ""It's also evident the province is fuelling and sponsoring what I would call factions to make it seem like there is disagreement among the rightful title holders on these lands,"" said Tait. Tait said the issue is not about economic development. ""This is a rights and title issue and if rights and title are respected here, it's going to benefit all First Nations."" Freda Huson, who is a spokesperson for the Unist'ot'en camp, said the issue is also about the authority of hereditary chiefs.  Huson said the federal and provincial governments, along with the pipeline company, are the ones who have created the divide within the Wet'suwet'en nation by ignoring the authority of hereditary chiefs.  ""Where are the documents that the hereditary chiefs gave up their responsibility for their lands to band councils? Do they have that? Does it show our hereditary chiefs signed a treaty giving that responsibility to the province or the federal government,"" said Huson in an interview with CBC News. ""These are the two entities that created the divide. We are not fighting our own people.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-lng-canada-1.5436837,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wet-suwet-en-coastal-gaslink-bc-supreme-court-1.5414131 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/gidimten-wetsuweten-unistoten-rcmp-injunction-1.4971999 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-indigenous-human-rights-1.5435854 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/human-rights-commissioner-indigenous-lng-1.5436954,N/A
223,Heidi Atter,2020-01-24T16:25:05.282Z,Storybook Dads lets fathers in Saskatoon jail read to their children,"Fathers at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre are able to read bedtime stories for their children thanks to a new program.  The Storybook Dads program films fathers, packages the footage on a DVD and has the father sign the book for their child. The book is then delivered in a new backpack with a pair of pyjamas.    The program is run by the Restorative Ministry Office at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saskatoon and the Saskatoon Correctional Centre.  Diann Block, cultural co-ordinator at the jail, said she was inspired by a similar program in the UK.  Block reached out to the Diocese and was introduced to Tim Yaworski, a volunteer who films the storytelling. Any inmate at the jail can apply for the program. The team will vet and decide who can participate.  Yaworski said he was hesitant at first, as entering the jail was outside his comfort zone.  ""I realised I've got a specific skill set that they needed and it was a way to force me out of that comfort zone,"" he said.  Literacy is important to keep families connected, Block said. ""When they come out, the kids will have an experience with their dad that they wouldn't have had before,"" Block said. ""For a lot of the men, it's a very moving experience."" If a man isn't able to read, Yaworski works with them to take their time and begin again, Block said.  Yaworski said it's moving to spend time with the men.  ""To see them reaching out to their children is really priceless,"" he said. ""One father, he came to me and he said 'My daughter watches the video every day. She thinks I'm a movie star now.'""  The jail also has an Inspired Minds program where dads could write their own stories just for their child, Block said. They've put it on twice since their All Nations Creative Writing Program started in 2011.  The Storytime Dads program does more than give children a new memory, it helps with rehabilitation, Block said.  ""It's been proven that if the men while they're inside can maintain contact with their families there's less chance of recidivism,"" she said. ""Any program like this, if it helps them not to come back that's a bonus.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/storybook-dad-program-prison-father-reads-1.5438956,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/alicia-mora-queens-volunteer-award-1.5135232,N/A
224,Ashley Heisler,2019-12-21T09:00:00.675Z,Canada should be going for gold-standard when protecting elite athletes from abuse,"This column is an opinion by Ashley Heisler, a second-year law student at the University of Ottawa and a former NCCA Division I athlete in women's lacrosse. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. The recent New York Times video featuring U.S. long-distance runner Mary Cain shook the track and field community in North America with a heart-wrenching story of physical and emotional abuse, and it has an all too familiar ring for those in sport in Canada. At 17, Cain signed a professional contract with Nike after becoming the youngest American track-and-field athlete to make a world championship team. Filled with potential, Cain says she was the ""fastest girl in America, until I joined Nike."" The seven-minute video provides an unadulterated recount of Cain's tenure training with Alberto Salazar's now dismantled Nike Oregon Project, during which she lost her period for three years, broke five bones and was burdened by suicidal thoughts. In Oregon, Cain says her male coaches insisted that, to be successful, she needed to be ""thinner, and thinner, and thinner,"" to the point where her body screamed for help. In Canada, physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuses have had severe and lasting effects on our nation's elite athletes, as well. In a federally funded, anonymous survey consisting of 1,000 former national team athletes this past year, for example, ""13 per cent of current and 20 per cent of retired athletes reported they had experienced suicidal thoughts,"" with only 15 per cent saying they had reported their experiences officially. Sandra Kirby, a professor at the University of Winnipeg and former Olympian who completed a study similar to the federally funded report, found that throughout Canada's elite sports management and coaching environments there is a general disrespect of the fact that athletes are people. In other words, viewing athletes as a tool or mechanism for profit, medal count, or reputation often takes precedence over their safety and well-being. Some are no longer staying silent. This past June, former Canadian Olympic skier Allison Forsyth launched a class-action lawsuit against Alpine Canada, claiming that the organization failed to protect its female athletes from sexual assault by former coach Bertrand Charest. When Forsyth initially reported the incidents to Alpine Canada, she says she was told to consider her allegations as she could be responsible for a loss of team sponsorship, and adds there was an implication that there could be effects on her own professional career. Others in sports in Canada have also gone public with accusations of inappropriate treatment of athletes by coaching staff or failure to properly protect athletes. Instances of ""abuse, manipulation and inappropriate behaviour"" have been alleged against a former coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer team, the Under-20 Women's National Team and assistant coach to the 2008 Canadian Women's Olympic Team, Bob Birarda. Among its conclusions, a report commissioned by the Whitecaps and submitted Dec. 13 found that the club failed to ensure Birarda was adhering to a code of conduct designed to protect players, and made 34 recommendations to improve player safety and complaint management.   Athletes in hockey, bobsleigh and rowing have also been coming forward with allegations of inappropriate treatment and behaviour. While formal litigation is an option and Canadian courts have established that coaches and their team staff owe a general duty of care to their athletes, the case law is limited. Many lawsuits are settled before they can be determined by a judge, leaving no room for binding precedent. The decisions that are published primarily deal with male professional athletes, and often fail to consider the additional barriers and vulnerabilities female athletes face, such as less funding, lower representation and gendered stereotypes. Further, they generally fail to address the psychological repercussions of abuse, even in cases stemming from physical acts. But outside the courts, while new policy protecting both female and male athletes pursuing professional and amateur sports careers in Canada is in its early stages, recent reforms suggest that measures safeguarding athletes are starting to change — and for the better.   Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science, Sport and Persons With Disabilities prior to the announcement of the new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 20, launched three major developments in order to combat harassment, abuse and discrimination at all levels of sport. First, an Investigation Unit supported by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) provides members of national sports teams with a third-party avenue to resolve disputes independent of an athlete's sports organization. Second, the Canadian Support Helpline was established as a neutral ""listening and referral service"" for athletes experiencing or witnessing harassment and discrimination in their sport. Third, Duncan committed to enforce a safety-valve mechanism, wherein federal funding will be withheld from national sports organizations if they fail to report incidents of discrimination and harassment, or don't utilize the SDRCC-supported Investigation Unit. For female athletes, specifically, Duncan took further steps towards ensuring their safety by appointing a federal Gender Equity Secretariat responsible for, ""developing, implementing and monitoring a gender equity in sport strategy."" This position is charged with facilitating initiatives to attract and maintain a greater female presence in sport, including athletes, coaches and officials, and aims to create a safer environment in which to train and compete. Members of national sport organizations will also be forced to undergo mandatory training in national policies around anti-harassment, abuse and discrimination before April 2020. It remains to be seen how the government will expand on these initiatives, as rookie MP Steven Guilbeault takes over the sport portfolio as part of his responsibilities as the new Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, the implementation of these early policies by his predecessor suggests an evolution in the culture of Canadian sport that is refusing to let competition harm athletes, and is helping to end silence around abuse. While the process of ensuring that athletes may pursue their goals without fear of abuse or harassment will hardly be linear, its current direction points to a promising future. As Olympic medallist Forsyth puts it, ""There is a strong sense of urgency to take action. We are not seeking perfection; we are seeking progress to ensure a safe, healthy sport environment for all athletes in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-sports-abuse-ashley-heisler-1.5363248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/elite-athletes-abuse-1.5125147 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur-sports-coaches-sexual-offences-minors-1.5006609 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-athletes-want-the-lip-service-around-safe-sport-to-stop-1.5117345 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes-renewing-call-independent-body-investigate-abuse-1.5378762 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abuse-sport-summit-1.5126753 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/shoemaker-canadian-olympic-committee-safe-sport-1.5128210,N/A
225,Erica Johnson,2019-06-10T20:42:18.198Z,Sunday school teacher says she was strip-searched at Vancouver airport after angry guard failed to find drugs,"A former Sunday school teacher who was falsely accused of being a drug smuggler, detained at Vancouver International Airport and eventually strip searched says she is still traumatized by the treatment and is calling for greater oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency. Jill Knapp's run-in with CBSA agents took place on Jan. 9, 2016, on her way home to Calgary, after visiting her husband in Mexico City. The 39-year-old says she is only now speaking out about her experience because she was diagnosed with anxiety after her airport ordeal. ""It was traumatizing,"" Knapp told Go Public, explaining that no one told her why she was red-flagged as she attempted to make her connecting flight in Vancouver. She said she has no criminal record and had nothing in her luggage that would prompt a closer look. ""Within two minutes he called me a drug smuggler, mentioned a strip search, and even said that he was going to send me to the hospital for an X-ray [to look for drugs],"" says Knapp. ""And that was before he even asked me any questions."" A request under the Access to Information Act by the CBC reveals other airline travellers have officially complained about mistreatment by border agents including screaming, using foul language, belittling them, using racial profiling and physical force. A civil liberties advocate says the complaints point to the need for independent oversight of the CBSA, the only major law enforcement agency in Canada that doesn't have external review of employee conduct. ""When border agents operate — either at land crossings, at airports — there is very little oversight,"" says Tim McSorley, national co-ordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, based in Ottawa. Knapp says she had collected her luggage when she was pulled aside and directed to ""secondary inspection,"" where she says a border guard became instantly aggressive. ""Out of nowhere, he actually raised his voice at me and said, 'I think you're a drug smuggler,'"" says Knapp. ""He said, 'I deal with people like you every day.'"" Knapp says she told him she had been visiting her husband in Mexico and that she had applied for him to live in Canada, but says the agent didn't believe her. She says the agent also didn't believe her when he asked what her job was and Knapp told him she worked with law firms as a software instructor. ""He actually scoffed at me and said, 'You don't do that type of work.' How would he know what kind of work I did? He was getting angrier and angrier."" The agent confiscated her phone and demanded her password. Finding nothing incriminating on her phone or in her luggage, the agent called in a drug-sniffing dog, which also didn't detect anything. Knapp says she was eventually placed in detention, but says she wasn't told why. She requested to speak with a lawyer and was told staff placed a call on her behalf, but she never heard from anyone. She hadn't eaten for 14 hours, but was only offered half a glass of water and no food. She says CBSA staff denied her requests to use the bathroom. Knapp was growing increasingly concerned about her parents, who were picking her up in Calgary. Her father is a heart attack survivor, and she worried about causing him stress. In desperation, she says, she offered to have the strip search the agent had mentioned hours earlier. ""At that point, I was so scared of what they would do if I stayed, it was like … if this is what it takes for me to leave, I'm going to do it.'"" Knapp says two female officers entered the room and told her to strip from the waist up. She told them she was a Sunday School teacher before complying. Finding nothing, they ordered her to remove her clothing from the waist down. ""They actually made me turn around, open up my butt cheeks and squat,"" says Knapp. ""I was just in shock. I didn't quite understand what it involved."" Knapp was finally released, and her phone returned. She found half a dozen texts from her anxious husband wondering where she was. CBC requested an interview with the CBSA, but the agency declined. In a statement, it said it couldn't discuss Knapp's case due to privacy concerns. After Knapp filed a complaint, she obtained internal documents through the Privacy Act, in which CBSA spokesperson Isabel McCusker wrote: ""The review of Ms. Knapp's clearance established that the [border services officers] involved in her examination followed standard procedures and guidelines."" CBC received over 1,700 pages of documents, most of the material heavily censored, after submitting a request under the Access to Information Act to find out how many other travellers have filed complaints about their treatment at the hands of the CBSA. We asked for complaints the agency classified under ""Officer/employee conduct,"" ""Questioning"" and other categories, for Vancouver International Airport, Toronto's Pearson International Airport and Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. The documents contain more than 800 allegations investigated by the CBSA about border agents and inappropriate behaviour, including the following: ""Officer commented, 'People like you who can't afford to travel always traffic drugs.'"" ""Threw me on the ground, yelling 'Don't resist'... [other] agents loved this and were laughing."" ""Hauled into the airport jail and treated like trash."" ""He called me moron more than once ... mocked my ... accent."" ""I was roughly frisked ... detained/held for questioning for seven hours."" ""He attacked me in the baggage claim area ... made anti-Semitic remarks."" ""He was pushing me with his hands ... started using foul language."" ""They broke my iPad."" ""Pulled out a knife in a threatening manner ... stared at me and then thrust the knife into the cardboard box."" The CBSA has a code of conduct, which says officers will act with ""professionalism, integrity and respect."" ""It's completely unacceptable and … kind of repulsive that people go through this when they're simply trying to travel to their destination,"" says McSorley, who reviewed the complaints. ""It's ... just common courtesy and decency that you wouldn't swear, use racist terms, use anti-Semitic terms, use physical force against someone who hasn't broken a law."" A CBSA spokesperson said during the calendar years 2016 to 2018, it investigated 821 allegations of misconduct by agents at all border crossings, of which 615 led to disciplinary action — including termination. McSorley's organization has been pushing for years for external oversight of the CBSA. ""There are millions of people crossing our border, flying into the country,"" says McSorley. ""The public deserves transparency from [the CBSA]."" For three years, the federal government has been promising to bring in oversight, and a bill is currently before the House of Commons. However, it has not yet received royal assent, and time is running out before the House breaks for the Oct. 21 federal election. Harassment, sexual assault among alleged misconduct by border agents investigated by CBSA In another internal CBSA memo Knapp obtained through the Privacy Act, as part of an internal investigation into the complaint she filed, an officer wrote that she was detained because her eyes appeared to be bloodshot — perhaps raising suspicion of drug use. Knapp says her eyes were red due to crying because she missed her husband. The officer also noted she was wearing bulky clothing, which Knapp disputes, saying she was wearing a fitted yoga outfit. Lastly, the officer questioned why she was flying through Vancouver on her way home to Calgary from Mexico. ""That was because I was using Aeroplan and that was the only route I could do,"" says Knapp. ""But the thing is, no one ever raised any of these concerns with me."" Knapp says she is speaking out about what happened to her to try to encourage Ottawa to change how complaints about the CBSA are investigated. ""I'm a safe person to talk about it because I'm a Canadian citizen … and I have no risk of deportation or anything like that,"" she says.

226,"Marilla Steuter-Martin, Loreen Pindera",2020-01-25T04:31:01.864Z,Quebec City man charged with woman's murder was on day parole for ex-spouse's brutal slaying,"A man charged with killing a Quebec City sex worker was allowed to have what the Parole Board of Canada deemed ""inappropriate"" sexual relations with women — despite the ""serious and worrisome risk.""  Eustachio Gallese had been allowed to meet women ""only for the purpose of responding to [his] sexual needs,"" since he was granted day parole in March 2019, according to parole board documents.   Gallese, 51, was charged Thursday with second-degree murder in the death of 22-year-old Marylène Levesque, whose body was found by police in a hotel room in Quebec City's Sainte-Foy neighbourhood on Wednesday evening. Police say Gallese turned himself in Wednesday, telling them where to find the body of Levesque, who was a sex worker, according to Radio-Canada sources. Gallese was sentenced in 2006 to life in prison with no chance of parole for 15 years for the 2004 second-degree murder of Chantale Deschênes who, according to parole documents, he struck on the head with a hammer and stabbed several times, enraged by her decision to leave him.  Gallese had been living in a halfway house since March and had been allowed to have his ""sexual needs"" met, his parole officer told the board at a hearing in September. The board raised serious concerns about that as a ""risk management strategy"" but nonetheless listed Gallese's likelihood of reoffending as ""low to moderate."" ""The Board expects the assessment that culminated in this approach to be re-examined,"" it said. It denied Gallese full parole but extended his day parole under several conditions.  He was required to report any relationships with women, sexual or otherwise, and was forbidden to consume drugs or alcohol. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel has asked federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to look into the case LeBel wants to know why certain conditions were granted to Gallese and whether his case workers were properly trained to evaluate the risk he might have posed to public safety. ""Once we have answers, we can work with [Blair] to put measures in place to keep a similar situation from happening,"" she said.  Véronique Hivon, the justice critic for the Parti Québécois, said the case shows a certain ""nonchalance"" in the way violent crimes against women are treated.  She said they require a specialized approach from all levels of the justice system, including the parole board. Sandra Wesley, the director of Stella, a Montreal-based sex workers' organization, said the case is ""very concerning"" because the parole board appears to have given Gallese tacit permission to hire prostitutes, knowingly putting them at risk.  ""They identified that this man was a potential danger to women and wasn't ready to have proper relationships with women but figured that he could then go see sex workers."" ""It really tells us what they think about us,"" Wesley said. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Blair said public safety is ""the main consideration in all parole decisions."" ""Violent offences by individuals on day parole are incredibly rare,"" the spokesperson said, calling day parole ""an important part of a process of gradual, supervised release."" Levesque's death is the first homicide in Quebec City in 2020. Gallese is due back in court Feb. 26.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/murder-day-parole-eustachio-gallese-1.5439020,[],N/A
227,Alana India Anderson,2020-01-13T21:39:43.390Z,Why a move to Canada makes sense for Prince Harry and Meghan,"This column is an opinion by Alana India Anderson, a British-Canadian entertainment journalist and editor currently living in London, U.K. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. In recent days, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been branded an ""ego-crazed"" leech, ""incredibly irritating,"" and ""insufferable"" by esteemed members of the British press. And yet they're shocked that she's made the decision, along with her husband Prince Harry, to leave the U.K. for North America.  On Monday, the Queen released a statement saying the Royal Family ""respect"" and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family, while remaining a valued part of the institution. ""It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the U.K.,"" it read.  Since the couple made their decision to ""step back"" from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family last Wednesday, the U.K. media has been thrown into a frenzy. How could they do this to the Queen? What does this new ""progressive role"" mean? Who will be paying for their security costs overseas?  But most importantly, why move to Canada? Having immigrated to Canada from London 20 years ago for a better quality of life, I know the appeal all too well. In fact, although I'm currently working in the media in the U.K., I still regularly visit the country that welcomed me and my family with open arms, so I'm well aware of the social and cultural differences. There's no doubt that Harry and Meghan would enjoy a relatively peaceful life if they relocate to Canada. Toronto is where Harry and Meghan started their relationship four years ago, and where she lived for several years while filming the TV series Suits. Besides familiarity, Canada offers a fresh sense of stress-free simplicity they are not afforded in the U.K. Not only is celebrity culture almost non-existent in Canada, but fascination with the Royal Family tends to take a far more friendly tone. In contrast, there's no escaping the paparazzi in places like London. While the U.K.'s reality TV stars relish the flashing bulbs of photographers, several celebrities will recall ""terrifying"" experiences of erratic driving and little to no privacy as photographers go to extreme lengths to get ""the shot."" This is because there is no governing body for paparazzi — it's a grey area. The paparazzi and tabloid culture prevalent in the U.K. is clearly something Harry is wary of. Last year, the Prince said that every camera flash ""takes him back"" to the tragedy of his mother's death in 1997, grief which he compared to a ""wound that festers."" And the media attention in Europe can be unrelenting. Kate Middleton and Prince William won £91,000 in damages in a French court verdict in 2017, for example, after topless paparazzi photographs of the Duchess were published in a French celebrity magazine. The couple said the incident was a ""serious breach of privacy."" It's telling that only one photograph emerged during Harry and Meghan's recent six-week Christmas holiday on Vancouver Island — an image they released on their own terms, showing Harry with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in front of a dazzling backdrop of water and mountains. Is it so wrong for Harry, who has not only grown up under the weight of media attention but also faced such tragedy in his life, to want some peace? After all, the couple who have put such a spotlight on mental health surely deserve to look after their own. Escaping the relentless pressure of media attention by itself isn't the only incentive for the family to leave the U.K.  Since their first meeting, Meghan's race has been the talking point of headlines adorning British tabloids. Toned-down prejudice has seen the Duchess described as having ""rich and exotic DNA"" and being ""almost straight out of Compton."" The fact that she makes mixed-race women, such as myself, feel more in-touch with their identity is merely overlooked. Despite 1.2 million people identifying as mixed-race in Britain, Meghan is often reduced to being an outsider. Meghan has openly expressed her struggle to adapt to British tabloid scrutiny, saying she ""tried to adopt"" the ""British sensibility of a stiff upper lip."" It's a struggle that now appears over, resulting in the U.K. losing a progressive and refreshing couple who are not only responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in tourism, retail and fashion, but also newspaper sales and website clicks. They wouldn't be the first members of the Royal Family to see the attraction of Canada. Speaking in Toronto in 2010, the Queen praised the ""vast, rich and varied"" country for ""inspiring its own and attracting many others."" And Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, resided in Canada from 1911 to 1916 and acted as hostess for her father, Prince Arthur, during his term as governor general. The Princess's portrait was even on the $1 banknote issued in 1917.  Of course, there's no guarantee the paparazzi wouldn't follow them, the way they did when Charles, Diana, William and Harry visited in 1991. But a move to Canada would likely mean at least a reduction in the media scrutiny of Harry, Meghan and Archie. And that spotlight is something Harry has tried to escape his entire life, a significant curiosity about his private life which he has admitted he has ""never been comfortable with."" And it could also see the Royal Family spread its wings and become an international brand in a country where, unlike the U.S., Harry and Meghan are less regarded as ""celebrities,"" but are undeniably extremely popular. Viewed from that perspective, Harry and Meghan relocating to Canada could be a win for their family — and the Royal Family.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harry-meghan-doc-media-1.5328618 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-harry-paparazzi-settlement-1.5138130 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5420966/royal-reporter-says-pressure-on-meghan-markle-is-typical-she-s-just-complained-more-1.5420972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025,N/A
228,Erica Johnson,2019-09-23T00:00:51.953Z,Banks tell dozens of customers they're to blame for thousands of dollars lost to e-transfer fraudsters,"A Manitoba man says marketing that claims people are protected when they e-transfer money is misleading, after fraudsters stole $3,000 and TD Bank said he was to blame. Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.  The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime. ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account."" Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements. Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves. ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive."" As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone. That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back. ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious."" He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate. TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""  Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions. The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.  Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer. ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.  They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.  In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.  ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating."" All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.  Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases: Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.  Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement. TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.  In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""  In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen. ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?"" She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted."" CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January. Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg."" He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm."" ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police."" Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police. ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner."" Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits. He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

229,Anonymous,2020-01-26T21:42:00.524Z,Quebec will invest $4.2M to make Place des Arts complex wheelchair accessible from Metro,"Within two years, the Quebec government is hoping to make Montreal's Place des Arts concert venue completely wheelchair accessible from the Metro system. Currently, a set of stairs separates Place-des-Arts Metro station from the tunnel leading to the performing arts complex. The STM is also planning to install an elevator inside Place-des-Arts Metro. Quebec Culture Minister Nathalie Roy announced Sunday the province will contribute $4.2 million to renovate and modernize the connecting tunnel, first built in 1966. ""We are sending a message. We have to make life easier for everybody, and have access to our wonderful shows at Place des Arts,"" she said. The staircase will be demolished and replaced by a long ramp. There are 8,127 seats available at Place des Arts for spectators with limited mobility annually, but only about 500 people take advantage of those seats. Roy said she hopes that number will increase once the venues, including the Maison Symphonique and the Salle Wilfrid Pelletier, are accessible from the Metro. As it stands now, people with reduced mobility can access those venues via the Ste-Catherine Street entrance, but not the Metro. ""There was a survey saying that 37 per cent of the population comes to the Place des Arts via the public transit. So we can increase that, and that's what we're gonna do,"" she said. Montrealer Linda Gauthier uses a wheelchair and says the current setup makes her feel ""excluded"" from arts and cultural events held at Place des Arts. ""I feel like a second-class citizen,"" she told CBC. ""For example, if you had a ticket, and you invited me to come to a show tonight and I [didn't] have a para-transit, I would stay home."" Gauthier said she's happy something is being done about the barriers that keep people with reduced mobility away. Meanwhile, the STM has set a goal of making 32 stations accessible by 2022. ""We wanted to make sure that when the station here is accessible, that Place des arts will be accessible too, at the same time.""

232,Vanessa Blanch,2020-01-24T23:23:27.593Z,'We're constantly asked for pictures': Teen researches why sending naked pics is now normal,"Kiona Osowski's Grade 12 research project started with a question, based on her own experiences as a 17-year-old teenager: why are girls so often asked for nude photos? ""I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it, but it's happening,"" she said. ""We're constantly asked for pictures or we're sent things without our consent."" Since September, Kiona has been looking more closely at why boys feel entitled to ask for nude photos, and why girls feel compelled to send them. ""This has become a societal norm and we need to start taking it apart."" Kids sharing nude photos 'before they even hold hands' worries counsellors, police In her research, she has discovered a perfect storm of media messages that she believes are ""toxic"" to teens who are growing up with phones in their hands 24/7. Kiona worked on her project under the supervision of psychology teacher Heather Gunn and sociology teacher Chris Evans. ""We're sort of naive as older people thinking, 'Oh, they've got this device and they're playing Minecraft,'"" Gunn said. ""It was an eye-opener for us. I don't understand their world and how, in many ways, they've been impacted from this new reality.""  As part of her project, Kiona has rewritten New Brunswick's Grade 9 and 10 personal development curriculum and has begun presenting her research to her peers at Moncton High. She said much of the material that's already being covered, such as internet safety and career planning is good, but it needs to be updated.  ""Nude photos, media exploitation of women, toxic male gender representation and violence-inducing media, porn and so many other issues are simply not talked about,"" she writes in her letter to officials at the Anglophone East School District. ""Many of the adults in our lives are unaware of the issues going on with our youth."" Kiona's research started with the way she and most of her friends feel about their bodies and how they look. ""You can sit next to your best friend and you know that she's thinking the same thing — that she doesn't like herself,"" she said. ""We're going through our Instagram and we see this skinny, tanned, blonde — this girl who only eats kale and goes to the gym every day and we think, 'Well why can't I look like that?' and 'Why can't I have that body?'"" In her new curriculum, students would learn about the editing of photographs that happens in some media, and how girls are often left striving for an ideal that doesn't exist. It also addresses the growing number of people with eating disorders. ""I could walk up to my friend and tell her, 'I haven't eaten all day,' and she'd be like, 'Oh my God, me neither.' And that shouldn't be a conversation. The conversation is, 'I haven't eaten all day,' and then someone should say, 'You need to eat something. That's not healthy for your body.'"" Kiona plays on her school soccer team and is part of a boxing club — two activities that make her feel ""strong"" and ""empowered."" She wishes someone had told her in middle school that feeling bad about her body was not normal. ""I just kind of went on with my life and I was like, 'Well, I can hate my body because everyone else does too,' so that's why I want to make it so it's not normal."" Kiona also looked closely at research around young men and the media. ""Guys watch a lot of movies, video games and porn … I've never seen a movie where guys walk up to each other and just hug,"" she said. In media, men rarely express emotion, which Kiona said has left boys with the belief that anger is the only acceptable emotion. ""In the media, men are seen as dominant, they're seen as sexually aggressive, aggressive in general and lacking in emotions."" In her presentation, she challenges the boys in her class to allow one another to express themselves. ""Like if your friend is having a hard day — support him, don't make fun of him. Create a community where it's OK to show emotion and challenge the media stereotype that it's not."" When she brings up porn in her presentation, Kiona said it always raises some eyebrows among her peers, but she believes the way women and men are portrayed needs to be talked about. ""There's this ideal that men have that they deserve certain things … a rich man with a nice house and a beautiful woman and when men don't get that in reality, they can become really frustrated because they don't know how to experience emotion."" Gunn points to her own course material, which includes research that suggests 80 per cent of young men in Canada between the ages of 12 and 18 watch porn daily. ""I've known that, but I didn't really think deeply about the many ways that impacts boys and girls,"" Gunn said. ""The damaging things that are happening that society is instilling in our young kids — we've got to talk about it,"" Evans added. Kiona hopes to present her new curriculum to members of Moncton High's parent school support committee later this month and also hopes to get an audience with officials at the Anglophone East School District. It's the first step as she tries to change the curriculum for the entire province. ""We need to keep evolving our education. We can't just stall out and say, 'Well we're just going to go with the flow — it doesn't work that way.'"" In the new semester that begins in February, Kiona plans to work with other students and make presentations to middle school classes. ""[Students] don't always want to hear from moms and dads and grown-ups. I think that they look to peers that they respect and they see themselves in and they're respect Kiona and those who will be working with her,"" said Gunn. The goal is to get students thinking more critically about the media messages that leave young women feeling insecure, and young men emotionally handicapped. Kiona believes her generation is smart enough to change the script, including those constant requests for nude pictures, that's playing out in middle schools and high schools. ""Once we start challenging the views that we're being brainwashed with and that the media keeps feeding us, then we can fix the relationships with ourselves and we can fix the relationship with each other as well.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/kiona-osowski-moncton-high-school-curriculum-gender-media-social-1.5430704,[],N/A

""There was a main pack that was going around, and it was intimidating and not healthy for the animals for this time of year, it's cold and, unfortunately, it's better for them not to be out around,"" said Hillier.  Three years ago, Sheshatshiu's public works department rounded up and euthanized problem dogs after several people were bitten by strays. Under new animal health regulations for the town being reviewed by the provincial Department of Municipal Affairs, all dogs will have to be registered with the town. Hillier estimates 80 per cent of dog owners already register their pets. The more who do, the easier it is for the town to identify a stray. ""We don't want anything happening to anybody's dog. If we get the dog, [owners] will have to pay a fee but it's for the health and safety of the dog and and our residents as a whole.""  Both North West River and neighbouring Sheshatshiu are working together to round up stray dogs. ""Our primary concern is the health and safety of residents, and  not only residents, dogs as well,"" Hillier said.  ""The population of dogs spike in cycles so since last summer it's been rising, and both communities, Sheshatshiu and North West River, we know that this is a problem. It's always been a problem.""  That's the reason for the communities' dog patrol, she said — not just safety for residents, but also for the dogs themselves, especially as freezing winter temperatures start to set in. ""I say 'patrol.' I don't like to use the word 'control' because it's for animal health,"" she said. While some loved the wandering canines, she said, they also cause a lot of concern. ""Our first problem are dogs that have never had a home,"" she said.   ""We had two packs of at least eight dogs. Now, they're not bad dogs, but no one wants to see eight dogs, big dogs, coming toward them. It's very intimidating. It's not safe.""  The town will focus on educating residents on registering their pets, as well as spaying and neutering, she said. ""We have a wonderful vet in Goose Bay, you know, a service that wasn't always there years ago, so I think spaying and neutering is a big part for any person who owns a pet,"" she said.  ""The next phase will be educating people to not be feeding strays and trying to find homes for them as soon as possible with support from the SPCA.""  All dogs will be held for at least 48 hours, said Hillier. So far, none of the dogs picked up have been claimed by owners, she said. ""The SPCA has been very supportive. Unfortunately some dogs aren't adoptable, so we've had to euthanize them,"" she said. ""Sometimes they'll have a bit of a temperament and those dogs are probably two or three years old now and didn't have a home.""  Hillier did not have exact numbers of how many dogs have been caught, or how many were considered unadoptable.

234,Logan Perley,2020-01-23T11:54:54.693Z,"Wolastoqi woman releases first children's book, plans for Indigenous-language versions","It took Gail Francis of Negotkuk (Tobique First Nation) years to turn an idea into her first children's book. But all that work comes to fruition when she releases Moonbeam on Monday. Moonbeam is a culturally based children's book about how a pre-contact Indigenous family names their child. The character Moonbeam is told the story of her naming while the family waits for another newborn baby in the village to be named. Francis is a former educator and now an autism resource consultant. She wrote the story of Moonbeam more than 15 years ago.  But bringing the book to life wasn't without its hurdles. Francis teamed up with her niece, Tara Audibert, an animator and filmmaker, who provided the illustrations. But the publishers they approached had a different idea.  ""One of the barriers for my aunt publishing this with a formal publishing house was that they all were like 'We're going to provide you with an illustrator, you can't bring your illustrator,'"" Audibert said.  ""Tara had captured the essence of Moonbeam, I really didn't want another illustrator,"" Francis added. Audibert didn't understand why so many publishers would walk away from a story by an Indigenous woman — illustrated by an Indigenous woman. She said there are probably only a handful in the field in the country. The aunt-niece duo decided to move in another direction with Moonbeam. ""She put it into publishers and then got some rejections,"" Audibert said. ""Then I said that I've self-published my own works and we could just do this."" And that's what they did.  Audibert created a logo and helped her aunt start her own publishing company. Francis Books was born with the intent to release Moonbeam.  Francis found one of the benefits of self-publishing is that she has the power to have the book translated into the two Indigenous languages of New Brunswick: Wolastoqey and Mi'kmaq. ""When I started school I didn't know in English, I had to learn English,"" Francis said. ""When I see the kids coming into school now it's the opposite. They're speaking English and trying to learn their language in school, so it's been a flip in terms of when I started my education."" Francis thinks it is important to recognize the Indigenous languages of each region. New Brunswick being the only officially bilingual province, she thinks that Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqey should be added to the official languages as well. Moonbeam already has Wolastoqey words sprinkled throughout the book, including terms of endearment such as ""t'us"" (daughter). But Francis said a full translation could be used as a teaching tool for a language at risk. ""If we could have the language out there available to them, so that there's resources out there that they could utilize"" Francis added. Francis said she has already had a few organizations and schools purchase several copies of Moonbeam to be used in their literacy programs or classrooms. Francis has plans to release a sequel to Moonbeam and wants the character to become the Wabanaki version of Franklin, the popular children's book series about a turtle. She hopes that she and Audibert can animate the story in the future, as well. Francis and Audibert will be having a book launch event for Moonbeam on Jan. 27 at the ARM Book Nook in Miramichi from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/aunt-and-niece-release-first-self-published-childrens-book-1.5436650,[],N/A

The project was two years in the making for Matthew Serge Guy, a London-based cat lover who raised $74,575.78 on Kickstarter to make it happen.  The approximately 170-cm tall bronze statue shows the French feline perched atop a globe and gazing toward the stars. It was quietly unveiled at the university near Strasbourg last month. ""I'd just like to thank the over 1,000 backers that came together to fund the project, and willingly put their trust in a somewhat naive person who's never made a statue before,"" Guy told As It Happens in an email. ""I think it turned out pretty well."" The statue was designed by sculpture Gill Parker, and forged by Sculpture Castings in Basingstoke, U.K. Félicette  — also known as ""Astrocat"" — was blasted 200 kilometres above Earth on Oct. 21, 1963, in a liquid-fuelled French Véronique AG1 rocket, and returned 13 minutes later.  It's not clear whether Félicette was purchased from a pet shop or hauled off the streets of Paris, but she was one of 14 felines put into training for a French space mission. While much has been written about the other animals of the space race — including Laika the Soviet dog, and American monkeys Able and Miss Baker — Guy says there's been little fanfare about Félicette. ""The space race [was] very much between the dogs in Russia and the monkeys in America,"" Guy told As It Happens host Carol Off in November 2017, shortly after he kicked off the crowdfunding campaign. ""The cat in Europe was kind of forgotten about along the way."" Whitehorse schoolteacher Emily Macht was so inspired when she heard Félicette's story on As It Happens, that she decided to tell her Grade 5 class about it. ""Kids at this age are really drawn to stories that involve animals, first of all, and this class in particular has a lot of animal lovers and specifically cat lovers, so I knew they would love it,"" Macht told As It Happens in December 2017. The students also wanted to honour the unsung space kitty, so they sculpted their own clay models of Félicette. ""Kids this age are also really drawn to notions of fairness and unfairness,"" Macht said.  Guy called the kids' sculptures ""magnificent creations."" On hand for Félicette's unveiling were Lilla Merabet, vice-president of the GrandEst region; astronauts Helen Sharman, Paolo Nespoli and Reinhold Ewald; and Philippe Jung, co-author of the academic paper ""Felicette, the only space cat."" If you'd like to see it in person, Guy recommends getting in touch with university officials first. ""It is a working university, and sometimes the hall Félicette is in is used for exams or other such activities, so it's not always accessible,"" he said in a Kickstarter post announcing the unveiling.""But with some notice, I'm sure they could accommodate you.""

236,Holly Conners,2020-01-24T22:22:36.910Z,"CBU prof says new approach needed to break addiction, incarceration cycle","A Cape Breton University sociologist says criminalizing drug use isn't working and a new approach is needed, one that includes more supportive communities. On Friday, Margaret Dechman presented her findings at the annual general meeting of the Ally Centre of Cape Breton, a Sydney harm-reduction centre. In partnership with CBU, the Ally Centre and the Cape Breton Correctional Facility, researchers interviewed 107 men who are or had previously been incarcerated. ""We really wanted to look at what are the impacts of criminalizing substance use, and really talk to people about the experiences of their life and what could have helped,"" said Dechman. Several of the people who turned out for the meeting had their own stories to share. Troy Matheson said he spent the last several years on the streets of north-end Halifax and did time in the Burnside jail. ""It's heartbreaking, cause once you get out, you're given a bus ticket for a city bus to get back and nothing else,"" he said. That led Matheson back to homeless shelters and into the cycle of addiction. ""Unfortunately, that's the lifestyle in shelters,"" he said. Poverty, employment and finding secure housing were some of the challenges cited at the meeting. For John MacEachern, who used drugs from an early age and lived on the street by the age of 10, incarceration became a safe haven. ""You're up against it on the outside,"" he said. ""You don't have the coping skills to cope while you're on the outside, so you return to what you know, right."" He said reducing the stigma of addiction would go long a way toward helping people in his position. Dechman agreed. She said having safe and supportive communities would be both preventive and a cure. ""Once you provide safety and security for people, they can make a choice,"" said Dechman. ""And without that, they really can't because they're just so consumed with dealing with that stress every day."" She said everyone in society has a role to play in making communities more supportive. ""When you're walking down the street, smile at somebody, speak to them, make them feel like they're a human being,"" said Dechman.

237,Kory Teneycke,2020-01-23T21:57:35.880Z,It's Stephen Harper's party — and he'll do what he wants to,"This column is an opinion by Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for prime minister Stephen Harper, manager of the recent Ontario PC Party campaign, and currently a partner at Rubicon Strategy. Teneycke has declared he will remain neutral in the federal Conservative leadership campaign and has recused himself from work Rubicon is providing for the MacKay campaign. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Even five years after his defeat, the presence of Stephen Harper still defines the Conservative Party of Canada. In any other party it would be a bit odd for a past leader to be so dominant in the race to replace his successor's successor. But not in this one. Only 17 years ago, it was a much younger, more ideologically strident Stephen Harper who forged a new party from the shattered pieces of the PC Party (which had become an Atlantic Canadian regional rump) and the Canadian Alliance (Preston Manning's failed effort to rebrand the Reform Party). As a Reform Party staffer and later as a Member of Parliament, Harper had always been a hardliner. Critical of Manning for his lack of conservatism and dismissive of those advocating the need for the two right-of-centre parties to merge. In running for the Canadian Alliance leadership, he was full of bravado about the ability of the CA to best the PC Party electorally. But in what would become a telling sign of his future approach to governing (best described as pragmatic, conservative incrementalism), in 2003 Harper adjusted course and engineered the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. On matters of party discipline, Harper would sometimes in half-jest quote Louis XIV: ""l'etat c'est moi"" (I am the state). Harper wasn't just the first leader for the first half of its existence, he was the Party. And everybody knew it. Even in departure he continued to maintain a low-profile but powerful role as a director of the Conservative Fund – the body that holds the purse strings for party operations and campaigns. His recent departure from the Fund generated headlines and speculation. Some ""unnamed sources"" have alleged this was to free him to attack potential leadership candidate Jean Charest. It is unlikely that was ever true, but given Charest's decision to not enter the race, it clearly is no longer a motivation. Even if Charest had entered the leadership he would have had to kiss the ring of Harper's legacy, and adopt positions similar to those of Harper on a range of issues — including conservative cultural issues such as gun control. Harper doesn't need to campaign for or against anyone in the party leadership race. Every candidate will be attempting to claim some degree of ownership or continuance of the Harper record, and quietly intimating that they have his private approval. There is no path to victory running against Harper's legacy. The decision to leave the fund is more likely, as National Post columnist John Ivison suggested, an effort to sidestep Andrew Scheer's expense account scandal – of which private school funding is rumoured to be only the tip of the iceberg. Harper has a near anaphylactic intolerance for expense account abuse. While he did get criticism for charging his personal stylist to the Party, Harper's legacy governing is one of transparency. His reforms brought in pro-active disclosure of expenses for cabinet ministers and their staff. And back in Reform Party days he was the alleged source for blowing the whistle on then Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's use of party funds to fix his teeth and purchase bespoke suits. Regardless the reasons for his departure from the Fund, it makes no difference. It is still Harper's party. It is the electoral coalition that he built that is the foundation of the party – not just nationally, but in provinces like Ontario as well. Fundraising letters sent on behalf of the party bring in the most money when sent under his name. Most telling, numerous polls demonstrate Harper continues to be the most popular potential leader for the Conservative Party – by far. He would easily achieve a first-ballot victory if he chose to enter the race (which I predict he won't). Of course, the Conservative Party will need to evolve. It was a mistake for the Scheer campaign to run on a mildly updated version of the Harper 2015 platform. But at its core, the conservative electoral coalition is quite strong. And that is thanks to Stephen Harper.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A

239,Perlita Stroh,2020-01-26T09:00:00.548Z,How 3D holograms and AI are preserving Holocaust survivors' stories,"Max Eisen, 90, has lived his life by stubbornly looking ahead. He survived losing his mother and siblings in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and survived the camp himself, by focusing on getting through each day one hour at a time. He survived a 13-day death march by willing himself to keep moving his body forward a step at a time. He emigrated to Canada and started a business and a family by refusing to look back at what he'd lost. Last month, though, he spent five full days in a studio in Los Angeles not only looking back, but going over every minute detail of his life for a high-tech project that will preserve his voice long after he's gone. ""I thought this was a very powerful tool, it was important,"" Eisen says. The tool Eisen is referring to is the New Dimensions in Testimony Program. It's part of Steven Spielberg's USC Shoah Foundation, which the director founded after making the film Schindler's List. For the past 25 years, the foundation has been recording the testimonies of survivors of the Holocaust and other genocides.  This new project, however, goes much further than simple recordings. Using proprietary technology, the USC initiative employs machine learning and artificial intelligence to create holograms of survivors' stories that audiences will be able to interact with and question for years to come. Eisen is the 25th person and the first Canadian to undergo the process, after another Canadian, Pinchas Gutter, piloted an earlier and less-polished version of it several years ago. The process starts on a Monday morning and goes straight through until Friday afternoon. Eisen, like others before him, has to sit in a chair in the same position and wearing the same clothes while a USC Shoah Foundation staff member peppers him with hundreds of questions about his life and experiences during the holocaust. The two are sitting in a specially constructed tent of green screens and surrounded by 26 mounted cameras that capture Eisen's responses from every angle. After the week of filming, the USC team begins the arduous editing process. They transform Eisen's week-long interview into an interactive hologram. The finished hologram will work with technology that allows users to ask it any question they want. The system will recognize words in the question and match it with an answer in its database in real time. Children and adults will essentially be talking to a person on a screen, who will look like they're listening to them and answering the questions in real time. ""When I first saw this, I sort of thought it was kind of eerie and this meant the end of life — you're only on a wall there hanging down now,"" Eisen says. ""But I've sort of come to realize this is a new technology and it could do a very big, important job."" For Eisen, participation in the New Dimensions Program is just the latest part of his personal quest to educate others about the horrors of the Holocaust.  For the past two decades, he has been giving speeches in schools and at community gatherings. He's returned to Poland many times with The March of the Living, a group that takes Jewish teenagers and adults on tours of concentration camps and ghettos in Poland. He agreed to start talking about his past only after retiring from his business in 1991. It was his granddaughter who first started questioning him about it when she began learning about the Holocaust in school.  ""I made up my mind then that I'm going to do this, I have to talk about it,"" he says. ""I did promise my father that I would tell the world what happened there, so it was time."" Eisen's mother and siblings were killed upon their arrival at the Auschwitz concentration camp in May 1944. He lost his father a few months after they arrived.  For months, he and his father had suffered on a gruelling work detail, often labouring for 10 to 12 hours a day and surviving on very little food. After his father was selected for medical experiments, Eisen never saw him again. Eisen credits his own survival to the mercy of the camp's surgeon, a Polish prisoner himself, after he was badly beaten by an SS officer. The surgeon kept Eisen in his clinic and put him to work as his assistant after he recovered from his injuries, sparing him any further labour. ""Of my entire family, over 70 people, I was one of three to survive,"" Eisen says,  Once he started opening up about his experiences in the Holocaust, Eisen has never stopped. His memoir, By Chance Alone, was published in 2016 and was the winner of 2019's CBC Canada Reads Competition. The endeavour, spreading the truth about what happened to him and those around him during the Holocaust, has now become his full time job. ""This is actually my career now,"" says Eisen. ""I was in business and I closed that book and I opened this book. And all these opportunities are just coming now and I don't refuse anybody."" His determination to educate as many people as possible about the Holocaust and the dangers of anti-Semitism is something he thinks is still relevant. This was reinforced when an image of him in front of synagogue promoting Holocaust education in 2018 was defaced with the German word ""achtung,"" which translates to ""attention"" — a word Eisen vividly remembers guards yelling at the prisoners in Auschwitz. Eisen admits reliving his past hasn't gotten easier, but says the work is too important for him to stop — and the feedback he gets from students keeps him going. ""They keep telling me, you know, 'I've been a principal in this school for 25 years, I've seen these students, they have a span of attention of 15 minutes, and they were sitting here for an hour and a half and they didn't blink an eyelash.' That's rewarding,"" says Eisen. Kia Hayes, from the USC Foundation, has been tasked with interviewing Eisen for the New Dimensions project. She and her team spent months researching every aspect of his past, a process that culminated in more than 1,000 questions for him. She says knowing Eisen could handle the gruelling interview process is why they selected him for the project. ""It's not just that the survivor can physically can sit for the five hours a day, five days a week, to tell their story. It's also, mentally and emotionally, are they able to? Do they want to? Do they feel comfortable sharing?,"" says Hayes. ""We want to know that we're not overburdening them with the amount of questions that we're asking, and that's really important to us."" The types of questions Hayes asks Eisen are interesting, too. Beyond questions about his childhood and wartime experience, her team has to think of what a child without much knowledge of history might ask of a Holocaust survivor in the future. So, questions like 'Have you met Hitler?' and 'Do you hate Germans?' are included, because of the fact that children are likely to ask them. ""They [children] are curious. They want to know things like that. So we need to make sure the questions we're building out include that level of curiosity,"" explains Hayes.  And Eisen is more than willing to answer all of those questions. He says it's essential that the stories of Holocaust survivors do not die with them, and the interactive holograms help keep the stories alive for future generations. ""It's amazing, who would've thought something like this would be possible?"" Eisen's interactive hologram is now in the editing stage and will be ready to be installed in museums and travel to schools in about a year's time. He says the experience was a once in a lifetime opportunity to preserve his legacy. ""That's why I keep doing this, and moving, and going, and talking. And this is what other survivors are doing — when we are no longer going to be here, there's got to be some other tools that these students and next generations will need to hear and see.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/holocaust-survivor-hologram-1.5436430,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/holocaust-survivor-in-famous-auschwitz-liberation-photo-says-rising-anti-semitism-scares-me-1.5429798 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/holocaust-survivor-talks-regina-saskatoon-1.5285538 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uvic-holocaust-graphic-novels-1.5434227 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rainer-hoess-auschwitz-holocaust-1.5348444,N/A
240,Catherine Cullen,2020-01-23T09:00:00.573Z,Online government survey on medical aid in dying sees record-breaking response,"The federal government has been flooded with messages from Canadians who want to weigh in on medical aid in dying. As of Wednesday evening, 229,281 Canadians had responded to the government's survey, which has been online for just a week and a half. It's an enormous figure — the largest number of responses the Department of Justice has ever seen for any public consultation. Even hot topics like cannabis and prostitution only netted about 30,000 responses each. CBC News asked Justice Canada whether it was aware of any organized campaign that might be pushing the numbers up. ""We will continue to monitor for any potential evidence of abuse, but to date no major issues have been identified,"" said a ministry spokesperson. One factor that could be driving the numbers is experience: more Canadians may now know someone who obtained a legal doctor-assisted death, said Susan Desjardins of the advocacy group Dying with Dignity. ""I believe that people want to have this choice,"" she said. In her own volunteer work with the group, Desjardins said, she's seen an increase in the number of requests for information about assisted dying. Her group is encouraging its members to participate in the online consultations. ""I would say there aren't very many people who want to die, but they want to die well and they want to die as much as possible on their terms,"" said Desjardins. The federal government said more than 6,700 Canadians have obtained medically-assisted deaths — but that figure only covers the period up to November 2018.  CBC News has requested newer numbers. Leaders in the Catholic Church also have been urging their members to weigh in. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops provides a link to the survey on its website. ""We weren't necessarily directing them or telling them how to fill it out,"" said Calgary Bishop William McGrattan. ""But [we're] giving them the proper understanding and context and knowledge so they might express their views with their faith in mind."" Bishop McGrattan said he worries that any expansion of access to medical aid in dying would affect the vulnerable, such as those with dementia or mental illnesses. He said he's also concerned about the tight timeline for public consultations. The survey will close on Jan. 27 at 11:59 PM PST. ""A two-week consultation I don't think gives it the importance that it should,"" he said, adding that a deeper discussion is needed before the law can be changed. The federal government is doing more than just the online survey.  Cabinet ministers have been holding closed-door roundtable meetings across the country on the topic as well. Officials are working quickly to meet a court-imposed timeline. A Quebec judge struck down a portion of the federal law in the fall. The portion of the law requiring that a patient's death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" to qualify for medical assistance will be suspended as of March 11. Justice Minister David Lametti has said he hopes to put forward new legislation next month. In 2016, a poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that 73 per cent of respondents believed it should be easier for Canadians to make their own end-of-life decisions. New data seen by CBC News that will be released by Angus Reid later this week shows that number has risen. It shows a ""hardening"" of opinion on the issue, said the polling firm's executive director Shachi Kurl. ""When you see consensus that is that strong on an issue, you know people are passionately engaged on it. They're paying attention. And in many cases, it's going to be something that has touched their [lives],"" said Kurl. Lametti has said Canadians' views on medically assisted death have evolved since the legislation was passed in 2016. Not everyone agrees. Grace Pastine of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, which advocates for fewer restrictions on medically assisted death, said that Canadian politicians are simply waking up to what the public already believed. ""The federal government has, in some ways, caught up to where the Canadian public is, and really where the courts have been for years now,"" said Pastine. She describes the current laws as providing ""layers and layers of safeguards"" on the procedure. People with diseases such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and Huntington's have a right to a doctor's help to die, she argued, and the new legislation should reflect that. Larry Worthen, executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Association of Canada, staunchly opposes the 2016 legislation. He said he fears some will choose a medically assisted death because they worry about being a burden to their loved ones, or because they feel lonely or isolated. ""We have to as Canadians come to grips with the fact that once we've opened Pandora's box in this way, there are going to be some unintentional repercussions,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medical-assistance-dying-survey-response-1.5434832,[],N/A

The Steinbach, Man., resident was on a trail near Whitemouth Lake, which is nearly 130 kilometres southeast of Winnipeg, when he saw car tracks, which seemed odd. ""It was about 15 or 16 kilometres in when I came upon the car that had broken through the ice, and in the car there was an elderly gentleman and two young children,"" Waldner said.  ""They were huddled up in blankets trying to keep warm and I asked them, 'What in the Sam Hill are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere?' and they said they're going to Toronto."" Waldner believes the children's parents were using their cellphones for directions and were misguided. The area has poor cell reception, he said. They apparently had tried everything to move the vehicle, but it wouldn't budge from the ice. They had been there for more than 24 hours, Waldner said. As a last resort, they left the safety of the vehicle in sub-zero temperatures to go for help. Waldner hopped back on his snowmobile to go look for them, and they're lucky he did. ""They were pretty much in a shutdown mode because they were so cold they couldn't walk anymore. It was -15 C. They were just wearing runners in six or seven inches of snow,"" he said. Waldner took off some of his layers for the couple to wear. He took them to a nearby warming shelter maintained by South East Sno-Riders and built a fire before returning to the car to pick up the children and the grandfather. Once the family was out of immediate danger, Waldner set off an SOS beacon, which the RCMP's Steinbach detachment received. Mitch Gobeil, the president of the Sno-Riders, said he and another member of the group were called by RCMP to help them get to the remote spot where the family was stuck. The group reached the warming shelter six hours after Waldner had taken them there. Waldner, who is an avid outdoorsperson, said the family is ""extremely lucky"" to be alive, partly because of the temperature, but also because of the wildlife. Bears are hibernating now, so they aren't a risk, ""but this area is just overridden with wolves. This could have been extremely bad."" The area is quite remote, too, so it's not likely another person would have found them, or that the family would ever have reached a main road to call for help. ""It was another 50 or 60 kilometres out to any road,"" Waldner said. ""You wouldn't have been found until spring maybe or something like that."" CBC News wasn't able to reach the family, but Waldner said they were grateful to be alive.

244,Liam Casey,2020-01-25T20:41:11.455Z,'My heart is going to bleed': Bodies of mother and daughter killed in Iran air disaster repatriated to Toronto,"Habib Haghjoo's girls are home. The bodies of Sahar Haghjoo, 37, and her eight-year-old daughter, Elsa Jadidi, landed in Toronto on Saturday, Haghjoo said of his daughter and granddaughter who were on the Ukrainian flight that was shot down by Iran forces earlier this month. ""It's going to break me badly,"" he said through tears. ""I know my heart is going to bleed inside, but I will be strong. I'll do my best."" The pair's remains were identified last weekend, he said, and Sahar Haghjoo's husband, Siamak Jadidi, resisted the Iranian government's repeated requests to bury them in Iran. ""We think the minimum right is to have my kids close to me and my family,"" Habib Haghjoo said. The Iranian government relented, he said. Imam Mahdi Islamic Centre's president, Daryoush Kari, confirms the bodies of Sahar Haghjoo and her daughter Elsa Jadidi are at the Islamic Centre right now and burials are to take place tomorrow. Habib Haghjoo spoke to his daughter nearly every day, even texting with her while the pair was on the doomed plane waiting for take off. She sent a selfie. Both mother and daughter were smiling — Elsa wearing a pink sparkly shirt, Sahar in a yellow and grey hijab. Time has stopped for Habib Haghjoo since the plane crashed on Jan. 8. He can't escape thoughts of his ""girls,"" as he calls them. The only reprieve comes at the pool of the local Y, where he swims 500 metres every day. Little things trip him up — he cannot stand using the past tense when talking about them. ""I don't say they did, I say they do,"" he said. ""I want to believe they are with me, but are just far away."" Habib Haghjoo and his wife left Iran in 1987 and moved to Ireland where he began working as a computer programmer. Sahar — the couple's third daughter — was just five years old when they left their home country. Her younger sister would soon be born in Ireland. One day while waiting for a meeting in Dublin, Habib Haghjoo decided to visit the Canadian Embassy. Inside he found a copy of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. ""I read it and sort of fell in love,"" he said. ""Probably that's a land I can raise my kids and family better."" So he applied for a visa and two years, in 1991, they moved to Toronto. Canada was in the middle of a recession that year, and Habib Haghjoo had thought he made a mistake. But his wife implored him to stay. So they stayed, settling in Richmond Hill, Ont. That's where Sahar met and became friends with Mina Mozaffarian, who is the principal of Wali ul Asr, an Islamic school in east Toronto that Elsa attended. ""I'm still in disbelief,"" Mozaffarian said. ""She (Elsa) was incredibly bright...She was one of our best readers."" Elsa's grandfather, like any proud relative, said she was going places. ""We say she'll be a minister, if not prime minister,"" Habib Haghjoo said. Elsa was the couple's only child, but Sahar had recently confided in Mozaffarian that she wanted another child. The school is struggling to cope with the loss, but a drawing by Elsa has helped soothe the pain and ease the difficulty of discussing her death with her classmates. A few months ago, Elsa drew a picture of heaven. After she died, a photo of the artwork began making the rounds at school. It shows a beaming Elsa holding a large white poster with the words, in letters the colours of the rainbow, ""Life in Heavin."" She drew three mosques: one of the mosque of the prophet's family, another with the words ""Pray Salah"" and the third that recognizes the Qur'an. Butterflies flutter near a palm tree with a bounty of coconuts. A creek flows along one edge. And a sun shines brightly on the entire scene. ""It does give people a little bit of comfort that she visualized something so wonderful that will be her reward to be in a good place,"" Mozaffarian said. The school's director, Syed Adil, said the image has helped the students. ""It provides us an opportunity to talk with students to live your life and make sure you're a source of kindness, just like Elsa,"" he said. Habib Haghjoo saw the artwork for the first time on Friday. ""I think both of them are laughing at us from Heaven,"" he said. The federal government has been good to Habib Haghjoo, he said, with Global Affairs calling daily with updates on their efforts to repatriate the remains of ""his girls."" ""I never was as proud to be Canadian as I am today,"" he said. ""I love, love, love this frozen soil. The weather is bad, but I love it."" He wants the entire country to come to the pair's burials on Sunday, which begins at 10 a.m. at the Imam Mahdi Islamic Centre north of Toronto, because he says Canadians have been so kind to his family. The centre has capacity for 4,000 mourners. For his part, he is trying to remain positive despite believing ""these beautiful souls were murdered."" ""This is their message,"" he said.

246,Adam Miller,2020-01-25T09:00:00.670Z,'It plays to our worst fears': Coronavirus misinformation fuelled by social media,"People collapsing in the streets of Wuhan, coverups of unreported deaths and travellers ""escaping"" quarantine in China at risk of spreading the coronavirus. If you've been following the outbreak on social media, you may have seen some, or more, of these types of claims.  But the truth is, they're completely unverified – and in most cases, flat out untrue.  Social media has completely changed the way in which information about a disease outbreak travels around the world and experts say it's not for the better.  ""When there's a lack of information and there's fear, rumours come in to fill that gap,"" said Alfred Hermida, professor and director of the journalism program at the University of British Columbia.  ""The reason people are sharing this is because they're trying to make sense of what is a really complicated situation and also something that is potentially worrying. The danger is that it spins out of control, because fear then takes over."" Hermida began tracking the rate at which information about the coronavirus has been shared on Twitter since coverage of the outbreak began late last month.  What he found was that there was little traffic around hashtags related to the coronavirus until Tuesday, the day the first U.S. case was reported, when the volume of tweets spiked.  Hermida's data showed about 25,000 tweets on Monday in the U.S., followed by over 80,000 Tuesday, close to 200,000 Wednesday, more than 350,000 Thursday and almost half a million on Friday alone.  ""Fear is a very powerful motivator here,"" he said. ""It's very easy to weaponize and for most people, it's very hard to figure out if something you see on social media is true or not. ""It plays to our worst fears."" One incident occurred Thursday morning, with the story of a traveller who reportedly ""escaped"" Wuhan and was heading to Toronto. The traveller was flagged to Toronto Pearson International Airport on Twitter as someone who should be quarantined.  ""This guy who escaped from Wuhan yesterday will be arrived at Toronto from Guangzhou today,"" one Twitter user wrote. ""Please quarantine him.""  The official account for the airport responded publicly, adding legitimacy to the claim and raising important privacy concerns. The information was also reportedly shared with border officials.  ""Thank you for letting us know!!"" the response read. ""We will share this information with Canada Immigration.""  For York University sociology professor Fuyuki Kurasawa, the tweet from an official source like the airport was troubling. ""I haven't seen anything like that and it seems to me to be a violation of that traveller's privacy, basic human rights and their right to be considered for fair treatment upon arriving at the Canadian border,"" he said.  ""I don't know if the person who was responsible for the Twitter account at Pearson Airport was aware of the potential violation of that person's human rights or civil liberties, but it certainly seems to be a case that's highly problematic.""  In a statement to CBC News, a spokesperson for the Greater Toronto Airports Authority said that it's not uncommon for the airport to receive information that needs to be reviewed to maintain passenger and employee safety.  ""The information had been shared widely on social media and blogging platforms before being sent to our account,"" Robin Smith said of the tweet.  ""The safety of passengers and employees is our top priority, and a response was posted to maintain transparency with concerned members of the public."" The responses from other Twitter users were indeed concerning.  ""For God's sake keep him away from us!!!!"" one Twitter user wrote.  ""We need to quarantine everyone on that flight!!"" another wrote.  But amid the panic, there was a clear lack of understanding of the nature of this coronavirus and the measures in place to prevent the spread of the illness. For one, it's not known how quickly this coronavirus spreads from person to person, or if it does so at a high rate.  Symptoms may also not present initially and, if this person did in fact leave Wuhan, they would have presumably done so before the quarantine of the city or after a comprehensive exit screening at the airport there. Other outlandish claims include reports that China's 5G wireless network could help spread the illness, or that nicotine could cure it.  ""Anything that's health-related, the challenge online is that it's so emotional,"" said Ramona Pringle, director of the Creative Innovation Studio at Ryerson University.  ""It speaks to our primal instincts about survival that people panic, people have an emotional reaction to it."" Pringle said a pattern with misinformation that goes viral is that the verified and accurate information never gets the same traction online.  ""It doesn't have the stuff that makes people want to share it. It doesn't have that shock and strong emotion,"" she said.  ""Maybe people end up seeing it, but if they see it, they're not sharing it. They're not spreading it, unfortunately.""  An example of this was a tweet that had huge engagement on Monday.  ""WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE #CORONAVIRUS AND HOW IT HAS ALREADY CLAIMED 4 LIVES,"" a Twitter user wrote.  ""AND THERE's THIS CHINESE KID IN CEBU WHO HAS THE VIRUS AND HOW THE VIRUS IS CONTAGIOUS BETWEEN HUMANS.""  Cebu, a province in the Philippines, has not had any cases of the illness to date.  Hours later, the same user clarified that the illness may not be the same as the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China, but that tweet was only retweeted five times.  Kurasawa, at York University in Toronto, says social media can amplify the fear that people have during an outbreak and decrease their ability to filter inaccurate information.  That can lead to a type of ""vigilantism,"" where people share personal information online, like in the case of the tweet the airport responded to, or confront them in the real world.  ""So you can imagine quickly that there would be targeting of people from specific ethnic or racial groups as a result of this, as potential carriers of a particular in this case of coronavirus,"" he said. ""And that's very worrisome.""  Kurasawa said he lived in Toronto during the 2003 SARS epidemic, and saw this type of racial profiling firsthand.  ""I was with a friend of mine who is Korean-Canadian and she happened to have a cold. She was coughing, and we were on the subway,"" he said.  ""And we literally had people who jumped out of their seats, got angry at her for being on the subway, said something and then jumped right out of the subway car as soon as it got to the next stop."" Former prime ministers Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien publicly ate at restaurants in Toronto's Chinatown during the height of the SARS epidemic to dissuade Canadians from this type of thinking.  This irrational fear and racist behaviour is nothing recent, but Kurasawa said it could easily happen again with the current outbreak.  ""The debate is going to be whether the message of 'let's remember the lessons of SARS' is going to win over the message of fear and panic, where people justified racist behavior because of their concern about their own health,"" he said.  ""That's the concern I think that a lot of people are having.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-canada-social-media-misinformation-1.5440334,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5438737 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-zoonosis-1.5440146 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/quarantine-coronavirus-1.5438652 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-coronavirus-cases-1.5439889 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562,N/A
247,Erica Johnson,2019-05-01T09:00:00.135Z,Bank employees angry regulator's report on sales tactics weakened after banks and government review drafts,"Several bank employees are speaking out, angered by recent revelations that a report on banking sales tactics was weakened after the regulator shared a draft copy with the banks and federal government. They contacted Go Public to reveal why they think upselling wasn't widely detected during a lengthy review of misleading sales tactics by the regulator — slamming the bank review as inaccurate, inappropriate and a PR exercise. The employees provided internal documents disclosing aggressive upselling they said isn't obvious and said they were frustrated by a recent Go Public story that showed a report released by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada last year had key consumer protections eliminated after early drafts were shared with the federal Finance Department and the big banks. ""When I saw the regulator gave the report to the banks, I couldn't believe it,"" a CIBC call centre employee wrote to Go Public. ""I had to reach out to you."" CBC has confirmed the identity of bank employees in this story, but is not revealing them to protect their employment.  The regulator told Go Public it gave banks a draft report so they could identify factual errors. The review was conducted in 2017 and culminated in a report released on March 20, 2018. The FCAC's handling of its bank review is grounds for a public inquiry into the regulator and Canada's financial services, says the Small Investor Protection Association (SIPA), a consumer advocacy organization. ""It's proof that the Department of Finance is complicit with the FCAC and is deceiving the public,"" SIPA president Stan Buell told Go Public. The CIBC call centre employee says she was one of the people interviewed by the FCAC as part of its review.  The regulator interviewed some 200 bank employees at various branches of BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD, Scotia and National Bank as well as 400 more employees — some of whom, worked at banking call centres. ""That whole interview was an exercise in public relations,"" she says. She says during the interview, she wasn't transparent about the pressure to meet sales targets, because she worried the process wasn't confidential.  Been wronged? Contact Erica and Go Public team ""Did I tell them we were pushing sales hard? No way,"" she says. ""How did I know that wouldn't get back to someone?"" She says she has sold things to help the bank's bottom line and meet sales targets, but has made it seem as though it is in the best interest of the client. ""At every telephone banking level, we are trying to sell to the client."" She says she had to vent, after learning the regulator's report was weakened, after early versions were sent to banks and government. ""It just made me really angry, reading what went on behind the scenes,"" she says. In an email to Go Public, CIBC's director of public affairs Trish Tervit says the bank ""supplied complete org charts"" to the FCAC.  ""The bank did not select which employees were interviewed as part of the FCAC's industry-wide review,"" wrote Tervit. ""Putting clients at the centre of all we do is our priority every day. We have a strong, client-focused culture and we continuously review our business to ensure we do what's right for our clients."" A Scotiabank financial adviser says he thought it was inappropriate for the FCAC to let banks see the draft report.  ""The banks shouldn't have had any say in it, in any way,"" he says. ""That's shocking to me."" He says his sales targets have sharply increased since last November. He says employees are upselling customers simply to meet sales targets, but that much of that harm would be impossible for the regulator to detect. He provided a screenshot of an internal website, showing that the higher an interest rate an employee quotes a customer on a mortgage, the more sales units they earn towards their target.  ""They [customers] don't know they could've got a lower mortgage rate,"" says the financial adviser. ""I don't know how upselling would ever be tracked."" Another example of upselling he said the regulator couldn't detect is the way employees are encouraged to move clients away from investing in GICs and steer them into mutual funds, which provide guaranteed annual fees for the bank. To meet sales targets, he says he pushes mutual funds because he gets double the amount of credit. ""That can be harmful to customers,"" he says, ""because a mutual fund might not make sense."" In an email to Go Public, Scotiabank director of Canadian banking communications Patricia Hsiung wrote, ""Any reports that Scotiabank has set aggressive sales targets are inaccurate and misleading. Scotiabank remains committed to delivering an exceptional, transparent and trustworthy experience for our customers that prioritizes our relationships over products."" She also wrote that the bank considers ""customer feedback from more than one million surveys yearly"" and is making, ""great strides in driving towards industry leadership in overall customer satisfaction."" Another Scotiabank financial adviser working in a different city also contacted Go Public to say he was disturbed to see the regulator's report was weakened after it went to government and the banks, and that the regulator's claim that it did not find that bank customers were widely harmed — is not accurate. He provided documents showing his sales targets had significantly increased as of last fall. ""The pressure is enormous,"" he says. ""We're lying to our clients. Upselling all the time. You don't want to do it, but if you don't, you'll lose your job."" He says the regulator wouldn't know his manager tells him to gloss over the fees attached to a mutual fund. ""People will back out if they know there's risk involved, or fees,"" he says. He says he also increases credit card limits because he's under pressure to hit sales targets, but the FCAC wouldn't be able to tell that either, by looking at files. ""If they [bank customer] have an existing card with a $5,000 credit limit, I'll say, 'I see you're pre-approved for $10,000, let's attach that to your file,'"" he says. ""I don't ask the client if that's a good thing for them, in case they say no. I need to make points for my sales target."" News that the banking regulator provided draft copies of its review into aggressive sales tactics to government and the banks has prompted renewed calls for a public inquiry into financial services and the FCAC from the Small Investor Protection Association. ""I really think the government needs to listen to the voices of the people, to understand what their needs are and the impact on their lives, due to the lack of investor protection,"" says Buell. ""The FCAC should be providing that, but is not."" In a statement released earlier this week, Buell said an independent inquiry is necessary because ""Canadians are entrusting their hard-earned money, savings and futures with what should be trusted institutions and individuals."" ""There appears to be a far too cosy relationship between the banking industry, the FCAC and the Finance Department,"" says Buell. Go Public asked Finance Minister Bill Morneau about claims that the report was weakened after he saw it. ""Obviously, it's always important for us to take a look at how the banking sector is working,"" he says.  ""And I'm confident the FCAC did a good job."" Regardless of whether or not a public inquiry is called, one of the Scotiabank financial advisers who reached out says he has a message for banks, and for bank customers.  ""They [the banks] need to stop being so greedy and ripping people off,"" he says. ""And when people go to the bank, they shouldn't trust what we say. We're under pressure to sell, but we can't tell you that."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

248,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:21:46.948Z,New virus could trigger travel sector woes akin to damage from SARS in 2003,"A deadly new virus that emerged in China is raising concerns beyond the public health sphere as experts warn about the potential economic cost of a global outbreak that is already drawing comparisons to the deadly SARS epidemic 17 years ago. Transportation and tourism companies have seen declines in share prices amid travel warnings and restrictions from governments around the world hoping to avoid a repeat of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which cost the Canadian economy an estimated $5.25 billion. At least 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected by the ailment called novel coronavirus, whose early cases are linked to a market in Wuhan in central China. The World Health Organization postponed until Thursday a decision on whether to declare an international emergency over the outbreak of the flu-like illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, including one case in the United States. ""The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering, in negative GDP terms, if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,"" Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp, said in a report. The travel sector has already started to feel the hit as shares of four North American airlines that fly to China, including Air Canada, fell on Tuesday amid growing anxiety about the viral infection. None of the airlines fly directly to Wuhan, but their Chinese partner airlines do, and some passengers transfer from a Chinese carrier to a Canadian one, offering the potential for the virus to spread here. Shares at the three biggest U.S. cruise lines have also fallen, with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. — which boasts a major Chinese presence — dropping more than four per cent this week. Analyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital pointed to the past for clues on the market volatility, propelled by ""an unknown level of potential disruption."" ""History suggests shares may be in for a rough ride,"" he said of airline and tourism stocks in a research note. He recalled jittery stock movements after the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as well as with H1N1 influenza in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. ""These larger-scale epidemics can have a more pronounced near-term impact. However, once a better understanding of the magnitude of the spread and severity was understood, stock prices recovered quite sharply in all three cases within months,"" he said. The extent of the epidemic so far still falls well short of the spread of SARS, a virus from the same family as coronavirus that spread from China to more than two dozen countries — including Canada. SARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide, killing close to 800, according to the World Health Organization. The disease sickened about 438 Canadian patients and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area. SARS cost the country $5.25 billion and about 28,000 jobs, according to a 2014 report by Kai Ostwald, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. The damage came in large part from fear-based shifts in consumer behaviour rather than higher medical expenditures, Ostwald said. ""Specifically, fear of contagion prompted widespread aversion behaviour, in which people significantly reduced activities that put them in close proximity with others. This included not only things like flying and eating in restaurants, but also activities like workplace and school attendance,"" he wrote. Hotels in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Canadian outbreak was centred, lost out on an estimated $39 million in revenues in April 2003 alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission. Less traffic through the city's Pearson airport spawned some $220 million in losses, according to the Conference Board of Canada. More than 800 bus tours were cancelled by the end of April — when the World Health Organization issued a one-week travel advisory for Toronto — with an economic loss of up to $6 million. Air Canada wouldn't speculate on the potential impact from coronavirus. In 2003 financial reports, it said passenger revenues decreased in part due to lower demand for travel resulting from the SARS crisis, particularly in the Pacific market that ""was severely adversely impacted with large reductions in traffic and capacity."" Chang Hoon Oh, a business professor at Simon Fraser University, warned against alarmist reactions to relatively small outbreaks. Canadian authorities are now more prepared for SARS-like viruses, he said. But he also noted that the number of annual visitors to Canada from China has shot up, growing by a factor of 10 since 2000 to 757,000 travellers in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. On Tuesday a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from China was diagnosed in the Seattle area, making the United States the sixth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, uncertainty over how deadly and transmittable the new virus may be has amplified concerns, especially on the cusp of the annual mass travel surrounding lunar New Year, which begins this week. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says she immediately contacted her counterparts at the provincial level upon hearing of three potential cases of the new virus that were investigated and ruled out. ""They in turn have notified their front line in terms of their health system,"" Tam said on a call with reporters Monday. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the SARS epidemic in anticipation of possible cases. Canadians are at low risk of contracting the illness, Tam said.

Edmunds, previously the ordinary member of Postville, was voted into the position Tuesday at the Nunatsiavut Assembly in Hopedale by assembly members. The position was left vacant when former first minister Kate Mitchell resigned after the government said she inserted herself into an issue that was outside her purview. The role of first minister comes with many responsibilities, including housing and transportation issues within Nunatsiavut. Edmunds says although navigating those issues will be difficult, he's trying to find the best direction to take.  ""It's going to be a lot of work necessary to advance both of those issues. Obviously we need to hold the province at task on the issues we've encountered around our marine services,"" Edmunds told CBC's Labrador Morning on Wednesday. ""It's clear that we're in a housing crisis especially in Nain and Hopedale. We're doing our housing and needs assessment to figure out the best direction and investment we need to take going forward.""  Edmunds' resignation of his ordinary member status to become first minister has led to a shuffling of positions within the Nunatsiavut government.  Carlene Palliser is the minister of education and economic development, Greg Flowers is the minister of lands and natural resources, and Tony Andersen is the minister of finance, human resources and information technology. Edmunds said he was initially reluctant to step into the position as first minister, but he's motivated by the people he serves.  ""I always ask myself the question, and I think every official asks themselves the question, why are they doing it?"" he said. ""And I think at the end of the day, you're trying to offer something to your community, some small part of yourself and you want to try to improve things.""

250,Michael Gorman,2020-01-25T14:27:54.180Z,Feds end talks that could have seen N.S. buy land for golf course development,"The federal government is no longer negotiating with Nova Scotia's Lands and Forestry Department for the sale of surplus Crown land that could have become part of a proposed golf course development. Lighthouse Links Development Company wants to build as many as three golf courses in Little Harbour on the province's Eastern Shore. As part of that proposal, the company is trying to buy Crown land from the Nova Scotia government. The province was also negotiating, on the company's behalf, to buy 17 hectares of land Ottawa deemed surplus. Had the province planned to use the land for a public purpose, it could have had the property for one dollar. Because the golf course development doesn't fit the category, the two levels of government were considering a sale for $167,500. But a spokesperson for Public Services and Procurement Canada recently says those negotiations are off. ""Public Services and Procurement Canada is in discussions with [Environment and Climate Change Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service] on the transfer of the land,"" Helena Sergakis said in an email. ""If finalized, the property on Nova Scotia's eastern shore would remain in the federal inventory. The Province of Nova Scotia has been notified."" Chris Miller, executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, said he is delighted, but not surprised, by the news. ""The Trudeau government has been a leader on land conservation in Canada and it would have been shocking to me if they had sold off an ecological hotspot for a golf course."" Negotiations will continue between the province and company, however, for 285 hectares of provincial Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. Last March, the government removed the land from the pending legal protection list in the Parks and Protected Areas Plan. The move allowed Lands and Forestry to enter into negotiations with Lighthouse Links, which hopes to acquire the land to merge it with property the company already owns in Little Harbour. Miller and others have expressed concern about the land being delisted without consultation. Even after the move was complete, Owls Head remained listed on the government's website as pending protection for about 10 months. But a spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said Friday that public feedback on the matter would be considered before any deal is complete. As part of the letter of offer between the province and company, Lighthouse Links is required to develop a public engagement plan. It must be reviewed by the department. In an email, the company's lawyer said they are early in the planning stages for public engagement. ""My client will be looking for opportunities to engage with key stakeholders and the community as this proposed project proceeds, particularly as it relates to protection of the environment,"" said Sean Glover. ""Lighthouse Links remains committed to working with the community and government to preserve the legacy and beauty of the Little Harbour community."" Before a sale could be finalized it would need to be approved by the provincial cabinet. A spokesperson for the province said feedback from the public would be considered as part of those discussions. But Miller said he takes no comfort in the process because the government did no consultation before delisting the property. ""I don't trust that they'll do the right thing,"" he said. He and others worry the development would destroy an ecologically sensitive area that is home to several endangered species and a globally rare ecosystem. Miller said the outcry over the potential development also shows that people aren't OK with Crown land along the coast being sold when so little of Nova Scotia's coastline remains public. Earlier this week, Miller's organization set up a website that allows people to send a letter to Premier Stephen McNeil calling on him to protect Owls Head and keep it in public hands. ""Already 1,000 letters have gone in,"" said Miller. ""That's a very large response in a very short period of time.""

251,Joanne Chianello,2020-01-24T16:20:05.446Z,"SNC-Lavalin's 'poor' LRT bid should have been tossed, evaluators found","SNC-Lavalin was awarded the $1.6-billion contract to extend Ottawa's north-south Trillium Line last March even though the team assembled to assess the bids reached a ""unanimous consensus that the proposal should not be considered further in the evaluation process,"" according to documents released by the city Thursday night. The SNC-Lavalin bid failed to include a signalling and train control system, had no plan for snow removal and, at one point, appeared to believe the trains that run on the Trillium Line were electric, not diesel. SNC-Lavalin's winning LRT bid under auditor's microscope today The evaluation team concluded the bid was a ""poor technical submission throughout,"" and that ""resolving all of the major issues identified in the submission would be a lengthy and likely impractical process."" It was also critical of SNC-Lavalin for not being able to provide a plan for using the Trillium Line's existing fleet of Alstom LINT diesel trains in the future — something the other two finalists, Trillium Extension Alliance and Transit Link, were able to provide. The technical team called the omission a ""fatal flaw."" On Oct. 3, the team concluded SNC-Lavalin's proposal ""failed all four technical categories."" CBC Ottawa first reported back in March 2019 that SNC-Lavalin failed to meet the minimum technical score of 70 per cent that appeared to be required for a firm to continue in the competition, but still managed to win it. In August 2019, the city finally admitted it was true. SNC-Lavalin had failed to score 70 per cent not just once, but twice: the company, operating under the name TransitNEXT, scored 63 per cent; the team was directed to rescore the bidders, but SNC-Lavalin still only scored 67 per cent.   A secret clause in the request for proposals (RFP) allowed the city's senior management team to wave a bidder onto the financial round, even if that bidder didn't score 70 per cent in the technical evaluation. The city's senior executive team exercised this discretion — without knowing the identity of the bidder, they say — following the advice of Geoff Gilbert, a Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer hired by the city to oversee the procurement of the contracts for LRT Stage 2. Contrary to the technical evaluation team's advice, SNC-Lavalin's bid was allowed to move to the next phase of the evaluation process: the financial scoring. Because its bid was so much cheaper than its competitors, SNC-Lavalin was the put forward as the preferred proponent, and council approved the contract in March 2019. Ottawa officials say the SNC-Lavalin bid offered taxpayers good value. And last November, the city's auditor-general found that the city had broken no rules in awarding the contract to the Montreal-based engineering giant. Weeks after CBC Ottawa requested the technical evaluation team's presentation on its scoring, the city released them Thursday at 9 p.m., two hours after a marathon emergency meeting of the transit commission. Although the city had already released the scores for SNC-Lavalin, the newly released documents shed light on what led the evaluation team to fail the company in two rounds of scoring. On Oct. 3, the technical team presented its findings to the city's bid steering evaluation committee (BESC), a three-member team that oversaw the procurement for LRT Stage 2. The members of the committee included Gilbert, a Deloitte finance expert Remo Bucci and Simon Dupuis, a procurement officer for the city. On Oct. 10, a different Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer — Martin Masse — called a meeting with the team and told them to review their scores based on numerous written questions from the BESC. The committee was concerned the evaluation team had considered details in its scoring that weren't explicitly asked for in the RFP. After the technical team reviewed its evaluations, the scores of all three finalists rose slightly, but SNC-Lavalin still didn't make 70 per cent. And the evaluation team's responses to some of the BESC questions appear quite damning. For example, BESC questioned the failing score for the systems integration management plan, which only required a ""high-level description.""  The technical team responded: ""A high-level description should not include inaccurate information, such as references to elements that do not form part of the project scope of work, e.g. a catenary system, traction power substations … nor should it omit critical City tasks such as the integration of fare control equipment in the stations."" ""Catenary systems"" and ""traction power substations"" are parts of electric train systems — the Trillium Line is a diesel train system. ""This demonstrates that the proponent lacks understanding of the scope of [the] works,"" according to the evaluation team. Among other glaring problems, according to the technical evaluation team, was SNC-Lavalin's complete lack of a train control system in its bid. The RFP did not demand that bidders provide a specific supplier of a train control system, but it did require ""a narrative"" of a ""signalling and train control solution."" SNC-Lavalin gave no description of any kind of solution and stated only: ""At the time of the technical submission we are still finalizing the option selection process."" The documents also revealed the identities of the five people on the city's technical evaluation team. One familiar name on the team is Michael Morgan. He's currently the city's director of rail construction and often responds to media questions regarding Confederation Line problems. Morgan had a different job when he was on the evaluation team back in the fall of 2018.

253,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-24T17:04:04.837Z,Trudeau appoints constitutional lawyer Marc Gold as government leader in the Senate,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tapped Quebec Sen. Marc Gold for the position of government representative in the upper house — the top job in the Senate. Gold will be the government's point-person in an increasingly independent upper house — tasked with ushering government legislation through a fractured chamber that is no longer defined by a Liberal and Conservative duopoly. Gold, appointed by Trudeau as an Independent senator in 2016, was a well-regarded constitutional lawyer and scholar before he was named to the upper house. Early in his career, he trained federally appointed judges on constitutional law and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Gold replaces Ontario Sen. Peter Harder in the top job. Since his appointment, Gold has voted in lockstep with the Liberal government. A CBC News analysis found his votes in the chamber aligned with the government position 100 per cent of the time. Gold also sponsored key pieces of government legislation, including Bill C-59, a bill that overhauled the national security regime. He served as the Independent Senators Group's (ISG) liaison or whip, the group's vote-counter. ""Sen. Gold's long record of personal and professional achievement, together with his commitment to promoting human rights and Canada's regional diversity, will help us find common ground in the Senate as we invest in and protect our communities, create good middle class jobs and fight climate change,"" Trudeau said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with him to build a better Canada for all Canadians."" The role of Senate government leader — or, as the Trudeau government has styled the position, ""government representative"" — is a difficult one. In years' past, the government leader was selected from the benches of the party in power. The leader could rely on his or her caucus colleagues to pass government legislation in the Senate. Since the introduction of an independent Senate, passage of government bills has been less certain because the government representative no longer sits as part of the government caucus. Gold will have to negotiate with five separate caucuses and leaders to see that government bills are passed in a timely manner. In addition to his legislative priorities, Gold will pick up where Harder left off on further reforms to the Senate. Harder had pushed for the creation of a ""business committee"" to schedule debates on bills and also advocated for an independent, outside audit committee to keep tabs on Senate spending — measures that failed to materialize in the face of opposition from Conservative senators.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-picks-marc-gold-1.5439110,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-senate-point-man-ethics-code-don-meredith-1.5404104 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-harder-senate-point-man-political-appointees-1.5403028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senate-strip-don-meredith-honourable-title-1.5391315,N/A

According to figures released by Statistics Canada on Friday, New Brunswick's legal cannabis retailer recorded sales of $3.47 million in November, a 4.8 per cent increase over October and 14.6 per cent better than last November. None of the other Atlantic provinces posted a month-over-month increase in sales in November, according to Statistics Canada — with Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador each recording sales declines and sales remaining flat in Prince Edward Island. Cannabis NB has been offering lower pricing options for consumers in recent months, which it credits for the growth in business. ""We've been able to offer competitive pricing, with our per gram price going as low at $3.30, tax in, on promotions,"" said Cannabis NB spokesperson Tom Tremblay in an email Friday, explaining the improvement. ""This has attracted new customers and more consistent traffic in our stores.""   This week, Cannabis NB was advertising loose cannabis buds for as little as $5.33 per gram on selected brands if a consumer buys 15 grams at a time. That's 33 per cent cheaper than its lowest price offering — $8 per gram for 15 grams — during the week it first opened in October 2018.  It's cheapest pre-rolled joints, which were once $7.50, now start at $5. But it may be too little too late for the Crown corporation. Late last year, Finance Minister Ernie Steeves announced the province would privatize cannabis sales following poor results by Cannabis NB during its first fiscal year and, earlier this month, eight organizations were identified by the province as potential private operators. Better financial results at Cannabis NB will not derail that process, but Steeves said if the province comes to believe keeping Cannabis NB is a better deal than disposing of it, that option will be considered. ""Should the negotiations fail to yield a compelling offer that we are satisfied with, government can walk away and continue to seek efficiencies with the current public sector model or look to another private sector model,"" said Steeves in a statement Friday about improving sales at Cannabis NB. November's sales are the latest in a series of improving results for Cannabis NB, which should only get stronger. In the last week of November, a police crackdown on ""illegal"" retailers in New Brunswick promised to shake free more customers for government stores and in December popular edible cannabis products, including chocolate, gummies and other candy products, began arriving for public sale. Those point to stronger future sales, but it is unclear if the organization has become profitable yet.

255,Pegah Salari,2020-01-16T18:50:22.772Z,OPINION | Tragedy broke Iranian community's heart. An outpouring of love will help it heal  ,"I was standing on the second floor at the Saville Centre, watching the team of volunteers prepare the stage about three hours before Sunday's memorial.  Baskets of flowers were being moved around and large framed pictures of the victims of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 were being placed in front of the podium.  Even from that distance, I could see the faces of the victims. It was as if they were watching the volunteers work.  Nasim Rahmanifar's picture, with her beautiful smile; I could imagine so vividly how she would be one of the people helping, if her face was not stuck in that frame forever.   How could a smile that beautiful be trapped forever inside a wooden frame? The picture of Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two little girls fit so effortlessly among the flowers. My goodness, if Dorina or Daria were not gone, they would have been too young to attend this memorial! That is a piece of reality I don't have the strength to focus on. A few feet away, in yet another wooden frame, Dr. Shekoufeh Choupannejad and her two daughters Sara and Saba Saadat were standing side by side. On the far left side, Elnaz Nabiyi's photo somehow looked like the only one who was watching me as I looked at them from above. I cried in silence all through Sunday: getting ready as the emcee, in between the speeches, listening to the tributes, walking up and down from the podium. I cried as I watched people coming in, as I hugged friends and families, as I looked at the non-Iranian crowd who showed up to pay their respects even though they likely didn't know anyone.  A green room was assigned to the speakers and dignitaries; again, I cried as soon as I stepped into the room.  Going in, I wondered if my professor from back when I was a student would remember me.  Dr. Joseph Doucet, now dean of the school of business, saw me and came forward. Before I knew it, I was crying in his arms. It was as if I had graduated a week ago. It's amazing how 12 years can feel like a week and a week can feel like months. Sunday's memorial was a beautiful event.  And I'm not thinking that just because everything went well. The presence of people is what touched many grieving hearts.  With a loss this big, there is no relief. Nothing can help but time. And time doesn't always move like a river, especially not now.  Looking down at the main floor, watching the crowd come in, I thought to myself, ""I wish I could tell you, one by one, how much it means to see you here."" Going down the stairs for sound check, I passed by the media in the room. A CBC camera tech waved at me; I went down the stairs in tears.  How supportive everyone has been, every reporter, news anchor, radio host, freelance writer that I met after this tragic event. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did all these people become my friends? And friend is an understatement. What is the word for a person that you just met, who looks you in the eyes and makes you believe that you are not alone? I looked at the people, Iranian and non-Iranian, sitting side by side. It looked like a freshly knitted scarf, meshed like one piece. I thought, did we always feel so connected, so much like we belong?  When I went behind the podium to start, I felt a little tremble inside. I could see the first words that came out of my mouth, floating like snowflakes, dancing so calmly.  I looked at the crowd and at my words floating in front of me, and all of a sudden I felt so strong.  These are my people, all of them, Iranian or not. I knew that in my heart.  As O Canada was being sung, speaking in front of them didn't seem so hard. I only found out on Monday how many of my friends and co-workers had either attended, or watched, the memorial. Now, a week after the crash, our hearts like broken ceramics, we know it's time for us to speak up.  To glue ourselves back together, one piece at a time, with resilience and all this shared love — like kintsugi, the elegant ancient Japanese art of mending pottery.  The Iranian community has formed a new bond with Canada. This tragedy did break us apart but the love and support we received glued us back together, even stronger now. And like kintsugi, we will slowly heal, and with every day that goes by, we will become closer to our hosting country.  Not ashamed of our scars, we understand that our wounds are what makes us, us. It was –35 C on Sunday, and I believe I speak for every Iranian in Edmonton when I say we had never felt so warm. This column is an opinion.

256,Inayat Singh,2020-01-23T23:08:46.165Z,Alberta's looming multibillion-dollar orphan wells problem prompts auditor general probe,"Alberta's energy minister is faulting the previous government for allowing the number of oil and gas wells left behind by bankrupt companies — known as orphan wells — to grow to the point where the province's auditor general is now examining how the problem got so big. ""Considering the previous NDP government took no action on the issue, it is unfortunate that the auditor general now has to intervene,"" Sonya Savage said in an email Thursday.  The comments from the United Conservative Party minister came after CBC News reported on the audit earlier on Thursday.  There are currently 3,406 orphan wells scattered around the province, usually on the properties of rural landowners, where they lie untended. There are another 94,000 inactive wells in the province, with the worry that many of these may become orphaned as their owners struggle — and taxpayers could be left with the bill. The auditor general's office will look at whether the province is doing enough to prevent wells from becoming orphaned in the first place, and whether it is prepared for more to be added to the list due to ongoing pressure on Alberta's energy economy. ""We will be focusing on both whether the government — and specifically the Alberta Energy Regulator — has the systems and processes to assess whether orphan oil and gas sites are being managed and reclaimed efficiently and economically in the best interests of Albertans,"" said Val Mellesmoen, spokesperson for the Office of the Auditor General of Alberta.  Meanwhile, the government is also reviewing its own processes to deal with orphan wells. Savage says the government will be proposing a suite of new regulations ""covering the entire lifecycle of wells in the first quarter of the year."" The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), an arm's-length agency of the provincial government that oversees the energy industry and its activities, has a liability management system that is supposed to make sure companies that are permitted to drill have a healthy enough bottom line to pay for cleanup later on. If a company's estimated assets fall below the cost of its environmental liabilities, the AER can collect and hold what's effectively a security deposit to make sure there's money on hand for cleanup if the company later walks away from the well. But the regulator has been using a formula based on out-of-date commodity prices that has inflated the assets of many companies. As a result, companies were not asked to put down large enough security deposits for future cleanup. The province's own estimate of the eventual cleanup bill for every oil and gas well in Alberta is $30 billion, while the AER only holds $227 million in financial security. ""The promise of this production was that companies would clean up their mess,"" said Nikki Way, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank based in Calgary.  ""I'm disappointed that we're at the point where the 'polluter pays' principle is not being upheld and we're considering cleaning up a bill that was always supposed to be accounted for."" Alberta has asked the federal government to help pay for cleaning up orphan wells. In a November 2019 letter sent by Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews to Bill Morneau, his federal counterpart, the province asked Ottawa for funding and tax instruments to encourage investment in well reclamation. ""This system is just not sustainable,"" said Lucija Muehlenbachs, an economist at the University of Calgary who specializes in the energy industry. ""It's not functioning, so it will have to be completely thrown out the window. But it's many years too late."" The AER uses a liability management rating, or LMR, to determine whether a company has enough money to clean up its wells down the line. If the company's estimated assets — calculated based on the amount of resources in its wells — are less than the estimated cost of cleaning up the wells, the company has to pay a security deposit. But the AER has been using commodity prices from 2008-2010, back when oil prices were much higher, to estimate the value of assets. Even though the regulator assesses these assets every month, because of its use of old commodity prices, many companies that should be putting up security deposits have not had to.  And simply adjusting the calculation now to account for current prices isn't an easy fix, according to the AER, because it could force struggling companies into bankruptcy. ""In many cases, this would have negative consequences for those already facing financial difficulties, and increases the risk that end-of-life obligations would not be addressed,"" AER spokesperson Shawn Roth said in an email. Meanwhile, landowners who agreed to lease their land to oil companies so they could drill wells were promised the companies would clean up after the wells were done producing and restore the surface of the land to its original state. Instead, many are left with inactive wells that nobody is monitoring, let alone cleaning up and closing. Dwight Popowich has an oil well on his property near Two Hills, Alta., about 100 kilometres east of Edmonton, that was drilled in 2008. It stopped producing in 2012, and its owner, Sequoia Resources Corp., stopped operating in March 2018. No remediation work has been done on the well. Popowich is waiting for the well to be transferred to the Orphan Well Association, which is an industry- and government-supported group that is trying to manage orphan wells. But, in the meantime, no one is monitoring the well on his property. ""We don't know if it's safe. We don't know if it's leaking. Nobody's showing up to even take a look at it,"" Popowich said. Sequoia held licences for 2,300 wells when it ceased operations in 2018. For Popowich, the well has become a financial headache in addition to an environmental problem. He wanted to subdivide his land and sell off half of it to help pay for his retirement. But the well is in the way. ""Nobody wants to buy the land if they have to deal with a well that's in limbo,"" he said. Across the border in North Dakota, as oil prices declined, the state saw a growing number of inactive wells, but it has not experienced the same problem with orphan wells as Alberta. North Dakota has strict timelines in place to deal with inactive wells. If a well stops producing for as little as three months, it's immediately flagged. The state also collects a bond from companies upfront — $50,000 US if the company is drilling one well — and can use that money to pay for plugging and remediating wells.  North Dakota, which is the second largest crude oil producer in the U.S. after Texas, has only 1,683 inactive wells — and not one of them is an orphan. The head of North Dakota's regulator says a combination of a bond system and plugging and reclamation fund is essential for preventing orphan wells. ""You've got to start somewhere,"" said Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Alberta, on the other hand, does not have any timeline for how long a company can leave a well inactive. This has raised concerns that many of the approximately 94,000 inactive wells in Alberta may become orphaned before their owners clean them up.  Alberta's industry knows the liability management system needs to change, and the AER and provincial government have said they are reviewing the program. The AER says a new system would gather more company-specific information to gain a more holistic view of whether a company can meet its environmental obligations.  But the government and regulator have to tread lightly on an industry that's struggling. ""We want to see progress on the file, but you have to manage the unintended consequences,"" said Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""You don't want to create more defaults. There are a lot of companies struggling. We are empathetic to that."" Nikki Way of the Pembina Institute says concerns over low oil prices should not stop the government from taking action now. New wells can be treated differently, with more financial security collected prior to drilling. She points out that while the government has to balance the profitability of the industry with any new regulations, the liability problem will continue to grow if nothing is done. ""The pressures aren't going away any time soon,"" she said. ""So the scope of the problem needs to be front and centre and transparent.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-orphan-wells-liability-audit-review-1.5433603,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-redwater-investment-consequences-1.5359734 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/crown-drilling-rights-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-oil-1.5371524 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-orphan-wells-1.5427559 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A
257,Anonymous,2020-01-25T12:57:57.250Z,"'Stand up for yourself': Amid coronavirus outbreak, nurse reflects on living through SARS in 2003","As a new type of coronavirus prompts lockdowns and quarantines in China, nurse Susan Sorrenti says health-care workers in Toronto are feeling a sense of déjà vu. In 2003, she was exposed to a patient with the SARS virus while on the job. For 17 days, she remained in quarantine at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she worked, with no visitors allowed and nothing but a phone to connect her to her husband and two young children waiting at home. ""It was brutal,"" Sorrenti said. ""And it was augmented by the fact that while in hospital I was on very high doses of steroids which affected me psychologically as well. I was in a great depression."" More than 1,000 cases have been confirmed in China and the death toll had risen to more than 40 as of Friday night, according to the Health Commission of Hubei Province.  In 2003, more than 800 people worldwide — including 44 Canadians — died of SARS, a virus from the same family as the coronavirus. However, infectious disease specialists in Toronto say Canada is much better prepared to deal with the new coronavirus than it was with SARS.  White Coat, Black Art host Dr. Brian Goldman spoke with Sorrenti about her days in quarantine and the anxiety that followed her SARS diagnosis in 2003. Here is part of their conversation. How did you first come in contact with SARS back in 2003? Our patient was transferred to us from a hospital that was quarantined, but the patient had been screened and deemed OK for transport. Obviously, as events turned out, it did not end up that way. That patient did actually have contact with the SARS from China. How much contact did you have with that patient? We had actually been exposed to the patient with no isolation gear whatsoever when the patient was transported into the [intensive care] unit. Unfortunately, the EMS that transported the patient had not notified us of the arrival. We had planned to gear up as best we could, but we did not have a chance. So we were fully exposed to the patient coming in: coughing and secretions were abounding. Describe for me the moment when you realized you were getting sick yourself. We had been called at home and told to impose ourselves into some kind of quarantine situation where we were to be apart from our family and try to eat in a different area and not have anything to do with our family members. We were then told to ... take our temperature every four hours, and if we noticed any symptoms developing, we were to contact public health immediately or to go to the hospital.  How did you feel at that moment when you were asked to go into self-quarantine? Dreadful. I was so concerned for my family. I mean, the whole anxiety of it all was not so much as myself getting sick as, did I by any chance get my family members or any members of my community sick? I was very concerned for everyone that was in my proximity. Forty-four people in Canada died of SARS. Was there a moment when you were worried that that might happen to you? They provided us with a television inside the rooms and, of course, the whole media coverage, the whole media blitz on what was happening and the way it was spun, how dangerous it was and how many people are dying every day — yes that did cross my mind.  I was not ready to go. I didn't have anything prepared. But it was on my mind. The precautions that were taken, that were developed — you know, the gowns and the gloves and the N95 masks ... and the paper masks, the paper hoods … basically you had little or none of that the day when you were exposed. Did that bother you as you thought about this illness that you were going through? Actually, it really did…. I did ask our nurse manager at the time for more support. I actually went to her and said, you know, we don't feel like we're really being supported with the amount of isolation gear we're asking for, versus what we're getting, and was there any way that we could increase the amount. And I was basically deferred to whatever infection control said we were to do, and that's all we were going to get. We wanted to err on the side of caution, but we weren't allowed to do that. There just [weren't] enough supplies for us to do that, so we had to basically make do with what we did. You're still a practicing nurse. Do you think we've learned since then? Are the precautions better? Yes, the precautions are better. We have learned. We've done … respiratory screening on most of the patients that come through the [emergency room]. We do travel checks. You know, these kinds of things now are commonplace, everyday things that happen that will hopefully prevent this from happening again to the extent it did in Toronto. Physically you got better. But there have been studies done about the long-term emotional impacts, including PTSD in some health-care workers. So what was the aftermath like for you? When I first came in there [was] still the screening at the entrances of the hospital, the barricading with plastic sheets everywhere. It was very surreal going back into work. That in itself caused me a great deal of anxiety before I even got on to the unit. I'm guessing you remember very well the day you were reunited with your family. Oh my God, yes, I do. I do. And it was a beautiful day. It was a gorgeous day outside. Sunny.  My husband met me outside of the hospital and I was, I don't know, I can't explain the feeling. I didn't think it was gonna happen. I didn't think I was ever going to see them. So it was great. It was the most marvellous day. What are the biggest lessons that people like you and I, who work in health care, and you, who had SARS, can learn from that entire personal and professional experience? I think, being more advocates for ourselves and really actually following our instincts  … not to ignore signs that there are dangers, and not to accept any kind of less-than-adequate protection for yourself. Like, to stand up for yourself—that was my biggest lesson that I learned about that. Written by Kirsten Fenn. Produced by Dawna Dingwall, Sujata Berry and Jeff Goodes.

258,Pam Berman,2020-01-24T20:55:49.014Z,Financial pressures push Town of Shelburne toward dissolution,"The Town of Shelburne, N.S., is on the verge of dissolving because it has been struggling financially for several years. ""Either we hack and slash, or we apply to dissolve,"" said Mayor Karen Mattatall. ""The taxpayers in town can't afford additional tax increases."" The town has just under 1,700 residents. Mattatall said town council now has to make some difficult decisions. She said cutting services will only ""delay the inevitable."" The town has been pinning its hopes on consolidation talks with its municipal neighbours, but there have only been a couple of preliminary sessions. The process is now in limbo because the Municipality of the District of Shelburne is worried about the impact Shelburne's financial position would have on its taxpayers. In a press release, Warden Penny Smith said the province needs to help pay for infrastructure challenges facing the town, such as flooding problems on Dock Street and aging water and sewer lines. She said if there was provincial support, consolidation talks could continue. Shelburne town council is expected to make a decision about dissolution by the end of March, when a new budget is supposed to be in place. If the town dissolved, the Utility and Review Board would be responsible for determining who would provide municipal governance. ""I've always referred to dissolution as a forced marriage where consolidation, unification or whatever is similar, to a marriage of willing partners,"" Mattatall said. The Town of Lockeport is nervously watching this situation unfold. Mayor George Harding said the town is in better financial shape than the Town of Shelburne, but it has agreements for shared services with both the town and the district, so it was interested in taking part in consolidation talks. ""What are the possibilities for eastern Shelburne County and what opportunities would be there for all three municipalities?"" said Harding. Harding pointed out Lockeport would be left out of the dissolution process. ""Exploring consolidation is far more favourable,"" he said. Krista Higdon, a spokesperson for the Department of Municipal Affairs, said if a municipality is considering consolidation, it would be happy to meet to discuss what support could be provided.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/town-of-shelburne-on-verge-of-dissolution-1.5439721,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forestry-loans-credit-union-contractors-1.5439410 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/doctor-manivasan-moodley-misconduct-patients-cape-breton-1.5439368 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/save-our-lunenburg-concerned-about-proposed-harbour-developments-1.5438998 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997,N/A
259,Anonymous,2020-01-26T16:42:03.549Z,'You are the lion': Why one Regina woman values her Chinese culture and traditions,"Helen Chang isn't a rat — in the literal sense and in terms of animal signs on the Chinese zodiac.  But the director of the Chinese Cultural Society of Saskatchewan is still happily ringing in the Year of the Metal Rat — even if her zodiac sign is the Wood Rabbit. Saturday marked the Chinese Lunar New Year, a celebration which is held on the first day of the Chinese calendar; often between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20 on the Gregorian calendar.  Chang's parents immigrated from China to Canada before she was born. But she holds Chinese traditions close to her heart.  Growing up in Regina, Chang and her brother were the only Chinese students at their elementary school. She witnessed the stereotypes people put on her culture.  ""It felt like you really had to let people know that there was more to Chinese people than just egg rolls and fried rice,"" she said, adding the stereotypes still exist. ""Every time you see an action move, if they're in Chinatown, there's a lion dance happening."" Chang has passed Chinese traditions down to her own children, including her 11-year-old son — whose zodiac sign just happens to be a rat. ""You can totally see it in him,"" she said. ""He's sporty; he's athletic."" Chang began kung fu lessons when she was about 15 at the encouragement of her mother. She's been doing it ever since and is now a senior level teacher at Chung Wah Kung Fu in Regina.  Kung fu, she said, ties closely with lion dance, another common Chinese tradition. Lion dance was traditionally performed by kung fu schools because it took significant physical strength to do it. The lion, Chang explained, has special significance to Chinese New Year celebrations. ""Lions are magical creatures in Chinese folklore,"" she said. ""The lion has a horn [and] a special mirror. All these things help it to dispel bad energy and bring in good luck.""  Chang and her family will be taking part in celebrations throughout the next couple of weeks, including one being held by the Chinese Cultural Society of Saskatchewan at Lee's Chop Suey on Feb. 8. The event features a traditional 10 course meal and is open to everyone. Tickets are available by calling 306-525-5027. Chang will also get the opportunity to take part in a lion dance throughout the next couple of weeks. On Sunday, her group will perform at Dosu Wok restaurant in Pilot Butte. It's an experience that's always meaningful to her. ""Once the drum's going and the music's playing, your heartbeat just pushes you along,"" she said.

Most cancer diagnoses are ""still being treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery — what I call the slash, poison, and burn approach,"" said Azra Raza. She told The Current's Matt Galloway that she is prescribing the same drugs today as when she treated her first North American patient in 1977. ""Why are we not looking at the entire overall picture and trying to do something different instead of repeating the same old, same old? This is why it's an embarrassment."" Raza is a professor of medicine at Columbia University and the author of The First Cell: And The Human Cost of Pursuing Cancer to the Last. The book tells the stories of some of the thousands of patients she has treated during her career, as well as her own husband's diagnosis and death from the disease. After five decades as an oncologist, Raza argues that efforts to fight cancer should be refocused on early detection. ""The only thing that seems to work is identifying cancer early,"" she said. ""Why aren't we using the latest technology to try and identify cancer at its inception?"" She explained that currently, a lot of research is aimed at prolonging life, but can come with side effects. Often those treatments make ""things even more grisly,"" she said, and can feel like ""taking a baseball bat and hitting a dog with it to get rid of its fleas"" for the patient. ""I am asking for redirection of funds being wasted in doing useless clinical trials, or trials that are yielding a five-per-cent success rate,"" she said.  That money could go towards developing tests to find ""the presence of cancer in any secretion through a liquid biopsy: blood, sweat, saliva, tears, urine."" In November, technology company Toshiba said it had developed a device that could detect 13 types of cancer from a single drop of blood, with 99 per cent accuracy. The company said trials would start this year, with a view to having the device on the market in a few years' time. A study published in 2018 suggested that early testing could have negative consequences, such as leading to false diagnoses, or unnecessary treatment.  Raza said that overdiagnoses are already happening in regular testing. She is confident that in the near future, we will have the technology ""to find the earlier footprints of cancers, and that along with that revolution will come better treatment options."" Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said it's ""a little presumptuous to say that all we're doing is poisoning people, or burning people, or cutting people."" He told The Current that millions of premature deaths have been prevented by cancer research, but acknowledged that treatments for some cancers haven't made much progress ""For every successful drug, there are eight or nine drugs that have not been successful in clinical trials — but that doesn't mean the research has failed,"" he said. ""A tremendous amount of effort has gone to finding the first cell, to finding the first signals of cancer, and then deciding how best to treat it."" Raza said she agreed the research to date has made for valuable progress, but said more could be done.  ""Yes, a lot of money is being spent in finding the first cell, but not enough,"" she said. She wants a re-energized fight against cancer to have the competition witnessed when the U.S. and Russia raced to put man on the Moon, and the cooperation ""seen between scientists around the world doing the Human Genome Project.""

261,Anonymous,2020-01-26T15:00:00.666Z,Blizzards can be fatal for birds. Here's how you can help our feathered friends,"For some birds in Newfoundland, last week's massive blizzard resulted in food scarcity and death, says a local bird expert. Jared Clarke, who owns a birdwatching and touring company called Bird the Rock, said now is an excellent time to fill up your bird feeders. ""There's certainly no reason not to be feeding birds right now, and they probably appreciate it a little more than usual if we do,"" he said. While some birds are prepared for bad weather, said Clarke, others visiting during migrations from the south aren't. Berries and seeds can freeze or become buried under snow, and the winds can even be lethal for some birds. ""We know for certain that there were a few birds here that have made the news recently that are sort of visiting from further south and probably shouldn't be here this time of year. And we know that they had a hard time and several of them didn't make it,"" he said. Clarke said the bull bird is one of them. ""It's a small bird related to the puffin that winters here off our coast, and with the strong winds during the storm the next morning people were picking them up in driveways and on roads."" When it comes to keeping birds fed, Clarke said, many finches prefer a small black seed called niger, while others eat millet. He sad buying a seed mix can help to accommodate different tastes.  Suet blocks are also a good idea, he said. ""That's a really high-energy food. It's really loved by a lot of birds, especially some of our woodpeckers. So that's a great thing to have this time of year."" Clarke said while some birds, like the bull bird, can be killed by the weather, others prepare well in advance and are perfectly safe. ""I don't think there's any doubt that they sense this storm coming, probably even before we would have,"" he said. ""A lot of birds like boreal chickadees and the kinglets that live in our forests will go deep into the forest and find places close to the tree trunks to be out of the wind and away from the bulk of the snow."" For crows, the suspension of garbage collection during the state of emergency is resulting in food scarcity, with a week's worth of fresh garbage not going to the dump, said Clarke. ""They're probably spreading out over the city looking for it, looking for things to eat,"" said Clarke. But crows will likely make do, he said, so there's no need to leave scraps out for them. ""I think it's fairly safe to assume that most of the crows will do fine.""

""It's not going to do any good ... I can't see them taking down a cross knowing how hurtful it would be to the grieving family,"" Marlene Cooper told CBC's Mainstreet Halifax in an interview that aired Friday. Cooper maintains a memorial for her daughter Kylie, 15, who was killed in a two-vehicle collision on Highway 2 in Wellington on June 10, 2018. A cross Cooper erected in her daughter's memory was removed after the municipality received complaints about it. It was later returned to the site. The Halifax Regional Municipality is currently surveying residents for their feedback on roadside memorials. Council is expected to see a report on roadside memorial recommendations by spring. Cooper said she completed the survey last weekend. ""I can't see them taking [memorials] down. If nothing more, that cross and every cross should serve as a reminder to stay safe,"" she said. According to municipal rules, if anyone complains about a sign within the public right of way it is removed. ""Having a policy will allow us as a municipality to ensure that roadside memorials in the right of way are not impacting safety or our ability to provide services to citizens,"" Halifax spokesperson Maggie-Jane Spray told Mainstreet. ""So for example, snow clearing and road repairs. It will also allow us to communicate clearly with residents who are looking to put up a roadside memorial and about the guidelines."" Spray said one of the primary concerns for the municipality has to do with communicating why a memorial might be taken down. ""We want to ensure that we're all on the same page in terms of making sure they're properly placed,"" Spray said. Cooper said the reason why her cross was taken down had nothing to do with safety. She said someone in the community had filed a complaint. Cooper said she was ""crushed"" when it was temporarily removed, and said the memorial has helped with the grieving process. ""We're celebrating her life and that was the last place that she lived.

""I have had friends in here with me every night,"" said Doran, while putting some water on to boil. ""I did some awesome bacon pesto grilled cheese sandwiches last night and I am hoping to do maybe a little fried pan pizza later this evening.""  Doran, who says he never once considered whether he's too old to build a snow fort, started the project three days ago and has spent hours in his snow cave every evening. ""It's the best. Everyone is asking to come over and everyone is more than welcome to crawl in and enjoy a couple drinks by the fire … listen to some tunes and hang out."" As the state of emergency in St. John's nears its end, Doran said he won't be sorry to see the fort go, regardless of the joy it brought him. ""It's OK, because I am going to remember this forever. This was one for the books, for sure."" Julie Purchase was running out of snow day activities when she decided to dig a five-room snow fort.  ""I had too much energy and I am no longer allowed to decorate in the house anymore so I had to get outside and create something,"" she said, while lying on her back in the structure she built just outside of her garage. Purchase said she spent hours digging, smoothing over the walls, adding decorations and now enjoying the space, often with a cold beverage. Her family has named it the Yoda hut, after the Star Wars character, and to keep on theme they have stuck figurines from the '70s in one of the fort windows and included a plush Yoda toy.  ""That just kind of happened and it's taken off so we have embraced it as much as we could,"" said Purchase. When asked if she is looking forward to seeing the state of emergency being lifted, she said, ""Work will always be there but these memories that you are making they are unique and you will always have them. ""Stay home, enjoy your time with your friends and family. You have nowhere to go, you have no excuse to not engage and have some fun and relax."" If you can't get to the 26 C weather, bring it to you. That was the theme for Nicole Roper and fiancé Bobby Clarke's snow fort.  ""We were on Day 5 of the state of emergency and trying to think of something to do to keep busy and I just looked in the backyard and was like, 'We actually have a fire pit there somewhere.'"" Once they found it, Roper and Clarke built a little fort around it and what started as a laugh quickly grew into a full-on tiki-themed snow party, complete with umbrellas, blow-up palm trees, a mini-bar and margarita glasses.  She said by the end of the evening about 15 people were sitting around the makeshift bar. ""We started just putting it up as a joke … just having a little bit of a laugh in the afternoon, just trying to stay busy and keep our mind off of everything that is going on,"" she said.   Roper says regardless of the cabin fever she and her friends have experienced, Snowmageddon 2020 could have been much worse.

Lori Tweddell, 18, and her twin sister Louve Tweddell planned to compete in the annual 1,609 kilometre sled-dog race between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse this winter. Those plans changed after the twins recently failed to finish a qualification race. In order to qualify for the Yukon Quest, racers must have completed a 483-kilometre race and a 322-kilometre race in the previous three and a half years. Last year, the Tweddells successfully completed the Yukon Quest's shorter race, known as the Yukon Quest 300. They set out to complete a 483-kilometre race in Alaska earlier this month, but decided to quit halfway through. ""Sadly, I could not finish the race, and the condition that the trail was [in], and the weather, and I guess bad luck as well played a major role,"" Lori said. While this meant they couldn't compete in the longer Yukon Quest race, the sisters hoped they'd be able to instead run the Yukon Quest 300 again this year. But that's not possible, according to Shayna Hammer, executive director of the Yukon Quest International Association (Canada). The deadline to apply for or switch to either race was Jan. 3. Others have tried to join after that date but were declined, Hammer said. ""I was really upset because we prepared for years,"" said Lori. ""It could be understandable, but we had registered, we paid for everything,"" Louve said. ""It was just kind of surprising not to be accepted."" Frank Turner, a previous Yukon Quest winner, said the Tweddells should be allowed to participate. ""You don't protect the bad rule by saying, 'That's the way it was done in the past.' If it's a bad rule now, then it should be dealt with now,"" he told Radio-Canada. Hammer said the Yukon Quest's board, which consists of representatives from the U.S. and Canada, will make a recommendation to the rules committee to prevent a situation like the Tweddells' from happening again. There is currently an acting rules committee for the event, since the previous six-member committee resigned last summer after reviewing the rules.   Speaking on Tuesday, Hammer referred to ""some differing directions between the [former] rules committee and the organization,"" but said she didn't know the exact reasons for the schism.  The acting rules committee plans to meet this spring.  Fifteen teams are registered for the longer race this year, and 21 teams are set to run the Yukon Quest 300. Both events begin Feb. 1 in Fairbanks. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-sisters-races-1.5435216,https://www.cbc.ca/archives/broken-legs-hypothermia-dogs-the-yukon-quest-1.5004546 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bike-winter-high-school-fat-bike-yukon-year-round-1.5431709,N/A
265,David Friend,2020-01-21T14:15:00.624Z,Nine times lucky? Alberta's Northern Cree takes another shot at Grammy gold,"Even the biggest pop stars might want to clear the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday when Northern Cree arrive dressed to impress. It's the ninth time Alberta's Indigenous singing group is nominated at music industry's biggest night, and co-founder Steve Wood says he's planning a few surprises. Among them, expect members of the 17-person act to sport traditional Cree designs that could easily overshadow the edgy threads worn by Shawn Mendes and Lil Nas X. ""Even if you're famous, you don't want to be next to us on the red carpet,"" Wood says with a chuckle on the phone from Maskwacis, Alta. ""Taking nothing away from any of the artists, what I'm saying is that people are always looking for something they haven't seen before."" Since the group's first nomination in 2001, the 58-year-old leader of Northern Cree has become somewhat of an expert in grabbing attention on the red carpet. A couple years ago, the act wowed onlookers when they pulled up wearing vibrant beaded vests, a sharp break from the steady flow of black tuxedos and designer looks on the carpet. Northern Cree didn't win the Grammy that year, but they had everyone talking. This year, they're nominated in the best regional roots category with their 40th album, When It's Cold - Cree Round Dance Songs, a collection of tracks that acknowledge the good times (The Hippity Hoppity) and the hardships (To All MMIW) a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women). Their Grammy category is stacked with other favourite contenders, including six-time Hawaiian nominee Amy Hanaiali'i and Rebirth Brass Band, a past winner from New Orleans. Northern Cree carries a longer history with the Recording Academy than the rest of them, but the singing group is running zero for eight on Grammy wins. While leaving empty-handed for so many years would've left many artists feeling slighted, Wood insists his fellow members are nothing less than auspicious winners even without a golden statuette to their name. ""If you look at the positives, it's giving us an opportunity to get recognition for our music,"" he explains. ""We're representing First Nations people across North America, but we are also representing the Canadian public. That's why we're going to do the best that we can, always."" Wood created Northern Cree with his brothers Randy and Earl in 1982. The group originates from the Saddle Lake Cree Nation in northern Alberta, but includes members from the Treaty 6 area, including the Frog Lake Cree Nation, Onion Lake Cree Nation, Samson Cree Nation, Louis Bull Cree Nation and the Poundmaker Cree Nation. They've performed on global stages, which included an opening spot for the Tragically Hip during a Canada Day concert at London's Trafalgar Square. Most of the group's members juggle career jobs outside of music, several of them school teachers. Wood is an education administrator at an Alberta junior and senior high school on top of balancing the group's schedule. That's one of the reasons the Grammy Awards offers Northern Cree a platform they can't find anywhere else. Not only are international audiences watching the big event, but the auditorium is packed with fellow musicians, which can lead to new opportunities. Several years ago, rapper M.I.A. and singer Santigold picked a Northern Cree sample for their own original song, while more recently Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy docuseries Who is America? used a pounding electronic track by producer DJ Shub, featuring Northern Cree, as its title music. And when Northern Cree was nominated in 2017, the Grammy organizers asked the group to play as part of the pre-telecast awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The performance shook the room, even before Mexican singer Carla Morrison joined them on stage. Wood says it's those pure Grammy moments that mean the most. ""I like to get the music out in its original form,"" he says. ""When we hit those mainstream stages, the audience is in a little bit of awe until they can feel it. But when they feel it, it turns into a rock concert.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/maskwacis-northern-cree-band-grammy-awards-1.5434335,[],N/A

268,Anonymous,2020-01-25T19:12:06.691Z,"In opening impeachment argument, Trump lawyers say Democrats want to overturn 2016 vote","U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyers plunged into their impeachment trial defence Saturday by accusing Democrats of striving to overturn the 2016 election, arguing that investigations of Trump's dealings with Ukraine have not been a fact-finding mission but a politically motivated effort to drive him from the White House. ""They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,"" White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told senators. ""And we can't allow that to happen."" The Trump legal team's arguments in the rare Saturday session were aimed at rebutting allegations that the president abused his power when he asked Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and then obstructed Congress as it tried to investigate. The lawyers are mounting a wide-ranging, aggressive defence asserting an expansive view of presidential powers and portraying Trump as besieged by political opponents determined to ensure he won't be re-elected this November. ""They're asking you to tear up all the ballots across this country on their own initiative,"" Cipollone said. Though Trump is the one on trial, the defence team made clear that it intends to paint the impeachment case as a mere continuation of the investigations that have shadowed the president since before he took office — including one into allegations of Russian election interference on his behalf. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow suggested Democrats were investigating the president over Ukraine simply because they couldn't bring him down for Russia. ""That — for this,"" said Sekulow, holding up a copy of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, which he accused Democrats of attempting to ""re-litigate."" That report detailed ties between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia but did not allege a criminal conspiracy to tip the election. From the White House, Trump added name-calling, tweeting that his team was making his case ""against lyin', cheatin', liddle' Adam ""Shifty"" Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nervous Nancy Pelosi"" and others of ""the Radical Left."" Trump's team made only a two-hour presentation, reserving the heart of its case for Monday. Acquittal appears likely, given that Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, and a two-thirds vote would be required for conviction and removal from office. Republican senators already eager to clear Trump said Saturday that the White House presentation had shredded the Democratic case. Several of the senators shook hands with Trump's lawyers after their presentation. The Trump attorneys are responding to two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House — one that accuses him of encouraging Ukraine to investigate Biden at the same time the administration withheld military aid from the country, and the other that accuses him of obstructing Congress by directing aides not to testify or produce documents. Trump's defence team took centre stage following three days of methodical and passionate arguments from Democrats, who wrapped up Friday by warning that Trump will persist in abusing his power and endangering American democracy unless Congress intervenes to remove him before the 2020 election. They also implored Republicans to allow new testimony to be heard before senators render a final verdict. ""Give America a fair trial,"" said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead Democratic impeachment manager. ""She's worth it."" In making their case that Trump invited Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election, the seven Democratic prosecutors peppered their arguments with video clips, email correspondence and lessons in American history. On Saturday morning, House managers made the procession across the Capitol at 9:30 to deliver the 28,578-page record of their case to the Senate. Republicans accused Democrats of cherrypicking evidence and omitting information favorable to the president, casing in a nefarious light actions that the president was legitimately empowered to take. They focused particular scorn on Schiff, playing clips of past statements meant to undercut his credibility. Schiff responded on Twitter that Republicans were ""trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth."" He later added: ""What was most striking to me was ... they don't contest the basic architecture of the scheme."" The Trump team had teased the idea that it would draw attention on Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was vice president. But neither Biden was a focus of Saturday arguments. Instead, Republicans argued that there was no evidence that Trump made the security aid contingent on Ukraine announcing an investigation into the Bidens and that Ukraine didn't even know that the money had been paused until shortly before it was released. Trump had reason to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine and he ultimately released the aid, they said. ""Most of the Democratic witnesses have never spoken to the president at all, let alone about Ukraine security assistance,"" said deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura. Watch: Democrats go on offence at impeachment trial Pupura told the senators the other main reason for the July 25 call in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky for the Biden investigation was in line with the president's concerns about corruption, though Trump never mentioned that word, according to the rough transcript released by the White House. Pupura said everyone knows that when Trump asked Zelensky to ""do us a favour,"" he meant the U.S., not himself. ""This entire impeachment process is about the house managers' insistence that they are able to read everybody's thoughts,"" Sekulow said. ""They can read everybody's intention. Even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves, insist that those interpretations are wrong."" After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud &amp; deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer &amp; their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V. Defence lawyers say Trump was a victim not only of Democratic rage but also of overzealous agents and prosecutors. Sekulow cited mistakes made by the FBI in its surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide in the now-concluded Trump-Russia election investigation. ""You cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum,"" he said. One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, is expected to argue next week that an impeachable offense requires criminal-like conduct, even though many legal scholars say that's not true. The Senate is heading next week toward a pivotal vote on Democratic demands for testimony from top Trump aides, including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, who refused to appear before the House. It would take four Republican senators to join the Democratic minority to seek witnesses, and so far the numbers appear lacking. The Democrats' challenge was clear as they tried to convince not just senators but an American public divided over the Republican president in an election year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-defence-arguments-1.5440604,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-democrats-final-arguments-1.5439716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-case-so-far-1.5438816 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-trump-1.5437770 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966,N/A
269,Shannon Flaman,2019-12-27T11:00:00.604Z,Don't pity my disability; it's not the same as being kind,"As someone with an external disability, I'd like people to know there's a line between kindness and pity. It's a realization I've come to after a lifetime of struggling with stuttering. Every single time my mouth opens, my disability is announced to the world. I've heard it all: ""spit it out,"" ""slow down,"" ""I can't understand you."" Drive-thrus are a challenge. When I talk on the phone, people think I'm cutting out. On many occasions, I've had people assume I'm drunk or disabled in other ways. These are just a few of the barriers I face every single day. I will continue to face them for the rest of my life. This is my reality. But it's not these barriers that get under my skin. I'm a smart, educated, ambitious woman, yet many people can't see past my disability. Don't get me wrong: I've never been bullied. It's actually the opposite – I'm repeatedly pitied. At least once a day, I can see pity in the eyes of someone I interact with. Take the gas attendant who's used to five-second exchanges. For me, the ""F"" in ""fill her up"" is 20 seconds and the ""R"" in ""regular"" another 20 more. I can see his expression change from confusion to panic to pity. Still, he just rolls with it, fills my tank and sends me on my way. The same can't be said for a woman who insisted on praying (quite loudly) over my head to God. She prayed pretty darn hard that God should take away my speech disability and fix my tongue. That situation was embarrassing and uncalled for. I didn't ask for her pity, nor did I ask for her prayers to ""fix"" me. Stuttering is the brain not connecting at the same pace as my tongue and lips. It also occurs because one side of my brain is stronger than the other. Do either of those sound like the end of the world? I think not. I don't pity myself and neither should you. We all have something ""wrong"" with us, whether it can be noticed by the naked eye or it's hidden inside of us. We all love to be shown kindness, but unless someone asks for pity, don't give it. Pity makes us feel less than or not enough. Over the past few years, social media has helped influence all of us to be kinder, to pay it forward. I love this movement and I think in general we are creating positive change with it. So, the next time you encounter someone different than you, rather than giving them an eye of pity, give them a big ole fist bump.

270,Erica Johnson,2019-05-13T19:21:56.898Z,RBC customer out of pocket after fraud: What you need to know if you e-transfer money,"A system to transfer money online — used over a million times a day in Canada — is not as safe as it advertises, says a Royal Bank customer who had $1,734 stolen during an e-transfer. The theft occurred after Anne Hoover of Peterborough, Ont., e-transferred money from her RBC account to her friend Fran Fearnley, only to have a fraudster intercept the transaction and divert the money to his own account at another bank. ""I always use e-transfer,"" says Hoover. ""I thought it was a safe way to send money."" An RBC manager says an internal investigation indicated that Fearnley's email account had been hacked, and when Hoover sent the e-transfer, the fraudster figured out the answer for the security question necessary to deposit the money, and then redirected it to a different bank account. An expert in online privacy protection and security says financial institutions have opted for convenience over security, which makes strong email passwords and equally strong e-transfer questions and passwords essential. ""How you manage those passwords is very important,"" says Claudiu Popa, author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook and a cybersecurity expert who advises government and companies. ""Banks and financial institutions have made it very easy to transfer money via email. Unfortunately, with convenience comes lack of security."" Hoover and Fearnley had just returned from a trip to Mexico on March 18, when Hoover went online and used her bank's Interac e-transfer system to reimburse her pal for trip expenses. But when Fearnley opened the email and tried to accept the payment, she got a message saying the e-transfer had already been deposited. The women called RBC's fraud department and a bank employee provided the name of the fraudster, his email, and said he'd transferred the money to a TD Bank account. ""This is clearly a complete stranger,"" says Fearnley. ""How could that possibly have happened?"" The two friends headed to their local RBC branch, where they are both customers — Hoover, for more than 30 years. The bank blamed the theft on Fearnley's email security. Hoover's security question to her friend was: ""Who is my favourite Beatle?"" The fraudster would have had a one in four chance of getting it right — John, Paul, George or Ringo. In a test of RBC's Interac system, Go Public was given four chances to answer the security question correctly. ""The manager continued to insist ... that it wasn't really their problem. It was now our problem,"" Hoover says. Eventually, the manager offered Hoover half the missing funds as a ""gesture of goodwill."" Hoover filed a report with Peterborough police, but an officer told her that it's difficult to clamp down on online fraud and her fight to recoup the money could take ages and would likely be fruitless. Hoover says she feels misled by the bank's website. A webpage about RBC's digital security tells customers they're ""fully protected"" and will be reimbursed ""for any unauthorized transactions."" But when Hoover pointed that out to bank officials, she was told customers aren't protected if they use weak passwords when transferring funds online. RBC declined an interview request from Go Public. In a statement, AJ Goodman, RBC's director of external communications, wrote: ""As part of our electronic access agreement, clients commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" That information is on the bank's website, but only if a customer reading RBC's ""Security Guarantee"" clicks on a few different links to get to a clause in the fine print of a section called ""Security."" Interac makes the same security promises online as RBC, telling customers in bold print that they are ""protected from fraud losses."" No one from Interac would agree to an interview with Go Public, directing questions to RBC. In a statement, the company's senior manager of external communications, Adrienne Vaughan, wrote that Canadians must ""protect their email and passwords so they do not fall victim to cybercrime and they can safely transact online."" In another, similar case, Dr. Sylvia Veith of Prince Albert, Sask., lost $7,000 when she used Interac to e-transfer money to her son's hockey league in June 2017. That money was intercepted and her bank — RBC — blamed a weak password to a security question and told the physician there was nothing that could be done. RBC would not comment on Veith's case, except to reiterate the importance of strong passwords. Police say an investigation is ongoing. ""This idea of transferring money by email is much more risky than people realize,"" says Popa. ""Companies don't report [incidents] because they don't want an investigation from the privacy commissioner, from other regulatory bodies."" Popa says people have been desensitized to the risk of email transfers ""very quickly, almost too quickly"" because they use email all the time, so they figure it's safe. What banks and other financial institutions have done, he says, is sacrifice security to get a high number of people using the system. Last year in Canada, there were more than 371 million e-transfers worth more than $132 billion, according to Interac Corp., the biggest online funds transfer service in the country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre told Go Public that it received 163 reports in 2018 involving e-transfers that were compromised, resulting in money being transferred to fraudsters. Popa did a quick search of Fearnley's email on www.haveibeenpwned.com, a website that tracks data breaches and reports almost eight billion occasions when personal accounts have been exposed. The same email address could be acquired from several different sources. Popa found her email was compromised on two sites when hackers attacked LinkedIn and Verification.io ""That means people have found those e-mail lists. They have sold them to others,"" says Popa. ""Different people have taken what they've needed from those lists, and that's how they got compromised, very likely."" The cybersecurity expert says financial institutions and Interac need to require something called ""two-factor authentication"" to better protect people's accounts. ""Every time you log into an account you need to use a second factor,"" explains Popa. ""A code that arrives as a text message or as a separate email to a different email address that is only valid for a few seconds or a few minutes after it's received."" He says the financial industry knows more security is needed, but is more concerned about getting customers to use the e-transfer system. Some financial institutions offer two-factor authentication as an option, not a requirement. Go Public asked RBC and Interac why they don't require two-factor authentication. Both declined to address the question. Hoover says she's learned the hard way that strong security questions and passwords are crucial. She's escalating her case to the RBC Ombudsman, hoping to prompt the bank to better warn customers they could be liable for losses even if they're victims of fraud. She's also closing her business account at RBC, after decades of loyalty. ""How can I feel confident [in RBC] when, in fact, I've had money stolen from me — clearly stolen,"" says Hoover. ""This isn't secure, and people need to know."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

It was the coldest temperature the northern city had experienced in more than four decades and, in the days leading up to the cold snap, city officials weren't entirely sure their unique heating system would be able to keep up.  ""Until you actually reach those extremes, there's always that question,"" said Wil Waddell, Prince George's manager of utilities. ""But we were able to do that without supplementing at all with any natural gas. ""This is the highest usage we have ever seen,"" he added. Prince George installs B.C.'s 1st solar-power parking lot Prince George's renewable energy system involves a partnership with the local Lakeland Mills sawmill. Wood chips and shavings from the mill — which otherwise go to waste — are burned to heat water that is then pumped through more than three kilometres of underground piping, providing heat and warm water to nearly a dozen downtown buildings, including the library, city hall, the courthouse and the downtown public pool. The heating system became operational in 2012 after Prince George received $11 million to fund the project from the provincial and federal governments, as well as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.  How solar power works in Yukon in winter (hint: it doesn't really, until February) ""There are only a handful of municipal district heating systems in Canada that primarily use a renewable fuel source and for Prince George to be able to operate at 100 per cent through such a cold period is certainly a positive achievement,"" Raymond Boulter, a national expert on community energy systems with Natural Resources Canada, said in a city news release. ""It shows that renewable, low-carbon heat is possible even in Canada's northern communities."" While a renewable energy system kept people warm in Prince George, a sustainable, ultra-low energy building known as a passive house achieved the same thing a few hours north in Fort St. John.  ""The best way to think about [a passive house] is it's just a typical house, but you put a nice, big winter jacket on it,"" said Ryan Harvey, Fort St. John's communications coordinator. ""So, it's extra insulated, using superior windows and doors, and no holes in the exterior walls."" And, during the recent cold stretch, it performed! No drafts, no leaky windows, just pure comfort. The innovative building design has begun to pop up across Canada over the past few years.  Retrofitting a 100-year-old house into a 'passive home' According to Harvey, an electric baseboard and the warmth of daily use heat Fort St. John's passive house, which houses civic offices and is not attached to a natural gas line.  Fort St. John completed the passive house in 2014 as part of its effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The city has committed to reduce its emissions by 12 per cent below 2007 levels by 2030. The city's website claims it maintains a ""carbon neutral status in its corporate operations."" Both cities view these alternative energy approaches as viable examples for how municipalities can lower their emissions, even in –40 degree weather.  ""It just makes sense to look at how we can reduce our usage,"" said Harvey. On Jan. 13, in the thick of the province's recent cold snap, B.C. used more electricity than ever before, a staggering 10,302 megawatts, surpassing the previous record of 10,194 megawatts used on Jan. 3, 2017.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-north-energy-sustainability-1.5440531,[],N/A
272,Aaron Wherry,2020-01-24T20:55:01.874Z,Room at the top: Is Harper's legacy a Conservative leadership vacuum?,"Stephen Harper left behind a relatively sturdy foundation for his successor to build on. Even in defeat, Harper's Conservative party won 99 seats and 32 per cent of the popular vote in 2015. The Conservatives raised $29 million that year, $7 million more than the Liberals. What he didn't leave behind was an heir (or heirs) apparent. To the degree that it's still possible for a leader to plan for these things, the Conservative Party might be better off now had it put more thought into a line of succession. The most successful run in the history of Canadian federal politics is the Liberal Party dynasty that ran from Mackenzie King's first victory in 1921 to John Turner's defeat in 1984 — an era that was held together by successful successions. Liberal prime ministers were in power for nearly 51 of those 63 years. King himself was in power for 21 years — a feat that probably will never be matched. But while King was still in office he decided to hand power to his preferred successor, Louis St. Laurent. King had made St. Laurent his foreign minister — a role that, until then, generally had been held by the prime minister of the day — and with King's backing, St. Laurent easily won the Liberal leadership in 1948. St. Laurent held office for nearly nine years, until the Liberals were defeated by John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservatives in 1957. St. Laurent initially was reluctant to resign as the party's leader but, according to one account, agreed to do so when he was assured that Lester B. Pearson — recruited by King and promoted by St. Laurent — would pursue the leadership. Despite a crushing election defeat in 1958, Pearson held on to the Liberal leadership and then became prime minister in 1963. Five years later, while still in office, he decided to step aside for a new leader. Pierre Trudeau, recruited and appointed justice minister by Pearson, emerged as the frontrunner. Except for the brief interregnum of Joe Clark's government, Trudeau governed for the next 16 years. John Turner — who entered federal politics under Pearson but split with Trudeau — was unlucky enough to go next. The Liberals' run of successful successions effectively ended with his 79 days as prime minister in 1984 and the landslide victory of Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives. Jean Chrétien, who had come into Parliament under Pearson and served in cabinet under Trudeau, returned the Liberals to power in 1993. The long and destructive intra-party war between Chrétien and Paul Martin that followed offered a lesson in the unintended consequences of a party succession that isn't handled well — consequences that included the ill-fated turns of Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, two people who were ill-suited to the tasks they were given. It's possible that politics has changed too much to allow for the kind of transfers of power that sustained the Liberals for half a century. Open leadership votes have put such contests beyond the easy control of party power brokers. And there's less tolerance within parties now for leaders who lose elections, as Pearson did in 1958 and 1962. For that matter, simple hand-offs of power might deprive both parties and the country of important debates about policies and values. But the post-Harper era also doesn't seem to offer a new model for political succession. The first Conservative leadership race after Harper was noteworthy for all the candidates who didn't run. The top two contenders in 2017 ended up being someone who had never served in Harper's cabinet (Andrew Scheer) and someone who was most famous for being fired from Harper's cabinet (Maxime Bernier). The second post-Harper race will feature at least one prominent name: Peter MacKay. But MacKay may end up spending more time answering for the trouble he found as a Harper minister (the F-35 procurement, the failed attempt to put Marc Nadon on the Supreme Court, his public suggestion that the chief justice had inappropriately raised concerns about that appointment, that helicopter ride) than he does boasting of any accomplishments. With a few notable exceptions, Harper did not surround himself with a team of strong ministers known for advancing policy or handling difficult situations. (For all the attention and praise that was directed at Rona Ambrose before she ruled herself out of the race, most of her aura of credibility was due to what she did as interim party leader after 2015.) And none of those notable exceptions were able or willing to run for the leadership when Harper finally departed. Jim Prentice — the closest Harper ever had to a deputy prime minister — left federal politics in 2010 to embark on an ill-fated run at provincial politics in Alberta; he died in a plane crash in 2016. Jim Flaherty, the veteran finance minister, resigned in March 2014 and passed away months later. James Moore, a former industry and heritage minister, resigned for family reasons in 2015. Jason Kenney, perhaps the most highly praised member of Harper's cabinet, chose to pursue power in Alberta. Much has been made about the decline of ""cabinet government"" in Canada in favour of a system where only the prime minister and his office really matter. While that decline can be seen as bad for democracy, it also might make it harder to establish a healthy line of succession. At the moment, it doesn't appear that Harper will be able to take much credit for setting up any of his potential successors. In an alternate universe, Harper might have found a way to hand the party off to someone like Prentice in 2013. And even if the Liberals still won the 2015 election in that alternate universe, the party might have been willing to let Prentice stay on for at least one more election. It's too early to plan Justin Trudeau's retirement party, but he might start thinking about giving his party some options to choose from when it's time to find a new leader. When Trudeau came to office in 2015, he proclaimed the return of cabinet government. His success in that regard is debatable — particularly since Jane Philpott, one of the most competent ministers of the first four years of Trudeau's government, is out of politics and no longer a Liberal. The elevation of Chrystia Freeland to deputy prime minister might present one possible option for succession. But she needn't be the only possible heir. In 1968, when Pearson decided to step aside, Pierre Trudeau was one of eight cabinet ministers to enter the leadership race. When Harper left, the party he led was still standing — something that makes his record look better than that of, say, Brian Mulroney. But the party might be better off now if he'd left it with more potential successors.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5437504,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-quebec-1.5434633 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,N/A
273,Scott Larson,2020-01-24T20:57:53.333Z,"Scotty goes to Scotland: Replica of world's largest T. rex, discovered in Sask., part of touring exhibit","Scotty the T. rex is once again roaming the Earth. Or at least, a replica of Scotty is.  The replica of Scotty — the nickname for the world's largest Tyrannosaurus rex specimen, which was discovered in Eastend, Sask., back in 1991 — is part of an Australian Museum travelling exhibit called Tyrannosaurs — Meet the Family. The Sydney-based museum's exhibit is currently at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. ""At this point Scotty is better traveled than I am,"" quipped Ryan McKellar, curator of paleontology at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina. The exhibit, which highlights the family of tyrannosaurs and their history over 100 million years, began in 2015 at the Australian Museum. It has since gone to other museums in Australia and New Zealand, Iowa and North Carolina in the U.S., and to Canadian museums in Kitchener, Ont., and Halifax. ""And Scotty is the sort of centrepiece of that exhibit, because it is the biggest T. rex specimen that's out there,"" said McKellar. The replica that is part of the exhibit was made by Research Casting International (RCI), which has done replication work of larger skeletons like Scotty for the Royal Saskatchewan Museum. McKellar said the museum has a licensing agreement with RCI that allows for Scotty clones to be made. ""There's a fairly large demand for that because Scotty is such a large T. rex specimen,"" McKellar said. ""It's one of the highlights of the RCI catalog."" The fossil was discovered in 1991 in Eastend, Sask. Excavation work began in 1994 and took six summers to complete. It took more than a decade to get all the rock off the bones and reassemble the skeleton. It's estimated the dinosaur was 13 metres (almost 43 feet) long would have weighed 8,870 kilograms. The first cast of Scotty appeared in the T. rex Discovery Centre in Eastend in 2013 and another replica was unveiled at the RSM in 2019. In addition to those, and the one touring with Australian Museum's exhibit, a fourth is at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo. McKellar said once a museum decides on a pose, and designs and makes the fibreglass model, the actual replica can be assembled in the span of a day.  The Saskatchewan museum still has the original skeleton, which it continues to do research on. McKellar said putting the real Scotty on display would not be feasible. For one, only 65 per cent of the fossil was recovered, much of it in tiny pieces. In addition, the real bones are just too heavy.  ""A good example is the thigh bone on Scotty that weighs something in the neighborhood of 250 pounds, and it's fragile,"" McKellar said. ""[A replica] allows us to present to the public a more complete picture of the animals.… I think it makes it much easier for the public to envision what the animals look like and just how impressive they would have been."" Scotty isn't the only Saskatchewan fossil that goes abroad. McKellar said other fossils are borrowed by international institutions each year for research purposes. Other famous fossils include the only known example of a tyrannosaurus coprolite (fossil feces found in the same valley as Scotty), as well as a brontothere (a rhinoceros-like mammal that lived about 40 million years ago), and a wide range of marine reptiles. Having Scotty replicas tramp around the world shines a spotlight on the work being done in Saskatchewan. ""This allows us to share the deep history of Saskatchewan with a much wider audience, and hopefully it draws people in to visit our province and see where the discoveries are being made,"" McKellar said. ""It's kind of exciting to see the international reach — that some of the research and exhibits work that we're doing here has led to some of these larger travelling exhibits."" The replica of Scotty is in Scotland until May. The Australian Museum exhibit will then travel to the Milwaukee Public Museum in 2021.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/scotty-t-rex-replica-touring-scotland-1.5439655,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/scotty-dinosaur-excavation-anniversary-1.5228457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/scotty-t-rex-regina-museum-1.5141335,N/A

The Tignish, P.E.I., fisherman is being inducted into the Atlantic Canada Marine Industries Hall of Fame. Gaudet called the induction an honour beyond his ""wildest dreams,"" and said he loves fishing just as much now as he did when he started back in 1966. ""It's just being in the outdoors, out on the water,"" Gaudet said from his home in Tignish. ""I worked in Ontario for six months and it wasn't my cup of tea. I had to come home to fish. I was just like a lost puppy in Ontario.""  The ceremony gets underway Friday in Moncton. It's part of the Fish Canada trade show, the largest marine show in the region.  Ruby Arsenault is a founding member of the Tignish Fishers' Awards Banquet committee. Her committee nominated Gaudet. Arsenault said Gaudet is known throughout the community as somebody who is willing to lend a helping hand, especially to new fishermen.  ""One quote comes to mind when you think of Dennis, most people will say he is a gentleman both on land and sea,"" said Arsenault. ""He's a seasoned fisher. He is a leader, which means you know he's not afraid to speak out or ask questions about anything that concerns the industry."" This is the second time in his career that Gaudet has been recognized for his craft. Last year, Gaudet's peers at Tignish harbour nominated him as captain of the year.  Gaudet said he knows all too well that his love of the sea comes with a risk. His own boat capsized after being struck by another in 1974. The weather was calm at the time and he and his fellow fishermen were able to swim to shore. His brother Laurie wasn't so lucky. He died after his boat swamped in rough seas in 1996. It's an event that is still fresh in Gaudet's mind.  ""It was hard on the family, hard on the community."" In September 2018, Gaudet suffered the loss of two of his close friends. Glen DesRoches and Moe Getson died when their boat capsized in rough seas. ""That just brought back old memories,"" he said. ""I knew them pretty good, I knew Glen pretty good."" In addition to Gaudet, Rudy LeBreton of Neguac, N.B., is being inducted as processor of the year. Laurence Cook of Grand Manan, N.B., is being inducted as industry builder of the year.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tignish-fisherman-marine-hall-fame-dennis-gaudet-1.5438528,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-tignish-fishers-banquet-1.5036850 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/lobster-trap-christmas-tree-lighting-tignish-pei-1.4920388 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-coronavirus-low-risk-1.5438378 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-road-rage-assault-charges-charlottetown-1.5438435,N/A

276,Nahlah Ayed,2020-01-24T10:40:56.616Z,'Historic day for international justice': UN Rohingya ruling brings glimmer of hope,"Is it possible for a court to stop ongoing violence aimed at genocide? A group of international lawyers believes it is, and that in persuading the UN's top court to act, they may have saved thousands of lives. The genocide accusation brought forward by Gambia against Myanmar is still far from settled. But on Thursday, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ordered Myanmar and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to do everything possible to protect Rohingya Muslims remaining in the country until the bigger question is settled. To Myanmar's many critics, the unanimous court decision is a flicker of the official rebuke the country has long deserved for its treatment of Rohingya people. It's an embarrassment for Suu Kyi. But in the ICJ's public takedown of her best arguments against accusations of genocide, lawyers and advocates also see another glimmer: a possible turn for the moribund international justice  system. ""Today is a historic day for international justice,"" says Payam Akhavan, a Canadian professor at Montreal's McGill University and a lawyer with the team representing Gambia. ""To their credit, the judges rose to the occasion … and if [Thursday's] order can buy a measure of protection for the 600,000 Rohingya that remain in that country and prevent further atrocities against them, I think this effort will have been very well worth all the trouble that it has taken."" The ICJ, which resolves disputes between states, isn't used to hearing about accusations of systematic sexual assault and murder and alleged attempts to destroy a people. Nor is it accustomed to the kind of spectacle unleashed when Suu Kyi decided to come, in the flesh, to the hearing back in December to defend her country against such accusations. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 that Human Rights Watch characterized as a ""campaign of ethnic cleansing."" UN investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent."" Six weeks after hearing Gambia's argument for ""provisional measures"" to protect Rohingya still in Myanmar, the court was of the opinion that they do ""remain extremely vulnerable."" The judgment, read by court president Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, poked holes in Suu Kyi's repeated argument that the violence in Rakhine state amounted to an internal conflict with an armed Rohingya group. ""Irrespective of the situation that the Myanmar government is facing in Rakhine state,"" the court noted, ""Myanmar remains under the obligation incumbent upon it as a state party to the Genocide Convention."" All 17 judges unanimously agreed Myanmar must protect Rohingya Muslims against genocidal acts, and exceeded Gambia's requests by requiring a check-in report from Myanmar every six months until the case is resolved. Such unanimity is exceedingly rare. Such decisions by an international court even more so. ""More recently, international justice has suffered a few setbacks,"" Gambia's justice minister, Abubacarr Tambadou, said following the ruling. ""I think [the decision] is a huge boost for international law and international justice."" The order is legally binding, but the court has no way to enforce the decision, short of reporting its decision to the Security Council. But the top UN body has failed to act on Myanmar in the past. Advocates still believe that Suu Kyi and her government, keen on international investment, will seek to comply. A UN fact-finding mission concluded that Myanmar's military acted with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine state, and the UN General Assembly passed a resolution late last month condemning Myanmar for human rights abuses. Yet Myanmar has largely avoided international action thanks in part to China, which opposed referring the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The presentation of the case to the ICJ was an attempt to work around the inertia — though the ICC has now opened an investigation into the matter. Thursday's decision quoted extensively from both the UN assembly resolution and the UN fact-finding mission report, which was also heartening to international justice advocates. ""The international justice road ahead is long,"" said Pam Singh, a Canadian with the international justice program at Human Rights Watch. For now, she adds, the order ""offers a much-needed reminder of what international justice can deliver when a country like Gambia shows moral courage, vision and leadership."" Myanmar has always denied persecuting Rohingya or committing anything resembling genocide. Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon, has been roundly criticized for failing to stand up for Rohingya people. Among other things, the Nobel laureate was stripped of her honorary Canadian citizenship. Canada's Parliament was the first to declare what happened in Rakhine state a ""genocide."" Suu Kyi published a letter in the Financial Times on Thursday quoting her own government's investigation, which concluded there was no evidence of genocide. It did, however, indicate there is some evidence of possible war crimes. She also cautioned against the international court's reliance on the UN fact-finding mission, which in turn relied on testimony from refugees which her government's investigation says may be ""inaccurate."" She said Myanmar has been condemned ""on unproven statements without the due process of criminal investigation."" Myanmar can only deal with any violations ""if adequate time is given for domestic justice to run its course,"" she added. A release from Myanmar's foreign ministry was more blunt, blaming Myanmar's accusers for presenting a ""distorted picture of the situation in Rakhine, and [affecting] Myanmar's bilateral relations with several countries."" François-Philippe Champagne, Canada's foreign affairs minister, urged Myanmar to comply with the court's ruling. As did Tambadou, who said the decision presented an opportunity to Myanmar for a change in course. For the more than 700,000 Rohingya displaced over the border in Bangladesh, the ruling changes nothing. Many of them nonetheless tuned in on radios and phones to hear the proceedings. Among the most persecuted people in the world, there were many who took heart. ""It has been a very, very painful journey for us to get here,"" said Yasmin Ullah, a Canadian Rohingya activist who was in the court at The Hague. Despite the failings of the international justice system, she added, ""we got here — and that says something about the resilience of our people.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/icj-rohingya-ruling-1.5438557,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/world-court-myanmar-protect-rohingya-genocide-1.5437258 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/suu-kyi-denies-myanmar-genocide-allegations-at-international-court-of-justice-1.5391947,N/A
277,"Dave Seglins,  Joseph Loiero",2020-01-25T22:36:43.595Z,Police officer suspects internal 'coverup' by CP Rail in fatal B.C. mountain crash,"A police officer probing the death of three Canadian Pacific Railway crewmen killed in a runaway train crash in B.C. last February alleges he was denied access to key evidence and suspects a ""coverup"" by the railway. Mark Tataryn was one of three officers with CP Police Service assigned to investigate the derailment of CP Train 301. CPPS is a fully authorized federal force, bound to uphold Canada's laws, but is employed directly by the company. Tataryn began investigating potential criminal negligence by CP after the parked train suffered air brake failure in the mountains in –28 C temperatures and crashed at the historic Spiral Tunnels near Field, B.C. on Feb. 4, 2019 ""I was ordered to stop investigating,"" Tataryn told CBC's The Fifth Estate, saying his superiors prevented him from obtaining key witness accounts. ""I would say it was some type of coverup."" ""I believe it's an injustice. I do believe that there was corporate influence to sway the aspect of the investigation in some capacity,"" said Tataryn in an interview, though he declined to discuss specific evidence from the case. Tataryn has since quit CPPS and joined the RCMP.  But before he left, he says he shared his concerns — and a copy of CP's police file — with B.C.'s Coroner, Canada's Transportation Safety Board and the RCMP. The Fifth Estate conducted a seven-month investigation, talking with witnesses, railroad workers, families and sources within police and government and uncovered a string of failures in the Train 301 tragedy, to be explored in a documentary ""Runaway Train"" airing Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. As a CP police officer based in Golden, B.C., Tataryn recalls racing to the derailment scene, finding 99 grain cars piled up and bodies of three crew members from the wrecked locomotive, by then overturned in the Kicking Horse River. Two other more senior CPPS officers were also part of CP's investigation.""We did everything we could at the time under those adverse conditions, –35 C in the howling wind … to get to the bottom of why it took place,"" Tataryn said. But Tataryn said that following the crash, he was instructed by supervisors to keep the investigation narrowly focused on the crew. ""I believe that they were looking out for the better interests of the corporation,"" he said. ""I was embarrassed to be a part of this investigation."" Tataryn said he believes they should also have examined potential negligence by the company. ""I originally swore an oath to uphold the law and protect the public, not to support the corporate interests of CP."" Tataryn said he was also denied access to safety records, the maintenance history of the train, as well as recordings of calls between rail traffic control and the crew from the night of the crash. ""I was after the audio recordings … anything they observed, saw, heard, what direction might have come from CP,"" he said. Tataryn said he was told one of his bosses listened to the recordings and ""there was nothing on it that had any evidentiary value."" CPPS declined to answer specific questions about its handling of the investigation. CP Police Chief Al Sauve said in an email the investigation was ""thorough"" and resulted in no charges. Sauve said Tataryn left CP Police under a cloud, and ""it would be misleading to your audience to take this disgruntled employee's comments at face value."" Tataryn said he grew suspicious after records began to disappear from CPPS's computer system. ""Those files were removed. I replaced them on two occasions. On yet the third occasion, I went back to look, they were gone,"" Tataryn said. ""I was suspicious … and sort of took other steps to safeguard information, because I knew that it would likely not be available in the future."" CPPS didn't respond to questions about the allegation of disappearing files. In a letter, Sauve said Tataryn resigned when he became the subject of a misconduct investigation for alleged infractions involving altered reports, investigative files and the storage of firearms. Sauve says their investigation found that Tataryn ""knowingly, negligently or recklessly made false, misleading or inaccurate statements in a CPPS report."" Tataryn dismisses the allegations as an attempt to discredit him, and Sauve wouldn't provide any further details of the internal probe. Disputes over the CPPS probe into the train crash reached a critical point one month after the incident, when Tataryn wrote to supervisors complaining that a lawyer present in employee interviews, paid for by CP, was hampering his investigation. ""They seemed all to be scripted and guarded, and they weren't true witness statements,"" Tataryn said. CP says that the lawyer was not working for CP and was made available to employees so they could obtain independent legal advice, if they wanted it. Tataryn said that ultimately, the CPPS investigation was abruptly shut down. ""We didn't even get to any key witnesses as far as managers or anybody else,"" he said. In his letter, Sauve said: ""The scope of CPPS's investigation was to determine actions of the crew members prior to the event regarding any outside factors that may have led or contributed to the incident itself."" CP's chief executive officer Keith Creel declined CBC's requests for an interview. When approached at a railroad conference in San Diego on Jan. 6, Creel deflected questions about the CPPS criminal probe and said he's waiting for the results of the safety investigation by the TSB. ""We've worked in lockstep with the RCMP from the very beginning,"" Creel told The Fifth Estate. ""They still retain jurisdiction over that investigation. If they want to step in or research or investigate anything that they haven't looked at prior to now, they're certainly welcome to do that."" In a statement, the RCMP said the investigation fell within the jurisdiction of the CP Police and was led by them because the crash happened on CP property. RCMP say they have jurisdiction across Canada, including in this case. But RCMP say they've never started their own independent investigation, adding they ""of course would be willing"" to step in if a request is made. ""As far as some conspiracy theory or the truth not coming out, there's no truth in that concern, that's for certain,"" Creel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cp-derailment-investigation-coverup-alleged-1.5436018,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/field-train-cp-canadian-pacific-derailment-fatal-1.5011096 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tsb-train-cp-railway-derailment-field-bc-calgary-investigation-1.5006374,N/A

Joi Scientific claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen, which would be a significant scientific breakthrough, but two former employees have told CBC News that it doesn't work as advertised. ""NB Power has indicated that they're dispatching with the final logistics of the lease arrangement that they have,"" Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland said in an interview on Tuesday. ""At that point, that will be the last of the financial obligations."" The utility, along with the Regional Development Corporation, spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. Earlier this year, Holland said he'd instructed NB Power to continue running its Florida lab while final tests were being performed in December. On Tuesday, Holland said those tests have been delayed. ""At this particular moment, I have not been presented with any proof of viability,"" Holland said. CBC News has contacted Joi Scientific for its response to the government's decision. A November statement from Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, said the company was committed to working on its technology ""in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" The statement said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. It didn't elaborate on those delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. At an appearance in front of a legislative committee in November, NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas doubled down on the utility's decision to license the technology, saying it still had ""potential."" But he said the company would decide whether to pull the plug on the project by the end of the calendar year or by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. ""Especially where we are now, we don't want to create expectation,"" Thomas said in November. ""But, obviously, if it doesn't prove out, we'll have to walk away and we'll be the first to come and tell that."" NB Power didn't immediately respond to an interview request for Thomas on Tuesday afternoon. In total, the lab has cost NB Power more than $178,000 US this year.  The utility has also spent money on travel to Florida and contracted several companies to do testing and other work on Joi's technology. That work cost the utility at least $51,000, according to documents obtained by CBC News through access to information. Two companies, Stantec and another company whose name was redacted from the documents, received between $25,000 and $100,000 to do work on the Joi project. Holland confirmed on Tuesday that NB Power will no longer spend money on that work either. Holland said that he assumes the utility and Joi Scientific will continue to communicate and that Thomas will remain on the company's board, a position he doesn't receive compensation to hold. ""I have no issue with allowing a continued peek over the shoulder as things move forward,"" the minister said. ""In the event that there is something that comes out of it then, so be it.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-funding-1.5411851,[],N/A
279,Ania Bessonov,2020-01-26T23:26:15.732Z,"In China, people wonder how open government is being over coronavirus","The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) left 44 Canadians dead, but it wasn't documented on social media. That's because Facebook, Twitter and YouTube didn't exist back then.  ""Social media adds a whole new layer to all of this messaging that's out there that I didn't have to deal with when I was reporting on SARS,"" Maureen Taylor said today on The Weekly with Wendy Mesley. Maureen was CBC's The National health correspondent who reported on the deadly outbreak back in 2003. Fake news about the coronavirus is now flooding the web, and many are taking to social media to discuss the virus, especially in China. ""It is indeed helping information to flow within the country,"" said Zhaoyin Feng, Washington correspondent for the BBC's Chinese Service.  But Feng also called it a double-edged sword.  ""Social media has also become a hot bed for misinformation.""  Every day, Feng says she opens her Weibo and WeChat to find an abundance of headlines about the outbreak. But there's almost no way to know whether any of it's true.  Officially, people are being told not to panic. Yet, horrifying videos, some of which include doctors and patients collapsing on the hospital floor, are circulating. One viral post claims that setting off fireworks can sterilize germs in the air. That spread so widely, Chinese officials had to publicly debunk it.   According to Feng, some Chinese people are criticizing their own government on social media for not being more open with information about the coronavirus. During the SARS outbreak, it wasn't possible to exert pressure via social media.  ""There was a lot of criticism against the local authority of Wuhan, saying they delayed the efforts of combating the virus by covering up some information at the early stage,"" said Feng. ""It's also making it hard for the Chinese government to cover up the story."" With Twitter banned in China, residents must opt for Weibo and WeChat — messaging platforms known to be monitored by the Chinese state. Watch: How China is handling the outbreak Online censors are busy scrubbing material the state deems ""too alarming"" and, according to AFP news, police arrested eight people for posting what it calls ""rumours"" about the virus. Feng said many in China are asking one question: ""Why, why couldn't something be done earlier?"" On Thursday, China's President Xi Jinping attempted to reassure the international community China was being open. ""China stands ready to work with the international community to effectively curb the spread of the pneumonia cases caused by a new strain of coronavirus to uphold global health security,"" he said. Initially, China was praised for its transparency in combating the virus, something that didn't happen during the SARS outbreak back in 2003.  But as more information about the virus unfolds, people are starting to question the Chinese government's initial statements.  ""Unfortunately now, it's looking a little bit like they weren't as forthcoming as they should have been,"" said Taylor. ""They initially said there was no human-to-human transmission... and that it all originated from an animal in the market giving it to somebody who worked there. And that's not true. They said there were no health-care workers affected ... Well now we know there were 14 health-care workers affected."" ""It's starting to feel a lot like SARS as far as what the Chinese are saying,"" said Taylor. Now working as a physician assistant at a local Toronto hospital, Taylor says she is confident the disease will be contained quickly ""if we have transparency and the right information coming out."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/theweekly/in-china-people-wonder-how-open-government-is-being-over-coronavirus-1.5441061,[],N/A
280,Anonymous,2020-01-26T12:00:00.759Z,Flu season and home remedies in P.E.I.'s bygone days,"Reginald (Dutch) Thompson's column The Bygone Days brings you the voices of Island seniors, many of whom are now long-departed. These tales of the way things used to be offer a fascinating glimpse into the past. Every second weekend CBC P.E.I. will bring you one of Dutch's columns.  Sometimes in the bygone days 100 years ago or more on P.E.I., the cure for the flu sounded worse than the affliction —remedies like turpentine and cow manure were not uncommon. Back then you didn't go running off to the drugstore looking for quick chemical fixes for coughs, aching joints and runny noses.  Instead, mothers and grandmothers had the salvation needed from the flu right at home, and every family had variations of certain home remedies.  One very popular cure for the flu, colds and pneumonia were turpentine and kerosene: sometimes applied externally and sometimes internally.  A few drops of turpentine or kerosene on a teaspoon of sugar was one home remedy.  ""The main medicine then in them days was either a dose of [epsom] salts, or if you got wounded somewhere or other it was always kerosene oil, and wrap it up,"" said Milton Buell from Abney in eastern P.E.I., near Murray River.  ""If you had a bad cough too, it'd be kerosene oil and sugar."" His mother would feed him five or six drops of kerosene on a half-teaspoon of sugar. ""It didn't taste too bad,"" Buell said.  Turpentine and kerosene were often mixed with various things to use externally, too: onions, garlic, and another favourite home remedy ingredient — goose grease. ""They would rub your chest with goose grease and a little bit of turpentine, I believe, at that time,"" said Kay Wood from Victoria. ""That was guaranteed to take the hair off your chest!""  Grease saved while butchering a goose would be saved and mixed with camphor oil, oil of wintergreen or cod liver oil.  Even doctors on P.E.I. practised some home remedies of their own.  Dr. MacLean in Souris made his own remedy for the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 — his own special tonic. Robbie Robertson's family of 14 children took it every morning and it seemed to work, Robertson said. Down in Murray River, Dr. Brehaut chewed tobacco to ward off the flu. Many people thought if you chewed tobacco and drank rum you wouldn't catch the flu.  And sometimes a good stiff drink helped cure the flu. Although liquor was tightly controlled on P.E.I. for much of the last century, certain retail vendors were allowed sell to any person presenting a prescription 24 ounces of wine or spirits or 12 quarts of ale ""not oftener than once a day,"" according to the history of liquor on the P.E.I. government's website. However, this quantity could be doubled if the person lived more than 10 miles from the vendor. These prescriptions came to be known as ""scripts,"" and were written by doctors.           ""If you couldn't get scripts, at that time of course moonshine was available,"" recalled Wood. ""I can remember one fella, he thought he was taking the flu — and that was the deadly flu, the very early flu — he went somewhere and he got a bottle of moonshine and he drank it, and he flopped on the floor. And the next day he was fine!"" An interesting sidebar: people were not able to freely buy liquor on P.E.I. until 1967, when the law was changed to finally abolish permits that had been required to buy it.  Some people claimed a snort of moonshine and chew of twist tobacco also did the trick of warding off the flu. Another piece of advice was ""don't stand in a doorway or you'll catch the flu."" That old adage was often repeated — people believed doorways were where germs are most prevalent. If there was congestion in the chest with the cold or flu, you may have been administered a mustard plaster, which was a popular home remedy until fairly recently.  They were a mixture of one-third flour and two-thirds dry mustard, mixed with hot water into a thick paste then applied to the chest or back and covered with a cloth. Sometimes goose grease or onions were added too.  Dorothy Palmer trained as a nurse in the 1920s. ""But nursing was nothing like it is today,"" she explained. She was instructed to administer mustard plasters every four hours to patients who had pneumonia, along with lots of fresh air from an open window no matter the weather. ""And you just slapped them on for 20 minutes then left them, then in four hours you had to slap them on again,"" Palmer said. ""That was the only treatment we had. Sometimes they got better and sometimes they didn't.""  One old Maritime cure for a fever was an application of warm cow manure, fresh from the cow. Others went with salt herring. Amy Bryanton from Spring Valley lived to be 104. She told Dutch about one cold she had at the age of four or five.  ""We had neighbours just lived across the field from us,"" she said. ""Jake Duggan and the wife, Ellen. Somewhere or other they had heard that I was sick with the cold. So Mrs. Duggan told mum to take a salt herring and split it and put one on each foot, tie it on each foot, to take the fever down.""   That's exactly what her mother did, but then they had to carry Bryanton anywhere she wanted to go, because she had herring tied to her feet.  Salt herring had almost magical healing powers as a home remedy — people wrapped it around their necks to cure a bad cough, as well as salt pork.  As smelly as that sounds, it was an alternative to one even smellier cure. In Britain, people were given horse dung water: a mixture of horse manure, ginger, molasses and other spices, Dutch reports. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-remedies-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.5434375,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-nicknames-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-history-1.5419336 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-home-remedies-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.5026152 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-winter-ready-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-1.5377440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dutch-thompson-bygone-days-minnie-langille-1.5322499 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-confederation-trail-biking-1.5288069 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bygone-days-dutch-thompson-school-1.5270620 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-canada-winter-games-2023-update-1.5433370 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-government-partners-medical-society-doctor-recruitment-2020-1.5433244,N/A

282,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-08T13:00:00.380Z,The RCMP said it didn't have any records about an investigation. But it had thousands.,"The RCMP is apologizing for saying it didn't have any records about its 11-month investigation into the death of Michel Vienneau, who was shot by a Bathurst Police Force member in 2015. In fact, the police agency had more than 10,000 records about the Nova Scotia RCMP's investigation into Vienneau's death, which led to criminal charges against two Bathurst Police Force officers. The charges were dropped in 2017 after a preliminary inquiry. More than two years after CBC News asked for the records through an access to information request, and more than four years after Vienneau's death, the RCMP disclosed nearly 1,800 pages of documents and more than 1,000 images and videos related to the investigation. That came only after an investigation by the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The RCMP blamed human error, saying the search for records wasn't done properly. ""Although in the end it is clear that we did not meet our obligations, this appears to be a process failure, not the result of any ill-intent,"" Dan Brien, the RCMP's director of issues management and media relations, wrote in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""I am not aware of any intent to hide or suppress information on the part of RCMP personnel."" No one from the RCMP was made available for an interview. Minutes after Vienneau was shot outside Bathurst's Via Rail station on the morning of Jan. 12, 2015, Nova Scotia RCMP officers were called in to investigate. New Brunswick doesn't have its own serious incident response team like neighbouring Nova Scotia. Instead, police agencies from other jurisdictions are often tasked with investigating police-involved shootings or deaths. In this case, the two subject officers were employed by the Bathurst Police Force but worked in the now-disbanded Northeast Integrated Intelligence Unit. The unit, made up of officers from several police forces in the area, including RCMP, focused on gathering intelligence about drugs and organized crime. Vienneau appeared on the officers' radar that day when their supervisor, RCMP Sgt. Ron DeSilva, now an inspector, received Crime Stoppers tips that Vienneau was returning from Montreal with a load of drugs. The tips were false. For months, a team of Nova Scotia RCMP officers pieced together what led to the shooting. They interviewed about 100 witnesses. Lead investigator Larry Wilson described the investigation as ""complex"" and ""exhaustive"" in an email he sent to his team after the investigation concluded. ""The fact that the subjects of this case are police officers added another layer of complexity but each and everyone of you brought an unbiased and professional approach to your tasks,"" Wilson wrote. But when CBC News asked for all records about the Nova Scotia RCMP investigation into Vienneau's death, the RCMP had a surprising response. ""Based on the information provided, a search for records was conducted in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"" Insp. Richard Haye of the RCMP's access to information and privacy branch wrote in a May 2017 letter. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to locate records which respond to your request.""  How is it possible that a division of Canada's largest police force could spend months on a complex investigation into a man's death but not have any records about the investigation? It wasn't possible because it wasn't true. The original request, filed in February 2017, also asked for records that detailed the process of sending the file to the Crown, which has to approve criminal charges in New Brunswick, and about the false Crime Stoppers tips that led police to Vienneau on the day of his death. CBC News filed a complaint about the request in June 2017, suggesting it was inconceivable the RCMP wouldn't have records about a lengthy investigation. ""We posed numerous questions regarding the institution's processing of your request and the nature of their search for the records requested,"" the investigation report from the commissioner's office says. ""A second tasking was conducted and the RCMP located relevant records which were then reviewed to determine which documents could be released.""  An investigator with the Office of the Information Commissioner was tasked with reviewing the records, combing through nine CDs. One CD had thousands of written records on 6,645 pages. There were also more than 3,500 photos, videos or audio records that were reviewed, according to correspondence sent to CBC News. Some of those records ultimately weren't disclosed, for a variety of reasons. Some were duplicates. The final package didn't include any video recordings of what unfolded that day outside Bathurst's Via Rail station. According to the Nova Scotia RCMP's report on the shooting, no such video exists. While the commissioner's investigation prompted the RCMP to disclose records it previously said it didn't have, it doesn't explain what went wrong in the first place. That's problematic for Ken Rubin, an Ottawa-based investigator and researcher who has spent decades using Canada's freedom of information system to draw out information that's in the public interest. ""I think they have to be held more accountable,"" Rubin said about the commissioner's office. ""You can't just go from no records to 10,000 and say, 'Oh, aren't we wonderful. We got the records for you.' No, what happened? Come on.""  In its explanation, the RCMP said it relies on people to search its records. ""In addition to our ongoing challenges related to the scope and volume of incoming requests, we occasionally encounter situations where individual searches do not identify all the documents that they should,"" Brien wrote in an email. ""In this case, through the Information Commissioner's investigation, we discovered that, for a variety of reasons, the document search was not executed properly."" He said not all of the units that should have been asked to search were asked to do so. Others who were searching found no records, which wasn't accurate. ""This situation has provided us with valuable insight into gaps in our system and we will continue to take every opportunity to improve our processes."" Rubin sees the case as part of a larger problem with the RCMP's access to information system. Last year, the RCMP was wading through a backlog of unanswered requests, prompting the police force to reverse a policy that forced members to go through access to information to get their own medical or personnel files. RCMP backlogged with access-to-information requests from its own staff Earlier this year, an access to information officer emailed CBC News to ask whether the requester still wanted overdue records from 2017, noting the RCMP is ""experiencing a high volume of requests with limited resources."" ""It's common knowledge that the RCMP, at least in terms of access to information, has not been that well organized or forthcoming in the last few years and has huge delays and some other problems … they are not the top of the transparency bureaucracy,"" Rubin said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vienneau-rcmp-foi-1.5387196,[],N/A

284,Jane Sponagle,2020-01-25T13:00:00.576Z,Behind the scenes of the rescue of the last solo climber on Mount Logan,"At 6:45 a.m. on June 1, 2018, Monique Richard called Parks Canada for help. The Quebec mountaineer was in her tent, 5,550 metres up on Mount Logan. The batteries on her communication device were getting low, and she was running out of food and fuel.  Richard was cold and exhausted. She hadn't slept since reaching the summit two days before. She was the first woman to reach Canada's highest peak on her own — and may have been Mount Logan's last solo climber.  This winter, Parks Canada put a moratorium on solo climbing expeditions on the mountain, citing dangerous and expensive rescue missions.  Documents obtained by CBC News through an access to information request detail what happened behind the scenes of Richard's rescue in 2018. Mount Logan is located deep in Kluane National Park and Reserve in Yukon.  All climbers need to apply for a permit. The application form says mountaineers need to prepare for extreme conditions, including storms, strong winds, zero visibility and temperatures below –40 C. The form says between 1973 and 2015, about 4,000 climbers and skiers visited Kluane's icefield ranges, and 15 people died. Richard is an experienced climber who's completed the Seven Summits — meaning she's summitted the highest peak on each continent. In a written statement to CBC, she called Logan her most significant achievement as a mountaineer. But something went wrong on her descent.  One note in Parks Canada's rescue incident report says she ""gave up."" Another internal email cited fatigue. After Richard called for help, rescue plans quickly formed. Kluane officials called for back up to Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska and Banff National Park in Alberta. A few hours after the initial call, an update on Richard's condition came through her agent Francois Masse. She reportedly had no fuel, one bar of food and one litre of water. The forecast showed stormy weather coming in, making any rescue attempt by helicopter difficult.  Parks Canada staff decided to first drop a bag with food, fuel, medication for acute mountain sickness, and a radio to Richard. Then they'd find a way to return and pick her up, either by a long line or basket. Richard was not willing to move from her spot.  The bag-drop mission that afternoon failed when weather forced the helicopter to turn back.  The incident team's notes from the call say Richard was trying to descend, but couldn't. She wasn't feeling sick, but her face and lips were cracking from the wind and sun. She was feeling discouraged. The helicopter team set up a base at Logan Cabin, 25 kilometres north of Richard's waiting spot at Prospector's Col. The team prepared for the bag drop and looked for Richard's tent.  They couldn't see it. They were looking for a green tent — the colour listed on Richard's expedition application — but in fact her tent was red. Eventually they spotted her and dropped the bag. They reported seeing her leave her tent to get it. Meanwhile, two other climbers had become involved in the rescue — and would be instrumental in its success.  Earlier in the day, Parks staff had contacted Stephane and Guillaume Gagnon. The father-and-son team were at Camp 3 on Mount Logan. At an elevation of 4,800 metres, they were closest to Richard.  The Gagnons made it to Camp 4, at 5,200 metres, but they were freezing and not acclimatized so they were told to stay put.  Early the next morning, Francois Masse, Richard's agent, told the incident team that he talked to Richard the night before. He said Richard was quite weak and it was stormy all night. He said it was too windy for her to use her stove. ""Panicked at first when start talking then calms down,"" is how Richard is described at this point in the incident report. At 10:30 a.m., Richard called Parks staff. ""Very low energy levels today. Likely unable to put on screamer suit today,"" the notes say, referring to the full-body harness used in a helicopter rescue. ""Have to eat and drink. Rationing food and water because worried about long term. Afraid to eat because she doesn't want to go to bathroom. Her mental state is getting worse (she sounds worse),"" say the incident report notes. Eventually the Gagnons reached Richard and helped get her down to Camp 4, but they weren't sure she could make it further.  The Parks Canada team planned a helicopter rescue involving either a full-body harness or a basket from Denali.  ""Big relief. Pressure off now,"" Gagnon told Parks Canada over the phone.  The incident report says Richard at that point was ""no longer resistant to moving. Feels like she wants to play along now."" An internal email says that at around 8 p.m., the helicopter picked up Richard from Camp 4 on a long line and landed at Logan Cabin. Two hours later, she was back in Haines Junction, safe and sound.  The Parks Canada team debriefed the following morning and discussed lessons from the rescue.  Some of the suggestions included buying a rescue basket, and putting a rescue cache at 5,200 metre elevation, like what's done on Denali.  There's one bullet point that stands out in the incident report: ""No solo climbers."" In a written statement this week, Parks Canada says the moratorium was not due to Richard's rescue, but for the safety of its staff and visitors. It also says a rescue basket has been purchased. Richard declined an interview with CBC News this week, but offered a written statement on why she ""had to seek help."" ""Mountaineering presents significant and unique challenges and dangers, and things do not always go as planned and there is always an element of unpredictability, even for the most experienced and well-prepared mountaineers,"" it reads. Richard thanked the Gagnons and staff from Parks Canada and Horizon Helicopters for their help. She said she hoped the moratorium on solo climbs of Mount Logan will be temporary. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/behind-mount-logan-rescue-1.5436993,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/new-rules-climbers-mount-logan-kluane-1.5428705,N/A
285,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-24T20:45:38.018Z,"China, Canada among WTO members backing alternate trade dispute scheme","As the U.S. continues to paralyze the World Trade Organization's appellate body, 17 members of the trade organization announced Friday that they will collaborate on an alternative system for resolving trade disputes that emerge between them, following the lead of an initiative by Canada and the European Union. The announcement was made on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where ministers representing like-minded trading partners have been grappling with how to proceed as a group, unless and until American concerns about the WTO can be resolved. ""We believe that a functioning dispute settlement system of the WTO is of the utmost importance for a rules-based trading system, and that an independent and impartial appeal stage must continue to be one of its essential features,"" said the joint statement released Friday by the group. The WTO continues to try to resolve disputes at its committees. Panels are still struck to review complaints and report back with their findings when member countries are alleged to have broken the rules. But as of December, the WTO's appellate body no longer has enough members to hear any more appeals of these panel reports, arresting the process by which complaints are resolved and retaliation is sanctioned. The United States is blocking the appointment of any new adjudicators until its concerns — which, in some cases, predate the Trump administration — are addressed and the mandate and scope of the appellate body's jurisprudence are clarified. Without a consensus among its members on how to proceed, the trade organization is paralyzed. Canada's complaint about American softwood lumber duties is one of the cases for which an appeal cannot be heard unless this standoff is resolved. ""Our Canadian businesses rely on a predictable, transparent system,"" International Trade Minister Mary Ng told CBC News on her way home from Davos Friday. ""Dispute resolution is an important function of this."" Canada's first priority remains finding a permanent solution to the appellate body impasse, but in the meantime, this statement is ""really encouraging"" and ""a big step in the right direction,"" Ng said. ""These efforts have developed a consensus among a diverse group of members,"" she said. ""It's not a small task."" Canada and the European Union first announced an interim arrangement for resolving trade disputes with each other last July. It didn't replace the appellate body but it serves the same purpose. Building on that, fifteen more countries have signed on to this idea with this latest initiative, which at the moment remains separate from the system Canada set up with the EU. They are: Many of these countries met in Davos this week as part of the WTO's Cairns group: agricultural exporters who share the  common cause of liberalizing trade barriers. Improving initiatives that support Canadian producers and agri-food exports is a key priority for 🇨🇦. In <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Davos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Davos</a>, Minister Ng met with fellow members of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/CairnsGroupWTO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CairnsGroupWTO</a> to discuss how to advance agriculture negotiations at the <a href=""https://twitter.com/wto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@wto</a>. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WEF20</a> 🌐 <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WTO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WTO</a> <a href=""https://t.co/qkeYBbR7ua"">pic.twitter.com/qkeYBbR7ua</a> Not all of Canada's key trading partners (beyond the U.S.) signed on to Friday's statement. Japan, for example, isn't onboard — at least not yet. The most significant signatory may be China. Many American complaints about the WTO stem from doubts that the terms of China's WTO membership are fair. But a 2018 analysis by researchers from the Cato Institute found that China does a ""reasonably good job of complying with WTO complaints brought against it.""  Neither China nor the U.S. was part of the Ottawa group, a collection of WTO members that also held a working dinner in Davos hosted by Ng to continue reform talks that began under Canada's leadership in 2018. Its door was left open to China or any other country that wanted to propose solutions. Friday's agreement now sets 17 WTO members back on a path to being able to resolve future disputes with China, a dominant player in international trade because of its massive market size, manufacturing capacity and corresponding economic influence. Ng didn't comment on China's participation specifically but said that ""it's a positive thing that all these countries signed on, including China."" Friday's statement characterized this new interim system as ""contingency measures"" to ""allow for appeals amongst ourselves"" when the findings of those panels are in dispute and members' rights are threatened. It's based on Article 25 of the WTO's dispute settlement rules, which allow for multi-party interim arrangements. The statement says it will be in place ""only and until a reformed WTO Appellate Body becomes fully operational"" and any other WTO members are welcome to join those already signing on. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed Friday's statement. ""However, this is only an agreement to make an agreement,"" it said on Twitter. ""Canada and the EU have a mechanism in place, so why reinvent the wheel?"" Officials must now determine how this new multilateral appeals process will work and what arbitrators will hear its cases.  ""We have also taken proper note of the recent engagement of President Trump on WTO reform,"" the group's joint statement said. ""We are very much looking forward to discussing WTO reform with the U.S.,"" Ng said, without providing any specifics on how the U.S. has reacted to this development. ""We've talked to all WTO members that this was in the works."" In his closing news conference before leaving Davos Wednesday, the American president told reporters that a delegation from the WTO will visit Washington next week or the week after. Because the WTO doesn't make top-down decisions, but only proceeds based on a negotiated consensus between members, it's not clear that any kind of deal could result from these talks with Trump, although they could allow the White House to communicate its concerns directly to the WTO's directorate. ""We're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" Trump said, without elaborating on what he has in mind. WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo did not address the new temporary appeals system in a news conference in Davos on Friday, but said WTO members meeting in Davos for informal ministerial talks had discussed the tasks ahead, including fixing dispute settlement at the WTO. ""There are options out there, we are trying to fix it, but we're not there yet,"" he said, adding that many papers and ideas had come forward. ""I would say that I would be confident that more progress will be possible in the short term."" Separately, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland arrived in Davos Friday to attend a meeting of the WEF's board of trustees. She wasn't previously listed among other cabinet members attending the forum.

He has helped build brands for more than 35 years and is a frequent commentator on political marketing, most recently on CBC's Power & Politics. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Business leaders dread them. They are set off by almost anything — competition, new regulations, changes in technology — and they force a company to adapt or fall by the wayside. Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel and a brilliant strategist, called them ""strategic inflection points"" and argued that, if managed right, these decisive moments can be an opportunity to win and emerge stronger than ever. The Conservative Party of Canada is now facing its own strategic inflection point. Political parties are complex creatures, and political brands are equally complex to build and manage. Therefore, battle-tested political strategists tend to rely on what they view as proven strategies and tactics. However, the Conservatives lost an election many thought they should have won, and they're now in search of a new leader. If ever there was a time the party should avoid doing the same thing while expecting a different outcome, this would be it. And in the course of trying something different, those political strategists could benefit from some marketing advice. WATCH | Power and Politics host Vassy Kapelos speaks to Éric Blais and ​​​​Dennis Matthews, a conservative strategist and vice-president at Enterprise Canada, about a potential fresh strategy for the Conservatives: The leadership race officially started this week. Don't just pick a leader. Pick a spokesperson with impeccable communications skills who is fluent in Canada's two official languages. Someone with strong name recognition and the gravitas to be the next prime minister. There isn't time for a Joe Clark to go from obscurity — Joe Who? — to prime minister. Even more importantly, don't let the leadership race influence the party policies that will be required to win over Liberal voters. Get those right, and do it now. If you don't, you risk hiring the wrong spokesperson (a blue, red or pink Tory) who will come across as inauthentic during the next election. Listen to new voices. There's a reason most organizations hire outside consultants for objective, fact-based advice: they usually tell it like it is. The party brand is seen as ""closed,"" according to a recent survey by Abacus Data. It's time to open it up to new thinking. The Conservative base of core supporters is solid, but not large enough in Ontario and Quebec to win the next election. So spend less time preaching to the converted who won't have anywhere to go even if they don't like some of the more progressive policies required to attract Liberal voters. Andy Grove was also known for his ability to ""look forward and reason back."" Take a page from his playbook and adapt the Conservative brand's promise to a changing Canada, while remaining true to the principles of conservatism. The next election will be about shaking loose Liberal supporters who are restless for something new. Please, don't use a slogan like ""Change you can trust."" Find something inspirational about the kind of change you'll bring to people's lives. Start a movement based on shared hope. Invite Canadians to vote for you because you're the better option, not because you're the one they distrust or dislike the least. And don't call them taxpayers. Pick a slogan and stick to it. Why wait until an election is called to express simply and concisely what you're about? Just do it. Permanent campaigning is a reality we can't escape. You might as well begin communicating what the party stands for even before the leader is elected in June. It will have the added benefit of making party members understand the Conservative strategy before choosing the right spokesperson. And stop being so negative. Many advertisers know they're wasting half their budget, they just don't know which half. There's a good chance the Conservatives wasted the large portion of their budget that was spent on relentless attack ads. That kind of ad worked against Stéphane Dion and Michael Ignatieff, but voters appear to have accepted that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised and still re-elected him. You've made your point. Run contrast ads during the next campaign but, in the meantime, focus your advertising on communicating your party's rebranding and on introducing the team, not just the new leader. Everyone marvels at the possibility of micro-targeting to reach specific groups of voters with a specific, tailored message. It's absolutely necessary as long as you have reliable data. But what will be equally important leading up to the next election is a plan to win votes in the Québécois nation — incidentally, a term used by Stephen Harper in a motion approved by the House of Commons in 2006. It may rattle some in Western Canada, but it's the only clear path the Conservative party has to form the next government. Experienced political strategists and pollsters who have lived in war rooms may think this advice from a marketer fails to recognize the unique realities of politics. It may be so, but marketing literature is filled with success stories of brands that broke the rules in order to break through and find new markets.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-conservative-party-strategy-1.5418732,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-next-conservative-leadership-1.5400959 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-party-brand-survey-1.5411086,N/A
287,Taylor Simmons,2020-01-25T12:50:33.689Z,"Indigenous theatre company explores grief, loss and laughter in new production","Like so many Indigenous people in Canada, James Dallas Smith's family history involves time at residential schools. His grandmother is a survivor of one, but despite what she went through, one of the things the Anishinaabe actor said he remembers most about her is her sense of humour.  ""She laughed so easily and so often. I didn't realize until much later in life that it was probably a survival tool, but I loved it,"" he said. Teepees come to city hall to honour residential school survivors Former residential school students connect with culture and each other That concept, of using humour to get through pain, is being explored in Native Earth Performing Arts' new production, This Is How We Got Here, says Smith. The Indigenous theatre company is dedicated to producing pieces reflecting Indigenous experiences in Canada. The play is about the suicide of a young person — an issue many Indigenous communities are grappling with — but it's also about using laughter as a way of bringing people together in times of sorrow. ""As hard as the subject is, there's still lots of moments where you laugh,"" he said. ""I think it's a big part of resilience, is humour, and it's what allows us to move on.""  The 2018 Governor General-nominated play, written by Algonquin Métis playwright Keith Barker, is being performed by an all Indigenous cast at Aki Studio in Regent Park from Jan. 26 to Feb. 16. Ahead of its opening day, Our Toronto spoke to the cast and crew about the story they're portraying and why it's important.  You can watch the story below, or read on to learn more.  The production is written and directed by Barker, who is also the artistic director of Native Earth Performing Arts. He said the idea for the play came from losses in his own life. 5 Indigenous youth spreading hope in communities on World Suicide Prevention Day ""My aunt and uncle lost both their sons to suicide, and I spent many years with them … and out of that I saw how they were dealing with grief,"" he said. ""Then, a couple of years ago a family friend took his own life, and so again I was present and watched as friends were also dealing with that … that was really kind of what solidified I needed to write a play about what the aftermath of a great loss is."" Anishinaabe-Ashkenazi actor Tamara Podemski plays 'Lucille,' one of four characters dealing with a loss in the production. ""I think it's impossible to talk about some of these realities that our communities are going through right now without bringing it back to colonization, without bringing it back to intergenerational trauma,"" she said. ""This is a family that is doing their best to process something horrible that happened, but when you don't have the tools and you haven't learned the tools from your parents … it's really hard to navigate."" Dallas Smith said just like in the play, many Indigenous families are still trying to reconnect with their way of life. As a result, they're sometimes unsure of how to deal with a tragedy culturally.  At times, the characters look to nature for answers — an element Barker said he often includes in his productions — in this case, through a fox continually stealing from the family garden.  ""One person thinks it's a ghost. One person thinks it's a reincarnated spirit. Somebody else just thinks it's a fox,"" Dallas Smith said. ""But it's the element of magic and mystery that I think weaves the play together. It's beautiful."" For him, the main takeaway from the story is the resilience of this family and the journey they take to become open and honest with themselves — and each other. ""It focuses on how they get through the tragedy, how they move on and discover themselves again."" Of course, humour is present to get the characters through their grief. ""The joy factor is huge,"" Pedemski said.  ""It's a huge component of healing, of reminding us of the good feelings, and it's contagious."" When people leave the play, Barker said he wants the audience to feel a sense of hope and to realize it's possible to rebuild connections with family and friends around them. ""There are so many times when I've been in places where people from the audience, young Indigenous people or even elders, coming in just saying like, 'It's the first time I've seen myself reflected back,'"" he said. ""It just constantly reminds me how we find connection through storytelling.""   The play was published by Playwrights Canada Press in 2017 and the published version was a finalist for the Governor General's Literary Award for Drama in 2018.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/this-is-how-we-got-here-1.5439470,[],N/A
288,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-24T18:51:25.357Z,"Texas murder suspect arrested in Halifax remains detained, refuses to leave cell","An American murder suspect nabbed in Halifax will remain detained until February, when he'll have another hearing to determine whether he's admissible to Canada, a member of the Immigration and Review Board ruled Friday. Derek Cameron Whisenand was scheduled to appear before the board Friday morning for both a detention review and an admissibility hearing, but refused to leave his cell in Halifax. A board member maintained Whisenand's detention on the basis he was a flight risk and a danger to the Canadian public. Dianne Tordoff also agreed to proceed with a hearing on admissibility on Feb. 11, regardless of whether Whisenand has secured counsel by then. The admissibility hearing scheduled for Friday was adjourned because Whisenand had the right to be present. ""But if a person refuses to attend, the board must proceed with celerity — we can't just keep postponing the hearing,"" Tordoff said. Whisenand, 28, is a suspect in the June 2019 death of a 78-year-old man in Eastland County, Texas, about 170 kilometres southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He has been detained since his Dec. 30 arrest, which came after police responded to a call about the shoplifting of work boots at a Walmart in the city's Bayers Lake area. A police report filed as an exhibit in connection with his detention said Whisenand had been living in a tent in the woods with his dog near the busy shopping district. According to the report by Halifax regional police, he was arrested after leading officers on a foot chase and only stopped after a constable threatened to use her Taser on him. The police report alleged the fugitive was wearing brand-new beige work boots that still had the price tags on them. He was evasive with Halifax officers and gave a false name — Christian Bates — before the officer found a tattered U.S. social security card with his real name on it, without a birth date, the report states. After giving police his date of birth, he allegedly pleaded with them to let him go on a promise to appear so he could fetch his dog at the campsite. Police confirmed they found a tent, clothing, dishes and dog food in a wooded area not far from where the alleged theft took place. The dog was seized by animal control officers. Whisenand was subsequently turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency and has refused to answer questions from immigration officials. In July, RCMP warned that he had illegally crossed into Canada near Haskett, Man., sometime during the week of June 24. Authorities in North Dakota said Whisenand's vehicle was found about three kilometres from the Canadian border. Whisenand hasn't explained how he got to Nova Scotia, but he was believed to have gotten a ride from the border to Winnipeg, then headed towards Atlantic Canada. He has no family or friends in Canada and has been detained at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. Whisenand didn't participate in his initial hearing on Jan. 2 and told the board at the second one on Jan. 8 that he wished to consult with a lawyer before proceeding on the issue of admissibility. Michel Gallant, a CBSA hearing officer, said Friday that officers have tried to interview Whisenand, but he's rebuffed their attempts. Gallant also said the U.S. consulate in Halifax will provide an emergency travel document if Whisenand is ultimately ordered removed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/new-stamp-commemorates-black-hockey-league-1.5437722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/northern-pulp-mill-boat-harbour-government-environment-1.5437969 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,N/A

290,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-23T21:26:05.755Z,Woman pleads guilty to helping cover up Candace Stevens's homicide,"A Moncton woman has confessed she helped cover up the crime of the man who killed Candace Stevens in 2018. Wendy Losier, 42, was charged earlier with comforting or assisting James Curtis, also known as James Knight, on Oct. 26, 2018, for the purpose of enabling him to escape. She was also accused of transporting Stevens's remains on Oct. 27. Court documents show Losier pleaded guilty to the charges before the Court of Queen's Bench on Wednesday. The documents present the first picture of what happened the day Stevens was shot to death at Curtis and Losier's home in Fredericton. Stevens's remains were found inside a hockey bag on Oct. 27, 2018 in Upper Derby, near Miramichi. She was the mother of a young girl and was working at a Fredericton spa at the time of her death. Curtis was the same man who opened fire at a Walmart in 2018, then died at the end of a lengthy police chase. The court documents reveal Stevens showed up at 530 Regent St. in Fredericton on Oct. 26, 2018, looking to speak with someone by the name of ""Nick."" She believed he was responsible for shots fired at her car. Stevens ""physically assaulted"" Curtis and Losier, the documents say. Curtis tried to calm Stevens down and said he was on his way to call ""Nick"" to discuss the damage to Stevens's car. Documents show Stevens tried to push her way up the stairs, shoving Losier against a TV and coffee table. Curtis returned with a gun in one hand and a cellphone in the other. When Losier left the two alone and went back upstairs to her bedroom, she heard between two and five gunshots coming from downstairs. Autopsy results found multiple gunshot wounds to Stevens's chest and abdomen, which caused lethal bleeding. She also had multiple illicit drugs in her system. When Losier came back downstairs to see what happened, she saw Stevens lying on the floor, begging for help. Still holding onto the gun, Curtis ordered Losier to pack a bag. He told her they were going to Miramichi. He then made some phone calls to people saying, ""I need help"" and ""I'm coming to the Miramichi."" Curtis was ""white as a ghost"" and crying when he told Losier he shot and killed Stevens.   But with the help of a friend, whose name was not mentioned in the documents, Curtis moved Stevens's body to the basement, while Losier smoked drugs and packed a bag upstairs. Losier told police they were high on crystal meth and Curtis was snorting pills. The duo slept at a friend's place that night and returned for the body the next morning, although Losier refused to go back inside the building. They also brought an undisclosed number of guns with them.  Curtis packed Stevens's body into a large hockey bag. Her body had been wrapped in hospital blankets with a yellow cord and plastic bags held together with red tuck tape. Her body was placed in the trunk of Losier's Saturn Ion. They were on their way to Miramichi when Curtis stopped the vehicle on a dirt road off Highway 8 near Blackville, where Curtis left the hockey bag on the dirt road. Afterward, they stayed together at Curtis's parents' home in Miramichi. There, Curtis told his mom that he shot someone and that person died. While they were there, the Regent Street apartment where Stevens died was also set on fire.  At the time, Fredericton police said Stevens's death was considered a homicide, and the house fire was connected to her death.  A sentencing hearing for Losier will be held in Fredericton on Feb. 21.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wendy-gail-losier-moncton-homicide-case-1.5437894,[],N/A
291,Shawn Jeffords,2020-01-21T23:57:56.001Z,"Public health restructuring should be negotiated, not forced, report states","Any merger of health units must be negotiated and not forced, public health officials in Peterborough, Ont., said Tuesday as they urged Premier Doug Ford's government to let communities drive service amalgamations. The recommendation is one of a series included in a discussion paper released Tuesday by the city's board of health at a rural municipalities' conference in Toronto. The board chairman of Peterborough Public Health said the agency wrote the report as the province conducts consultations on its plan to reduce the number of provincial health units from 34. ""As they try to determine the right number, that needs to come through conversation,"" Andy Mitchell said. ""It needs to come from the bottom up, from the communities."" Premier Doug Ford's government announced in the 2019 budget that it planned to begin a sweeping merger of public health units by 2020-2021, saying at the time it would strengthen the system. The government said it had conducted a review of the province's public health units and believed their structure did not allow for consistent service delivery. Ontario's public health units co-ordinate services including vaccination programs, infectious disease outbreak investigations, and restaurant inspections. The consolidation would mean that health units would serve larger geographic regions, which include communities with different needs. But Health Minister Christine Elliott appointed special adviser Jim Pine last fall to conduct consultations with municipalities who had warned that the amalgamation, coupled with changes to public health cost-sharing with the province, could jeopardize services and result in frontline staff layoffs. A spokeswoman for Elliott said Tuesday that consultations continue but the government intends to move forward with its plan to ""amalgamate certain units."" ""This work will be directly informed by feedback from Mr. Pine's consultations and, as such, it is too early to say how many units the province will establish or when amalgamation will start,"" Hayley Chazan said in a statement. Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, Peterborough's medical officer of health, said the local health board is encouraging the minister to build on established strengths of many public health units, including those in rural Ontario. ""Amalgamations of boards, particularly into regional, rather than local structures, threatens both the accountability and the responsiveness of public health governance,"" she said. The report does not oppose merging health units, but said that based on studies, the agencies should not serve populations greater than 500,000. Any new model must also take into account rural communities' ability to pay, it adds. ""Funding should be predictable and consider factors such as equity, population demographics and density, rural/urban mix,"" the report said, adding it should also ""increase to meet new demands."" Dr. Joyce Lock, the chief medical officer for Southwestern Public Health, said that agency was created in May 2018 as a result of a voluntary merger between two health units near London, Ont. The former Elgin-St. Thomas Public Health Unit and Oxford County Public Health Unit separately served 205,000 rural and small city residents. The agencies joined together to ensure they could continue to provide programing after multi-year funding increases below the rate of inflation, she said. ""Without longer-term efficiencies we would need to shutter some programs,"" she said. ""Our amalgamation has allowed us to pool our resources, become a stronger voice for rural public health and blend the best of our skills, talent, and knowledge."" Lock said their merger will save money over the long-term, but urged the province to take a ""thoughtfully planned, strategic, and well-funded"" view of the process. ""It takes dollars and time up-front to save dollars and time down the road,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-public-health-1.5435445,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/reconsider-public-health-restructuring-region-waterloo-1.5245480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lhin-management-jobs-cuts-1.5055191 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ontario-health-super-agency-private-health-care-funding-1.5039944 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-are-ontario-health-teams-doug-ford-government-1.5035750,N/A
292,Susan Bell,2020-01-24T19:29:48.991Z,"Cree interest in private home ownership very high, but issues with readiness remain: report","Programs to increase financial literacy and education encouraging high-income earners to move out of social housing are just some of the ideas put forth in a housing report prepared for the Cree Nation Government.  The report was commissioned to evaluate the readiness of Quebec Cree to buy their own house, and to help communities address some longstanding log jams with regard to a lack of housing and maintenance.  There is an immediate need for more than 2,000 homes in Eeyou Istchee, and getting more people to move into private home ownership is one way the Cree Nation Government is trying to tackle the housing issue and help build wealth in Cree communities. The report, titled Market Research: Private Housing in Eeyou Istchee, suggests interest in private home ownership is very high, but readiness is low, according to Irene Neeposh. She brought together the findings and recommendations of a survey of more than 300 Cree currently living in social housing and from focus groups with housing committees and co-ordinators. ""Close to 90 per cent of people say they have thought of building,"" said Neeposh, but added that slightly more than 6 per cent of those people have actually made an application with their local band office.  The report makes 18 recommendations to close that gap — like developing programs in financial literacy, project planning and home maintenance. Other recommendations include diversifying the types of housing available and providing financing options for home buyers, with a goal of better supporting Cree who want to buy a home.  Some of the obstacles to home ownership are inability to save, a lack of financial readiness, low income levels and long waiting lists to build, according to the findings of the research. ""The report is really useful to plan how to solve problems we have right now for both social housing and private home ownership,"" said Cree Grand Chief Abel Bosum. He also said while financial readiness is an issue, a more fundamental obstacle to home ownership has been band offices with limited ability to guarantee mortgages. In 2019, the Cree government moved to remove a 75-year limit on land leases and Bosum said that will allow Cree homeowners to build up equity in their homes and not need a band guarantee. The Cree government is also setting up a $100-million fund to help more people access private home ownership. It hopes to have the fund in place beginning in April of 2020.  The report also points to a need for more financial accountability in the social housing system in Cree communities. Slightly more than half of the survey respondents currently living in social housing said they were up-to-date with their rent and 62 per cent said they had paid their rent in the last month.  Neeposh said the housing committees all identified non-payment of rent as a serious problem that has negative impacts. ""The results from non-payment end up deteriorating the existing units,"" said Neeposh. ""It doesn't also allow for the housing departments to provide services or proper management.""  Neeposh said most housing co-ordinators recommended more education and accountability in the social housing system to help people understand the importance of paying rent. They also want the Cree Nation to explore the idea of setting up a Cree collection agency to help build financial capacity. Chief Bosum said non-payment of rent is a difficult issue for local housing departments to manage.  ""Arrears have been an issue for a very long time. That is one of the problems with the program itself, because even if you were to evict someone, where do they go?"" said Bosum.  He said all levels of Cree government have to work together to look for solutions, adding that it is less of an issue with younger Cree families. The report also pointed to another problem — high-income earners living in social housing.  Neeposh noted that housing department staff said having options in Cree communities like transitional housing, starter homes, rent-to-own and co-rent options could help encourage more high-income earners to move on to private home ownership.  The Cree Nation Government will table a housing strategy next week.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/housing-cree-strategy-private-home-ownership-1.5438379,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/housing-private-home-ownership-cree-nation-viens-commission-1.4953096,N/A
293,Frances Willick,2020-01-17T10:00:00.809Z,When donors cross the line: Charitable sector grapples with sexual harassment ,"As Carly Butler got ready to attend another big gala for her job as a major gifts fundraiser, she put on a special dress she'd often wear on such occasions. But for this particular event at a high-end Nova Scotia resort, she took an extra precaution, placing a safety pin at the neckline to be prudent. She'd heard there had been ""bad behaviour"" at the event in the past. As she and her co-workers arrived at the resort, one charity staffer joked to the crew, ""OK, ladies, lock up your vaginas!"" Soon after, Butler had an experience she would later describe as ""a general disrespect"" of her professionalism. Her job as a fundraiser for the IWK Foundation — the charitable organization that supports the women and children's hospital in Halifax — required her to drum up $1.5 million in donations the year she was employed there. During the event, a potential donor asked her to meet him outside in 10 minutes so they could drive his luxury car down a nearby private runway, even though he was drunk. When she said no, he told her she could drive — that there were no police around, and what happened at the resort would stay at the resort. She didn't get in the car that day nearly five years ago. But she worries that younger or more vulnerable women starting out their fundraising career may have. As the #MeToo movement continues to sweep across industry after industry, some in the fundraising sector say it's time for their profession to step up efforts to tackle and prevent sexual harassment. Workers in some fundraising roles can be particularly vulnerable to harassment due to the deep power imbalance between fundraisers — who are often young women, and whose jobs depend on meeting donation targets — and donors, who are often wealthy older men. And events like golf tournaments, galas or auction evenings — especially where alcohol is involved — are ripe for abuse of that inequality, say industry insiders. CBC News spoke with nearly a dozen women across the country who work in the non-profit sector. Nearly all had experiences of being harassed by donors or other employees, either with unwanted touching, sexual innuendo or inappropriate propositions. One spoke of a former premier grabbing her butt at an event, another of an older donor putting his hand on her knee and offering to ""treat"" her to a night at the iconic Ottawa hotel Chateau Laurier, while another woman told of a men's group of potential donors leaving a photo of a naked woman on the podium where she was about to speak. Jacquie Stoyek, who worked in marketing at the IWK Foundation for about five years until leaving in 2017, attended the same fundraiser as Butler. She recalled seeing a businessman — already intoxicated first thing in the morning — making comments about a foundation staff member and pretending behind her back to grab her butt. Stoyek said a senior foundation staff member saw that and gave her a look that said, ""Watch out for this one,"" and it became an ongoing joke. The IWK Foundation declined to answer any questions about the fundraising event, saying in a two-sentence statement it is ""unable to provide comment on the specific circumstances"" of Butler and Stoyek's allegations. But at the time — after Butler reported the luxury car incident to her peers and superiors — she was told not to go to future meetings with that donor by herself. Butler said the man cancelled a followup meeting with her when he learned she would not be alone. The IWK Foundation said in a statement: ""With respect to the issue of harassment, it is a very important topic in every sector and we continue to work within our organization to foster a culture of openness, respect and safety."" The foundation would not comment on whether the event is still taking place. A survey on sexual harassment conducted in 2018 by the Harris Poll for the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that a quarter of female respondents and seven per cent of male respondents had experienced sexual harassment in the field. The survey involved about 1,000 fundraisers, including about 900 people living in the U.S. and 100 living in Canada. In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, a donor was the perpetrator. But less than half of those who were harassed told their organization about the incident. Beth Ann Locke, who until recently served as the chief philanthropy officer for the B.C. Women's Health Foundation, said women are worried about the questions that will be asked — ""What did you do to make him do that? Did you flirt with him?"" They are also concerned that reporting the incident will hurt their career, say many in the industry. If they no longer work with a major donor who has harassed them, they may not get invited to events, be asked to take on large accounts or meet their donation targets for the year. At small organizations, there often isn't another staffer who can take over an account involving a harasser. Fundraisers are also passionate about the organizations and causes they work for, and are reluctant to do anything that could harm them, say several of the women interviewed by the CBC. Locke is one of the co-founders of Ms. Rupt, a group that aims to spark conversation and action on challenges facing female fundraisers. ""What drives me crazy is that all of us as fundraisers work to help people who have no voice — so whether that's the Amazon rainforest or, you know, dogs in Halifax or people with dementia, right? ""And yet we don't stand up for ourselves and we kind of allow this to happen in our own profession."" Locke said she has experienced several incidents of harassment over the course of her career, including someone asking her to be their ""mistress,"" someone stroking her arm and commenting on her skin and an uninvited hand on her knee under the table. She said the most severe instance of harassment occurred years ago while she was working in the U.S., when a superior grabbed her wrist — which she promptly wrenched away — and then held his erect penis through his clothes, saying, ""This is what you do to me."" Locke said she reported the incident to human resources, which forced the man to take three days off without pay and lectured both parties about ""this kind of stuff going on in our office.""  ""It was like a dressing-down you'd get from your parents,"" Locke said. That type of lacklustre response does not appear to be unusual, according to the Harris Poll survey. Of the respondents who had experienced sexual harassment and told their organization about it, 71 per cent said no action had been taken against the perpetrator. Thirty-five per cent of respondents who took steps to deal with the harassment said they experienced a negative impact on their career after reporting it. Locke said organizations within the non-profit sector need to take allegations more seriously. She said she's heard stories of organizations giving donors or other perpetrators a ""pass"" for harassing behaviour: ""'He's sweet.' 'Oh, don't worry about it.' Even kind of a 'he doesn't know what he's doing' thing.… Or 'they're from a different age when that was allowed.' I've heard that one."" Some smaller non-profits that run on a shoestring budget don't have a separate human resources department to deal with complaints.  Lucy White, a Toronto consultant for the non-profit sector, said one of the barriers to change in the industry is that when people do file complaints about harassment, the cases are often settled out of court and out of the public eye, often with non-disclosure agreements that forbid them from discussing details. ""So the real problem is no one ever admits publicly that they did anything wrong and we never find out any of the facts,"" White said. ""We're left in the dark about how often this kind of thing happens."" That silence also means other organizations and those who sit on their board of directors never learn what kind of financial repercussions can stem from findings of harrassment, and the liabilities their own charities could face if allegations emerge. ""What happens is they think it's not a big deal, right?"" White said. There is some movement afoot to help prevent sexual harassment in the fundraising sector. The Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), an organization that has 3,500 members across Canada and over 30,000 internationally, has formed the Women's Impact Initiative to address challenges facing women in the sector. The AFP, which helped commission the Harris Poll survey, is following up on the results by interviewing fundraisers about their experiences of job-related harassment. The association already has a donor bill of rights that outlines what donors are entitled to as a result of their donations, but it is now considering developing a similar document outlining a donor's responsibilities when working with fundraisers. Some in the profession say non-profits should take other concrete steps, including implementing and enforcing clear anti-harassment policies, overtly encouraging employees and bystanders to come forward with complaints and improving diversity on boards of directors. But money is often the bottom line for charitable and non-profit organizations. Perhaps accepting donations from harassers is where the buck must stop, said Caroline Riseboro, the president of AFP Toronto, the largest chapter in the world. ""If targets are missed, boards tend to get nervous. But, you know, boards need to understand if targets are missed because of a harassment issue, then that's OK. Better to keep employees safe than to meet the target or the goal."" Riseboro said she believes most boards do take action when they know about instances of harassment, but board members often don't realize the behaviour is going on. For some in the fundraising sector, any impending cultural change has come too late.  Butler, the fundraiser who worked for the IWK Foundation, left the profession, saying despite the enjoyable aspects of the job, ""there's a whole bunch of distasteful things about it"" — including, sometimes, the dynamic between the people who work in fundraising and donors. ""It doesn't feel great after a while.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-harassment-fundraising-1.5426629,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/metoo-sexual-violence-harassment-fundraising-1.4945951 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cobequid-toll-highway-highway-104-public-private-partnership-1.5426142 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cbu-prof-plans-to-commercialize-waste-water-cleaning-technology-1.5429702 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/man-found-not-criminally-responsible-for-killing-wife-gets-her-life-insurance-1.5429351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/woodpecker-phone-line-cable-internet-servic-1.5430134 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cermaq-st-marys-bay-public-meeting-fish-farm-salmon-company-council-1.5429551,N/A
294,Courtney Dickson,2020-01-24T13:00:00.965Z,'It was pretty real': B.C. band's latest song reflects on overdose death of childhood friend,"Cayne McKenzie, lead vocalist with Vancouver-based rock group We Are the City, had already started writing a song about losing a loved one when his childhood friend, Kyle Tubbs, died suddenly from a fentanyl overdose three years ago.  That song ultimately became the title track on the band's latest album, R.I.P, released Thursday night.  The group started writing the song about friends growing apart, becoming interested in different things and following different paths. When Tubbs died, it took the existing vocals out of the song and improvised new lyrics, which is what is now featured in the song.  ""I was just lying on the couch by myself and I just listened to the song, and I was listening to some of Kyle's music as well,"" McKenzie told Radio West host Sarah Penton.   ""That was it. There is a lot of time and a lot of emotion put into it but actually not a lot of thought put into it. It was pretty real."" This is Kyle Tubbs. A deep soul and an artistic genius. We have released a song today — it's called RIP. The song was written, mostly, before Kyle died. A sad song about feeling like he was fading as a childhood best friend, I was mourning our friendship. <a href=""https://t.co/HG5Pk9HYzF"">pic.twitter.com/HG5Pk9HYzF</a>   The song looks back at the last time McKenzie saw Tubbs, drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, while sharing music with each other. Shortly after, the lyrics reference memories of his friend that may fade over time and thank him for their friendship. From there, the song becomes increasingly emotional, as McKenzie's voice seems to become uneasy.  Drummer Andrew Huculiak said that while he's anticipating the song will be special, he's also dreading it.  Releasing a song that personal and emotional comes with challenges, including playing it live over and over again. The band has just started rehearsing it and working on how to perform it.   ""It's one of those songs that I don't think it's possible to disconnect from the emotion of it,"" he said. ""It's a good thing that it isn't. I mean that's what people go to shows [for], to see something true.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/we-are-the-city-rip-1.5438669,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/max-merrifield-different-tracks-1.5296983 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/new-normal-overdose-fentanyl-crisis-1.4314578 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/southpaw-tyler-hay-ottawa-music-1.5077992,N/A
295,Rosa Marchitelli,2020-01-20T02:26:20.853Z,Caught on camera: Man chases dangerous driver after 911 puts him on hold ,"Sam Gill says he had a knot in his stomach as he watched a driver in front of him barrelling down a busy road in Mississauga, Ont., weaving in and out of oncoming traffic, jumping a curb and hitting a snowbank so hard the impact knocked his headlight off, though that didn't stop him. When Gill dialled 911 for help, he was put on hold.  Just before 8 p.m. on a Sunday last month, Gill spotted the other motorist ""driving erratically — can't stay in his lanes, can't maintain control of the vehicle.""  ""Every second that passed, I'm thinking, 'Oh my god, somebody is going to die,"" he said.  Canadians make an estimated nine million calls to 911 every year, taking for granted that someone will answer, says Holly Barkwell, the Canadian region director of the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), an international organization that works to improve 911 service. ""Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere across Canada,"" she says. In reality, Barkwell says, the 911 system might not work as expected because it's fragmented, underfunded and operating on technology that's over 50 years old. ""It's been ignored too long. It's an issue of public safety.""  There are no mandatory standards in Canada, but voluntary standards set by NENA in 2006 say 90 per cent of 911 calls should be answered within 10 seconds, and 95 per cent within 20 seconds. But because there is no national oversight on 911 service, there's no way to tell how Canada measures up.  In Gill's case, he was on hold for almost six minutes (his phone was hands-free) while he chased the dangerous driver — honking and flashing his lights, trying to warn others to steer clear. ""At this point I'm saying to myself … if [911] doesn't answer, should I push him off the road? I might hurt him in the process, but I might save his life and potentially the lives of others,"" he said. Peel Regional Police, which runs the 911 service in Gill's area, says it was swamped with double the usual number of calls at the time, adding it had a ""record number"" of calls in 2019, though an exact number wasn't available.  By the time an operator answered and police arrived, the driver had crashed into another snowbank and passed out behind the wheel, with his vehicle still in drive, Gill said. He says an officer told him the man was drunk. Peel Regional Police wouldn't confirm that with Go Public.  Similarly, Helena Shepherd-Snider couldn't reach 911 when her husband had a heart attack in 2016. Instead, she got a recorded message saying the number was not in service, and to dial zero for the operator. Initially, she says the operator refused to call for her, telling Shepherd-Snider she should do it herself. ""It felt like a double whammy. [I was thinking] where else can I go? What can I do? Time was of the essence,"" she said. After about 15 minutes, she convinced the operator to call 911. She credits fast-working paramedics for saving her husband's life. When the dust settled, Shepherd-Snider discovered everyone on her block — about half a kilometre outside Sudbury, Ont. — had 911 service except the last four houses including hers.  Depending on where you live, 911 is run by municipalities, the police or the province, while telecom companies are responsible for supplying the network needed to connect the calls — an example of how the system is fragmented, according to Barkwell.  When Shepherd-Snider called Bell and the municipality, she says they ""passed the buck"" — neither correcting the issue. Instead, Bell cut off 911 service to her neighbours. ] The company tells Go Public that their block is outside Sudbury's service boundaries and that Shepherd-Snider's neighbours ""had been erroneously provided with 911."" The city says those houses are a provincial responsibility and have separate emergency numbers for ambulance, fire and police. Shepherd-Snider had no idea.  The shortcomings of the 911 system were flagged back in a 2013 CRTC report and, says Barkwell, haven't changed. The report found: One of the biggest problems, according to Barkwell, is that 911 services still use old analog technology, which makes it difficult to locate people using mobile phones. She says mobile apps have a better chance of locating someone than 911. ""The biggest question I get from people often is how come Uber can find me and how come Domino's Pizza can find me but 911 can't find me?"" Barkwell said. A number of recent deaths have highlighted other problems with 911 services, and how they co-ordinate with emergency personnel.  B.C. is promising changes to its 911 system after a woman bled to death after waiting 35 minutes for an ambulance in Vancouver in 2018. An ambulance was dispatched promptly, but attendants were unable to reach her because the doors and an elevator in her building were locked, and firefighters were called in too late.  In Ontario, the deaths of four people in two separate incidents led to dozens of recommendations from the provincial coroner, and to a bill meant to address problems with 911.  ""People have lost their lives and people will continue to lose their lives,"" said France Gélinas, the NDP MPP, who last year put forward Bill 75, which is currently before the social policy committee.  Gélinas says she doesn't believe the Tory government will pass the bill, however, and, when asked by Go Public, the provincial Ministry of Health wouldn't say. Spokesperson David Jensen said the government has established a task force to look at the problems with the system, including the coroner's recommendations. Ontario does not have legislation to govern delivery of 911 service or to provide secure funding for it. Certain provinces, including Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Quebec do. In March, the CRTC introduced a plan to modernize 911 networks in Canada. As part of that plan, telecoms must upgrade from analog technology to digital by June 30, 2023.  It's a good start, says Barkwell, but doesn't address the many other problems like inconsistent or inadequate funding.  In the meantime, after his experience with the dangerous driver in Mississauga, Sam Gill says he worries what might happen to his family or others if there is another emergency. ""We've lost our faith and that's not a good feeling,"" he said. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

296,Amina Zafar,2020-01-23T02:08:58.060Z,How Canadian hospitals and airports are preparing for new coronavirus,"Health-care workers on the front lines of Canada's preparations for the new coronavirus are gearing up to treat potential infections and prevent spread. Those preparations will continue regardless of whether or not the World Health Organization declares the outbreak spreading in and beyond China a global health emergency on Thursday. The agency was expected to  make a decision on Wednesday but delayed, citing lack of information. China remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with more than 500 cases. Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have also confirmed cases. The head of the WHO's health emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said the priority now is to find out how the virus is passing between people and to limit it. ""We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" he said. Given the speed of global travel, Canadian officials have said they would not be surprised if the virus lands here. If so, airport screening would offer one measure in efforts to control the spread. But passengers arriving here may not show any symptoms for days, which is why hospitals and health-care officials are getting ready. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> Standard infection control practices like isolating potentially sick patients are key, experts say. At Toronto General Hospital's emergency department, staff have already had some practice in the form of three patients who tested negative. ""We've had three patients come in with a travel history who presented with these symptoms,"" said nurse Debra Davies, the manager of the emergency department. ""They've done a phenomenal job in getting those patients into the isolation."" ""As long as we keep an eye on it, we should be well prepared,"" she said. Davies is a veteran of the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 that infected more than 400 people in Canada and killed 44. Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in northwest Toronto, says there were lessons learned from SARS. ""I can't stress enough how incredibly unprepared we were for SARS,"" he said. ""We're in such a better position now."" During that outbreak, Gardam recalls running around trying to buy respirators and setting up negative pressure rooms to isolate patients. When Humber River opened in 2015, it was designed with outbreaks and infection control in mind, and such equipment and design principles are built into the new hospital. Horacio Arruda, head of Quebec's public health authority, said Wednesday five people in that province were under surveillance for possible exposure.  Hospitals in Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia have also announced preparations for cases.  The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) acts as the lead agency for dealing with the coronavirus, through the Quarantine Act. Under PHAC's direction, Canada Border Services Agency officials will now ask travellers: ""Have you been in Wuhan, China, in the past 14 days?"" There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. Additional signs at airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will remind passengers to speak to border officials if they have flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough.  ""We are in the process of putting up signs on the electronic screens warning travellers that if they've been to an affected area to essentially determine if they've been in contact with live animals, sick people,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday on CBC's Power & Politics. If so, CBSA agents can alert a federal quarantine officer to do an assessment, which could include a temperature check. Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory as well as provincial government labs in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have a battery of tests to detect respiratory pathogens, including one that's in the works for the new coronavirus, Allen said.   So far, Canada is not planning to use thermal imaging to monitor travellers en masse, as was tested during the SARS outbreak. Tam said the current assessment of the risk to Canada is ""low."" Steven Hoffman, a law professor and director of the Global Strategy Lab at Toronto's York University, and an expert on global health, supports Canada's screening approach so far. ""Not everyone who has a high temperature is going to have this novel coronavirus. In fact, only a very small percentage would,"" said Hoffman. The first U.S. patient illustrates one of the weaknesses of airport screening — the man in his 30s did not have symptoms when he arrived and was in good condition, so he wouldn't be picked up in a check for fever. Rather, when the man started feeling ill, he went to a doctor, with a fever and cough. Lab tests confirmed the infection and he was put into isolation for monitoring. Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician in Toronto, said there's a delay between when people are infected and when they develop symptoms — the incubation period. For coronaviruses in general, such as those that can cause the common cold, the incubation period is typically five or six days. With coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, the incubation period can extend to 14 days. ""You can imagine if an individual is infected and they get on a plane and it could be up to two weeks before they manifest symptoms. In today's world you could literally go around the Earth before you start to develop illness,"" said Khan, founder and CEO of BlueDot, a digital health company that helps predict the spread of infectious diseases globally. ""We need to kind of think about that in the context of how airport screening works. The value of airport screening and engagement with travellers, if you will, is more about giving them the information they need so that if they do become sick after they've left the airport they know what to do."" Health officials stress precautions for travellers to  prevent infection while in China, such as staying away from animal markets, washing hands, observing cough hygiene, not coming into contact with sick people and telling health-care providers about their travel if flu-like symptoms occur.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,[],N/A
297,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-22T15:11:34.498Z,"As teen recovers from near-fatal accident, his family bonds with teen who struck him","As Alex Nelson lies in a dimmed room at the Saint John Regional Hospital, he grips a set of cream-coloured rosary beads.  They were a gift from Hanna Bordage, the 16-year-old girl who was driving the black Honda that struck him earlier this month near the corner of Prospect Street and Duncan Lane in Fredericton. ""Alex has not let go of it since,"" said his mother, Terri Taylor. The crash left the 18-year-old with a serious brain injury, and he spent days fighting for his life. ""I just keep trying to remind myself of the little bits of light through all this darkness,"" Taylor said. Although Taylor wishes she could go back in time and change what happened that day, she wouldn't take back meeting the Bordage family. The near-fatal crash on Jan. 8 sparked an unlikely friendship between the two Fredericton families, who otherwise might never have met. The families have supported each other in Facebook messages, a joint visit to the hospital where Alex is staying and a handwritten note about forgiveness. ""We're going to get through this together,"" Taylor said. Over the past two weeks, Taylor has used Facebook posts to keep family and friends updated on Alex's recovery from the crash. One of the posts asked readers to pray for the driver who hit him. That's when Hanna decided to reach out to Alex's family. She sent a Facebook message to Julia, Alex's 16-year-old sister. Hanna introduced herself and asked how Alex was making out in hospital and apologized over and over again for striking him.  ""She didn't mean to hurt him,"" Taylor said. The two families decided to finally meet in person. Hanna, her mom, aunt and grandmother met over the weekend at the hospital in Saint John.  ""You don't know what to say,"" said Hanna's mother, Joemana Bordage. ""You just know you have to be there."" Hanna sat outside while her mother went into Alex's hospital room. She wasn't ready to meet him face to face just yet.  Both mothers understood. When Alex's mother told him Hanna's mother had come to visit, he reached out and squeezed Bordage's hand.  Weak and unable to speak clearly, he whispered into his own mother's ear. He asked about Hanna. ""He is fighting for his life in a hospital bed and he is concerned about Hanna,"" said Bordage, who held back tears at the time. Then Bordage gave him Hanna's rosary beads, which she'd received after her baptism at six months old. He weaved the beads through his fingers. ""That's how we get through things,"" said Bordage. ""We pray.""' Hanna, a Grade 11 student at École Sainte-Anne in Fredericton, was driving home from school in a snowstorm on that day in early January. The newly licensed driver knew the roads were poor. And Hanna's father cautioned her to be careful and drive slowly — even if it angered other drivers. The teen even turned the music off inside her car to concentrate. The avid soccer player and straight-A student said she was driving 20 kilometres below the speed limit when she spotted a pedestrian walking in the same direction on the side of the busy street. There aren't any sidewalks in that area. She swerved into the median of Prospect Street — putting herself in danger — while trying to dodge the pedestrian, who was Alex.  But it was too late. Her car hit Alex and sent him into the ditch. Hanna immediately called 911. When paramedics arrived, Alex's face was swollen and covered in dirt.  There was blood everywhere. Just before the crash, Alex told his mom he was going for a walk to Tim Hortons.  The Grade 12 Fredericton High School student battles anxiety and depression, so walking was a way to clear his head. ""The last thing I said to him was, 'Be careful and I love you,'"" said Taylor. About 20 minutes later, she heard sirens about 100 metres from her home. She didn't think anything of it and drove her daughter, Julia, to work at the north-side Dairy Queen. When she returned home, Taylor noticed her son's black Sorel boots weren't in the doorway. ""I had this sickening feeling consume me."" Instinctively, Taylor ran out of the house, in her navy snowflake pyjamas and white slippers, to the accident scene, where police confirmed it was her son who had been hit. Alex was immediately sent to the Saint John Regional Hospital. He had surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The surgery lasted just over an hour, but ""felt like a million years,"" Taylor said.  ""We were just moments away from losing him."" Taylor is adamant the crash wasn't Hanna's fault. In fact, she believes the teen's quick reaction is what kept Alex from suffering more serious injury. ""She is as damaged emotionally as my son is physically,"" Taylor said. There haven't been any criminal charges following the crash. Alex will be staying at the hospital for several months and will move to the Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation in Fredericton after that. Taylor and Bordage have been texting and talking over the phone — especially on the bad days. They share jokes, laugh and cry together. ""We'll forever be family now,"" Taylor said. Alex has broken bones on the right side of his skull and his maxillary sinuses are shattered. He is relearning how to walk and eat on his own. The right side of his face is paralyzed.  In the future, Alex could struggle to walk and talk — he could even lose his memory and cognitive ability. Doctors still don't know whether he'll be the same person he was before the crash. But he did manage to write his first sentence this week:   ""I'll always forgive.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/car-crash-friendship-mothers-brain-injury-1.5433745,[],N/A
298,Courtney Dickson,2020-01-26T22:04:13.372Z,Open rehearsal program invites audience to watch theatre in the making,"If you've ever wanted a behind-the-scenes look at the performing arts, a new program at UBC Okanagan gives the public unique access to theatre as its made. The Public Theatre Project invites artists to book time — for free — to rehearse and teach classes on the university stage. The catch: it's open for the public to watch.  The initiative was launched by performance instructor Tracy Ross, in an attempt to bring the campus community and the arts community in Kelowna together. ""It allows [students] to understand what resources and opportunities exist within Kelowna,"" Ross told Daybreak South host Chris Walker, noting that it also gives artists access to unique, diverse voices within the university.  ""Because we have a really contemporary young population, these artists that are developing new work or putting something on by having an audience come in, they get to have a really fresh outlook on what it is that they're doing."" Another benefit to hosting an open theatre session is it gives audiences more appreciation for what they see on stage. Simultaneously, artists, both emerging and established, get to practice in a larger space than what they would typically have access to; the theatre seats about 200 people.  By allowing the public to come and watch performances, it also gives the artists a feel for how an audience reacts to their work.  ""It's really a process-based environment where people can see all of the things that go into creating choreography or a play ... it's really up to the artist in terms of how they engage the people that are there,"" Ross said. Since the program launched earlier this month, the Canadian School of Ballet has already used the space to prepare for an upcoming competition. Ross also organized a Playtime through the project where the public was invited to participate in physical theatre, read through scripts and talk about a play.  ""Anybody who showed up that day we put them onstage if they wanted to be there,"" Ross said. The space is open for bookings, and public viewing, Sundays from 1p.m. to 4 p.m.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ubco-public-theatre-project-1.5440078,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/all-bodies-dance-vocaleye-translations-dance-vancouver-1.5364691 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/kelowna-immigrants-study-1.3467278,N/A
299,Morgan Modjeski,2020-01-23T12:00:00.328Z,Some Onion Lake residents say info about diphtheria not coming fast enough after 2 cases confirmed,"People in the community of Onion Lake are feeling uneasy after two cases of a rare infection were found in the area, but health officials say there's little to no risk of the infection spreading further. Last week, Indigenous Services Canada wrote to band leaders of the Onion Lake Cree Nation near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border indicating that two cases of diphtheria had been diagnosed — one on the reserve itself and the other in a nearby community. For one mother, the diagnoses have been troubling. ""I am terrified,"" said Roxanne Littlewolfe, a mother of six and educational assistant in Onion Lake. She said she's been hearing a lot of the same from other people in the community, especially mothers who have just had children. Littlewolfe said many people have questions and she doesn't think enough information about the infection is circulating in the community. ""There's not enough information for us to go on it,"" she said. ""It's just going ear-to-ear and mouth-to-mouth."" The Onion Lake Health Centre has posted some information about the illness on it's Facebook page, but Littlewolfe said she'd like to see a community-education event organized because some in the area aren't connected to the Internet or social media. ""If they had somebody come in to actually speak about the 'do's and the don'ts' and the 'what ifs' I think our community would have a better understanding."" According to the Centre for Disease Control in the U.S., diphtheria is an infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. The infection occurs in the respiratory system or on skin. With treatment, 1 in 10 diphtheria patients die and that number jumps up to 5 in 10 if left untreated. Officials say the Onion Lake diphtheria cases were not linked to one another. Albert Jimmy, the health director of the Onion Lake Health Board Inc. said band leadership is working to distribute information about the infections. Fact sheets have been distributed to schools, teachers, healthcare professionals and in the community at large.  Jimmy said he had plans to go on local radio Wednesday to relay information about the infection, but the broadcast was delayed. Instead, the broadcast will take place Thursday. He said leadership is working with Indigenous Services Canada to make sure information is flowing. ""I understand people are scared, they were texting me and some parents weren't going to be sending their children to school, so we have to reassure them,"" he said.  Jimmy said medical staff in the area treated the infection quickly and were able to contain its spread.  ""All we need to do is keep people informed more and we're trying to do that,"" he said.  When asked about the idea of hosting a public event to inform members of the community about the infection he said ""we're open to all suggestions"" and it's something he'll be approaching leadership about this week.  Dr. Ibrahim Khan, Regional Medical Health Officer with Indigenous Services Canada, said the community did an excellent job identifying and containing the infection. At this time, no additional resources have been requested. ""So far, I have offered all sorts of support to the community, but they say they are O.K. and if they need anything they will let us know,"" said Khan.  He said he's also had an opportunity to speak with the affected patients and their families directly and has been in frequent contact with health officials and nurses on the frontline in the community.    Khan said if the community decides to host an event to inform community members, representatives from Indigenous Services Canada will be present.  ""I'll be there. Our nurses will be there. Our team will be there,"" he said. In the letter sent to Onion Lake leaders last week, it explained that people may be at risk of infection because the vaccination rate for diphtheria in the Onion Lake area is below the desired target. However, Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the medical health officer responsible for overseeing communicable diseases within the Saskatchewan Health Authority said the provincial vaccination rate for the province is solid.  ""My understanding is even on First Nations communities their coverage for this vaccine is very high ... more than 90 percent of the population have been immunized with vaccine that protects against diphtheria,"" he said.  He said there hasn't been a case of diphtheria in the province for ""many years"" and stressed that professionals in Onion Lake took the correct steps to contain the infection.  Anyone with concerns about their own or their child's immunization record should get in touch with their local health officials to ensure all vaccines are up to date.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/diphtheria-onion-lake-1.5436957,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-sask-vaccines-1.5117395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/african-swine-flu-university-saskatchewan-1.5422544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-coronavirus-1.5434143 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/two-cases-diptheria-onion-lake-cree-nation-sask-1.5434377 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-warned-about-coronavirus-2020-1.5436690,N/A
300,Adam Carter,2020-01-23T16:10:10.093Z,"E-learning is no boogeyman, but would be costly to implement properly, expert says","Online learning isn't the massive problem that Ontario's embattled teachers unions are making it out to be, according to a leading expert in the field — but he says to properly implement it across the province would likely prove very costly. Michael Barbour, associate professor of instructional design at the College of Education and Health Sciences at Touro University California, told CBC News that political rhetoric is masking the possible benefits that e-learning could bring to Ontario. But with few concrete details about how the program would roll out, he says it's difficult for people take an informed stance. One thing is for sure, Barbour says: to do this right wouldn't be cheap. The province would need to hire more teachers to support students, properly outfit classrooms and computer labs, and work with telecom companies to ensure broadband access in rural areas. ""It's going to be a lot of money, a lot of purchasing, [and] a lot of set-up in a very short period of time,"" said Barbour, a Canadian who has been involved with K-12 online learning in countries including Canada and the U.S. for decades as a researcher, teacher, course designer and administrator. ""If the government embarked upon this because they believe it is going to save money, then that was a fool's journey."" E-learning has become a major talking point in the fight between the provincial government and education workers, alongside class sizes and compensation for teachers. The province announced last year that it would require high school students to take four online courses in order to graduate. After considerable blowback, Education Minister Stephen Lecce scaled that number back to two. Students graduating in 2023-2024 would be the first cohort required to complete the two courses, selecting from options like Grade 11 biology, Grade 12 data management, and Grade 10 career studies. Union leaders have repeatedly said that bringing in mandatory e-learning courses would hurt the province's education system. Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation president Harvey Bischof appeared on CBC Radio's Metro Morning Monday, and said the province wants to ""impose mandatory Alabama style e-learning that every piece of evidence says is not constructive for many of our students."" Larry Raines, coordinator of the educational technology section at the Alabama Department of Education, dismisses that idea outright. He told CBC News that since online classes were first offered in 2006, enrolment has ballooned from 300 students to over 27,000, and the results have been largely positive. ""We worked to make sure we were not out there to take the place of teachers,"" Raines said in a phone interview. ""We're actually employing almost 1,000 teachers across the state."" Comparing Ontario to Alabama also doesn't work, because completion of Alabama's online courses isn't mandatory for graduation. Instead, the state has a guideline that dictates every student must have an ""online experience"" to graduate, but an online course is just one way to achieve that. Barbour says he understands why a union that's embroiled in a labour dispute would want to hold up Alabama as an example. ""I did my PhD down in Georgia, and the common saying in Georgia was, 'Thank God for Alabama, because otherwise Georgia would be the worst education system in the U.S.,'"" he said, adding that Alabama historically has had very poor performances on both national and international assessments. ""But that's not because of online learning,"" he said. An examination of Alabama's graduation numbers shows there's not really a difference before or after online learning was implemented, he said. ""Alabama has a bad education system for a variety of reasons."" Part of the problem here, Barbour says, is the province has released very few details about its plans for the program, so people can't really make an informed decision. ""The ministry hasn't done a good job of actually telling us what they mean,"" he said. Ministry of Education spokesperson Alexandra Adamo told CBC News in a statement that that province is ""committed to building a world-leading online learning system to strengthen Ontario students' competencies in the modern economy. ""We are proceeding with developing and implementing a made-in-Ontario program that will ensure student flexibility, technological literacy and a vast selection of courses, through two mandatory courses over the lifetime of a student's high school career."" Adamo could not, however, say how much that program will cost. ""The full financial and policy implications of the online learning strategy are subject to the development of the ministry's final implementation plan. Once these elements are finalized, the ministry will provide more information,"" she said. Some research from the U.S. has lauded e-learning as a viable education option, while other reports are less bullish. A 2014 study based out of Harvard University that examined Florida's online course offerings did not find any evidence of negative effects of virtual education on student learning. But in 2018, The Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute examined how effective online learning has been in that state, and found that online learning was failing poorer students. Despite the fact that 62 per cent of enrolments in Michigan were students living in poverty, researchers saw a gap of nearly 20 percentage points between the pass rates for those students (48 per cent) and students not in poverty (66 per cent). The institute says that in the last decade, the number of virtual learners in Michigan nearly tripled, but the statewide virtual pass rate did not improve — instead, it has steadily decreased from 66 per cent in 2010-11 to 55 per cent in the 2018 academic year. Still, Barbour maintains that e-learning could work in Ontario if students are properly supported. ""Technology, be it a classroom that's using a traditional chalk board or white board, to a high-tech classroom ... to an online class, it's just a medium,"" he said. ""And what impacts learning is how we design, deliver and support that learning within that medium."" But he says he also understands why unions are pushing back during this round of bargaining, given what he sees as comparisons between the current Ford government and when Mike Harris was in power back in the 1990s. ""The idea that the motivation behind a lot of the measures that they're making is based upon cost saving, that's a real concern for folks that are trying to collective bargain right now,"" Barbour said. ""It's a reasonable position to take."" adam.carter@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/e-learning-ontario-1.5436788,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586,N/A
301,Andrew Lupton,2020-01-24T19:33:38.273Z,London street preachers arrested at Queen's campus in Kingston,"Two men notorious for shouting scripture and confronting people on the street in London were arrested Thursday in Kingston, Ont., and charged with causing a disturbance near the campus of Queen's University.  Kingston Police confirm they were called to reports of a disturbance at the corner of Earl Street and University Avenue just after 3 p.m.  Although police would not release the names of the men arrested, birth dates provided by police and photos taken at the scene confirm they are Matthew Carapella and Steven Ravbar. Both men were already facing criminal mischief charges in London in response to complaints of them entering a church and confronting parishioners. Photos from the scene show Ravbar and Carapella wearing their familiar sandwich-board signs with Biblical messages directed at women. Photos from the scene show Carapella being arrested and put into a squad car.  Police say the men were held briefly at the station before being charged under section 175 of the Criminal Code and released.  Kingston police were notified by campus security after female students complained the men were calling them out for what they were wearing.  One of them was Tegwyn Hughes, a fourth-year history student at Queen's and a journalist with the Queen's Journal, the university's student newspaper.  Hughes was notified by a friend that the men were near campus and she went to interview them for a story. Both men refused her request for a comment but then made a remark about what she was wearing.  ""They told me that wearing pants was going to drive men to lust, and that I should wear a long flowing skirt,"" she said. As she continued to walk away, she said the men told her she would be going to hell. Campus security told Hughes that police had been called. While she waited, she watched from across the street as Ravbar and Carapella continue to approach women.  ""They'd say that they were dressed whorishly, that they were listening to music that was letting Hollywood brainwash them to be immoral,"" she said.  The story of their arrest was published in the Queen's Journal. While staff were researching the story they learned of Ravbar and Carapell's reputation in London. ""It gave me impression that in London these men are really well known and so they were looking to go into a new market and hopefully not be as prosecuted as they had been previously,"" said Hughes.  Hughes said a handful of students, many of them women, gave statements to police.  The Kingston incident appears to follow a recent trend of the men operating outside of London.  In June they appeared in Port Stanley and just before Christmas women in Waterloo complained that the men had shouted slurs at them.  In the past the men have attracted police attention for the disturbance at the London church and in the southern United States.  Their next scheduled court date for the London incident is Feb. 18. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/street-preachers-kingston-1.5439151,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/london-street-preachers-1.5095811 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/street-preachers-port-stanley-1.5172937,N/A
302,Anonymous,2020-01-25T11:00:00.883Z,"'We're doing everything we can' to end hallway medicine, says Premier Doug Ford","Premier Doug Ford says his government has made ""tremendous progress"" on tackling hospital overcrowding, despite evidence this week that Ontario hospitals are routinely putting patients in hallways.  Ford promised during the 2018 election campaign to end hallway medicine in the province. He was asked about the overcrowding problem Friday, following a CBC News investigation that revealed dozens of hospitals filled to overcapacity on most days.  ""I think we've made tremendous progress,"" Ford said at a news conference at Peel Regional Police headquarters in Mississauga. ""We're putting the resources in. We're doing everything we can to clean up hallway healthcare and we are putting a dent in it."" Statistics provided by the Ministry of Health for October through December show the total number of Ontario hospital patients housed in what are termed ""unconventional spaces"" — including hallways, meeting rooms, and kitchenettes —dropped between five and six per cent from the same months of 2018. However, that still meant that on an average day in November, 997 patients were not in a proper hospital room. Figures obtained by CBC News showed that 32 hospitals across Ontario were filled beyond their official capacity for at least 100 days during the first six months of 2019.  Hospital overcrowding has been an issue of particular concern in Peel region, particularly in Brampton. Ford met Friday with Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, whose city council this week declared a health care emergency over hallway medicine. The declaration called for extra funding to the city's two hospitals and an additional 850 beds.  Asked during the news conference for his response, Ford said, ""Yes, we will support a hospital in Brampton,"" without adding any details.  ""That public statement is encouraging and we're going to hold the government's feet to the fire to make sure they honour that commitment,"" Brown told reporters.  However, Ford's press secretary clarified later that Ford was not making a new commitment, but reiterating the government's support for a project that is already in the planning stages, a 250-bed expansion of the Peel Memorial Centre for Integrated Health and Wellness. Its planning phase began in May 2018, during the final days of the Kathleen Wynne Liberal government.  The Ford government needs to do more to end hallway healthcare, Liberal party leadership candidate Steven Del Duca said Friday. ""There are steps the government can take today that will have an immediate impact,"" Del Duca said in a statement. He called on the government boost funding to hospitals that are running deficits because of high patient demand, and to start constructing new long-term care beds, to reduce the number of elderly patients waiting in hospital.  The results of the CBC News investigation are ""shocking,"" said NDP leader Andrea Horwath.  ""After two years of the Ford government, we've seen hallway medicine go from bad to worse, and people are suffering,"" Horwath said in a statement. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-ontario-hallway-medicine-hospital-overcrowding-1.5440470,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hallway-medicine-hospital-southlake-regional-1.5437444 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-health-emergency-declaration-1.5436518,N/A
303,Erica Johnson,2019-04-29T16:46:41.471Z,'I had to crawl': Amputee seeks damages after United Airlines and airport security seize scooter batteries,"Stearn Hodge says he will never forget the humiliation of having to drag his body across a hotel room floor during what was supposed to be a vacation celebrating his 43rd wedding anniversary — because a security agent at the Calgary International Airport and United Airlines confiscated the batteries he needed to operate a portable scooter. ""Having to crawl across the floor in front of my wife is the most humiliating thing that I can think of,"" said Hodge. ""It unmasks how real my disability is … I haven't been the same since."" The 68-year-old retired contractor from Kelowna, B.C., lost his left arm and right leg in a 1984 workplace accident. He now relies on a portable scooter powered by lithium batteries. But on a trip to Tulsa, Okla., on Feb. 26, 2017, an agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and a United Airlines official told Hodge to remove the $2,000 battery from his scooter and fly without it, as well as his spare battery. In making the demand, both employees cited safety concerns. Stearn Hodge shows how he had to crawl when he didn't have his mobility scooter: Lithium-ion batteries are a potential fire hazard, but global standards issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) allow people with disabilities to travel with compact lithium batteries for medical devices in carry-on luggage. Hodge said no one from CATSA or United Airlines would listen to him or read IATA documents he had printed out, showing his batteries are permitted on board if an airline gives prior approval. Hodge had received that permission. ""They're taking my legs — and not only that, my dignity,"" said Hodge.  He can only wear a prosthetic leg for a short period due to discomfort and risk of infection, he said. A few months earlier, Hodge almost had his batteries seized on a WestJet flight. But ""seconds"" before takeoff — and after he suffered a panic attack — Hodge was granted permission to take them on board. He has now hired a lawyer and is fighting to have his case heard before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A spokesperson for an Ottawa-based disability rights organization says it's ""frustrating"" that Canada's airline industry seems to ignore hard-won protections for people with disabilities. ""It's been a long fight to make sure that mobility devices — or any device used to accommodate a person with a disability — can be carried on [a plane],"" said Terrance Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. ""When security can — even with regulations in place — seize what otherwise should be able to go onto the aircraft, that leaves people with disabilities very vulnerable."" When the CATSA agent seized his batteries in Calgary, the employee suggested it wasn't a big deal, Hodge said. ""I still remember the CATSA agent saying, 'Well, you could get a wheelchair.' How's a one-armed guy going to run a wheelchair?"" asked Hodge. ""How am I going to go down a ramp and brake with one hand? But that shouldn't even have to come up."" Hodge's wife had recently undergone cancer treatment, which affected her spine, and she couldn't push a wheelchair for her husband. Hodge said he asked for an agent from United Airlines to come to the security checkpoint, as he had called the airline earlier and was assured it was OK to bring his battery and a spare on board. But the United Airlines employee that arrived sided with the security agent. Consequently, a three-week trip that was supposed to be a celebration with his wife resulted in Hodge spending much of his vacation confined to his bed. To perform basic personal hygiene, he was forced to drag himself across the hotel room floor to the bathroom. ""An anniversary is supposed to be all about remembering how you fell in love … and keeping that magic alive,"" said Hodge. ""And those things were denied. I'm crawling across the floor and it is pathetic."" A United Airlines spokesperson told Go Public that it couldn't comment on Hodge's experience, as he wants his case heard by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In an email sent to Hodge by the airline, complaint resolution official Tatricia Orija wrote that ""it appears we were in violation of federal disability requirements,"" offering both Hodge and his wife an $800 travel certificate. She also apologized for the ""inconvenience."" ""Inconvenience is when it rains on your holiday,"" said Hodge. ""This was a … life-changing moment for me and my wife."" Three months before the United incident, on Nov. 27, 2016, Hodge had also run into battery problems while travelling to Cancun, Mexico. In that case, a WestJet employee initially told him he could take the batteries in a carry-on, but when he got to the security checkpoint, a CATSA agent said the batteries had to be in checked luggage. ""According to federal airline law, that's the worst place you want to put them,"" said Hodge. ""Because if a problem develops with those batteries, they don't know where they are and they're only going to find out about it when it's too late."" Minutes before his departure, a WestJet employee was able to confirm that the batteries could go on the plane. In an email to Hodge, a WestJet customer support agent wrote: ""While I cannot change your past experience, I would like to offer you a $350 future travel credit as a goodwill gesture."" WestJet spokesperson Morgan Bell told Go Public he couldn't comment on the case since it is before the courts but that ""WestJet will always err on the side of caution and supports the due diligence of its people evaluating any items they believe may pose a safety concern.""  CATSA also wouldn't address questions from Go Public, citing Hodge's complaint. The agency did provide Hodge with a transcript of a recorded call with client service agent Justine Drouin, who apologizes to Hodge and says ""all of the screening officers will undergo a briefing."" Hodge and his wife travel at least once or twice a year and say the only place they run into trouble with his scooter batteries is in Canada. ""I have flown through Europe, the United States and Mexico since 2015 with these batteries and have never been detained or harassed because of them. It is only in Canada that I have been relentlessly detained,"" said Hodge.  He estimates it's happened more than a dozen times in the past two years, saying it now triggers severe anxiety. ""When I go through the checkpoint, I'm starting to vibrate now. I don't know what I'm going to get. It's like playing Russian roulette."" Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, said while he's pleased there are protections in place for people with disabilities who are travelling, those protections need to be enforced. ""This is an assault on a person's dignity,"" said Green, noting his organization has been fighting over transportation issues for four decades. ""In 1979, the government of the day said, 'Yes, we will make our transportation system accessible,'"" he said. ""Here we are … 40 years later and the same barriers are there in transportation for Canadians with disabilities."" Green, who is visually impaired, said he has had security agents question the battery in his laptop, which allows it to ""talk"" when it is turned on. He said he receives ""a lot of emails and telephone calls"" from people with disabilities who have been hassled at the airport. ""It happens very, very frequently,"" said Green. ""You put in complaints, the first thing that happens is the airlines deny."" Go Public asked the Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulates air, rail and marine travel, how often people have filed disability-related complaints over the past three years. A spokesperson said the agency has received 583 accessibility complaints related to air travel during that time — with fewer than one per cent related to batteries. And those numbers have steadily increased since 2016. The majority of complaints related to the transport of mobility aids are from passengers who have had expensive mobility devices — scooters and wheelchairs — damaged.   Last September, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Hodge's complaint to the Canadian Transportation Agency. However, the agency has no power to award general damages beyond out-of-pocket expenses.  On May 9, Hodge's lawyer, John Burns, will ask a Federal Court judge to compel the commission to hear the case. ""It's a failure of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to grant access to the remedy that the statute provides,"" said Burns. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows for up to $20,000 in damages for each count of pain and suffering, and up to another $20,000 if the discrimination is ""willful or reckless."" ""It sends a very clear message to the airlines and everybody else involved,"" said Burns. ""People with disabilities should be taken seriously. You don't take away somebody's legs and then describe it as an inconvenience. No, this is an injury."" Hodge is optimistic he'll eventually have his day before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It's a pricey endeavour. In order to cover legal costs, he's had to put up for sale a cherished Corvette he has worked on for years. But it's a fight he says he has to have — not just for himself, but for so many others with disabilities. ""The thing I would love more than the compensation,"" said Hodge, ""is the [legal] decision that someone can go to and say, 'You did it here, you can do it for me.'""

304,Anjuli Patil,2020-01-25T19:56:05.158Z,Famous last words. The 'quirky things' that make for a memorable obituary,"When Gloria Churchill's son, Shannon, died in 2018, she had no idea how far his self-written obituary would travel. ""The obituary went viral, over 500,000 hits online,"" Churchill told CBC's Maritime Noon radio show on Thursday. ""He hated Facebook, so I'm sure he's chuckling somewhere. ""Also it went to every news network across the country."" Churchill was one of several people who phoned in to Maritime Noon's call-in show on Thursday. The topic was obituaries. Host Bob Murphy interviewed Tamara Vukusic, an avid obituary reader who has also written about them. The reason why Churchill thinks her son's obituary went viral is because his personality shone through. ""He said his only regret was that he didn't get to see how Coronation Street ended. There are many things in there, lots of humour,"" Churchill said. The cast of Coronation Street ended up finding out about her son and mailing the family an autographed photo. Others who read the obituary, she said, wrote to tell her the obit inspired them to take a trip or check something off their bucket list. She said the response has meant a lot. ""He didn't really do anything extraordinary with his life other than be himself,"" Churchill said. Vukusic, writing a  book on obituaries, has been reading them for 20 years. She said she started after working at a veterans hospital in Ottawa. She said she enjoyed getting to know the patients and would find out about memorial services by reading the obituaries. ""While doing so I was really struck by how much there was that I didn't know about them, how many stories they had to share, how many life experiences,"" Vukusic said. ""And that is when I decided I would start asking more questions."" A sign of a good obituary, Vukusic said, is feeling a sense of loss for having never known the person. She said obituaries that don't gloss over imperfections are quite memorable, too. ""So of course we want to capture all the things that were wonderful about a person, but it's those little quirky things that make us human,"" she said. Vukusic read a portion of an obituary for a woman named Doris Mary Sturdee as an example. ""She was a constant source of giddy spontaneous humour to all who knew her, and yet she could not tell a conventional joke to save her life. That was fine because her frequent failed attempts at joke-telling were vastly funnier than the jokes she was trying to tell."" A short story or a short sentence that encapsulates the person is another way to make an obituary memorable, Vukusic said. ""So much like people will look for a good bottle of wine that's $15 or less, I love finding sentences that capture a person in 15 words or less,"" she said. An example of a short sentence that summed up a person was for Holly Denny Chercover, which simply read: ""She was the frog whisperer."" Obituaries don't have to be too long, Vukusic said. A short obituary she enjoyed was for Ora Orbach. ""Born in Israel in 1940, died in Toronto on Dec. 11, 2019 of cancer, borne stoically. Diagnosed many years ago, declined medical intervention. Petite, a skeptic and news junkie, loved Oded, the arts, music, good proportions in everything, minimalism, aesthetics and knitting."" Paul Crawford, a 78-year-old man who called into Maritime Noon on Thursday, is also an avid obituary reader. He said he wrote his own obituary 25 years ago and checks back on it every so often to make updates. ""I've given copies to my children and that way I like to see it,"" Crawford said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/famous-last-words-memorable-obituary-1.5440644,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/crown-seeks-dangerous-offender-sem-paul-obed-1.5440548 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-mackay-officially-launches-bid-for-conservative-leadership-1.5440587 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-endorsements-1.5438124 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-little-harbour-protected-land-golf-course-development-1.5439596 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/glen-petitpas-donair-recipe-nova-scotia-smithsonian-astronomer-1.5425033,N/A
305,Liz James,2019-12-23T12:00:00.423Z,Giving up store-bought gifts reconnected my family to the true spirit of Christmas,"Ten years ago, I threw up my hands in despair at the whole Christmas ""thing."" I'd spent a particularly stressful season buying, wrapping and bookkeeping. I realized that I'd lost touch with the holiday I loved so much.  There was a time when I eagerly bounded out of bed on Nov. 1 to see if the stores had put up decorations yet. I belted out Christmas music all season. Now the sight of a twinkling tree just made me feel tired.  I realized my kids were still of that tender age where I hadn't yet defined how Christmas ""should"" be. I had a unique opportunity. I explained, a la Whoville, that Christmas doesn't come from a store. I quickly learned that ""handmade Christmas"" could be even more exhausting than ""bought Christmas."" After the first year I learned to streamline. Each person picked a type of gift  and made a ton of them. You get what you get.  I learned to have a strong idea of the season I loved and wanted — beautiful decorations, nice smells in the kitchen, tons of time with my family — and to keep adjusting until I got there. My kids bought into the idea with remarkable enthusiasm. The toddler declared excitedly ""I get to BE Santa"" (in our household, we treat Santa as a metaphor more than a literal truth). Both boys spent all of November and December rescuing egg cartons from the trash, colouring them with markers and wrapping them to go under the tree. On Dec. 24, we went around to friends and neighbours who were delighted to receive partially wrapped bits of trash from exuberant three- and five-year-olds wearing Santa hats. It was all the cuteness of regular Christmas, with far less guilt for getting rid of everything the minute the season has passed. A couple of years in, I found a five-year-old sitting beside the tree surrounded by piles of gifts. He declared, ""Mom, I have more presents than ANYBODY,""  Looking at the piles he'd sorted, I saw that he meant he'd made more presents than anybody.  I was sold. I figured it would end when they went to school, but it didn't. They'd return each January to join in the chorus of ""what'd you get?"" with their heartfelt speeches about creating the Christmas that matters to you. I thought this would get them ostracized for sure, but it gave them a kind of celebrity. The boys' sense of fairness was helped by the fact that we do presents at other times of the year. I'd see something perfect for them in a store in May and bring it home as a spontaneous gift, especially when travel was imminent. I once overheard one of the boys saying ""we don't do bought Christmas, we do airplane Presents."" Last year, it changed. My 13-year-old asked if we could have a bought Christmas, so that he could find out what ""normal Christmas"" was like. His dad and I had a decision to make. Was handmade Christmas really about no-buying, or was it about intentionality?   We agreed to give bought Christmas a try. By mid-morning on Dec. 25, it appeared we'd never go back. The 13-year-old stood in piles of crumpled paper and declared, ""What have I been missing?"" To my surprise, this year he asked if we could go ""50-50"" between the two.  He told me that bought Christmas was ""fun, but obviously not for every year,"" and that it ""lacked a personal touch.""  His older brother would have skipped bought Christmas completely, because he thought it was ""exhausting"" and that ""making a gift means you're giving someone a part of you."" I have no idea what Christmas will look like for my boys when they're adults.  Or even next year. What I hope is that it will be a conscious choice. I also hope that if — or when — they feel like they've lost the season they love, they'll have the tools they need to find it again.

307,Reneltta Arluk,2019-12-28T15:45:52.275Z,Shared Lines: Why one Inuvialuk woman decided to get facial tattoos,"My great-grandmother, Alice Simon, had facial tattoos.  In the pictures we have of her, there are visible markings all up her cheeks but what always struck me was the thick black line that connected her bottom lip to her chin. So when I began to imagine that thick black line on my face, from lip to chin, I had more questions than answers as to why I wanted it. I'm not fully Inuk. My mother is Denesuline and Cree from the Fort Chipewyan region. My father was Inuvialuit but he was also Dene with Gwich'in roots. The woman who gave me this tattoo is a well known tattooer, Maya Sialuk Jacobsen of Greenland. She is an Inuk that studies the historical markings of Inuit women across the circumpolar North.  She said, ""I don't study land, I study patterns."" Her tattoo methods are traditional stick and poke or skin stitching ink with needle and thread. When I first contacted her, I sent an image of my great-grandmother, and Maya knew exactly where Alice Simon was from.  My great-grandmother spoke very little English; she was a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker. I did not get to grow up with her unfortunately. She died when I was just a young one, but when I was born, she came down to Fort Smith, N.W.T., from Inuvik to meet me. I was five months old.  She took care of me one night while my parents went to the movies. It was winter. In what was then an Inuvialuit practice, my great-grandmother took me outside, bare, and put me in the snow. I am not sure how long I was out there for. I am sure I cried. But even now I know her doing that to me was an act of love.  Through this winter custom, I was given the gift of resilience — a teaching that remains with me still.  She lived during a time when survival was the only way. She was a respected elder, cherished for her knowledge of preserving berries in the winter using techniques that are no longer practised.  Today Inuvialuktun is spoken by only a handful of Inuvialuit — mostly my great-grandmother's relatives, and likely because of her.  Alice was a matriarch. She gave the younger generations their Inuit names when they were born. Mine is Akpik.  It is the cloudberry that grows in the barren land — not too sweet but makes the best jam. Often Inuit are named after relatives who have passed or people in the community that have lived good lives. It's a way to instil positive traits in the young ones.  So when I learned my Inuk name was Akpik, I was confused. Why a berry?  I have a wonderful great aunt, Lillian Elias. Alice was her grandmother. Lillian is the matriarch now, and also a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker.  In one of our visits I asked her why great-grandmother Alice named me after a berry and not a relative. Auntie Lillian thought for a moment and said, ""maybe because they were her favourite."" It was clear to me getting tattooed would be a journey of reconnection, not only to my great-grandmother, but to the community of Inuit women wearing their ancestors' lines in celebration of who we are. I asked myself, why get this now? Easy, because it is time.  So much of our cultural teachings have been lost or taken away by colonialism. We know this, but most importantly we still feel this. In recent years there has been a resurgence of facial tattoos among Inuit women across the circumpolar north.  I received my thick black line so recently that in reflection of writing this, I am still unsure of the teachings it will offer me. I am fine with it, though.  This was not done to resolve any doubts or insecurities.  It was done to keep asking myself the questions about who I am at a time when we are needing to know who we are. We need to reconnect to our ancestral truths and I am grateful that my great-grandmother had the courage to wear hers at a time where many had started being denied theirs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-face-tattoo-reneltta-arluk-1.5397755,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,N/A
308,Anonymous,2020-01-25T15:00:00.366Z,'Enormously gratifying': Pat Braden reflects on 30 episodes of Musicians of the Midnight Sun,"For the last 17 years, Pat Braden has been on a journey. The Yellowknife music legend began compiling Musicians of the Midnight Sun — a website and audio documentary series looking back at Northwest Territories musicians from the 1950s to 1970s — in 2003. Now, 30 episodes in, Braden isn't finished with the series, but he is taking time to reflect on his accomplishment. ""Enormously gratifying,"" he said. ""I described this project as ... this is on my bucket list, this is going to get done, one way or another. And so for me, it's just been something that I've always wanted to do, is pay homage to that generation of musicians that came before me."" Though Braden knew many of his subjects personally, he says that profiling many of his own musical inspirations has given him ""a lot deeper insight"" into their lives and work.  ""It started out as a very personal kind of journey that way,"" said Braden. ""And so here I am, looking forward, but also looking back to see what I've done, and what's been done up here, and I just thought that time, and those musicians, as well, were definitely worth[y] of documenting and raising awareness for people."" Braden's documentaries have been airing on Tuesdays on CBC's The Trailbreaker on a semi-regular basis since 2018. This past week, host Loren McGinnis and producer Peter Sheldon flipped the script on him, having local musicians reflect on his life and work in a surprise tribute.  ""Pat is one of the best bass players around,"" said George Mandeville. ""His best contributions to musicians and the music community is his support and encouragement, and sharing of his talents. I admire his personal qualities and I consider him a valued friend."" ""Pat surely deserves a lot of accolades for his work on this project. He is a great guy with a wonderful personality, quiet and reserved but a real powerhouse of dedication,"" said John Tees, the 30th musician profiled in Braden's series.  ""We often forget we're part of a collective history,"" said singer Leela Gilday. ""I think it's a really huge accomplishment that he's dedicated his time to. And I'm just really proud."" As for the series, Braden says he isn't finished. Though his initial goal was to release 30 profiles, he says he'll be adding additional interviews to his website, and publishing his first series as a podcast. He'll also continue in his musical career, ""sharing the stage with local and touring musicians in the days to come.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/pat-braden-musicians-midnight-sun-1.5439404,https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-john-tees-1.5426459 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-wayne-bertrand-1.5418316 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-jim-lawrance-1.5403729 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-sandy-wilson-1.5403300 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-nick-sibbeston-1.5383130 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-1.5376184 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-penny-ballantyne-1.5370309 https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-129-the-trailbreaker/clip/15746155-musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-rand-demmon https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-john-telgen-1.5350080 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-peter-lafferty-1.5341576 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-john-sigvaldason-1.5108285 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-louie-goose-1.5100028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-pat-burke-1.5090433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-roy-menagh-1.5081320 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-johnny-landry-1.5072136 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-april-and-stan-mercredi-1.5062682 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-david-evalik-1.5053187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-ted-wesley-1.5053197 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-elsie-justus-burger-1.5034305 https://www.cbc.ca/news/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-wally-firth-1.5025025 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-midnight-sun-wilf-schidlowsky-1.4921349 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-midnight-sun-george-mandeville-1.4912252 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-midnight-sun-archie-loutit-1.4900451 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-episode-7-albert-canadien-1.4893145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-episode-6-tony-buggins-1.4882544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-of-the-midnight-sun-episode-5-alex-czarnecki-1.4873239 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/musicians-midnight-sun-angus-beaulieu-1.4864234 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/mms-ep3-kevin-mackie-1.4852360 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/muscians-midnight-sun-tom-hudson-1.4841601 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/mms-ep1-richard-lafferty-1.4836962,N/A
309,Amina Zafar,2020-01-25T14:53:02.561Z,Why tracing the animal source of coronavirus matters,"Alongside treating people infected with the new coronavirus, tracing those they've been in contact with and learning how the virus is transmitted, there's another pillar for controlling infectious diseases: searching for its animal host. Scientists have named the new virus that's caused hundreds of confirmed infections 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The outbreak started in Wuhan, China and travellers have brought the virus to other countries. So far, the virus seems most closely related to coronaviruses from bats. Many of the patients in Wuhan had a link to a large seafood and live animal market. That origin suggests spread from an animal to a human, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website.  Viruses in non-human animal hosts tend to invade a certain type of animal cell without harming people. In the case of avian influenza, for example, the virus gets into the intestines and respiratory tracts of birds. Occasionally, a virus jumps the species barrier to infect human cells. ""We're always on the lookout for the strange ones like SARS,"" says Dr. Scott Weese, a veterinary professor at the University of Guelph who is interested in novel coronaviruses from the perspective of emerging and infectious diseases. ""We always worry about bats as the original source, but what made it go from a bat to a person? Is there an animal in between and is that something we need to be paying attention to, or is it just human-to-human transmission?"" Animals can be hosts both to viruses that only affect them, and viruses they can spread to humans. For SARS, civet cats and raccoon dogs were found to carry and spread the virus, as well as domestic cats and ferrets, he said. ""If we don't know what the host range is, we should assume that it is more than just humans until we prove otherwise because we don't want to miss a potential source of an infection."" Dr. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust in Britain, where he studies infectious diseases and tropical medicine, noted that this coronavirus has crossed from animals to humans. ""That does not happen often, and it is without doubt very serious,"" Farrar said in a Science Media Centre commentary. According to Weese, the majority of emerging diseases have animal origins. The more humans interact with different species and wild environments, the more the risk increases, he said. Conversely, keeping animal habitats and human habitats apart helps to reduce the risk, Weese said, while acknowledging that isn't completely practical. Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist who teaches medical students about environmental change and human health at the University of Toronto, went to the market in Wuhan linked to the first cases of this new coronavirus about 18 months ago. While there, he counted about 50 species including snakes, turtles, wild rabbits, foxes, Asian palm civets and frogs. ""You've got these extremely stressed animals in really tiny, contained spaces that are clearly unwell,"" Bowman recalled. ""You've got high-powered hoses blasting water constantly and so you've got urine and feces — everything is merging between species sitting in the sun. You can imagine the potential for recombination of viruses."" Bowman said he's loath to criticize another culture's consumption habits. But in his opinion, China's laws of wildlife trade are not well enforced. Today, we publish the first clinical data from individuals confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCov from Wuhan, China. As for all public health emergencies, we will be making all related <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Coronavirus</a> Lancet content fully and freely available <a href=""https://t.co/Z8zYVJxZJl"">https://t.co/Z8zYVJxZJl</a> <a href=""https://t.co/wejlfiXEAp"">pic.twitter.com/wejlfiXEAp</a> China is also not alone. Ebola is spread in different ways and causes different symptoms than respiratory infections, but the Ebola virus is currently spreading person to person in Congo. Just as a coronavirus can originate in animals, people can be exposed to the Ebola virus by eating bushmeat, such as primates. After SARS killed 44 people in Canada, health officials here and internationally invested in preparing for outbreaks, Bowman said. ""I think we've learned a lot,"" he said. ""But if we don't deal with the heart of the problem where these things can emerge, it could easily happen again.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-zoonosis-1.5440146,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/france-coronavirus-cases-1.5439889 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,N/A
310,Amanda Pfeffer,2020-01-23T10:11:15.898Z,Good boy alerts rescuers to suspected dognapping,"A five-month-old Australian shepherd named Vango may have had a paw in his own rescue when he alerted staff at a Gatineau, Que., pet store to his suspected dognapping. According to Yves Jodoin, a staff member and dog trainer at Au Royaume des Animaux, Vango entered the store Monday with a couple that normally came in to buy cat food. ""The dog was barking, the dog was poking and he really wanted my attention,"" Jodoin said. Jodoin said he immediately became suspicious when the couple didn't seem to know basic information about the dog — his exact age, whether he'd been sterilized, what kind of food he ate and how much they'd paid for him.   ""They were evading the questions,"" Jodoin said. ""I was giving the dog cookies, but the dog was still barking."" Meanwhile, a colleague went to check social media for reports of stolen pets, and quickly pulled up a picture of Vango. The dog had been reported missing from his home in Buckingham, Que., just two and a half hours earlier. That's when Jodoin suddenly realized he already knew the dog — he'd trained Vango as a puppy. ""At that point I said, 'Vango, come!' And the dog was reacting, he was jumping,"" Jodoin said. ""All along he was barking and poking, trying to say, 'Hello, I'm not the dog they say I am.'"" The couple claimed they'd found the dog in the woods. The woman told Jodoin she wanted to keep the dog as a support animal because she had poor health and couldn't afford to buy and train a dog. Surrounded by witnesses in the store, Jodoin convinced the couple to surrender the animal. Then he called Vango's rightful owner, Josée Francoeur. ""I can't talk about it without crying,"" Francoeur said about the moment she received Jodoin's call.  Francoeur said the dog disappeared after she let him out for a pee in her fenced yard around 9 a.m. Monday. When she stuck her head out the door, Vango, who wasn't microchipped was gone. ""Is it possible that someone took him? And I was thinking, 'Who could do that? It's impossible!""     Francoeur immediately posted a notice on the local SPCA site for missing animals, and on other social media pages. In tears, she searched her neighbourhood, asking everyone she met if they'd seen her dog. At one point, a police officer pitched in to help and wrote up an official missing dog report. She was starting to lose hope when her phone rang. ""Imagine, If those people didn't go to that pet store, I would have lost my dog forever,"" Francoeur said. She's now filed a police complaint because she wants the couple to understand the impact of their actions. ""I don't want to cause them problems. We don't know why they did it. But at the same time, they took my baby,"" Francoeur said. ""I want to discourage others from doing this."" Gatineau police said they're investigating, but would need to prove the couple deliberately stole the dog, as opposed to finding him, before laying charges. The SPCA de L'Outaouais, where the couple had taken Vango that morning to register the dog with a new name, is using the incident to remind dog owners to get their pet microchipped. Francoeur said she's made an appointment to get Vango microchipped. ""This all could have been avoided,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/vango-helped-in-his-own-rescue-after-dognapping-1.5435671,[],N/A
311,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-24T09:00:00.517Z,Maritime Iron proposes others claw back emissions to offset its high-pollution plant,"The company pitching a high-pollution iron plant in northern New Brunswick says the provincial government should get other industries and emitters to cut their emissions to accommodate the new facility. Maritime Iron acknowledges in its environmental impact assessment document that ""implementing the project will make it difficult for New Brunswick to achieve its current aspirational climate change goal"" once the plant begins operating in 2022.  But the company boldly proposes that the province simply encourage other emitters to scale back their emissions enough to stay on target. ""Before 2030, New Brunswick would need to identify opportunities to meet this target through reductions across all sectors, including continued efforts and cooperation by the industrial sector as well as reductions in the transportation and electricity sectors,"" the document says. The document says the proposed plant, which would process iron ore into pig iron, would create a net increase of 2.3 million tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions, which is partly funded by large energy producers and users.  How the province would find corresponding reductions elsewhere isn't clear. ""Will it need to reach down into the refinery and reduce greenhouse gases there? Will it have to reach down into the forest sector and reduce emissions there?"" asked Lois Corbett of the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. ""Where will those other tonnes, millions of tonnes, come from?""  The province's legislated emissions goal for this year is 14.8 million tonnes, and for 2030 it's 10.7 million tonnes. It also has a second, less stringent 2030 goal, 14.1 million tonnes, tied to Canada's Paris climate plan objectives.  New Brunswick's emissions in 2017 were 14.3 million tonnes, below the legislated 2020 target and close to the 2030 Paris target. To stay close to those targets would require offsetting Maritime Iron's 2.3 million tonnes of net emissions increases. To put that in perspective, the required offset represents three-quarters of what the Irving Oil refinery emits in greenhouse gases annually, about three million tonnes. The offset would be nine times what J.D. Irving's four biggest polluting plants put out. Three JDI mills and its Atlantic Wallboard plant emitted 259,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2017. Maritime Iron did not respond to a request for comment. While the company is calling for reductions in industrial, transportation and electricity sectors to make room for its increased emissions, the head of a Saint John energy think-tank says industry has already done its part. ""To date, from 2005 to 2020, most of the heavy lifting, the reductions, have been on the backs of oil refining and electricity generation,"" said Colleen d'Entremont, president of the Atlantica Energy Centre, which is funded by large energy producers and users. ""Now is the time, from 2020 to 2030, for the rest of the sectors to try and make the same gains,"" she said. Most of New Brunswick's emissions reductions since 2005 have been attributed to the closures of large forestry mills and power plants. D'Entremont said there have been ""very, very few gains"" reducing emissions from transportation, including cars and buses, during the same period. Those emissions were four million tonnes in 2017. Last year, Irving Oil's director of growth and strategy Andy Carson told a Senate committee there was ""a role for us to play"" in reducing emissions and fighting climate change. He called it ""a very, very significant and important issue"" for the province's only oil refiner. But in December 2019 Reuters news agency reported that the company had quietly dropped its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by this year. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Maritime Iron's suggestion about reduced emissions among industrial plants.  JDI vice-president Mary Keith said in an email the company's mills have already exceeded both 2030 reduction targets and the company's forestry operations are a carbon sink, with trees absorbing more carbon dioxide than mills emit.  She said the company would not comment on Maritime Iron's proposal other than to suggest that a federal plan to plant more than two million trees could help offset the iron plant's emissions. D'Entremont said Maritime Iron represents ""a really good test case"" of whether the province can increase economic activity and create jobs while also hitting emissions targets. ""How are we as a collective going to address the fact that carbon emissions are going to go up?"" she said. ""What other activities do we have going on that are going to reduce them in other ways?"" She called for the province to fund more technology that would allow ""all of us"" to reduce emissions and said small nuclear reactors and NB Power's proposed smart meters could play a role. This week, MLAs on a legislative committee voted to amend the government's carbon-pricing bill for large industry to tie it to the more stringent legislated targets. The amended bill now says explicitly the pricing system's goal is to regulate emissions ""in order to facilitate the achievement"" of the targets. Maritime Iron proposes to link its iron plant to NB Power's generating station so it can sell gas byproduct to the generating station, allowing it to cut its use of coal. The two facilities combined would emit 4.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, or 2.3 million more than what Belledune now emits on its own.  The company argues that Maritime Iron's location will reduce shipping distances for both raw iron ore and finished pig iron, lowering emissions from ocean-going freighters. That and the company's new processing technology will contribute to global emissions reductions even while increasing emissions in New Brunswick, the company says. The existing federal climate plan doesn't allow provinces to get credit for emissions created outside their boundaries, and no international credit-trading regime exists.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-emissions-proposal-1.5438667,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-eia-carbon-emissions-nb-power-belledune-1.5433510 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-carbo-pledge-1.5405518,N/A
312,Paul Palmeter,2020-01-26T10:00:00.481Z,Canso Seahawks basketball team nets friend from Ohio,"It's a long drive from Cincinnati, Ohio to Guysborough, N.S., but it was well worth it for retired basketball coach Ernie Wolke. Wolke, 79, drove 26 hours to watch a game at a high school basketball tournament. He owns a cottage in Port Hilford, Guysborough County and spends his summers there. It was at the 2018 Stan Rogers Folk Festival in Canso when he met the MacLeans, a local family. When Wolke saw there were no mesh nets on an outdoor basketball court used by kids in the community, the former coach said he had to step up. He bought some nets and gave them to the MacLeans. ""When I got back to the cottage that day I decided I would drive up to Antigonish and I bought a few nets,"" Wolke said from his home in Ohio. ""I'm a big advocate of kids being outside doing something versus sitting around and being bored."" That was just the beginning of the relationship between the retired coach and young basketball players in the remote community more than three hours northeast of Halifax. He delivered more gifts the following summer as Wolke continued to spread goodwill through basketball. ""This time he had two basketballs and more basketball nets,"" said Amanda MacLean. MacLean is a teacher at Canso Academy. Her son, Druhan, is a member of the school basketball team and her husband, John, is an assistant coach. ""It just goes to show you that there really are good people in this world,"" Amanda said. After Wolke returned to Ohio he stayed in touch with the family. He learned many of the boys who played on those no-net basketball hoops 18 months ago are now playing for the high school team in Canso. Wolke wanted to see the Canso Academy Seahawks in person. Two weeks ago, he and two friends made the drive to watch them play in a tournament in Guysborough, not far from his cottage. ""We actually left a little early because a storm was coming,"" said Wolke, who saw the Seahawks win a semifinal game and advance to the tournament final. ""They played a really good game. They looked really good."" Prior to that game, only a few of those players had ever met the man who donated the equipment that many of them had used on their outdoor court. Wolke had a special surprise when he addressed the team in their dressing room. ""The boys knew he had something with him in a box but they didn't know what it was,"" said Amanda. ""When he opened up the box there were beautiful Canso Academy Seahawks T-shirts for each of the players and coaches."" Wolke said he had the shirts made for free by a friend in Cincinnati. But his gesture has had an impact on the boys team. ""To have somebody who is literally hundreds of miles away take the time and want to share his time and experiences is just tremendous,"" said Brandon Dort, the team's head coach. ""It's all about life lessons and Ernie has really been an amazing model of how you can give back through sport."" For many years there was no high school basketball team in Canso.

Poilievre was expected to announce his candidacy on Sunday in Ottawa, but in a Facebook post late Thursday he said he would not be joining the race to replace outgoing leader Andrew Scheer. ""Over the last several weeks, I have been building a team and support for a possible run for the Conservative leadership. In criss-crossing the country, I have been overwhelmed with the favourable response,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I knew it would be hard on my family life to do this. But I did not realize how hard. It is harder still because I had just spent the earlier 18 months campaigning furiously to win back my seat in the recent federal election, during which I mostly missed the first year of our baby's life."" ""As such, my heart is not fully engaged in this leadership race. Without being all in, I cannot be in at all. So I have decided not to seek the leadership of the party at this time."" Poilievre said he will continue to serve his Carleton constituents as an MP. He said he is not currently supporting any other candidate, but will look for a ""strong fiscal conservative who will unleash free enterprise so people can achieve their dreams through hard work."" WATCH | Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre won't run for the Conservative leadership: As recently as this week, Poilievre was outlining policy positions in a manner that suggested he was determined to run. He told the Toronto Star that under his leadership, Conservative MPs would be free to bring forward legislation on abortion and vote according to their conscience, but that such legislation would not be adopted under a Conservative government under his leadership. He also lashed out at Richard Décarie, a social conservative who says he intends to join the leadership race, for comments he'd made on CTV's Power Play suggesting that being gay is a ""choice"". ""The comments are as unacceptable as they are ignorant. You do not speak for Conservatives — or for Canadians. Being gay is NOT a choice. Being ignorant is,"" Poilievre wrote on Twitter.

He's expected to formally join the race Saturday. Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu also has said she intends to join the race, and Ontario MP Erin O'Toole is expected to be a candidate. O'Toole's deputy campaign manager Melanie Paradis said Poilievre's decision to opt out means a narrow field of serious candidates. ""It's now a two-way race. We need a leader for 2020, not the 90s.

O'Toole responded to Poilievre's announcement on Twitter. ""Pierre has been a champion for our party and the conservative movement. I know he will continue to be an important voice,"" he wrote.

315,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-24T09:00:00.783Z,"Canada's casinos 'threatened' by Liberal stance on sports betting, proponents warn","The Canadian gaming industry is losing billions of dollars in sports betting revenue to the black market each year due to federal prohibitions — and a recent legalization push in the U.S. could further threaten the viability of casinos in this country, proponents say. Casino boosters in Canada, including NDP MP Brian Masse, are hoping the recent legalization of single-event sports betting in U.S. border states like Michigan and New York will force the Liberal government to act now to save casino jobs — especially at places like Caesars Windsor and the Niagara Falls-based Fallsview, which depend on a steady stream of U.S. gamblers to stay afloat. A years-long effort to legalize single-event sports betting — betting on a single football game, for example — stalled when the federal Liberal government voted against legislation to allow this sort of gambling in Canada. Voting against the legislation in 2016, the government cited major sports leagues' claims that single-event betting might lead to match-fixing. But that opposition has been blunted since sports leagues, including the NBA and NHL, have partnered with U.S.-based casino operators like MGM Resorts to bolster sports betting stateside. Masse, who introduced a private member's bill to dismantle the prohibition, said the Liberal government should take up the issue when the House of Commons returns next week. The government only needs to drop one sentence from the Criminal Code to end the prohibition — a change Masse said could be made through legislation or an order-in-council from cabinet. ""We are in a lose-lose position right now. We would have been ahead of the curve if we had actually defined our own destiny, but instead U.S. courts, as expected, moved ahead and left us behind. The consequences for Canada are very high,"" Masse told CBC News. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturned decades-old federal limits on sports betting in states other than Nevada. The result has been a push by state lawmakers — notably in New Jersey, New York and Michigan — to legalize single-game bets at casinos, racetracks and online. Single-event legalization has unleashed a revenue boom for state coffers already; New Jersey casinos collected $4.5 billion in revenue last year alone. Sports bettors in Canada are limited to ""parlay"" bets — meaning they have to place bets on more than one game, and pick the winning team in each contest, to see any sort of windfall. The odds of a winning bet are low. Canadians gamble roughly $500 million a year in parlay bets through lottery games like Pro-Line. ""Capital investments in Canada are being delayed, jobs are being lost, customers are going to be lost for the long-term. We inherit all the problems of sports gambling, but we don't get any of the benefits or the supports to deal with the situation,"" Masse said. Canada's gaming industry employs about 180,000 people — many more than the automotive manufacturing sector. Masse said Windsor-area Liberal candidates in the last election promised voters a re-elected Trudeau government would do away with the Criminal Code prohibition to help those casinos compete, but the Prime Minister's Office has since shied away from the issue. In a statement, Justice Minister David Lametti's spokesperson said gambling reforms are simply not ""immediate priorities.""  ""Minister Lametti was honoured to receive his mandate letter in December, which outlines the immediate priorities he has been tasked with. Reforms to gambling laws are not included as part of these immediate priorities,"" Rachel Rappaport said. ""Our government is aware of the recent changes to the legal frameworks for legalized gambling in the United States, which have produced consequences on both sides of the border. We continue to monitor the situation, as well as meet with and hear from individuals and groups that have been affected."" Masse said the government's stance betrays the voters in places like Windsor and Niagara Falls who trusted the Liberals when they said they'd take action. ""It's very much a paternalistic approach by the federal government, denying Ontario, Quebec and B.C. and others. The message is basically, 'Canadians can go to the internet or the black market, instead of a regulated, open market where provinces can make their own decisions,'"" Masse said. ""It's a bizarre position and I'm quite shocked that they've been able to skate on this so long."" An estimated $14 billion in annual sports betting — $10 billion through the black market through bookies and $4 billion more through off-shore online outlets, according to figures from the Canadian Gaming Association — is wagered by Canadians through illegal channels, beyond the regulatory control of the government. The biggest draw of these other outlets is the fact that they allow bettors to gamble on just one game. Paul Burns is the president and CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association, the lobby group that represents casino interests. Burns said the Liberal government should simply adopt the approach it took to the legalization of cannabis. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau proposed changes to drug laws as a way to take profits out of the hands of criminals and legitimize a practice dominated by illegal sellers. Burns said the same standard should apply to sports betting. ""This would take money out of the hands of bad guys and give real benefit to the hundreds of gaming communities across the country,"" Burns said. ""'This issue isn't going away. It's getting worse. We're saying to the federal government, 'Don't put us in a position where we have one arm tied behind our backs.' These are great, good-paying jobs and they're threatened. And yet, there's a very simple solution."" Federal and provincial governments don't get a cut of revenues from gaming through these illegal channels. For the province of Ontario, for example, that means an estimated $400 million a year in lost profit, said Jim Lawson, head of Woodbine Entertainment, the group that runs the main horse racetrack in Toronto. ""So much money is moving offshore and offshore now includes sports wagering in the U.S. We're really starting to feel the pressure — it's having a dramatic impact,"" Lawson told CBC News. ""There's a huge revenue miss at a time when government is trying to keep up with health care and education costs. And when I say a revenue miss, we're in the hundreds of millions of dollars range."" Lawson said Woodbine Entertainment employs 15,000 people in Ontario directly or indirectly, but the horse racing industry is facing ""extreme challenges"" due to demographic shifts and robust competition from the U.S. He said flowing some of the sports betting through racetracks and off-track betting shops would help stabilize an industry crucial to rural communities. ""We should be allowed to participate rather than it all going into foreign pockets and for-profit offshore operators,"" Lawson said, adding that leaving horse tracks out of the equation would ""decimate"" racing.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-single-event-sports-betting-1.5437725,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/horse-racing-single-sports-betting-mp-windsor-1.5331851 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/single-sports-betting-quashed-1.3773417 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/nhl-s-vegas-expansion-hypocrisy-says-mp-chasing-single-event-betting-1.3649179,N/A

318,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-24T22:42:11.115Z,Opposition parties express 'confusion' over plan for rural health-care hubs,"P.E.I.'s Official Opposition says its proposal for a pair of rural health-care hubs is ""just a line in the [capital] budget"" at this point, while MLAs from all three parties in the legislature continue to say they don't understand what government plans to do with the $5 million allocated to the project. ""We were really glad to see that commitment in the capital budget,"" said Green Party health critic Trish Altass. ""We just know that it's a line in the budget, we don't know what the government's plans are moving forward."" Budget documents describe the allocation, to be made starting in the 2020-21 fiscal year, as ""providing the necessary space for renewed and strengthened community-based primary care to meet the needs of West Prince and Kings County."" The issue sparked many questions during the fall 2019 sitting of the legislature, with Premier Dennis King eventually telling the House the idea came from the Green Party platform. In fact, the Greens submitted a proposal for funding for the hubs to government as part of capital budget deliberations. That submission suggested one rural hospital each in eastern and western P.E.I. receive upgrades in infrastructure to accommodate an expansion of services, including primary and long-term care, community support services, mental health and addictions treatment, home care services and emergency, acute and post-acute care. The ""key question"" that needs to be addressed is ""what services can we possibly bring from urban areas to our rural communities and what do we need to do that?"" Altass said. But she said the capital funding to prepare the space and purchase equipment for the hubs is just one component. The plan would also require new staffing policies and strategic planning from Health PEI. ""We would certainly hope to see follow through with the rest of what would be needed to make this work,"" Altass said. ""However to this point we have not yet had those conversations. We've not been invited to the table to figure out what this is going to look like."" On the last day of the fall sitting — a sitting extended by one day by Liberal MLA Robert Henderson over his frustrations over a lack of information on the hubs and other topics — Minister of Health and Wellness James Aylward said government ""will be increasing the breadth of health services while maintaining the existing services in communities as they are, including family doctors."" He said the hubs will provide services in rural areas that aren't currently available, including cancer care, diabetes and mental health support. This week Aylward said government will ""absolutely"" collaborate with the Opposition on fleshing out a plan for enhancing rural health-care services through the hubs. ""We had lengthy discussions in the latest session of the legislative assembly where we talked about this. I was questioned daily on health-care hubs,"" said Aylward. He said he's told Altass ""that we are going to continue to have the consultative process and discussions on our plan to move forward with health care here on P.E.I."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Wellness told CBC News the province will be engaging with communities and health-care professionals to talk about the hubs, but didn't provide any timeline. At a committee meeting Wednesday where the province's plans for primary care in rural P.E.I. were questioned, MLAs from all three parties each said they don't know what government's plans are for the hubs. ""There's been a continual story from the third party [Liberals] that they're confused about what these hubs are,"" said Green Leader Peter Bevan-Baker. ""The Opposition is also confused about what these hubs are ... I have no idea what government is doing when they talk about health hubs."" Bevan-Baker said a proposal from South Shore residents to have a doctor and two nurse practitioners provide primary care from a new clinic in Crapaud is something ""that can absolutely live comfortably together"" with his party's ideas around health-care hubs — but it's not a hub. ""I also don't know quite what the health hubs are either so I'm not going to get into that debate,"" said Cory Deagle, a backbench MLA with the governing PCs. O'Leary-Inverness MLA Robert Henderson, who asked most of the questions around hubs during the fall sitting, said in an interview with CBC a lack of specific information around staffing and services is the ""missing link"" in terms of the proposal, and the main reason why he voted against government's capital budget. ""That's the whole thing — what's missing here?"" Henderson said. ""What the Greens seem to be talking about … is really funding that would be through the operational budget. That's why I'm confused … whose initiative is it? Where's this money going to be spent?

320,David Wasylciw,2020-01-25T11:30:00.568Z,What does it cost to win an election in the N.W.T.?,"Last week, Elections NWT released campaign finance reports for the 2019 N.W.T. election. The reports detailed $356,000 in fundraising and over $420,000 in spending for candidates: who funded their campaign, where the money went, and how much they spent.  These numbers are interesting, and worth a look. Transparency is key, especially when it comes to newly-elected MLAs. However, the numbers can also reveal some interesting trends in how campaign spending is changing in the territory, and how successful campaigns are funded. In this analysis, we'll take a look at this year's numbers, seeing who spent the most, and how those donations came in. We'll also take a look at the reports in comparison to previous elections dating back to 2007. There's no specific price to pay to win a campaign, but the most candidates are allowed to spend is $30,000. In the past, unsuccessful candidates have spent as much as $29,165 (Yellowknife Centre's Sue Glowach, 2007), while winners have spent as little as $1,045 (Mackenzie Delta's current MLA, Frederick Blake Jr., in 2011). On average, since 2007, election campaigns have cost $8,131, while successful campaigns have averaged $10,935 — but this changes significantly when you remove Yellowknife from the equation. Outside the capital, campaigns' average cost is $5,497, while successful campaigns cost an average of $7,506. In Yellowknife, that price jumps considerably, with campaigns carrying an average cost of $12,562; successful campaigns jump to $16,812. In 2019, seven successful candidates — Jackie Jacobson, Kevin O'Reilly, Caroline Wawzonek, Julie Green, Lesa Semmler, Caitlin Cleveland, and Caroline Cochrane — spent more than the average. The most resourceful new MLA was Deh Cho's Ronald Bonnetrouge. He spent only $2,004, less than acclaimed Mackenzie Delta MLA Blake Jr., who spent $2,533. Taken together, campaigns for successful candidates spent just over $168,000 and received 6,115 votes, an average of $27.50 per vote. Overall, candidates in the last election raised $420,177, with 40 per cent coming from individuals, 30 per cent coming from businesses, and 25 per cent from candidates themselves. The rest came from organizations like Indigenous governments and local unions. This is different from federal and several provincial campaigns, where only individual contributions are allowed. Last year's election marks a record high for self funding. The average amount contributed by candidates to their own campaigns nearly doubled, from $1,075 in 2015 to $1,860. The N.W.T. is always a very generous place, with over 360 individuals contributing to campaigns last year. Over 40 people contributed to multiple campaigns, with retired MLA Wendy Bisaro being the most prolific individual contributor, donating to nine. This election also saw contributions from the Union of Northern Workers for the first time since at least 2007. The UNW donated $1,500 — the maximum allowed — to successful candidates O'Reilly and Shane Thompson and unsuccessful candidates Kieron Testart and Hughie Graham. The NWT Federation of Labour also donated $1,500 to O'Reilly.  The North Slave Métis Alliance regularly contributes to two or three campaigns each election. In 2019, though, they were much more active, donating $1,500 each to seven Yellowknife-area campaigns: eventual cabinet members Cochrane, Wawzonek, and Katrina Nokleby, and unsuccessful candidates Testart, Patrick Scott, Arlene Hache, and Cory Vanthuyne. Elections can be a big boost to local businesses. In total, over $409,000 was spent in the 2019 campaign. Any unspent campaign funds must be donated to a local non-profit or the territory's Consolidated Revenue Fund. During the election, 25 campaigns spent over $94,500 total at Signed, a Yellowknife-based graphic design and print shop, making it by far the most frequently used vendor. Other frequently used vendors include Home Hardware, Staples, Canada Post, Cabin Radio, Kopykat North and Northern News Services. One noticeable trend is with campaign advertising. In 2007, not a single candidate declared any spending with Facebook, but last fall, eight separate campaigns spent a total of just under $2,000 with Facebook Inc.  At the same time, in 2007, campaigns spent over $41,000 advertising with N.W.T. newspaper group Northern News Services Ltd. (NNSL). In 2019, only 10 campaigns reported advertising with NNSL, totalling just over $7,100. The difference in the ways of reaching potential voters — and the cost of doing so — will only continue to shift. The numbers only tell part of the election story, but they reflect a lot of the ways candidates feel the need to reach out to us. Often, campaigns that show the broadest support with donors or lawn signs have a leg up, but not always. If you want to dig a bit deeper into the numbers, you can find candidate finance reports for each electoral district on Elections NWT's website.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/elections-nwt-finance-campaign-report-1.5436072,[],N/A

An exclusive analysis of the data by CBC News shows that hospital gridlock — a phenomenon that used to be restricted to surges in patients during flu season — is the new normal.  Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals were filled beyond 100 per cent occupancy nearly every day in the first half of last year.  Five hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as the main hospital in Hamilton, Sudbury, Peterborough and Niagara Falls all spent more than 160 days over their funded capacity during the 181-day period from January through June 2019.

Some of the key findings:  An expert on hospital administration calls the figures ""astonishing"" and says they demonstrate that overcrowding is now a widespread phenomenon around Ontario. ""These are really big numbers,"" said Donald Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at University of Toronto. He said the data show the hallway medicine problem is neither occasional nor restricted to a few hospitals. Redelmeier said such chronic overcapacity makes the hospital experience extremely dissatisfying for patients, it means non-emergency surgeries get postponed, and it means when there's a surge of new patients, there's nowhere to relieve the congestion.  ""You ought not to be striving for 100 per cent capacity because it doesn't leave you any reserve for when things get tough,"" said Redelmeier, who is also an internal medicine specialist at Sunnybrook Hospital.   ""We've got warning signs going off all over the province and the situation just isn't viable,"" said Anthony Dale, chief executive of the Ontario Hospital Association.  WATCH: Overcrowding affects patients from the moment they enter ER ""All across the province you have hospitals at extremely high levels of occupancy,"" said Dale in an interview with CBC News. ""What we're seeing is that it's no longer just during the flu season but it's all year round."" The chronic nature of the overcrowding ""is simply not sustainable, not for patients, not for people who work in hospitals,"" Dale said  The acute care hospital site that was the most frequently filled beyond capacity was Mackenzie Health's 333-bed Richmond Hill Hospital. Its acute care wards were overcapacity on all but two days in this six-month period.    A tour of its emergency room in the early afternoon of a recent weekday — typically a time of lower ER volumes as compared to evenings and weekends — revealed around a dozen patients on stretchers in the corridors or placed alongside the nursing station desk. The situation has become so entrenched that signs are posted assigning hallway spots an official bed number. ""For our staff who work in this environment, they would describe it as constantly working under crisis,"" said Mary-Agnes Wilson, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Mackenzie Health, which runs Richmond Hill Hospital.  Richmond Hill provides an example of how the ripple effect of overcapacity in acute care wards is felt in the emergency department. Even after being admitted, a patient typically spends hours stuck in the ER waiting for a ward bed to open up. Over the past year, the average patient admitted to an Ontario hospital spent more than 16 hours in the ER before getting a ward bed, according to provincial data.   At the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, the average admitted patient waited 46 hours in the ER before getting a bed on a ward in November, the most recent month for which statistics are available. Although the occupancy data analyzed by CBC News comes from the first half of 2019, there's little if any indication the situation has improved since then. Niagara Health says the overcapacity problem across its three acute care hospital sites did not improve in the second half of 2019, averaging 104 per cent during both six-month periods last year.  At Southlake Regional Health Centre, a 500-bed facility in Newmarket, occupancy averaged 110 per cent in the first six months of 2019, according to the data. In the second half of the year, occupancy averaged 113 per cent, says the hospital's CEO, Arden Krystal.  Hospitals' chief method of coping with the demand is to place beds in makeshift locations, now officially enshrined as ""unconventional spaces"" in the Ontario health care bureaucracy. At Richmond Hill, a former meeting room now houses 10 patients separated by cubicle dividers. At Southlake Regional Health Centre, overflow spaces include former exercise rooms and a kitchenette.  ""We try to fill every nook and cranny because the risk of having 40 or 50 admitted patients standing in our emergency department is even greater than filling those spaces,"" said Krystal. ""When emergency gets backed up, they start to get worried that they can't assess people quickly enough to make sure that they can stay safe.""  Figures provided by the Ministry of Health suggest a five to six per cent drop in the use of unconventional spaces province-wide over the past year.   ""It was increasing steadily year over year but we have managed to halt that,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott.  That still means nearly 1,000 Ontario patients are being housed in hallways, lunch rooms and auditoriums every day. Elliott admitted it will take ""several years"" to achieve Ford's promise of ending hallway health care.   ""This isn't a problem that grew up overnight, it has been building up over a number of years,"" Elliott said in an interview Tuesday. ""There's no simple solution to change it, there's a lot of action that needs to be taken and we are doing that.""  The number of acute care hospital beds in Ontario has stayed effectively the same for 20 years, at around 20,000 while the province's population has grown by three million people. Ontario now has fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than any other province: 1.4 beds for every 1,000 people. That's on par with Mexico, and half the number in the U.S. WATCH | Anthony Dale of the Ontario Hospital Association says hospital overcrowding is putting a strain on health-care providers But shortages of care available outside the hospital system are also crucial factors in the overcrowding. On any day, one out of six hospital beds is occupied by a patient who doesn't need to be in hospital, but cannot be safely discharged home. This is a long-running phenomenon in health systems across Canada known as ""alternate level of care"" (ALC). Lengthy waits for long-term care spaces are the chief cause, but a lack of available home care and other forms of continuing care also contributes.  While the number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals hovered between 3,500 and 4,000 for the first half of the 2010s, it grew over the past five years, exceeding 5,300 in September 2019, according to figures from the Ontario Hospital Association.  This means creating new hospital beds is not necessarily a better solution than freeing up the beds occupied by patients who ought to be elsewhere.  Ford became premier in June 2018, and his Progressive Conservative government by no means created the hallway medicine trend. The previous Liberal government froze hospitals' annual base funding for four years running.  Nor is hospital overcrowding restricted to Ontario. Recent reports of overflowing patients come from Montreal, Saskatoon,  Moncton, N.B. and Kentville, N.S. Some of the most obvious solutions to the problem won't happen quickly or without a major outlay of public money. One  top priority is expanding the number of long-term care facilities to meet the demands of a senior population that is growing in number and in the complexity of its needs. The Ford government is embarking on a long-term reform of the health system that includes reorganizing how funding is provided. The aim is to shift those hospital patients who don't need to be there into care elsewhere.  The reform is centred on teams that bring together hospitals, home-care agencies and long-term care facilities in geographic areas. Each team will receive a combined pot of funding to provide the range of health services its population needs.   Hospitals are taking their own steps to try to reduce patient demand. For people with chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, Niagara Health has focused on developing programs to support the patients at home after discharge. ""This has already shown great reductions in emergency department visits, hospital readmissions and days spent in hospital,"" said Derek McNally, Niagara Health's executive vice-president of clinical services and chief nursing executive. ""We know that there's a lot more work that we need to do,"" said Elliott. ""It's like taking an ocean liner and turning it around. it doesn't happen on a dime.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-hallway-medicine-healthcare-over-capacity-1.5434572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/hallway-medicine-unfortunate-reality-for-guelph-general-hospital-1.5435015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/across-sw-ontario-small-hospitals-struggle-with-overcapacity-1.5434670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-civic-etobicoke-general-hallway-health-care-1.5339511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hospital-health-sciences-north-overcrowding-1.5139909 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ontario-health-care-1.4912674 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-doug-ford-health-care-rueben-devlin-1.4997601,N/A

For decades, Ten Thousand Villages pop-up markets have been part of Christmas on P.E.I., connecting Islanders with thousands of artisans from more than 30 countries. The markets sold food products, home decor, jewelry and many other items. Shelley MacEwen, organizer of the market at Park Royal Church, volunteered for decades at the markets, and would often offer this advice to people. ""I said 'Come to the sale,'"" MacEwen told CBC Radio: Island Morning Friday. ""Don't buy, just come in and absorb all those countries that are represented in one room, and you get quite a feel for what you see and how other people live in the world."" This week, Ten Thousand Villages announced this week poor sales are forcing the closure of its Canadian distribution centre, bringing to an end the holiday tradition of pop-up markets around the country. It was just too difficult to compete with online retailers, MacEwen said, adding that online shopping will still be an option for Canadian Ten Thousand Villages customers. ""I'm extremely sad for what I will miss,"" she said. ""On the bigger picture you have to look at all the artisans that that potentially can lose their market for selling their product. So I think that's where my heart mostly lies."" Ten Thousand Villages is one of the oldest fair-trade organizations in North America, operating for almost 75 years. A fair deal for the artisans is what came first, said MacEwen, not profit. Apart from international connections, MacEwen said Ten Thousand Villages brought together people on the Island. She had dozens of volunteers who worked on the market she organized at Park Royal Church.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-ten-thousand-villages-1.5438994,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ten-thousand-villages-winnipeg-closing-1.5434881 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ten-thousand-villages-store-closures-1.5434902 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-crapaud-south-shore-clinic-1.5438273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-water-use-down-1.5438136,N/A

The printer opened in March 2003 and since then has printed many Maritime publications including The Guardian and The Journal-Pioneer newspapers, entertainment monthly The Buzz and monthly food digest Salty. The company announced in November the plant would close.  ""I can tell you when the lead press-man shut the job off, there wasn't a dry eye in the house,"" said printing plant manager Bruce MacDougall. ""It was the end of an era for us ... a sad day.  ""It's unfortunate, it really sucks."" MacDougall himself called around to local businesses to try to find work for the 11 people at the plant who were losing their jobs, and his efforts seem to have paid off.  After they'd all shared one last lunch together Thursday, MacDougall received a phone call offering all 11 jobs at a P.E.I. facility.  Publications that relied on the plant have found new printers, MacDougall said, at Transcontinental's Montreal plant or closer to home, at printers in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  Paul MacNeill, the publisher of Island Press, praised Transcontinental as ""exceptional to deal with.""  ""It's the end of an era on P.E.I.,"" he said. ""We've always had a press on P.E.I. ... now there are none.""

""My head would just pivot and I'd think: 'I really want to do that!"" she told CBC Montreal's Daybreak. At the time, she thought it was an odd feeling for a married mother of two teenage daughters with a white collar job. ""It was a very traditional kind of life,"" she said. Before she knew it, McGean was leaving all that behind — her home, her job, even her marriage. ""Some people thought I'd absolutely lost my mind,"" McGean said. ""I just completely turned my life upside down."" McGean started to chase her dream of riding a motorcycle at 51 years old, signing herself up for circuit training. She realized that she didn't feel comfortable on only two wheels and bumped up to a three-wheeled bike. She said it was ""love at first sight,"" and suddenly McGean was buying a bike of her own. ""I think it's the first thing in my life I found that I thought, 'this is mine,'"" she said. ""It represents complete and utter freedom."" Not long after McGean got a taste of that freedom, she suffered a major loss. Her father died. ""[It] made me realize that if there's something that I want to do in my life, then I better get at it,"" she said. ""So I made the decision to leave my marriage."" After 23 years of married life, McGean said she started to feel like a square peg and her life was a round hole. Something just didn't fit anymore. ""I was lucky enough to have somebody that understood that I needed to explore that,"" she said. After living on her own for a while, McGean saw that her workplace was offering an early retirement package that she qualified for. She took it, moved out of her apartment and put everything she owned in storage, except for a one-person tent. ""I got on my bike and headed north without any reservations or anything,"" she said. With no plans and no commitments, McGean spent the next five weeks riding west to Tofino, B.C. and back, stopping in different towns and meeting new people. One man she met at a gas station was intrigued by her motorcycle and struck up a conversation about his own cross-country ride on a bike. Before pulling out of the station, he gave her a hug. ""Stopping and having conversations with people I met along the way was probably the best part of the whole trip,"" she said. McGean also took the opportunity to reconnect with people she hadn't seen in years — she spent a night with a friend in Ontario she hadn't seen since high school, and also stopped to visit some cousins in Manitoba. McGean's cross-country treks are over, for now, but she said she's grateful for the experience. ""At some point along the way, I finally realized that I had to live my life for me,"" she said. ""I had to do things that made me happy."" She's not sure what lies ahead for her, but McGean is now looking for a job doing something she loves in the Montreal area because she wants to be near her daughters, who are now in their 20s. Looking back, she said her adventures really helped her come into her own. ""I'm comfortable in my own skin now.

326,Katy Parsons,2020-01-24T18:31:49.898Z,"Projects that would include Lunenburg waterfront, seabed concern community group","A community group in Lunenburg is raising concerns about developments being floated by a manufacturer that could alter the appearance of the heritage town's iconic waterfront. Save Our Lunenburg formed last year after local residents and property owners became aware of ABCO's plans to purchase and infill parcels of federally owned seabed extending into Lunenburg harbour. George Wyatt, a spokesperson for the group, said people learned of the plans after the company, which has a long history of aluminum boat construction in the area, asked town council for a letter stating no objection to its proposal to purchase the land for a possible residential-commercial development. At a public meeting of council last March, ABCO outlined two-storey townhouses as a development option for the infilled harbour area. Save Our Lunenburg members let residents know about the matter by distributing flyers around town. ""First and foremost, we didn't think putting townhouses in the middle of the harbour would really be in keeping with the character of the town,"" Wyatt told CBC's Information Morning, also citing concerns about environmental impacts. ""Our objective really here is we want to promote appropriate and sustainable development in Lunenburg."" Wyatt said Save Our Lunenburg is also concerned about ABCO applying to remove properties from areas under architectural control. Lunenburg has two such areas — along Falkland and Dufferin Streets and along Tannery Road, where ABCO's properties are located. In those areas, there are requirements for new main buildings and additions to be similar to pre-1940 buildings, and restrictions on the size of additions and such things as cladding, roof shape and style.  ABCO plans to develop a brew pub and cidery on Lunenburg's harbourfront, in partnership with Mahone Bay Brewing Company. There has been some confusion around whether that's why ABCO wants to be freed from some of the town's architectural limitations. According to ABCO, the brew pub and cidery, which will be called Lightship Brewery, will follow local bylaws and be built ""reminiscent of the fishing shacks that once occupied the same shores."" In an email to Information Morning, ABCO manager Jason Huskilson stated the company has requested to be removed from the architectural controls because ""current rules limit ABCO from realizing its potential"" by expanding its current manufacturing operations. ABCO's application for removal has to go before a public meeting and a public session of council before it can be approved.  Rachel Bailey, Lunenburg's mayor, told CBC that the company has made no formal applications to develop either the brew pub and cidery, which would be located on existing harbourfront land, or the mixed-used development along the harbour. The town has not sent a letter of no-objection to the federal government for the company's proposed purchase and infilling of portions of Lunenburg harbour. ""We found out there's a lengthy process, it involves the three levels of government, and our role doesn't come into play until the end,"" said Bailey, adding that the purchase and the infilling would require environmental assessment before being addressed by the municipality.   MORE TOP STORIES",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/save-our-lunenburg-concerned-about-proposed-harbour-developments-1.5438998,https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/stain-on-a-seaside-town https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/plastic-free-lunenburg-open-house-1.4994795 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285,N/A

The 18-year-old, who cannot be identified under a court-ordered publication ban, appeared at the John Sopinka Courthouse in Hamilton on Friday morning for a bail hearing. The Crown withdrew the murder count. He's now charged with assault with a weapon, administering a noxious substance and unauthorized possession of a weapon. Outside of court, the 18-year-old embraced more than a dozen family members and supporters, who filled three benches in the courtroom during the hearing. ""He's spending time with his family now,"" defence lawyer Jordana Goldlist said after her client was released from custody. ""He's been improperly in custody for two months, shuffled between three different institutions. He spent a significant amount of time in segregation, so right now he's just looking forward to going home with his family as he should be."" She said the Crown had to withdraw the murder charge, because ""there was no reasonable prospect of conviction."" The 18-year-old was released to two sureties — one of whom will have to pay $20,000 if he doesn't comply with conditions and the other who will have to pay $5,000. His conditions include not being within 100 metres of Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School or the Pat Quinn Arena, observing a curfew between 10 p.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET and not having contact with a list of 63 people or anyone with a criminal record. He also cannot possess any weapons. The 18-year-old and his 14-year-old brother, who can't be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, were initially both charged with murder in the Oct. 7 stabbing of Devan, 14, outside Winston Churchill Secondary School. CBC News previously spoke with witnesses who said that bear spray had been used on a crowd of people standing in front of the arena, causing them to scatter right before the stabbing, which happened behind the school. Police allege the 14-year-old is the person who stabbed Devan, so he's still charged with first-degree murder. Devan died in the arms of his mother, Shari-Anne Selvey. Selvey was briefly spotted outside court Friday but appeared upset and did not speak with reporters. Devan's death kickstarted a community conversation about bullying and led to the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board setting up a panel to examine its anti-bullying practices.

328,Paul Withers,2020-01-26T10:00:00.138Z,Why more Nova Scotians lose power in a storm than you realize,"During severe weather, many Nova Scotians click on Nova Scotia Power's outage map to find out how many customers have lost electricity and where. But the map doesn't tell the whole story. The actual number of customers without electricity during a recent storm was higher than indicated by the outage map, according to information provided to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. And that's a normal occurrence says Paul Casey, Nova Scotia Power's vice-president of transmission, distribution and delivery service. The Utility and Review Board asked the power company for detailed information on the interruptions and restoration times associated with a big windstorm on Dec. 10, 2019. At the time, the company said a maximum of 52,000 customers were without power at the same time during the storm. That's what appeared on the outage map. Casey said about 78,000 households lost power at least once during the storm, while the number of instances of households losing power was about 116,000. He said the peak outage number doesn't include households experiencing a second or subsequent outage, or households temporarily taken off the grid by Nova Scotia Power when the company is carrying out restoration work. It's unclear what the peak number would be if those instances were included in Nova Scotia Power's figures. ""That would total a larger number [than 52,000],"" said Casey. In its submission to the board, Nova Scotia Power released a graph tracking cumulative hours of winds above 80 km/h between 2005 and 2019 at stations in Yarmouth, Greenwood, Halifax, Truro and Sydney. The December windstorm capped a year that saw the most hours of sustained high winds on record. These winds weaken trees and equipment, increasing the probability of outages. Nova Scotia Power spends $100 million a year to maintain and upgrade transmission and distribution equipment, including $25 million for vegetation management. The company said it's investigating battery storage and microgrids as it tries to harden its system as sustained high winds become more frequent.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-power-customers-storm-outages-reason-winds-1.5440084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/10000-carrots-rabbit-rescue-adoption-1.5440660 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ohio-basketball-coach-pays-visit-brings-gifts-to-canso-team-1.5439003 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/glen-petitpas-donair-recipe-nova-scotia-smithsonian-astronomer-1.5425033 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/owls-head-little-harbour-protected-land-golf-course-development-1.5439596 https://www.cbc.ca/archives/with-interactive-tv-restaurant-delivery-was-just-clicks-away-1.5429942,N/A

Revelstoke has been bombarded with snow this winter and Sandra Gregory, who recently returned from volunteering in West Africa, is trying to gather resources to help those who are quite literally getting stuck in the community. It started last week when Gregory saw an elderly woman trying to walk through the snow in the dark with her cane when it was –18 C.  The lady had been on her way to her church group, so Gregory offered her a ride. ""By the time we got to your church group, I just said, 'Here's my name, here's my number, whatever you need, just give me a call. But I don't want to see you walking out like that in this kind of weather,' and it just started from there,"" she said. The next day Gregory got a call from another elderly woman, who got her number from the lady in the church group, asking her to come over because she was worried her roof would collapse under all of the snow. ""I wasn't really anticipating that. So I got on snow pants and wandered over and started shoveling off a roof,"" Gregory told Daybreak South guest host Brady Strachan. From there, the phone calls started to pour in from people in the community asking her to help them with snow. Gregory decided to put a call out on social media to see if there were others who would be able to help her. ""I just started to realize, you know even for myself, getting ourselves 'unstuck' in Revi isn't always easy. You don't always have the resources,"" she said. ""For our senior community, or anyone really vulnerable who doesn't have the physical ability to deal with all this snow, I mean that's tough."" Gregory has created a Facebook group called Revelstoke Unstuck, to connect people who are able to volunteer their time with those who need assistance. ""I just thought well if I can get a few people out with me really quick then I can get this done and I can probably unpack, because I haven't even shoveled myself out yet,"" she said. Since starting the Facebook group, Gregory has gotten so many messages from volunteers, she can't keep up. Some have offered time and labour, while others have offered equipment like snow blowers. ""It was incredible. It was really, really special,"" she said. While she doesn't expect any payment, people have gifted her mittens, homemade jam and salad. ""I'm eating well, and my hands are going to be warm, and I'm sure the jam was made with love.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-woman-huge-response-search-volunteers-help-seniors-snow-1.5435614,[],N/A

Skating is open to the public Thursday evenings and Saturday afternoons through mid-March.  Enjoying the ice is free, however a park entry permit is required. Visitors are encouraged to wear a helmet and asked to leave their hockey sticks at home. Tiana Waldbauer, a park nature interpreter with the ministry, grew up figure skating 15 minutes away in Fort Qu'Appelle. She said having skating through the campground in the park is an excellent idea.  ""We've already had so many people come out and use it, from just the videos on Facebook,"" Waldbauer said.  She said the area will be lit by spotlights and strings of lights by next week, allowing guests to skate after the sun sets. Waldbauer said during the winter, the park isn't often used. She said cross country skiers and people on snow shoes are a frequent sight.  She said normally the park provides lots of programming for schools during the spring months, but this year more is being offered in the winter.  ""If schools, or youth groups, families, whatever, are looking for different activities… I can bring you to the skating rink, we can do snow shoeing, fire starting programs, all sorts of different fun winter activities,"" she said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/aspen-campground-skating-rink-1.5440720,https://www.cbc.ca/life/travel/must-skate-situations-scenic-rinks-icy-trails-and-frozen-lakes-across-the-country-1.5419878 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/river-skating-winnipeg-history-1.5400778,N/A
331,Craig Desson,2020-01-23T16:45:24.843Z,"Take a walk through Kaie Kellough's Montreal of poetry, seditious cafes and immigrant vitality","Kaie Kellough is standing in Montreal's Berri-UQAM Metro. Crowds of people swerve around him in the cavernous underground structure that links three metro lines, a university and the Montreal bus station. This is close to the spot where Kellough first arrived in Montreal from Calgary in 1998. He moved to become a poet. ""That was it. That was the plan,"" he says. Berri-UQAM Metro is where Kellough decided to start his walking tour of Montreal. ""Berri might not seem like the most interesting destination, but in fact, it is a fascinating place because it is an incredible nexus in the city,"" he says. When he first moved to Montreal, he learned about his new city by riding the metro and getting off at random stations. Since this station is a transit hub, he would often end up there alone, wandering through the crowds. ""When you move to a new place ... you have to disappear into it before you kind of re-emerge, forged in that new identity."" Kellough has now lived in Montreal for more than two decades. In that time, he's established himself in Montreal as a poet, novelist and musician. He's published three books of poetry and an experimental novel. His most recent collection of poetry, Magnetic Equator, was named one of the best of 2019 by CBC Books. In his novel Accordéon, he describes the experience of being a newcomer in Montreal. ""I see people who I know arrived in this city one month ago. I see them wandering the city that I know. And I know that they will have to try harder if they want to disappear."" For the next stop on his walk, he takes us two stops north to Mont-Royal Metro — ""to a neighborhood where I lived when I first moved to Montreal."" The station is in the Plateau, a neighborhood that's been a home to Montreal artists for over a century. Kellough emerges from the metro and wanders up a nearby residential street. ""It's freezing cold."" On either side of the road are the three-storey apartments with the long outdoor staircases that the neighborhood is known for. This was the type of apartment he was able to rent for a song in the late 1990s, when Montreal's economy was struggling. At the time he could rent a 1,200 square foot apartment for $500 a month — although what he didn't bargain for was how the thin apartment walls would bring him into contact with mundane rhythms of his neighbours. The kind of dense urban living found in the Plateau became an inspiration for his writing. ""You hear people's lives up close. You hear them through the walls of your apartment. It allows you to cultivate an insight and an empathy off the different rhythms of different people's lives."" Kellough walks through the Plateau until he stops at his final destination. In front of him is a poem etched into the side of a Plateau triplex. The poems' four stanzas tower above the street. ""I love it because its language is part of the fabric of the city."" The poem is called Tango de Montréal and it's by Gérald Godin, who was a renowned journalist and politician with the Parti Québécois. It begins by describing immigrants riding the metro early in the morning and how their energy helps keep the almost 400-year-old city of Montreal on its feet — or as the poem says in French, ""If the old heart of the city is still beating, it's thanks to them."" For Kellough, who moved to Montreal from English Canada and comes from a family that immigrated from South America, the poems reveals how newcomers renew the vitality of a city. ""It makes me reflect on what my contribution is ... to the society,"" the poem translates. ""Is it just waking up in the morning and taking the metro to work and labouring or is it writing your own presence into the society?""",https://www.cbc.ca/arts/take-a-walk-through-kaie-kellough-s-montreal-of-poetry-seditious-cafes-and-immigrant-vitality-1.5423277,https://www.cbc.ca/arts/inthemaking/walking-through-vancouver-with-legendary-public-artist-ken-lum-makes-you-see-the-city-with-new-eyes-1.5331138,N/A
332,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-04-11T00:00:00.447Z,Bank regulator's report on aggressive sales tactics weakened after government — and banks — reviewed drafts,"Last year's report from Canada's banking regulator about aggressive sales tactics underwent several drafts that eliminated proposed protections for consumers — edits that were made after the regulator sent early versions to the federal Finance Department and the big banks. Internal documents from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) — obtained under Access to Information and provided to Go Public — show that some recommendations for action were weakened or removed, including a proposal to require that banks work in the best interest of consumers.  Another key edit was the addition of a line saying the review did not find ""widespread mis-selling"" by the banks. It all paints a picture of the ""cosy"" relationship between the country's six big banks, the agency that's supposed to regulate them and the federal government, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""[The banks] have disproportionate access and perhaps disproportionate influence."" The report was prompted in part by months of reporting by Go Public, in which hundreds of current and former bank employees said they were pushed to upsell customers to try to meet sales targets. Some described feeling pressured to do such things as mislead customers about credit card fees and mortgage rates, forge signatures on credit card and loan insurance products and secretly increase lines of credit. At the time, the banks told Go Public that they act in the best interests of their clients, and that employees are expected to follow various codes of conduct. The documents were obtained through Access to Information by public policy researcher Ken Rubin, who asked for draft copies of FCAC's report on sales practices at the big banks, and related correspondence. The regulator's review focused on BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD and National Bank. It found that banks encourage employees to sell products and services and reward them for sales success. But FCAC also said it did not find evidence of widespread harm to consumers. Although FCAC staff interviewed 600 bank employees, and reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents and 4,500 customer complaints, the report did not name a single bank or quote from any of the interviews. ""When I saw the March [2018] report, I said, 'There's more to it than meets the eye,'"" said Rubin, one of Canada's most prolific practitioners of federal Access to Information requests. Thomas found it particularly interesting that the regulator sent a draft of its report to the very banks at the centre of its eight-month review. ""[The banks] have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking,"" he said. ""It's a fact of life."" Sending the banks a draft copy is a big concern for consumer advocate Duff Conacher. ""You don't share … the evidence you gathered,"" said the co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa. ""That evidence is the basis of your conclusions as to whether the law has been violated."" The banking regulator told Go Public it sent the banks a draft report so the financial institutions could ""identify factual errors."" ""If the agency wanted to check the facts in the report … they could have just sent them those facts,"" Conacher said.  In a subsequent draft, a line was added pointing out that banks are ""in the process of enhancing their oversight and management of sales practices risk."" It's not known who proposed adding that line. Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) whether it requested a draft copy of the report.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labreche sent an email that did not respond to that question, writing, ""The Canadian Bankers Association and its member banks regularly communicate and meet with supervisory bodies, including the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as part of the normal course of the oversight process."" The internal documents also include dozens of pages from the big banks, which appear to be responses to the regulator's draft report.  Go Public is not able to know their contents — including the date they were written, or who wrote them — because entire pages were redacted under an Access to Information exemption that protects commercial interests. The documents also reveal that the banking regulator supplied a draft to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his department three months before publicly releasing it last year. Conacher says the regulator, purportedly an independent agency, should not have given the minister and his department a chance to vet and comment on its report. ""It's inappropriate and improper for a minister to be looking at the draft conclusions of a law enforcement agency,"" he told Go Public. ""That means decisions could be made on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts and the law."" One of the most significant edits to the initial draft that was sent to the finance minister was the addition of a finding on Page 1 that says, ""FCAC did not find widespread mis-selling during its review."" ""It's hard to say … exactly what happened,"" said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer organization based in Ottawa. ""The language seems to belie the rest of the report, which goes into some detail about how sales practices — which are a little unseemly — can be performed."" Go Public requested an interview with Morneau, but his spokesperson, Pierre-Olivier Herbert, said the minister was unavailable. In a statement, Herbert did not respond to Conacher's criticism that it ought to be considered inappropriate for the minister to receive a draft report from the banking regulator. A Finance Department spokesperson said it is routine for financial sector agencies to share documents for comment and to confirm facts. Go Public received various versions of the banking regulator's report, including several versions of the original draft, a revised copy after it went to the finance minister, and the final report.  Sentences, recommendations or conclusions are redacted in several drafts, based on an exemption in Canada's Access to Information Act that allows the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose any advice involving the institution or a federal cabinet minister. The exemption applies to advice or recommendations that occur at a ministerial level, essentially to allow confidentiality in the policy-making process. Go Public asked the minister about additions made after he had received a copy. In an email, Morneau's spokesperson wrote, ""the Minister's office did not provide comments or request any edits to the FCAC's report. The findings in the FCAC's report are entirely their own."" However, the documents indicate that Morneau's department made at least six comments on the first draft of the report, including about changing parts that say the regulator will introduce certain reforms to the regulator ""proposes"" them. Most of the comments from the department are redacted. ""The biggest thing is there were three recommendations saying banks should be 'required' to make changes,"" Conacher said. ""And those were all changed to 'suggestions' that the banks should do some things. ""Suggestions are meaningless, if you're actually trying to solve a problem. The banks don't have to do anything."" The draft sent to the minister's office included a line saying, ""Require banks to work in the best interests of their customers."" The line didn't make the final version of the report. Some other language that was critical of the banks — such as a line saying that banks ""lean disproportionately in favour of a sales driven culture"" — was also dropped before the report was published. Go Public checked the lobbyist registry to see how many times the banks or their umbrella group, the CBA, lobbied government officials, senators, MPs — including Morneau — the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and FCAC during the 12-month period between when the regulator announced it was conducting a bank review and the date it released its report. Between March 15, 2017, and March 20, 2018, the big banks and the CBA lobbied a total of 165 times. In the month leading up to the release of FCAC's report, the CBA met with the regulator's deputy commissioner, Brigitte Goulard, four times — including the day before the report was published. Lobbying is legal, but those who do significant amounts of it are required to file a record with the lobbying commissioner, who then makes the information public online. ""The banks — because they're an important economic asset to the country — have to be listened to,"" said the University of Manitoba's Paul Thomas. ""They have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking. It's a fact of life."" As a comparison, Go Public asked four consumer advocacy organizations how many times they had the ear of lawmakers and banking watchdogs during the same period. In total, they had fewer than 10 meetings with policy-makers and FCAC to discuss the sales practices of banks, they said. ""It's extremely concerning to us, of course, that consumer groups are not more meaningfully supported to participate in these important conversations,"" wrote Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. ""The council continues to have serious concerns about the resources available to facilitate meaningful consumer representation at not only FCAC but across government concerning consumer protection."" Thomas says after combing through the various versions of the bank regulator's report, the relationship between the banks, the government and the banking regulator can be difficult to figure out. ""The whole process is submerged. It's not transparent,"" he said.  ""If it hadn't been for Access to Information requests, we wouldn't know the extent to which the banks were given a certain privileged status in this process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fcac-bank-report-on-sales-tactics-weakened-1.5091115,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096,N/A

""It must have been a horrific scene. Bodies were scattered along the beach for about a mile and a half according to the first eyewitnesses,"" said ​Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin, a professor at Concordia University's School of Irish Studies. Just off the coast of the Gaspé Peninsula, the ship was caught up in a nor'easter which froze the sails and sent the mast cracking down through the ship. Among the survivors were married couple Patrick Kaveney and Sarah MacDonald, as well as their teenage son Martin. Their five daughters, all between the age of two and 10, were lost. This family and their descendants are the subject of a new documentary, called Lost Children of the Carricks: Defying the Great Irish Famine to Create a Canadian Legacy. Filmmaker Ó hAllmhuráin first heard the story from Georges Kavanagh, a francophone historian and descendant of Kaveney and MacDonald. ""I was tru​ly astonished when I heard him describe their leaving Ireland, their crossing the Atlantic, the experience of being trapped in this ship which, at the time, wasn't too different from a slave ship, and then arriving on the edge of the New World,"" Ó hAllmhuráin told CBC Montreal's All in a Weekend. Over the course of five generations, the story of Kavanagh's ancestors and their was preserved through the family's oral tradition. ""This is oral storytelling at its richest, at its very best,"" said ​Ó hAllmhuráin.  Thousands of Irish people fled to North America during the potato famine, in ships that weren't built to house human cargo. Canada alone received about 300,000 Irish immigrants, but an estimated 20,000 others died at sea or on shore from disease. ​Ó hAllmhuráin's film is described as a ""70-minute documentary of exodus and reunion,"" beginning with Kavanagh (whose name was changed slightly from the original Kaveney over the years) in the Gaspésie and following his journey back to Ireland.   ""We were able to bring the Kaveney — the Kavanagh family — back into their ancestral village,"" he said. The film crew worked with local historians in County Sligo, Ireland to track down the original walls of the Kaveney home and even some living cousins. ​Ó hAllmhuráin said it was an emotional experience for Kavanagh, now in his 80s, and his daughter. ""He had been waiting his whole life. He told me on the way across the Atlantic that ever since he was a teenager, he dreamed of going to Ireland. And he described it as 'Mon Irlande,' My Ireland. Which was so touching to hear."" The film, Lost Children of the Carricks: Defying the Great Irish Famine to Create a Canadian Legacy, screens Friday Jan. 24 at the J.A.

'If you read a graphic novel, it is as if you're watching and reading a movie at the same time,"" Schallié told host Kathryn Marlow on CBC's All Points West, adding that the combination of graphics, narrative, speech bubbles, sound effects, and visuals create a deep engagement between the reader and the text. ""Visual storytelling in graphic narratives is especially effective for life stories and memories of survivors who were children during the Holocaust, as images often tend to be so deeply imprinted in a child survivor's memory."" In fact, one of the most famous examples of the graphic novel genre, Art Spiegelman's Maus, is a depiction of Spiegelman's father's experiences as a Holocaust survivor. ""That was one of the texts that I've been using in my classroom,"" Schallié said. ""And at the end of the class, when I ask which was the text that most profoundly moved you or impacted you, it was very often Maus."" The four survivors who are part of the project include David Schaffer of Vancouver; Emmie Arbel in Kiryat Tiv'on, Israel; and brothers Nicole and Rolf Kamp in Amsterdam, Holland. Each survivor is paired with a graphic artist, and the team works together to create the story.  ""It was very important for us, to begin with, that graphic novelist were not just illustrators but were actively co-producing the history with the survivors,"" said Schallié. ""Most of the visual documentary and documents we have from the Holocaust are documents produced by perpetrators, so it's extremely important to have survivors tell their own stories."" Miriam Libicki, a graphic novelist based in Vancouver, is working with Schaffer, who survived the Holocaust as a boy in Romania after his family was deported to Transnistria. Libicki, whose own grandparents were Holocaust survivors, says the project has a great deal of urgency. Her own grandfather died three years ago and she wishes she had got a chance to talk to him more about his experiences. ""We have fewer and fewer survivors left, and I think it's really important to have the stories first and to not only have them as documents, but to know what the survivors themselves think is important about their stories, what they care about, what are the lessons or the facts they want future generations to take from this story,"" she said.  Schallié says the graphic novels will be completed by 2022. International Holocaust Remembrance Day is on Jan.27.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uvic-holocaust-graphic-novels-1.5434227,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/schedule-for-monday-jan-26-1.2952224/acclaimed-cartoonist-art-spiegelman-on-keeping-comics-daring-1.2952229 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028,N/A

The company announced a production halt in December, when the global grounding of the fast-selling 737 Max following two deadly crashes in five months looked set to last into mid-2020. Calhoun said the company isn't considering scrapping the Max and expects it will continue to fly for a generation. He also said it won't launch a marketing campaign to get customers to get back on 737 Max planes. He disclosed that Boeing is starting with a ""clean sheet of paper"" on a new midsize airplane but it is not clear if the company is scrapping the existing design. The company said on Tuesday it now expects regulators to approve the plane's return to service in the middle of the year. Calhoun said he did not see recent issues raised about wiring or software as ""serious problems."" Boeing shares fell about 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, rebounding from earlier lows during the day. Calhoun said Boeing isn't planning to cut or suspend its dividend, because the company has the ""financial capacity and capability to do the things we need to do."" The CEO said he ""will stay on that path unless something dramatic changes."" Calhoun declined to provide a specific date for resumption of production, but said it ""will be reinvigorated months before that moment in June, because we have to get that line started up again."" He also said the company would make some changes to the 737 Max production line to make it more efficient. Calhoun said the company ""will slowly, steadily bring our production rate up a few months before that date in the middle of the year."" He said the company was not planning to lay off any employees because of the latest delay in the Max. The latest push back in the forecasted return to service is due to the company's decision to endorse simulator training for pilots before they resume flights, he said. ""We can get this thing back on its horse and we will,"" he added. Calhoun was a director at Boeing for a decade before taking over as chief executive earlier this month. The board ousted Dennis Muilenburg in December amid rising anger among regulators, politicians and customers. He said the company should have not have repeatedly revised the plane's forecasted return. ""It was hard for anybody to trust us,"" Calhoun said. Calhoun said before certification there will be ""a few more things somewhere along the way that the FAA and us will determine need a little extra work and we'll do it.

339,Amanda Pfeffer,2020-01-26T03:20:46.715Z,Animal rights activists decry Ontario bill that would limit farm protests,"Animal rights groups have begun protesting and petitioning against Ontario Bill 156 — a law aimed at curbing activism against farms and farming practices. The Security From Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2019  was introduced in the Ontario legislature late last year. Agriculture Minister Ernie Hardeman said the bill comes in response to complaints from farmers about animal rights groups trespassing on their private property.  'The farm is also our home': Proposed bill suggests peace of mind for farmers In debate, Hardeman called the bill a ""bio-security"" measure, to protect food safety. The bill is now in its second reading. If passed, the bill would increase fines for anyone caught trespassing on farmland and food processing plants, and introduce new measures against interfering with animal transportation.  The law would also make it illegal to gain access to a farm under ""false pretences"" — effectively making undercover filming an offence. A group of about 20 animal rights activists showed up at Ottawa's Lansdowne Park Saturday with signs and leaflets, encouraging the public to sign a petition against the law. It was one of several protests planned over the next month, ""It will stop people from seeing animal suffering,"" said Lucie Tsi, who works with the Ottawa group Animal Rebellion. She fears the proposed law will halt animal activism. If caught trespassing on a farm, offenders could be fined as much as $25,000, a significant hike from the current $10,000 maximum under the Trespass to Property Act. It would also introduce fines for interacting with farm animals which are being transported by a vehicle without permission. Tsi points to the example of Ontario activist Anita Krajnc who made headlines in 2017 when she was arrested for giving water to pigs on the back of a transport truck on the way to a slaughterhouse. Pig Trial: Anita Krajnc found not guilty of mischief charge for giving water to pigs Krajnc was acquitted on charges of mischief, but if the new law is passed, similar actions could be found in violation. Farmers have been lobbying for legislation to protect them from the threat of more ""aggressive tactics"" from animal rights activists. ""It poses stress on farmers, and anxiety that it might happen to them,"" said Mireille Leroux, first vice-president of the Union des Cultivateurs Franco-Ontariens. ""The more aggressive activism is what farmers fear the most,"" she said. ""So we want to keep our families safe, and our work environment safe.""  Similar legislation was passed in Alberta earlier this year, and also exists in the United States.  But among the half-dozen states that now have what activists call ""Ag-Gag"" laws, courts have struck down legislation in Idaho, Iowa and Utah as being unconstitutional. Last week a U.S. federal judge ruled the law in Kansas banning undercover filming at farms and slaughterhouse facilities ""criminalizes"" free speech.

340,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-28T19:29:08.530Z,"Senior evicted from mental health facility, left to live in tent with rats","Judy Trask can barely sleep at night — curled up in a tent hidden in the bushes of a Victoria, B.C., park, worried that rats will attack, or worse, that she'll be raped. The 65-year-old ended up homeless, she says, after she was given two hours to pack what she could carry and get out of an apartment operated by a government-run mental health program. In March, according to Trask, staff sent her onto the street to fend for herself, handing her only a ""street survival guide"" to get by: a brochure that lists the locations of soup kitchens, 24-hour washrooms and homeless shelters. According to the eviction letter, Trask was kicked out of the mental health treatment facility after staff decided the program wasn't working for her, saying the senior was verbally aggressive and threatening toward staff. ""I mean my God, they think you're just human cattle,"" said Trask, who says she suffers from suicidal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Trask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. She was sent there from another facility in the Comox Valley, more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria, after that program underwent cutbacks, she said. The senior has no ID — it was stolen —and no family that can help. She often doesn't take the mood-stabilizing medications she needs.  She's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria public parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring. While Vancouver Island Health's motto is, ""Excellent health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,"" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham told Go Public the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency shelters ""as a last resort."" She said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database tracking exact numbers. Bloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but said Island Health ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services. Trask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay. Trask is part of a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilities that can result in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges. ""Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,"" he said. That adds pressure on overburdened emergency services across the country. Trask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela — a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre — after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent. ""It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her body when I found her,"" said Tudela.   Tudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification. Trask ended up going back to her tent that night. ""What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,"" Tudela told Go Public. ""That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that … with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'"" In September,  police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors of homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.  She says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a park in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated. Tudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask. She says no one responded. Although the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is ""a very frail woman."" ""She's all about 110 pounds,"" Tudela said. ""She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm."" Mental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in Canada on any given night — and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness. ""There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,"" said Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg. He says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues. He worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings. The AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, N.B. It found that the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. The study, published Oct. 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind using the Housing First model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term. WATCH | Judy Trask shows housing advocate  Carolina Tudela her tent in a Victoria park: Without stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for. ""Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,"" Distasio told Go Public. Go Public put Trask's situation to Canada's first provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken. ""For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,"" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. ""Our government is working to change this."" Darcy says the B.C. government plans to build 2,200 affordable housing units and expand access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit. As for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street. ""You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,"" says Tudela. ""The system is broken … I don't understand the coldness of it all.""

341,Erica Johnson,2019-11-18T16:14:38.413Z,"Bank wires fraudsters over $800K of retiree's savings, despite red flags","A Calgary retiree says he was ""sick to his stomach"" after learning his bank wired more than $800,000 of his savings to fraudsters despite security red flags. Rod McLeod, 75, was a longtime customer with Cidel Bank — one of dozens of private banks in Canada that handle wealth management for people with high incomes or sizeable assets.  ""It has turned my life upside down,"" says McLeod, a retired lawyer. ""I expected them to protect me."" McLeod is suing, alleging ""negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"" by Cidel in a statement of claim filed last week. It's one more case of what's become a multibillion-dollar problem in Canada and the U.S., according to authorities.  Wire fraud is a ""huge problem"" and ""so rampant,"" investigator and former FBI agent Don Vilfer told Go Public, that better laws are needed in Canada and the U.S. to protect bank customers.  ""Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. is behind in terms of requiring financial institutions to take certain steps … [to prevent] this kind of thing,"" Vilfer said.  In September 2018, McLeod was excited to make an offer on a condo in Rancho Mirage, Calif. — just north of Palm Desert. He had Cidel wire a deposit to a California bank account and waited for instructions on the outstanding balance of $619,000 US ($820,000 Cdn). A few weeks later, an email supposedly from the realtor handling the sale, said the balance should go to a different bank — Chase Bank in Denver, Colo. Even though his escrow agent had cautioned him, two months earlier, against any sudden changes, McLeod says the warning was forgotten in the push to seal the deal.  The seller, he'd been told, was a billionaire. ""So it made sense that he banked in several places."" McLeod sent the new instructions to his contact at Cidel. But the email wasn't from his realtor, Brady Sandahl. It was from a new email address, created by fraudsters who had transposed the last two letters of Sandahl's name so that, at first glance, it appeared legit. When that email arrived at Cidel, it appears the bank's mail server flagged it, tacking ""SUSPICIOUS MESSAGE"" onto the subject line.  Despite that warning, a bank employee emailed the fraudster, asking for the address of the bank account owner — adding a senior Cidel employee and McLeod to the email thread. McLeod says his excitement about the condo got the better of him. He didn't notice the email had been flagged, and, he says, had no prior experience wiring money to another country. ""I don't do this every day. This is something that's totally new to me,"" he said.  ""My wife said, 'You wanted it too much, you ignored the red flags.'""  McLeod and his wife authorized the wire transfer. The money went to Denver, where fraudsters quickly transferred most of it to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. Days later, when McLeod made inquiries about next steps, it became apparent he was the victim of fraud. ""I thought, this can't be happening,"" he says. ""It just can't be happening."" Chase Bank was able to keep $26,000 US from being transferred, and that money was returned to McLeod. McLeod hired Vilfer to investigate. Since leaving the FBI over a decade ago, Vilfer has testified in over 100 cases, often providing expert testimony on digital forensics in cases involving wire fraud. ""It's very profitable for the fraudsters when they can pull it off,"" he says. ""We had one client that lost $14 million — and they're [fraudsters] doing this all day long."" In his report to McLeod, Vilfer says the realtor's email account may have been compromised and recommended further analysis of the realtor's devices and accounts.  ""With email hijacking scams of this type, in my experience, it is the realtor or mortgage broker who is targeted,"" he wrote. Sandahl did not respond to calls for comment from Go Public.  The case is an example of what investigators call ""business email compromise"" — a type of wire fraud that targets businesses and their customers. Typically, the fraudster hacks into a business's email account and impersonates the sender, instructing the customer to redirect the money.  Go Public recently investigated this type of scam, and spoke to a Toronto-area businessman who lost almost $3,000.  Compromised business emails — particularly in the real estate sector — led to an estimated loss of $12 billion US over the past five years, according to the FBI. Such scams were reported in 150 countries, and all 50 U.S. states. Vilfer says McLeod's bank — Cidel — should have stopped the scam in its tracks. ""You have the flag on the email that it's a suspicious message,"" says Vilfer. ""And with this kind of fraud that's so prevalent … that should certainly cause some sort of alarm, to take an extra look at this and see why is this being flagged?"" ""Good technology ... apparently was ignored,"" he said.  In the statement of claim against Cidel, McLeod's lawyer, Brett Code, alleges the bank's actions ""represent a marked departure from the required standard of care, and constitute gross negligence."" It seeks full compensation for McLeod's loss.  None of the allegations has been proven in court and Cidel has not yet responded to the statement of claim.  In one of two emails to McLeod, Cidel CEO Craig Rimer wrote: ""We are very sorry that you've had to go through this terrible experience and for the financial loss you endured."" However, he wrote, Cidel has no obligation to reimburse McLeod.  In a second, one-line email, Rimer blamed McLeod for the wire fraud, writing, ""The introduction to the email address came from you and you authorized the transaction after much back and forth between them [fraudsters] and you."" Rimer declined to be interviewed but sent Go Public a statement saying, ""We acted in accordance with the express written and signed wire instructions that were delivered to us by our client.""  He would not outline what policies exist at the bank when it comes to conducting wire transfers, but wrote that Cidel acted in full compliance with all industry standards and that the bank will continue to assist its client in recovering the funds from ""an unscrupulous third party."" There is no legislation in Canada or the U.S. that requires a financial institution to confirm the identity of a bank account holder who is receiving a wire transfer to prevent fraud and protect customers.   It's considered a best practice for banks to confirm they are sending a client's money to an appropriate destination, but Vilfer — the former FBI agent — thinks that needs to become law.  ""We're just relying on the banks doing the right thing,"" he says. ""It would be a good idea for both the United States and Canada to stiffen up the statutory requirements; require policies for protecting against this sort of fraud."" The largest insurer of U.S. banks, ABA Insurance Services, said recently it's ""critical"" that banks start making phone calls to authenticate wire transfers, among other procedures.  McLeod knows his lawsuit against Cidel could drag on for years. ""If I don't win this, I'm throwing good money after bad,"" he says. ""And they can outlast me. I'm 75 years old."" He's also moved his remaining assets to another management company.

342,Anonymous,2020-01-26T21:22:59.293Z,"Rain, warm temperatures on the way for eastern Newfoundland on the heels of huge blizzard","Just over a week after a historic blizzard dropped more than 75 centimetres of snow on eastern Newfoundland, warmer temperatures and a significant rainfall are now expected. Environment Canada has issued a special weather statement for much of eastern Newfoundland, with the Burin Peninsula falling under a rainfall warning with 20 to 30 mm forecast. CBC meteorologist Ashley Brauweiler says the St. John's area will see about 5 to 10 mm, starting overnight Sunday with the heaviest rain starting around 9 a.m. Monday and persisting through the afternoon. That rain, combined with warmer temperatures, could cause flooding in some areas.  ""We're going to see that rain, we're going to see those temperatures climb as well,"" Brauweiler said. ""There's 115 cm of snow on the ground and that [snow], the rain and the temperatures in the mid-single digits, will lead to quite a bit of melting … at five to six degrees, I'd say that it's going to melt pretty fast."" Brauweiler said it's best to be proactive and dig out catch basins and around homes before the heaviest rain begins. ""Make sure that storm drains are cleared, that if you do have any sort of snow against windows — because we did have a lot of drifting with this storm — just make sure you clean those off,"" she said. ""When it does start to rain, you don't want that water to come in."" The warm temperatures are expected to cool off Monday night, Brauweiler said, bringing some flurries and the possiblity of a quick freeze. ""The temperatures aren't staying up above zero for very long, and then heading into Tuesday, they're going to be hovering near or around zero,"" she said. ""Into Tuesday, it looks like we'll just see some flurries and grey skies, but still, as those temperatures hover around the zero degree mark, we're still going to see some sort of melting."" A rainfall warning is also in effect along the south coast of the island, with 20 to 40 mm of rain expected from Port aux Basques to the Connaigre Peninsula. While the snowpack on the south coast is only 14 centimetres, Brauweiler said, there could still be some localized flooding in areas that are prone to flood. All that rain will instead come down as snow along parts of the Northern Peninsula and Green Bay-White Bay, with 10 to 20 cm expected. A freezing rain warning has also been issued for Deer Lake, the Humber Valley and communites south of Green Bay, as well as a blowing snow advisory for Red Bay to L'Anse-au-Clair.

The national disaster agency later updated the total with seven more casualties. Some 1,243 people were injured, with 34 of them in intensive care but not in critical condition, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. On Saturday afternoon, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the hardest-hit areas and attended the funeral of a mother and son killed in the quake. He warned people against repeating ""negative"" hearsay about the country being unprepared for earthquakes. ""Do not listen to rumours, do not listen to anyone's negative, contrary propaganda, and know that we are your servants,"" Erdogan said. Various earthquake monitoring centres gave magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 6.8. for the earthquake, which hit Friday at 8:55 p.m. local time near the Elazig province town of Sivrice, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said. It was followed by 398 aftershocks, the strongest of them with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1, the disaster agency said. Emergency workers and security forces distributed tents, beds and blankets as overnight temperatures dropped below freezing in the affected areas. Mosques, schools, sports halls and student dormitories were opened for hundreds who left their homes after the quake. ""The earthquake was very severe. We desperately ran out [of our home],"" Emre Gocer told the state-run Anadolu news agency as he sheltered with his family at a sports hall in Sivrice. ""We don't have a safe place to stay right now."" While visiting Sivrice and the city of Elazig, the provincial capital located some 565 kilometres east of Ankara, Erdogan promised state support for those affected by the disaster. ""We will not leave anyone in the open,"" he said. Earlier, a prosecutor in the capital Ankara announced an investigation into ""provocative"" social media posts. The Anadolu news agency reported that Turkey's broadcasting authority was also reviewing media coverage of the quake. At least five buildings in Sivrice and 25 in Malatya province were destroyed in the disaster, Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said. Hundreds of other structures were damaged and made unsafe. AFAD reported that 42 people had been rescued as search teams combed wrecked apartment buildings. Television footage showed emergency workers removing a woman from the wreckage of a collapsed building 19 hours after the main earthquake struck. A prison in Adiyaman, 110 kilometres southwest of the epicentre, was evacuated due to damage, with more than 800 prisoners transferred to nearby jails. AFAD said 28 rescue teams had been working around the clock. More than 2,600 personnel from 39 of Turkey's 81 provinces were sent to the disaster site. Unmanned drones were used to survey damaged neighbourhoods and co-ordinate rescue efforts. ""Our biggest hope is that the death toll does not rise,""parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop said. Communication companies announced free telephone and internet services for residents in the quake-hit region. Neighbouring Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over maritime boundaries and gas exploration rights, offered to send rescue crews to assist the Turkish teams. Erdogan appeared to reject the offer of outside assistance during his visit to the city of Elazig, telling reporters, ""Our state does not need anything."" Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.

A new program launched by the Winnipeg School Division, Indspire and the University of Winnipeg is doing just that, and recruiting students while they're still in high school. ""The Build From Within program is a teacher development program that [Indigenous] students will embark in a six year journey to become educators,"" said Stephanie Midford, a teacher at St. John's High School in Winnipeg where the program launched. ""It's super awesome and very intense, but you know our students are given this opportunity and they're just going to succeed."" In its first year, the goal for the 30 students who were accepted, is to graduate with both their high school diploma, an an educational assistant diploma. Once they graduate, they will go to the University of Winnipeg to complete their integrated Bachelor of Arts and Education. Shane Bostrom, project manager of Build From Within, said the program is unique to the Winnipeg School Division, and was created with the help of local Indigenous elders.  ""In talking with elders [they said], we need to find from within our division future Indigenous teachers, instead of trying to find them from everywhere else to come in,"" he explained. The program was created with the goal of getting more Indigenous teachers into classrooms, which Midford said has the potential to positively impact the education experiences of students. ""The biggest thing is to see that reflection [in teachers], seeing an Indigenous person in front [of the class] who is this role model, mentor, that students can relate to,"" said Midford. ""I think the biggest thing though is [Indigenous teachers] will help decolonize our classrooms … if we have more Indigenous teachers in those roles of leadership, our classrooms will be decolonized."" Ayla LaForte, a student from St. John's, joined the program and hopes to one day teach kindergarten. ""I personally didn't know how I was going to get into University, just because I didn't know what I wanted to be,"" said LaForte. ""This program [also allows me to] give back to my community, because it has given me so much.""

346,Sara Minogue,2020-01-24T20:33:46.827Z,Yellowknives Dene seek benefits agreement from Giant Mine cleanup,"The Yellowknives Dene are asking why they're still being treated like any other stakeholder when it comes to the $1-billion Giant Mine cleanup.  The project was subject to public hearings by the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board this week. The board is considering whether to issue a 20-year water licence that would allow the Giant Mine cleanup team to move into active remediation. ""One of the things that the Yellowknives Dene are struggling with is a project such as this has such a high dollar value,"" Johanne Black, the First Nation's director of treaty rights and governance, told the board early in the week. ""But when it comes to the Giant Mine Remediation Project, there is not one agreement that exists in terms of their social responsibilities.""  The Yellowknives Dene want to see a benefits agreement that specifically addresses the need to share jobs, training and business opportunities with the First Nation most affected by the mine. They also want to take a leading role in environmental monitoring of the site for the long-term. It's not clear whether the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board will consider a benefits agreement or another arrangement with the Yellowknives Dene as a condition of the water licence.  However, a lawyer with the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board pointed to an example from 25 years ago when Ron Irwin, as minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, ordered resources company BHP to address social licence issues around the Ekati Diamond Mine before a water licence could be issued.  ""That's an issue that crystallized around the water licensing process,"" said John Donihee.  Every operating mine in the N.W.T. has signed a voluntary agreement with an Indigenous group or groups. The new Mineral Resources Act, which passed in September of last year, will make such agreements mandatory for future projects.  The Giant Mine cleanup is not a mining project, and it's not under the jurisdiction of the N.W.T. government. But Black and others argued that the billion-dollar price tag puts it in the same league.  ""Under the legislation, impact benefit agreements are between private companies,"" Natalie Plato, deputy director with the Giant Mine Remediation Project, told the CBC. ""We're a government so obviously we don't fall into that category."" ""What we have agreed to do,"" Plato said, ""is we do a contribution agreement with the Yellowknives Dene as well as the North Slave Métis Alliance that contains many of the items that would be in a typical benefits agreement.""  Contribution agreements are also in place for the City of Yellowknife, Alternatives North, and other groups participating in the formal review of the project.  The cleanup team has funded a BEAHR training program through the Yellowknives Dene's Dechita Naowo program, at a cost of about $150,000 a year. The program, designed to prepare students for environmental field work, recently produced about a dozen graduates. Plato also points to the project's socio-economic strategy and advisory committee, which includes the Yellowknives Dene as one of several parties at the table.  But Black said that seat at the table has the effect of ""diluting"" the Yellowknives' Dene voice.  ""The project's response has been that it is not necessary to have an agreement with an individual organization,"" Black said. ""We are not just any organization."" She said repeatedly that the First Nation is a rights holder, not a stakeholder, a term that several project staff began to use as the hearings rolled on.  The cleanup team also points to two efforts to increase Indigenous participation in future contracts.  The Aboriginal Opportunities Considerations gives contract bidders higher points if they include Indigenous employment, training and subcontracting as part of their bid, thus making them more likely to win the contract. The Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business or PSAB is another mechanism. In a PSAB request for proposals, only Indigenous businesses can bid. Bobby Drygeese is the chair of the Yellowknives Dene's Det'on Cho Corporation.

""The cleanup … should be used to help us move on to the future.""  The Det'on Cho Corp. has a contract to do security at the mine site.

""I shouldn't have to come here and beg for compensation.""  Beaulieu is one of the recent graduates from the project-sponsored BEAHR training, but he says he's still out of work, and can't afford to go to school elsewhere.  In response, Plato said more positions should open up, once active remediation begins.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-economy-yk-dene-1.5439395,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-hearings-tuesday-1.5435900 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-remediation-to-do-list-1.5434166 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ykdfn-nechalacho-agreement-1.5437975,N/A

Multiple trains along the Confederation Line lost power on both Saturday and Sunday, delaying travel times for many riders. 'Power loss' on 2 LRT trains leads to delays for riders Saturday On Sunday evening, OC Transpo warned customers the weekend problems would continue to cause interruptions on Monday, but did not specify to what extent. Supplemental bus service will continue Monday to help move customers between Tunney's Pasture and Blair stations, it said. In an email to CBC Ottawa Saturday night, Rideau Transit Maintenance said initial indications were that the day's service interruptions were related to ""a known electrical arcing issue."" The problem can trip a train's main circuit breaker and halt the train, the company said. OC Transpo implemented its R1 bus service between parts of the line Saturday. On Sunday morning, the transit service again warned of longer way times because of trains being held at Tunney's Pasture and Pimisi stations due to power issues, however, it said full service was still running from end-to-end along the Confederation Line. The power issues are part of an ongoing series of problems that have been plaguing the system, including when two trains collided, Friday.

Rescue teams from neighbouring provinces were dispatched to the affected areas, working in the dark with floodlights. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said troops were on standby to help. TV footage showed rescuers pull out one injured person from the rubble of a collapsed building in the district of Gezin, in the eastern Elazig province. Around 30 were believed to be trapped inside collapsed structures in Elazig province, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, who travelled to the afflicted area together with Soylu, said 13 people were killed in Elazig, including two people who suffered heart attacks, and five others died in Malatya. A total of 553 people were hurt, including 11 who were in serious condition. Some 30 buildings had collapsed from the quake in the two provinces, according to Murat Kurum, the environment minister. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Twitter that all measures were being taken to ""ensure that the earthquake that occurred in Elazig and was felt in many provinces is overcome with the least amount of loss."" The quake struck at 8:55 p.m. local time, at a depth of 6.7 kilometres near the town of Sivrice in Elazig, the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, or AFAD, said. It was followed by several aftershocks, the strongest with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.1. Elazig is some 750 kilometres east of the capital, Ankara. People in Elazig whose homes were damaged were being moved to student dormitories or a sports centre amid freezing conditions. Elazig Gov. Cetin Oktay Kaldirim told NTV television that a fire broke out in a building in Sivrice, near the epicentre, but was quickly brought under control. Soylu was at a meeting on earthquake preparedness when the quake struck. The Kandilli seismology centre in Istanbul said the quake measured 6.5., while the U.S. Geological Survey gave the preliminary magnitude as 6.7, and said the quake affected not only Turkey but also Syria, Georgia and Armenia. Different earthquake monitoring centres frequently give differing estimates. NTV said the earthquake was felt in several Turkish provinces and sent people running outdoors in panic. Turkey sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent. Two strong earthquakes struck northwest Turkey in 1999, killing around 18,000 people.

349,Sophia Harris,2020-01-23T09:00:00.107Z,"U.S. border officers were told to target Iranian-born travellers, officer alleges in email","U.S. border officers working at multiple Canada-U.S. border crossings were instructed to target and interrogate Iranian-born travellers in early January, said a U.S. border officer in an email obtained by CBC News.  The allegation follows reports that up to 200 people of Iranian descent travelling from B.C. — many of them Canadian or U.S. citizens — were detained and questioned for hours at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, Wash., during the weekend of Jan. 4.  On Friday, Jan. 3, the U.S. assassinated Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, intensifying tensions between the two countries.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told CBC News that the ""current threat environment"" prompted it to implement an ""enhanced posture"" at the border. However, it denied detaining Iranian-born travellers and said the delays at the Peace Arch crossing were related to staffing issues during a busy holiday weekend.  The U.S. border officer challenges CBP's claims in an email he sent to Blaine-based immigration lawyer, Len Saunders. Social media posts that CBP is detaining Iranian-Americans and refusing their entry into the U.S. because of their country of origin are false. Reports that DHS/CBP has issued a related directive are also false. Saunders believes the officer reached out to him because the lawyer has been openly critical of how CBP allegedly treated Iranian-born travellers.  Saunders confirmed the U.S. officer's identity and said that he works on the front lines. He asked that CBC News keep the officer's name confidential, because the person fears repercussions from his employer.  To further protect the officer's identity, CBC isn't directly quoting from the page-long email.  In it, the officer told Saunders that CBP's Seattle Field Office — which covers the Canada-U.S. border from Washington State to Minnesota — directed border officers to ask Iranian-born travellers counterterrorism questions.  The officer claimed that the sole reason Iranian travellers were detained and questioned that weekend was due to their ethnicity. He alleged that the operation was unethical and possibly unconstitutional. In his email, the officer also told Saunders that after the detainment of Iranian-born travellers made national news on Jan. 5, the operation was suspended. CBP declined to comment on the content of the email without reviewing it first. To protect the officer's identity, CBC declined to send it. Saunders said he also recently spoke with another U.S. border officer who worked the weekend of Jan. 4 at a Washington State border crossing different from the Peace Arch. Saunders said the officer confirmed the Seattle Field Office had directed frontline staff to target Iranian-born travellers.  ""It confirms my suspicion that this was not just happening at Peach Arch,"" said Saunders. He also said that the officers' claims confirm his beliefs about how Iranian-born travellers were treated at the border.  ""They violated American constitutional rights by interrogating them and detaining them,"" alleges Saunders. ""What's next? Where does it stop?""  Although there are allegations that travellers with ties to Iran were targeted at multiple U.S. border crossings, Saunders believes the focus has been on the Peace Arch because a big group of Iranian-Americans travelled through that crossing Jan. 4, on their way home from a concert in Vancouver.  ""It was because there was a large group that it got attention. That was just by chance,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's a lot more cases we don't know about."" Not all Iranian-born travellers held at the Peace Arch in Blaine were returning home from a concert.  Iranian-born Canadian citizen, Sam Sadr of North Vancouver said he and three relatives were heading to Seattle when they were detained at the crossing for more than eight hours on Jan. 4.  ""Why us?"" said Sadr who was visiting the U.S. for the first time. He said he counted more than 120 people of Iranian heritage being held for questioning that day. ""As soon as they released me, I told the officer, 'This is called discrimination.'""  Negah Hekmati, an Iranian-born U.S. Citizen, was returning home with her husband and two children after a ski weekend in Canada. She said her family was held for questioning at the Peace Arch crossing for five hours during the early hours of Sunday.  ""They had our car keys, they had our passports,"" she said during a news conference on Jan. 6. ""I am here today because of my kids. They shouldn't experience such things. They are U.S. citizens and this is not OK."" To get to the bottom of what happened, 70 U.S. congress members sent a letter to CBP on Jan. 6, demanding answers. ""We are deeply concerned about the experiences of those impacted this past weekend and the potential that this may be the start of a new policy at our borders and airports illegally targeting those of Iranian descent,"" stated the letter.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is now investigating the matter.  CBP declined to comment on the investigation. ""As a matter of policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not comment on pending litigation,"" spokesperson Mike Niezgoda said in an email.

350,Roshini Nair,2020-01-21T23:00:41.932Z,"As paparazzi descend on Harry and Meghan, B.C. privacy laws could face first celebrity test","Ever since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their exit from the royal family, the hot glare of the media they tried to escape in the U.K. has continued to burn brightly, even on Canada's west coast.  Monday evening, SkyNews published video of Harry, decked in a puffer jacket and tuque, deplaning from a West Jet plane on the Victoria airport tarmac. Photographs of Meghan's life on the island — taking a seaplane to Vancouver, going to a yoga class, picking up a friend from the airport — have all been published. On Tuesday, media outlets like the Guardian said the couple had issued ""a stern warning"" against photographers in Canada after ""unauthorized"" pictures of Meghan walking with eight-month-old Archie in a park with the family's two dogs were published in a number of British tabloids.  The couple, who have long had a difficult relationship with the tabloid press, are involved in a number of lawsuits with U.K. tabloids over invasion of privacy — but their latest Canadian warning could mean a test for this country's privacy laws.  Privacy is governed by both federal and provincial statutes in Canada, explains privacy lawyer David Fraser, who works for the firm McInnes Cooper, and runs the Canadian Privacy Law Blog.  Most Canadian privacy law is similar to U.K. law, he says, but what is different in British Columbia is the implementation of the provincial Privacy Act.  In  B.C., the Privacy Act is what allows individuals to sue other people for invasions of privacy where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The act also says privacy may be violated by eavesdropping or surveillance, whether or not accomplished by physical trespass. ""So, the act of the paparazzi of continually following around a person — in this case the duchess — probably could be surveillance for the purposes of this act, which could lead to a lawsuit,"" Fraser explained.  A successful lawsuit wouldn't bring substantial monetary damages, he says, but could grant the privacy-seeking couple something more important — an injunction against that kind of repeat surveillance from photographers. The major caveat, however, is that the law hasn't really been tested with these types of ""celebrity"" cases.  ""It's all relatively untested when it comes to these sorts of circumstances [because] we don't have in Canada the same sort of paparazzi culture,"" Fraser said. ""Most of the cases that we've seen under this statute ... principally relate to voyeurism, to a landlord putting a hidden camera in an apartment [or] harassment and things like that."" As Vancouver Island continues to bear the gaze of the international tabloid press, Fraser says pure economics rather than the law might be the blunt instrument of choice that eventually wins the young family their peace.  ""If you're a freelance paparazzi photographer in Los Angeles or Monaco or London, that's a pretty target rich environment,"" Fraser said. ""On Vancouver Island, there will be one or two celebrities and one baby that you'll be looking to try to earn your living from.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-privacy-laws-harry-meghan-1.5434741,https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-harry-victoria-meghan-archie-1.5434247 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-her-majesty-prince-harry-meghan-security-costs-canada-1.5434579,N/A
351,Anonymous,2020-01-26T11:00:00.988Z,"After the apology, Indigenous groups seek firm commitments from Quebec government","There was optimism last fall when Quebec Premier François Legault stood before the National Assembly, turned to First Nations and Inuit leaders in the gallery and apologized for the province's mistreatment of Indigenous people.  The apology was the first recommendation in a report prepared by retired Quebec Superior Court justice Jacques Viens. The report — the result of nine months'  testimony about decades of abuse, mistreatment and neglect — concluded that Indigenous people in Quebec are victims of ""systemic discrimination"" when it comes to accessing public services. It laid out 142 recommendations for the province regarding policing, social services, corrections, justice, youth protection, and health and social services. Legault promised to closely examine those recommendations and act swiftly to improve the relationship between the province and Indigenous communities. Since then, things have not gone as well. Legault didn't show up to the first meeting with Indigenous leaders last October. His absence prompted questions about the government's level of commitment to a ""nation-to-nation"" relationship. He isn't planning to attend the follow up, scheduled for Monday, either. ""It's really disappointing,"" Lac Simon Chief Adrienne Jérôme said last week. Legault's minister of Indigenous affairs, Sylvie D'Amours, who was on vacation for most of January, will be there in his stead.  Legault told reporters he has ""full confidence"" in D'Amours. ""Obviously, during the year I will meet the Indigenous communities, but I cannot go to all the meetings,"" he told reporters. Ghislain Picard, the regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations for Quebec and Labrador, said Friday he wants Indigenous leaders to ""be bold"" and ""take the lead on matter and, hopefully, get a positive response from Quebec."" ""As we've said many times before, an apology is something, but it's got to be supported by proper actions by the government."" Monday's meeting, to be held behind closed doors, is scheduled to run all day in Montreal.  On the agenda are both the Viens commission recommendations and those of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. But other concerns have emerged since.  The Coalition Avenir Québec government upset First Nations leaders when it announced, right before the Christmas break, that it would ask the province's Court of Appeal to rule on the constitutionality of a new federal law governing Indigenous child welfare. The federal legislation, which went into effect Jan. 1, allows Indigenous groups to take over their own child welfare systems and prioritizes the placement of Indigenous children in care with members of their own extended families and Indigenous communities. Picard called the decision to challenge the long-awaited federal law ""shameful"" and ""unacceptable."" ""Defending its so-called jurisdiction is one thing, but doing it on the back of our children is another,"" he said at the time. ""The Legault government is well aware that the current child welfare system does not work for First Nations children.""

352,Thomas Daigle,2020-01-24T09:00:00.324Z,"After Jeff Bezos hack, calls for greater controls on hacking tools","The recent revelation that Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos fell victim to smartphone hacking — allegedly involving Saudi Arabia's crown prince — has cast a light on the shadowy world of cyber weapons sales. Organizations as prominent as the United Nations and Amnesty International have demanded better controls be implemented over the way digital arms and private surveillance tools are sold. But those calls have come before, and experts say the attack on Bezos, one of the wealthiest people in the world, highlights how journalists and free speech activists, among other groups, remain at risk. ""These allegations demonstrate that nobody is safe from the use of this kind of technology,"" the UN's point person on free speech, David Kaye, told CBC News in an interview. He warned that people ""should understand the reach of the private surveillance industry."" Kaye and Agnès Callamard, both UN special rapporteurs, on Wednesday published details of the Bezos hack, stemming from a private consulting firm's forensic analysis of the billionaire's iPhone.  The company, hired by Bezos, assessed with ""medium to high confidence"" that his device had been infected with spyware when he received a video file from the account of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the Facebook-owned instant messaging service WhatsApp. The analysis found ""unprecedented"" data transmission from the iPhone began within hours of Bezos receiving the suspect video — apparently allowing hackers to steal gigabytes of files from his device over ""some months."" The incident, on May 1, 2018, came months ahead of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime — and columnist for Bezos's newspaper — at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The hack also came before the National Enquirer tabloid obtained private texts and photos revealing Bezos's extramarital affair. His longtime wife later filed for divorce. Norway-based human rights activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, a friend of Khashoggi's, told CBC hacking tools are being handed ""to governments that are simply irresponsible."" ""Given the current state of affairs, I think we need a moratorium on the sale and transfer of this technology,"" he said. Saudi officials called claims of the Kingdom's involvement in the hack ""absurd."" The UN report calls for national and international authorities to institute export control regimes on private surveillance technology. Conventional weapons, by contrast, are subject to worldwide agreements such as the UN-brokered Arms Trade Treaty. Involving more than 100 countries, the treaty sets norms for cross-border arms sales and seeks to prevent human rights abuses. Although analysts found no malware in Bezos's smartphone, experts said it's possible the malicious code could have hidden its own tracks after the infection. The UN report pointed to two types of spyware ""that can hook into legitimate applications to bypass detection and obfuscate activity."" The first, known as ""Pegasus,"" created by the Israeli-based NSO Group, was suspected of being used by Saudis before, to spy on critics abroad. The second ""less likely"" option, according to the report, is that hackers employed Galileo, otherwise known as ""Remote Control Service,"" developed by the Hacking Team. The Milan-based group was reported to have sold cyber tools to the FBI in the past. Hacking Team did not reply to a request for comment. NSO, however, vigorously defended its work in an emailed statement, saying ""our technology was not used in this instance … our products are only used to investigate terror and serious crime."" Saudi Arabia was previously reported to have spent $55 million US on Pegasus. The Israeli firm, though, claimed this week its tools cannot be used on U.S. phone numbers. It did not explain whether the apparent measure was included in its code, or whether it could be modified by a client after its sale. It's not the first time NSO distanced itself from similar allegations. In October, WhatsApp sued the firm in U.S. federal court, claiming NSO had helped governments spy on 1,400 users around the world. NSO said at the time it denied the allegations and vowed to ""vigorously fight them."" Separately, WhatsApp's developers recently said they had fixed a bug that allowed for malicious code to be inserted into an MP4, the same type of video file believed to have been sent to Bezos. The alleged targets were not named in court. Quebec resident Omar Abdulaziz, however, is among Saudi Arabia's critics believed to have been hit with spyware — likely NSO's Pegasus, according to research carried out by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard, who wrote a book on the Saudi crown prince, also said on Twitter this week that ""operators linked to Saudi Arabia"" tried to hack his phone a month after the attack on Bezos. He thanked Citizen Lab for having ""checked it out."" This week's UN report said Saudi Arabia targeted Bezos principally in his role as owner of the Post, which published Khashoggi's criticism of the regime. Ronald Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab, said the Bezos case serves as ""a reminder that the proliferation of commercial spyware is a global security problem for all sectors, from government and businesses to civil society."" He said his group had identified ""hundreds of journalists, human rights defenders, politicians, and others who have been targeted with these technologies."" Citizen Lab stressed it was not part of the private analysis of Bezos's iPhone, but published recommendations for how the consulting firm could further investigate the source of the hack. Amnesty International is also involved in court action in Israel, where activists are attempting to get the country's defence ministry to block NSO from exporting its products. ""NSO continues to profit from its spyware being used to commit abuses against activists across the world and the Israeli government has stood by and watched it happen,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty's tech division. Kaye, the UN special rapporteur, said Citizen Lab's work has shown spyware is all too often used by rogue regimes to silence or intimidate activists, dissenters and reporters. He said it's been illustrated so many times it's ""no longer surprising, but still shocking.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bezos-hack-controls-on-hacking-tools-1.5438388,https://www.cbc.ca/news/theweekly/the-canadian-researcher-who-helped-expose-a-new-cyber-weapon-the-weekly-with-wendy-mesley-1.5368893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-experts-call-for-investigation-after-saudis-linked-to-jeff-bezos-phone-hack-1.5435739,N/A
353,Anonymous,2020-01-25T10:00:00.759Z,Chinese New Year celebrations to kick off in Montreal despite coronavirus worries,"As revellers get ready to celebrate the Chinese New Year in downtown Montreal, participants can expect to see a couple of new additions to the colourful displays: hand sanitizers and face masks. Everybody — as long as they're feeling healthy — is welcomed by organizers to show up at the Complexe Desjardins to enjoy a range of professional performances and activities rooted in Chinese culture. But anybody who is feeling even slightly under the weather is encouraged to stay home and wait for the video to be posted online. The extra caution is in response to concerns about the coronavirus — a potentially fatal flu-like virus that originated in China and is now surfacing in countries around the world. Yet Montrealers have little to worry about so far, health authorities say. ""There are no new cases of coronavirus at the moment in Quebec, nor in Canada,"" said Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, Friday. He has been working to reassure the population, telling the public that the province is well prepared to detect, treat and contain the virus should it find its way here. Airports are taking extra measures, and health professionals across Quebec are well-equipped, he said. The screening protocols have already put six people who arrived in Quebec from China in hospital. They were subsequently under observation in Quebec City and Montreal, but they have all tested negative for the disease which can cause a fever, cough and respiratory distress. Arruda urged the population to not give in to any irrational or unfounded fear as stories of China's struggle to contain the virus make international headlines. However, the province isn't letting its guard down, he said, and people should not be surprised to see more people under medical surveillance. In Brossard, on Montreal's South Shore, Sino-Quebec, a group that helps more than 3,000 new Chinese immigrants a year integrate into Quebec society, has changed its office policy. The group usually helps people in person, but director Xixi Li said they're asking newcomers not to show up right away. ""If you just arrived from China, you should stay at home for two weeks before you go to a public space or come to our centre for service,"" she said. Some Chinese New Year celebrations have been cancelled in the region because the community is on edge, Li said. She said her organization has been in touch with health authorities, hoping to better understand the situation.      The community is ""afraid because we know what happened during the SARS period,"" she said. ""And they're afraid that they will have this disease, there's no treatment and people will die suddenly."" However, Canadians have no need to worry about the prospect of mass quarantines, public health authorities said on Friday. Health officials have been working with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg to develop a quicker testing method, and the federal government has beefed up measures at major airports. Quebec's public health directorate has set up a webpage outlining the disease, reminding the population that most people who do contract the coronavirus will recover on their own.  ""There's no reason for fear because sometimes the epidemic of fear is greater than what is going on,'' said Arruda. As for the festivities planned for downtown Montreal, organizers say they don't expect the coronavirus to deter people from the celebrations.  ""The year of the rat is the first year of the zodiac,"" said Bing Pan, the secretary of the Montreal Chinese Chamber of Commerce, referring to the 12 animals that make up the cycle. ""The people who were born in this year, are very active, like sports. They run fast. And they are lucky.

The 17-year-old's comments marked a final coda to the four-day World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, where a major theme was tension between environmental activists who want to protect the Earth and Trump administration officials and business titans who want to exploit its resources for jobs, profits and economic growth. Many of the 3,000-odd business leaders, government officials, UN representatives, civil society representatives and other elites on hand have found themselves somewhere along the spectrum between the positions staked out by U.S. President Donald Trump and Thunberg. The Swedish teen sat in on Trump's speech Tuesday to the forum, but that did little to bridge their ideological differences. On Friday, Thunberg, who has been battling the flu this week, apologized for her ""low energy"" — a term Trump has often used to mock rivals — as she spoke out again in favour of science and facts, and set off on yet another ""Fridays for Future"" march through snowy Davos streets. At a news conference before the march, she acknowledged young climate activists ""are being criticized all the time"" in comments like those from U.S. Treasury chief Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin had a day earlier dismissed Thunberg's suggestion that governments and companies cut back dramatically on fossil fuels with a condescending barb. ""Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused,"" he said. Then, following a brief pause, he said it was ""a joke."" ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us."" Watch Greta Thunberg say her demands over climate change 'have been completely ignored' at Davos:  Thunberg insisted that her priority was drawing attention and action to concerns about global warming. ""We cannot care about those kinds of things,"" said the Swede, who was selected as Time's Person of the Year for 2019. ""The situation is not being treated like the crisis it is,"" she said alongside fellow activists Vanessa Nakate of Uganda, Loukina Tille of Switzerland, Luisa Neubauer of Germany, and Isabelle Axelsson of Sweden. Thunberg and her climate advocates have also faced criticism from some longstanding environmental advocates over their tactics, if not necessarily their ambitions. Famed primatologist Jane Goodall warned about ""gloom and doom"" messages that cause some young people to lose hope. ""It doesn't help when young people stand up and point fingers and blame people. That doesn't work. The only way it works is to tell stories and to get to people's hearts, and some of these young people I know have such amazing stories, and they really are changing the way people think,"" Goodall said in an interview Thursday. ""But not in an aggressive way."" A press handler for Thunberg said she wasn't available to respond to Goodall's comments.

355,Éric Grenier,2020-01-24T13:17:11.472Z,What Pierre Poilievre's exit means for the Conservative leadership race,"Jean Charest was probably in — and then he was definitely out. Rona Ambrose was thinking about it — then she stopped. Peter MacKay is in and, by all accounts, still is. Pierre Poilievre was going to throw his hat into the ring, too. Until he wasn't. Yes, the Conservative leadership race we all expected has not quite materialized. Poilievre's surprise announcement on Thursday that he would not mount a bid for the leadership leaves the contours of this campaign ill-defined. The Ontario MP was widely considered to be the main competition for MacKay, the former cabinet minister and last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party. Poilievre did have a path to victory. As the only major candidate with roots in Western Canada — he was born and raised in Alberta — Poilievre had the potential to take the lane as the candidate of the West, where the party's caucus, membership and donor base are disproportionately located. Watch: What high-profile exits mean for the Conservative leadership race  He had the chops to be a player in Quebec. Only a few days ago, he was on Radio-Canada and, by speaking decent French and expressing views on social conservative issues that were in line with mainstream opinion in the province, dispelled the two biggest concerns Quebec Conservatives had with Andrew Scheer's election performance. Combined with his track record as a partisan pitbull for Stephen Harper, he appeared to be the most likely recipient of votes from members opposed to MacKay — and to any swing back to the old PC wing of the party that took a back seat to the Reformers after the 2003 merger. With MacKay and Poilievre on the ballot, there didn't appear to be much room for Ontario MP Erin O'Toole, who finished third in the 2017 leadership race and will be mounting a second attempt. He ran his last campaign as a consensus candidate in the centre of the party, gaining the support of members who voted for moderates like Lisa Raitt and Michael Chong and disproportionately ranked O'Toole as their second choice. MacKay is well-positioned to occupy this lane. He has already received the endorsement of three MPs who backed O'Toole in 2017. Even MacKay's regional base overlaps with O'Toole, who had his best results in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Atlantic Canada is likely to be MacKay's fiefdom: he represented a riding in Nova Scotia for nearly two decades, the same seat his father Elmer occupied for even longer, and he has the backing of Tim Houston, the provincial PC leader in Nova Scotia. But there is now an opportunity for O'Toole to take up the space left vacant by Poilievre. That will be no easy task. But by the process of elimination, O'Toole has the best shot at it. Instead of being squeezed out between MacKay and Poilievre, O'Toole merely has to position himself to the right of MacKay as the only acceptable option for members looking for an alternative. Other names probably will join MacKay and O'Toole on the ballot. Ontario MPs Marilyn Gladu and Derek Sloan have indicated they want to run. The 12th place finisher in 2017, businessman Rick Peterson, says he will take another kick at the can, as have a number of former staffers and failed election candidates. But until these people meet the Conservative Party's demanding qualification requirements, or give some tangible evidence that they are serious contenders, this looks like a two-horse race. It's a race with no frontrunner from Quebec and nobody from Western Canada. Only a single candidate has a name that a majority of Canadians can recognize: Peter MacKay. So, will this be it? Justin Trudeau's Liberals are in their second term and were reduced to a minority government only last fall. The Conservatives continue to run roughly even with the Liberals in national polls. The next leader of the Conservative Party has a good shot of becoming the next prime minister — certainly a better shot than appeared to be the case in 2017. Charest's decision on Tuesday left Quebec up for grabs. On Wednesday, Ambrose left the field wide open in Western Canada. Poilievre relinquished his contender status on Thursday, along with all the organizers and donors his candidacy would have taken off the table for other candidates. This race looks a lot different than it did on Monday. Anyone who had ruled out a bid at the beginning of the week might want to take the weekend to think it over again.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447,[],N/A
356,Alex Soloducha,2020-01-23T23:14:20.557Z,FNUniv students call for apology from U of R over poet controversy,"Some students at the First Nations University are calling for an apology from the University of Regina after controversy over a lecture originally scheduled for Thursday night. The First Nations University Student Association held a smudge walk around the campus it shares with the U of R this morning. The event was planned after the University of Regina invited George Elliott Clarke to speak at the Woodrow Lloyd Lecture.  In December, there were calls for the lecture to be cancelled because Clarke had edited poetry for Steven Kummerfield, who was convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of Regina woman Pamela George in 1995. Clarke told CBC that he wasn't ruling out reading Kummerfield's work during the lecture. Clarke later apologized to members of George's family, said he would not read any of Kummerfield's poetry at the event and, the following day, cancelled the lecture completely.  Taryn Acoose, president of the FNUniv student association, said some of her peers and supporters from outside of the association and the school are calling for an apology from the U of R.  ""This is all just about having a discussion. We're not trying to slander or be rude to anybody,"" Acoose said. ""It's just...acknowledge that there was a mistake made. And how do we make it better? How do we move forward in a good way?"" Acoose said she's proud that her student association has been in talks with the U of R and has received some informal acknowledgement. The president of URSU and a representative of Vianne Timmons were both at the walk Thursday afternoon.  ""This is just a peaceful gesture just to demonstrate and promote healing,"" said Acoose. ""We just wanted to cleanse all the negativity from the university. ""These are small acts of reconciliation and healing that we can all practice in our own lives."" Acoose said she has classes with a member of Pamela George's family who said they were willing to welcome George Elliott Clarke.  George's daughter Chelsey, and other members of her family, took part in the walk along with students and other people who have lost a missing or murdered loved one. Acoose said it was powerful to see everyone come together. ""I almost cried,"" said Acoose.""I'm on my own healing journey and we all have that trauma, but you know, we need to start opening up that it's OK to acknowledge those traumas."" Chelsey George was brought on as one of the guest speakers at Thursday night's event, Speaking for Ourselves, held at the FNUniv by the group Matriarchs on Duty.   Chasity Delorme said they came up with the idea to give women the opportunity to perform songs, poetry and speak at the open mic. Delorme said she and other women were talking before the cancellation of the lecture and decided to take things into their own hands. ""That's kind of where the seed was planted,"" Delorme said.  The name for the group of organizers was inspired by the traditional role of women in Indigenous society, according to Delorme. ""Historically it was the women who oversaw what happens in the community. Although we had male chiefs to represent us — it was always the women who made decisions,"" she said. ""So we are also reclaiming our space within our communities and taking on the responsibility of protecting our community."" Delorme said the U of R should never have invited Clarke to give the lecture.  ""It's unfortunate that the committee who selected him didn't do their research,"" she said. ""Even when they did find out the connection, their lack of empathy is still actually what the community is hurting from."" She said truth and reconciliation should have superseded academic freedom of speech in this case. ""An entire community lost their faith in the University of Regina.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/matriatchs-on-duty-hosting-regina-event-1.5437425,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/poems-removed-parliamentary-website-1.5416642 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/indigenization-academic-freedom-george-elliott-clarke-steven-kummerfield-1.5414821,N/A

The growth of the celebration has been huge since the 2016 New Year, known as Tet in Vietnam, in Elaine Nguyen's basement. Then a few friends had a potluck and sang karaoke. Nguyen, now secretary of the Vietnamese Association of P.E.I., said the community is both growing and coming together. ""We found each other,"" she said. There were about 100 people in a church basement for the second celebration. ""Then the third year we have about 120 people. And the fourth year we had 400 people attending. Well, our celebration this year we hope would be around 500 people."" Preparations for the coming event include the making of sticky rice cakes that can take 12 to 15 hours to cook, a deep cleaning of the house, and throwing away any worn out items. Nguyen will also share stories and traditions of Tet with her children. For example, the Vietnamese share a tradition with northern British people that the nature of the first visitor of the New Year can bring bad or good luck. The Vietnamese, however, have devised a way of cheating fate. ""Just to be safe the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before 12:00 a.m.,"" Nguyen said. ""Then when the clock strikes midnight he will step into the house to prevent the first person entering the house."" Nguyen said it is important to share these traditions with her children. ""What kind of food you should eat or drinks, what you should not do during Tet, what you shouldn't say during Tet. Otherwise they will start forgetting,"" she said. ""My understanding of Tet is already fading a lot. So I try to keep whatever I can remember for my children.""

She was startled, and called her husband, who was out of town and driving back from Halifax that morning. ""To my surprise, I looked out the window and there was someone in it and just took off with our vehicle,"" Dable said.  The vehicle was locked and the keys were inside the house.  ""I just realized, 'Oh my goodness, I think somebody stole our vehicle,'"" Dable said when she spoke with her husband, confirming that he wasn't the person in the truck. After she called the police, Dable made a post on Facebook explaining what happened to the truck. ""I felt violated the whole day,"" Dable said. ""How can people be so cruel, right?"" But casting a net on social media worked.  The post she made was widely shared and found its way to two woodcutters working on an isolated road in Nackawic, about 40 minutes from Dable's house.  And around 11 a.m. Friday, Dable had a message from the workers. They thought they had found the vehicle. ""They sent me a picture of our plow truck in the middle of the woods in Nackawic,"" she said. The two guys who found the truck stayed there until Dable's husband and the RCMP arrived. Dable said it looks like the thief tried to plow an isolated road in the woods and got stuck before abandoning the vehicle. Dable said it's too early to know the extent of the damage to the truck because it's still with the RCMP while they investigate. But, she said the lock on the front door of the truck is broken and the dashboard is torn apart. Dable said she's happy that the truck was found in piece, but the whole experience was eerie.  ""Last night, I couldn't sleep. I felt violated.""  ""And for somebody to have done something like that, it means that we were being watched.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-stolen-truck-found-1.5440722,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/family-number-dean-ns-home-invasion-truck-theft-1.5186916 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/sea-doos-mount-moriah-social-media-1.3857158,N/A
359,Adam van der Zwan,2020-01-26T18:06:43.638Z,'Trapped in a dump': Shawnigan Lake resident frustrated over high property value,"A resident in Shawnigan Lake, B.C., says he is shocked that his assessed property value remains high despite the provincial government's decision not to remove around 100,000 tonnes of contaminated soil from a controversial landfill next to his property.  ""It hasn't decreased enough because we have a toxic waste dump in our backyard. We're all paying too much tax,"" says resident Kevin Glass. Glass said he and his neighbours are appealing their assessments, hoping to have them lowered, so they can sell more easily, and so newcomers will be able to afford to build new homes and move in to what ""was supposed to be a high-end neighbourhood."" The landfill, located in an old quarry in the hills above the community of Shawnigan Lake, received a permit in 2013 to accept and store up to 100,000 tonnes of contaminated soil each year. Contaminated soil is typically caused by industrial activity but does not include hazardous waste. In 2017, the province pulled the permit after it said the company, Cobble Hill Holdings, failed to provide documents proving financial security. The decision to revoke the permit followed years of protests and several court battles over the facility. In July 2019, the province decided on a landfill closure plan that does not involve removing the soil, but involves regular monitoring by the province.  Glass said his property value only decreased by four per cent last year, after it was announced the soil would stay. It had jumped 20 per cent the year before, after the site's permit was pulled. After years of controversy surrounding the site and widespread concerns over possible contaminants in the drinking water, Glass is left questioning what the ""real market value"" might be ""when we're trapped in such a dump."" He added that there are a number of half-constructed houses in the neighbourhood because it's too expensive to complete them. Gerry Marolla, deputy assessor for B.C. Assessment's Vancouver Island branch, said residents from the neighbourhood have been appealing their property values since 2015, when the issue took off. Currently, five property owners have appealed their 2019 assessment.  ""At the end of the day, we have to look at what the market transactions are selling for in the area,"" Marolla said about how property values are assessed. Aaron Stone, chairman of the Cowichan Valley Regional District, says he ""absolutely sympathizes"" with the residents, and continues to pressure the Ministry of Environment to remove the contaminated soil from the site. ""Protecting drinking water is paramount,"" said Stone, adding the district did propose a soils deposit bylaw in 2017, but ""reclamation of mining sites or contaminated sites … are not within the jurisdiction of the regional district."" The bylaw was amended in 2019 to require fees for soil deposits. Bernhard Juurlink from the Shawnigan Basin Society said the Vancouver Island Health Authority conducted a test of the well water right next to the site, where it found lead levels to be five times higher than the allowable limit. A statement from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy says ""though the Cobble Hill Holdings landfill site is no longer operating, the company is responsible for maintaining and dealing with the site under the Spill Prevention Order."" It says any new soil added to the site ""advances work of the closure plan"" and will ""stabilize the landfill"" and ""reduce any chance of erosion.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trapped-in-a-dump-shawnigan-lake-resident-frustrated-over-high-property-value-1.5440399,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/shawnigan-lake-landfill-closure-extended-1.5340548 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/soil-landfill-contaminated-vancouver-island-shawnigan-lake-1.5198872 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-government-suspends-permit-for-soil-dumping-near-shawnigan-lake-1.3956584,N/A
360,Yvonne Colbert,2019-11-20T19:47:55.495Z,N.S. man takes one of world's biggest automakers to court — and wins,"Most people might be hesitant to take one of the world's biggest automakers to court. But not Nine Mile River, N.S., resident Ranulph Hudston, who persisted in his battle to have Volkswagen honour its 12-year corrosion warranty. The retired educator wouldn't take no for an answer when his 2007 Jetta started rusting and the company denied his warranty claim. He decided to take Volkswagen to Nova Scotia small claims court, and earlier this month won a judgment of $7,886.40 to pay for the repair costs. ""I was very surprised and very pleased,"" Hudston said of the court's Nov. 7 ruling. ""As I read the decision, I saw a lot of what I put into the case coming back to me as the truth, and the truth coming through felt really good."" His win came despite a list from Volkswagen of possible causes for the corrosion on the Jetta's door sills and rocker panels, including tree sap, bird droppings, shoe buckles and an improperly stored seatbelt. In her ruling, small claims adjudicator Shelly Martin didn't buy any of the excuses, saying she failed ""to see how a seatbelt or footwear could affect the areas in question, as the site of corrosion is not easily in contact with footwear or a seatbelt."" The 12-year corrosion warranty was provided to Hudston when he bought the vehicle brand new in 2007. He first noticed rust on the left front fender when his Jetta was almost seven years old. He went back to Hillcrest Volkswagen in Halifax, where he purchased the vehicle. He was then sent to a Volkswagen-authorized repair shop, which fixed most of the rusted areas and replaced the right quarter panel. But three years later, in 2017, he noticed blistering paint and a small strip of paint peeling on the rocker panels, as well as blistering paint on the front door sills. He took the Jetta to a body shop for repairs and was told the body work under the paint was rusting. He was advised the repairs should be covered under Volkswagen's warranty. Hudston went back to Hillcrest, where he was told to fill out an online inspection request that included acceptance of additional terms and conditions that were not in the original warranty. One new clause said any decisions by Volkswagen were final, while another said repairs must be made ""promptly."" Hudston was subsequently sent for a repair estimate where a technician told him any attempt to clean the rust on the door sill would likely ""blow a hole right through it."" More than a month later, Hillcrest Volkswagen told him the repair would not be covered, saying the corrosion was not the type covered by his warranty. It also refused to cover the rocker panels. Hudston continued to push Volkswagen to pay for the repairs, but the company responded in an email: ""We are unable to base our decisions on information received from independent shops and our decision remains unchanged."" It cited a number of reasons why the corrosion might have occurred — ranging from bird droppings, to rocks, to lack of rust proofing — and also suggested the problem was due to a general lack of maintenance. But in her decision, Martin noted photos of the vehicle showed ""an older but well cared for Jetta, stored in an impeccable clean garage."" The adjudicator said she was not convinced that any of the reasons provided by Volkswagen ""were of sufficient magnitude in the location of the corrosion to be its cause."" She also noted that three technicians that inspected the vehicle suggested it was corrosion covered under the warranty. George Iny, with the consumer advocacy group Automobile Protection Association, said he's not surprised by the potential causes cited by Volkswagen. He said automakers have a template for rust cases that includes 18 reasons why corrosion might have occurred. ""In many cases, they would just throw as many as they can and hope that one or two will stick. They really need only one for the judge to be convinced they are not responsible,"" he said. He calls it ""laughable"" that Volkswagen would say bird droppings are responsible for the rust on vertical surfaces on the lower part of the car. Iny said his organization has heard from dozens of Volkswagen owners who have had difficulty getting their corrosion warranties honoured. As a result, his group has posted tips on its website. Iny noted Volkswagen last year reduced its warranty from 12 to seven years, which he said is still good coverage by industry standards.  ""The impression we have is that they're applying that reduction retroactively and they're not supposed to do that,"" he said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Canada, Thomas Tetzlaff, said the automaker takes all matters of quality very seriously and always honours the full terms of its warranties. He said while the company respects the court's decision, it is now considering whether to appeal. Iny said Hudston's case is a template for other Volkswagen owners facing rust problems. He said people can't go to court and simply say, ""I have a warranty and my vehicle is rusting."" He said vehicle owners need an expert or, at the very least, a report from an expert. Hudston, who has owned numerous Volkswagens and thinks they're excellent cars, said it was the company's own actions that led him to continue his fight. ""They didn't seem to want to hear me. They, in fact, seemed to be stonewalling me and I guess that insulted me. I expect to be respected by the companies I buy products from,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/warranty-corrosion-volkswagen-group-canada-small-claims-court-1.5363613,[],N/A
361,Shanifa Nasser,2020-01-27T01:18:55.385Z,"'Impossible to forget them': Hundreds honour 2 mothers, children killed in Iran plane disaster","In the quiet of his empty home, it can sometimes feel like Hadi Ahmadi's wife and son are still away on their trip. It's a short-lived reprieve from the crushing weight of his loss. His wife, Behnaz Ebrahimi, and nine-year-old son, Rahmtin Ahmadi, were ripped away from him when 176 people were killed on Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752, which was downed by Iranian forces earlier this month.  Then reality sets in. ""I don't have them anymore,"" he says, taking a breath. Each time he can grasp it, the pain begins all over again.  Ahmadi arrived back to his Toronto home Saturday night after a flight to Iran he never dreamed he would have to make: to identify the remains of his loved ones and lay them to rest. On Sunday, hundreds gathered to honour his wife and son at a memorial in Richmond Hill, Ont.   It was one of two memorials held Sunday for two mothers and their children killed in the disaster. Siamak Jadidi also bid his wife and daughter goodbye on Sunday. Saharnaz Haghjoo, 37, and Elsa Jadidi were also on the plane, their remains identified last weekend and returned to their family in Toronto on Saturday. Some 300 people turned out to the Imam Mahdi Islamic Centre north of Toronto to honour their memory. ""They were full of love, both mother and daughter, and they always wanted to do good,"" said Zainab Rasool, who grew up with Haghjoo. ""Sahar was just a gem, she was a flower, she walked into the room and she would light up the room."" Ahmadi flew to Tehran as soon as he heard the news. He had to see his wife and son again. But when he arrived, he learned there was almost nothing left of their remains. ""She was a wonderful wife. The best mother, the best friend, kind to everyone ... she always had a smile,"" he said through tears. The pair met in Tehran and got married there, before moving to Toronto 16 years ago.  Rahmtin, he said, loved dinosaurs and especially hugs from friends, teachers and just about anyone around him. He had Down Syndome and was in a special class at school, his father said. ""Rahmtin had a short life, but I think he had the best life. He was always happy. He had whatever he wanted,"" Ahmadi said. ""I wish I would have gone with them to Iran instead of staying behind to work."" On the morning after the news of the disaster, Ahmadi recalled Rahmtin's school bus driver arriving ready to pick him up. ""I went to see the driver. I told him Rahmtin is not coming home anymore,"" Ahmadi said, explaining what had happened.  When he looked out 15 minutes later, the bus was still there, the driver's head resting on the wheel in grief. That afternoon, he got a phone call from the school saying all of Rahmtin's teachers had been crying recalling those special hugs.  At the ceremony for Saharnaz Haghjoo and Elsa Jadidi, Haghjoo's father thanked Canadians for all the support shown to his family and the victims since the disaster. ""My family is now from this city to the ocean, from East to West,"" he said. ""The amount of compassion, sympathy, they're all with me,"" he said. ""Everyone, I really thank you."" But amid the gratitude, his pain was palpable. ""I hope nothing like this happens to not even my worst enemy. This is unbearable,"" he said, his voice breaking. Haghjoo was a teacher at a campus of the Brampton-based Wali ul Asr Islamic school, while Elsa was a student there. Since Elsa's death, a photo of a drawing she did a few months prior has been a small comfort to students, the school said.   The drawing showed a beaming Elsa holding a large, white poster with the words, in letters the colours of the rainbow, ""Life in Heavin."" She drew three mosques: one of the mosque of the prophet's family, another with the words ""Pray Salah"" and the third that recognizes the Qur'an. Butterflies flutter near a palm tree with a bounty of coconuts. A creek flows along one edge. And a sun shines brightly on the entire scene. ""It does give people a little bit of comfort that she visualized something so wonderful that will be her reward to be in a good place,"" said the school's principal, Mina Mozaffarian. Through the grief, the ways in which Canadians have banded together has been a light, said Daryoush Kari, president of the Imam Mahdi Islamic Centre, which shares a parking lot with the neighbouring synagogue. After the tragedy, he said, the rabbi, a good friend, visited the mosque to deliver prayers. ""One of the first slogans I saw when I came to Canada was 'The world needs more Canada.' I didn't get it at that time, but when it comes to this kind of times, I realize it,"" he said.  For Ahmadi, the silence in his home is almost too much to bear. He's overcome with grief when he opens the door to his son's room for the first time since the tragedy.  ""Everywhere I look, I have a memory of them,"" he said. ""It's impossible to forget them, it's impossible to live without them."" ""I really don't know how to start my life again, if there's anything left.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-victims-laid-to-rest-1.5441166,https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/flightps752/ https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-body-recovery-funerals-1.5421321 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-canada-iran-mother-daughter-plane-crash-1.5440685 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/iran-plane-crash-toronto-victims-1.5418882,N/A
362,Ben Mussett,2020-01-25T15:00:00.538Z,'Do the little bit I can': Wuhan-born woman raises funds to help hospitals back home,"A Prince George woman originally from Wuhan, China is raising money to buy basic medical supplies to help halt the spread of the mysterious coronavirus that originated in her hometown. ""I try to do the little bit I can,"" said Vicki Larsen. So far, the retired restaurant owner and her friend Sarah Lin Yang, also from Wuhan, have bought $400 worth of surgical gloves and face masks. But Larsen hopes to purchase more supplies, including sanitizing solution and full-body protective equipment, before shipping the load to Wuhan, the sprawling capital of China's Hubei province.  The city is now on lockdown, leaving 11 million residents in a state of mass quarantine, while over-capacity hospitals continue to face a shortage of medical supplies. The virus has now killed 41 people, all in China, mostly within Hubei province.  Coronavirus death toll climbs to 41, more cases reported in China ""I know it's very limited but I'm trying my best,"" the 54-year-old told CBC's Andrew Kurjata about her effort to help, which involves a partnership with Marquee International, a Prince George grocery store that is also accepting donations. ""It's very scary and very sad."" Fortunately, Larsen says, nobody she knows has contracted the virus. Larsen and her family left Wuhan for British Columbia's north when she was 16, but she never lost touch with her hometown. Over the last decade, Larsen has visited Wuhan every year, always drawn back by the city's famous breakfast treat: hot dry noodles.  ""That's the first thing I do [when] I get to Wuhan,"" said Larsen, about her affinity for the dish. ""It could be 12 o'clock, middle [of the] night. That's what I want.""  She last visited this past October, when China's seventh most populous city bustled with people. Now, streets lie mostly empty as many residents hunker indoors. When people do venture outside, they are required to wear face masks, though the B.C. Centre for Disease Control has cast doubt on the effectiveness of the masks. Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus ""It's very desperate,"" said Larsen, who receives continual WeChat updates from friends back home. ""Everything is shut down."" The epidemic has emerged at Lunar New Year, typically one of China's busiest times of year. When people would normally be flocking to outdoor celebrations, the government has instead encouraged residents to wish their friends and family a happy new year over social media. ""It's a very different new year for Wuhan,"" she said. On Friday, one day after banning travel to and from Wuhan, China expanded the lockdown to include 12 cities and 35 million people across the central part of the country.  Meanwhile, ""to address the insufficiency of existing medical resources,"" the city is constructing a 1,000-bed hospital modelled after the Xiaotangshan SARS hospital in Beijing. The facility is a prefabricated structure, slated for completion Feb. 3.  The SARS hospital was built from scratch in 2003 in just six days to treat an outbreak of a similar respiratory virus, which spread from China to more than a dozen countries, killing about 800 people. The new coronavirus: Symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you think you're infected According to China's National Health Commission, more than 1,287 people in China have been infected by the virus, bringing the global total to over 1,300. So far, cases have been identified in France, Australia and the United States, including Washington state.  There have been no confirmed cases in Canada, but Larsen's thoughts are more than 9,000 km away, where the picture looks very different.

The second motion directs hamlet administration to send a letter to the minister of Community and Government Services requesting the community's name be changed from Cape Dorset to Kinngait.

Police divers located the body Friday afternoon about two kilometres downstream from where the group of snowmobilers broke through the ice on La Grande Décharge, an outlet to Lac Saint-Jean located about 70 kilometres northwest of Saguenay. The group of eight French nationals, led by a guide, were trying to cross a snow-covered channel between the towns of Saint-Henri-de-Taillon and Alma when the ice gave way. The guide, found due to the light on his helmet, was pulled from the water by Alma firefighters soon after the accident. He died several hours later in hospital. Three others from the group survived without serious injury. Police are not identifying the body found Friday. A Quebec coroner will perform an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death before the body is repatriated to France. Teams of divers, supported by a Sûreté du Québec helicopter, will continue to search the freezing waters Saturday for the four other missing tourists, according to SQ spokesperson Sgt. Hugues Beaulieu. He said conditions are optimal for divers, who will intensify their efforts in the area where the body was found on Friday. While they will focus on that location, Beaulieu said rescuers aren't neglecting other sectors, as the area left to search is ""extremely large."" ""At this moment, there is no question of abandoning the search,"" he said. About 30 provincial police officers are involved. Rescuers with specialized training to work on ice, snowmobile units and drones have also been deployed. On Thursday, the divers found personal effects, including clothing belonging to the missing people. They have also located six of the seven snowmobiles. Andrée LaForest, the provincial minister responsible for the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, offered her condolences to the victims' loved ones.

For the past dozen years, the NCC has offered free, guided snowshoeing expeditions into Gatineau Park, specifically aimed at new Canadians experiencing their first winter here. If participants show up underdressed, there are tuques, scarves, even winter coats and boots they can borrow. Newcomers celebrate Family Day in true Canadian style: snowshoeing Snowshoeing is easier, cheaper and arguably less painful to learn than skating or skiing. ""If they can walk, they can snowshoe,"" said Rachel Paquette, an NCC program officer in Gatineau Park. She even offers a bold guarantee: ""They will master snowshoeing in just a few minutes.""  That's not to say they won't take the odd tumble, especially when the guide challenges participants to walk backward. The good news is, snow provides a soft landing for learners.  ""I fell down on the ground. It was funny,"" said Jiewen Nan, 20, from China. His friend, Zezhou Lu, 18, pulled him to his feet. ""Otherwise I couldn't get up."" Manal el Kacimi, from Morocco, arrived in Ottawa in August. She said other international students warned her that, 'Oh my God, it's going to go to –40 C, you're going to be so depressed all the time.'"" But that's not at all what happened. ""When winter came along, I was super happy about it,"" el Kacimi, 19, said. ""It's actually, like, super awesome to discover a new environment that you don't always see."" After completing the introductory 1.5-kilometre loop, which takes about an hour, participants are offered hot chocolate and a choice of regular or halal marshmallows — often their first exposure to the sweet treats, Paquette said. Participants come from the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America. More than 8,000 have experienced snowshoeing through the NCC program. The wintry, woodsy experience is ""something that they've read about, or heard about. And now it's real,"" Paquette said. ""I've never experienced a winter like this,"" confirmed Evelin Nickels, 29, from Argentina. ""Even when the snow is hitting you in the face. It's a whole new experience for me. I'm in love with Canada, and with winter. Most people say they hate winter, but I love it. Honestly."" And the snowshoeing? ""So far, it's fun.""

366,Erica Johnson,2019-11-04T18:23:16.606Z,Seniors' home confines 94-year-old blind woman to bedbug-infested room for 2 weeks,"Rita Bedford, 94, was kept confined to her apartment in a Chilliwack, B.C., senior care home for two weeks last December over the holidays — while bedbugs multiplied on her mattress. She is blind, and a staffer alleged in emails to provincial authorities that employees of The Cascades facility were ordered not to tell Bedford what was happening. But, so disturbed by what she saw, the staffer took photos. Another took video — capturing bedbugs scurrying across Bedford's mattress, bloodstains, and bedbug carcasses on the floor. They sent the images to Bedford's daughter in Ottawa, early in the New Year.  ""I couldn't believe my eyes,"" said Anne-Marie Burgon, recalling how she played the video several times, trying to absorb what she was seeing. ""I'm so grateful that [the employees] were willing to stand up for their beliefs, for doing the right thing, the moral thing."" ""I could not believe that a facility in Canada … would allow something so hideous to happen."" Infuriating, yes, but ""not shocking,"" said Amani Oakley, a Toronto-area lawyer who has battled nursing home chains for over two decades, and who currently has several lawsuits underway against Cascades owner Sienna Senior Living, formerly Leisureworld.  ""I'm infuriated that we still are allowing these corporations to make money off our seniors … while delivering shoddy care,"" Oakley said. Burgon was first contacted on Dec. 20, 2018 by the Cascades head nurse, who was filling in for the vacationing executive director. She says she was told that a resident living next to her mother had brought bedbugs into the facility and that a single bedbug had been found on Bedford's bed. ""I assumed they knew what they were doing,"" said Burgon. ""I thought it would be not much of a big deal."" But according to a timeline the home later provided to health authorities, employees had, on Dec. 19, found ""10 small bite marks"" on Bedford's back and arms, ""blood spots"" on her bed and ""five possible bed bugs"" on her floor.  Staff were told to ""wash and change"" Bedford, and a pest control company was brought in, though only the apartment next to hers was heat-treated and vacuumed, according to the timeline. In Bedford's apartment, an ant trap was placed between her mattress and box spring.  After two weeks, on Jan. 2, a Cascades employee complained to regulators with the Ministry of Health, reporting she and her colleagues were being instructed to keep Bedford confined to her room. ""Please help,"" the employee wrote in an email. ""It's inhumane.""  She claimed management told staff to lie to Bedford — that she was sick and couldn't visit with friends or share Christmas dinner with other residents. She also alleged management threatened to fire any staff who spoke publicly or to other residents about the outbreak.  ""I just can't do it any longer,"" the employee wrote, calling Bedford a ""blood buffet.""  ""This woman is 94 and blind. Locked in a room, being chewed up while management hides it."" That same day staff moved Bedford and her neighbour to new suites. Management later claimed, in the timeline, that they didn't have other rooms available until then. An employee secretly described what her mother had endured over the holidays, Burgon says. ""I was told of her crying and asking repeatedly, 'Are these bugs crawling on my skin?'"" she said. ""It broke my heart ... I felt betrayed.""  Around then, Cascades executive director Rob White returned from vacation.  Burgon says he told her that Sienna did not know how to handle the bedbug outbreak and says he repeatedly complained to her about the cost of dealing with it. ""I had to listen to his concerns about how expensive this was and how much time it was taking him away from his job,"" Burgon said.  White did not respond to Go Public's request for an interview. Oakley, the lawyer, says she hears so many complaints of neglect and abuse involving Canada's three largest for-profit seniors' homes that last year, she filed a proposed class-action lawsuit involving 200 families. The lawsuit named Extendicare, which runs 96 homes across the country; Sienna, which operates 83; and Revera, which runs 76.  Oakley alleged the companies were ""systematically negligent"" but the Ontario Superior Court of Justice discontinued the lawsuit, says Oakley, because the cases were too dissimilar.  She is instead pursuing dozens of individual lawsuits on behalf of the families. None of the allegations has been proven in court and all three companies deny the allegations have merit.  Oakley says because privately owned chains receive provincial subsidies for some clients, government oversight needs to be rigorous. ""Part of the problem is that [government] inspections tend to be announced,"" said Oakley. ""So they [long-term care chains] know when the inspectors are coming, weeks ahead of time."" Go Public asked several provinces whether their inspections are announced or unexpected.  Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario said some inspections are not announced, while others are and happen every one to two years — more often if a complaint is reported or a problem found. Nova Scotia said all inspections are unannounced and happen at least twice a year. Inspections in B.C. were previously only triggered by complaints. New legislation that takes effect Dec. 1 allows inspections at any time.  But even when problems are discovered — Oakley says many homes are understaffed, and she often hears of one nurse being in charge of 60 people at nighttime —  getting justice can be a challenge. She says the courts don't place much value on the lives of elderly people who are no longer working. ""I've been told by a judge that I'm wasting his time because the case is [financially] modest,"" she said.  Sienna Senior Living is a publicly-traded company worth $1.25 billion in 2018. Complaints to regulators from staff and Burgon led to an investigation and two reports in May and in June, which found Cascades violated regulations including not providing a ""safe and sanitary environment"" and not protecting residents by responding in a timely manner to allegations of ""abuse and neglect."" The site was also found to not have sufficient staffing levels. As of last week, the home was still ""not in full compliance"" with health and safety standards, according to a Ministry of Health spokesperson, who added that officials had a recent meeting with Sienna to discuss outstanding issues and to ensure the company keeps working toward ""full compliance."" Cascades management apologized in a letter to the family for the ""housekeeping inadequacies, miscommunications … and the overall experience."" Sienna Senior Living declined an interview request by Go Public, sending a statement that said the company regrets what happened.  ""Our goal is to provide all tenants with the best possible quality service and overall retirement living experience through the warmth of human connection,"" wrote a spokesperson. ""We recognized that there were actions that should have been better."" ""We have apologized and worked with the tenant and family to resolve their concerns."" The spokesperson would not say why Bedford was left in her room for two weeks, nor comment on a staffer's allegation that management threatened to fire any staffers. Burgon decided it would be too disorienting to move her mother — who turned 95 in February — to another nursing home. She's worried that speaking out about the care her mom received will bring repercussions, but says she wants Sienna held accountable. ""You trust that they're [Sienna] going to uphold their part of — not even the legal contract, but the social and moral contract,"" says Burgon. ""I'm appalled at how callous they were.""

367,"Virginia Smart, Lisa Ellenwood",2019-11-24T09:00:00.590Z,"Pain, agony and 'years of duress': How hockey wives are fighting back over players' chronic brain injuries","Jennifer Belak Liang remembers her car phone ringing as she was picking up her daughters Alex and Andie from school one day in August 2011. It was the agent for her husband, hockey player Wade Belak. On speaker phone, the agent asked her if she had spoken to her husband that day.  She hadn't. It was the second phone call she received asking that question and it filled her with dread.  ""Wade is really hurt,"" the agent said. ""It was awful. I was called by multiple friends … they knew before I knew. But they didn't know what to say,"" Belak Liang said of the day she lost her husband to suicide. Belak's suicide was the third death in a cluster of tragic and sudden deaths of NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard, 28, and Rick Rypien, 27. All had been tasked with fighting on ice and all suffered multiple hits to the head. There have been other deaths of players since, including Steve Montador and Todd Ewen. Now, the wives of some of the retired hockey enforcers are in their own fight, taking on the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman. They want the league to acknowledge there's a link between fights and head injuries on the ice and long-term effects like degenerative brain disease. They also want more support for families struggling with symptoms of traumatic brain injury.  ""My husband had CTE. He was showing signs of CTE. He took his own life,"" said Belak Liang. ""It's going to be many more...  It's [an] injustice to everyone else out there, I think, for them not to admit that this can happen.""  Wade Belak had recently retired from his 14-year career with the National Hockey League and was in Toronto in the summer of 2011 rehearsing for the show Battle of the Blades — the CBC reality show that pairs hockey players with figure skaters. At approximately 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, he ended his life. After the loss of her husband, Jennifer Belak Liang struggled with feelings of isolation and guilt.  ""I was drowning, blaming myself,"" she said in an interview with The Fifth Estate. At the time, she knew little of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease. Her husband had asked that in the event of his death, his brain be tested for the disease. She fulfilled his wish, and he was diagnosed with CTE. Since the loss of her husband, Belak Liang, who has since remarried, tries to offer support to others facing tragic loss of loved ones. As an NHL enforcer who played 14 seasons in the NHL, Belak ""knew his role,"" said Belak Liang. ""He didn't love it, but he was fine with it [because] he wanted to stay within the NHL and have his career.  ""He told me: 'I can't stay here unless I fight.' "" Watch Jennifer Belak Liang remember her husband: While many hockey players can make millions during their career, brain trauma and concussions can take a toll, especially for those who played the role of an enforcer — a role now being phased out. It  was during her husband's last years with the Nashville Predators that Belak Liang noticed a shift in his behaviour.   ""It started about five years before he passed. He just got really introverted, really quiet at home. When the kids were screeching or making noises, I could see him not able to handle it, which was not like him."" About eight months before he died, Belak noticed a decline in her husband's memory. He'd use his phone to help remember daily tasks, including taking pictures of groceries he had to buy.   Many experts say concussions can often lead to a cycle of substance abuse, depression, memory loss, even suicide.  Daniel Carcillo, 35, from King City, Ont., has won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Blackhawks, and was known as Car Bomb for his reckless fighting style on ice. He now battles depression and suicidal thoughts.  Carcillo said his wife, Ela Bulawa, has been burdened. ""But I think that's what marriage and loving somebody is all about, right? Through sickness and in health.""  While he was in his final NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015, Carcillo suffered great personal loss: the passing of his grandfather, as well as his best friend and teammate, Steve Montador, who was found to have CTE. Carcillo, who had seven concussions during his NHL career, wonders if he could become another statistic. ""Wade had CTE. Are these reaffirmations that I'm going to have CTE?... ""There's a pretty good chance."" Once retired, players can often feel abandoned and without support. Carcillo said he has felt that way. But he's taken steps to heal: functional neurology therapy, acupuncture, proper nutrition and diet. He speaks publicly, often on social media, about traumatic brain injury and the impact it can have.   ""I'm very, very proud of Daniel, from where he has been, and where he is now,"" Bulawa said. They have started a foundation called Chapter 5, which aims to provide support to retired players and their families, especially players who are suffering post-concussion syndrome, anxiety and depression. ""They put their whole lives into playing hockey and being the best of the best. And once it's over, then what?"" said Bulawa. ""It shouldn't just be,'Oh, that's it, sorry guys. See ya later.' ""   Carcillo and Bulawa have learned to recognize signs of his depression returning, for example sleeping in, impulse control issues, loss of appetite and withdrawal from friends and family. Todd Ewen played hockey in the era when even after getting rocked on the ice, players were sent back out again. Both he and his wife, Kelli, believed he experienced head trauma because he had symptoms: blurry vision, headaches and sleeplessness. After playing 11 seasons in the NHL, Todd Ewen retired in 1997. He became a real estate agent, was a musician, patented several inventions and coached the St. Louis University Billikens. But Ewen was struggling. He became aggressive with Kelli. Depression, memory loss and confusion plagued him. By 2013, he gave up coaching because he couldn't remember plays and was missing practices.   ""We didn't know who we had. One day we had the sad Todd, the mad Todd, the angry Todd. We had no idea what was going on. This man suffered for years like this, our family suffered for years like this,"" his wife said. They wondered if he could have Alzeimher's or Parkinson's disease, but with the loss of Rypien, Boogaard and Belak in 2011, Ewen began to wonder if he could have CTE.  He told Kelli one day that he didn't want to be a burden. At the time, she did not realize the weight of his words. On Sept. 19, 2015, Kelli Ewen found her husband in the basement of their home near St. Louis. He was 49 when he killed himself. The Ewen family was contacted by the Canadian Concussion Centre in Toronto asking to study Todd's brain.   ""I knew something was wrong. And I thought maybe this is the answer. I read the articles about [CTE]. I could just check off the boxes, just one after another. And I thought this has to be it.""  But neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati at the centre told Kelli her husband did not have CTE. She was devastated and desperate for an explanation and said she asked the doctor to retest his brain, but Hazrati declined.  In 2018, a class action lawsuit between more than 300 retired players and the NHL was settled. Players had accused the league of failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. Ewen's negative CTE results were used as an example in the lawsuit of how media hype could lead a person to kill themselves because of fear of having CTE. Bettman wrote: ""This, sadly, is precisely the type of tragedy that can result when plaintiffs' lawyers and their media consultants jump ahead of the medical community and assert, without reliable scientific support, that there is a causal link between concussions and CTE.""  Kelli Ewen said she was was extremely hurt, and believed they were using her husband for the benefit of the lawsuit.   The NHL announced an $18.9-million US settlement — $22,000 US per player and medical expense coverage up to $75,000 per person. However, there was no acknowledgement of liability for the players' assertions.  Carcillo refused to participate in the settlement.  Kelli Ewen couldn't live with the results from the Canadian Concussion Centre. She arranged to have samples of her husband's brain sent to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist and director of Boston University's CTE Center. Her research, much of which has involved professional athletes, focuses on the long-term effects of all kinds of brain injury, which can include CTE. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy.  While there is no known treatment, the hope is research from Boston University's brain bank will one day allow the detection of the disease in life, ""while there's still a chance to do something about it,"" McKee said. In late 2018, McKee revealed her own conclusions to Kelli Ewen, stating her instincts were correct: her husband did, in fact, have CTE.  ""[Gary Bettman] still stands by the [original] findings, which I find mind-boggling,"" Kelli Ewen said. Kelli Ewen filed a lawsuit against the NHL on April 30, 2019, challenging the league's dismissal of  a link between hits to the head during hockey games and CTE . She wants to bring awareness to concussions and CTE and the suffering families go through when they don't understand the symptoms they're seeing with their husbands.   ""It's not about money, you know? It's about the pain, the agony, the years of duress,"" she said.   ""I feel like it's the NHL's responsibility to stand up and take care of these players that this great game of hockey was built on; these fighters that gave, essentially, their lives for the NHL. And it's time for them to step up and admit and help them get the help they need."" Watch Kelli Ewen talk about her lawsuit: The day after Kelli Ewen's lawsuit was filed, Bettman appeared before a Commons subcommittee in Ottawa regarding sports-related concussions and safety.   Bettman questioned any direct link between multiple hockey concussions and CTE, saying ""in short, I don't believe based on everything I've been told — and if anybody has information to the contrary, we'd be happy to hear it — other than some anecdotal evidence, there has not been that conclusive link."" ""Our players like the way the NHL game is played and understand the implications of playing a physical contact sport at the highest professional level in the world,"" he said.  ""At the end of the day we view ourselves as a family, and our resources are available to the members of our family."" Jennifer Belak Liang, Kelli Ewen and the Carcillo family would disagree.  ""It's crazy to me that they won't admit anything. It's sad,"" Belak Liang said.   ""At least admit it's real,"" said Ewen. ""That would go a long way with a lot of the families."" The Fifth Estate requested an interview with Bettman to address the wives' concerns, but the only response was: ""Thank you for your inquiry. We will not be participating.""   At a sports conference in Toronto last week, The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeown approached Bettman. All he would say was: ""How are you? Nice to see you. I gotta go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hockey-players-enforcers-brain-injuries-1.5370444,[],N/A

It's as traditional as it gets when it comes to Inuit recipes. It's called akutuk; Inuvialuit sometimes call it Eskimo ice cream. It's a cool treat that can be eaten like a spread or frozen. After making it, you'd probably want it that way; it'll make you sweat as you stir, grind and pull. ""It takes a long time,"" said Sandra Pascal to CBC Northwind host, Wanda McLeod. Akutuk is made with a lot of different caribou parts. It's a recipe she shared on CBC North's Facebook recipe group — a perfect fit for a group that focuses on recipes of the North. ""It's whipped rendered caribou fat, with cooked [ground] meat and cooked string meat and caribou bone marrow,' she said from her home in Inuvik, N.W.T. ""Just to pull the meat apart, it's one day. Took me about eight hours."" Then she's right back at it for more. Boiling, pulling it apart and making sure she has enough meat.  Then comes the stirring. First Pascal strains the rendered caribou fat into a bowl and lets it cool down.  ""I'm stirring it for almost two hours and it's starting to change colour ... like pure white."" That's when she knows she's getting close. Eventually the fat gets fluffy and then stiff peaks start to form. ""That's when you add your ... meat,"" said Pascal. She then spreads it evenly on a cookie sheet and cuts it into squares. Pascal said she is so happy to get back into making this traditional recipe. She said her grandmother used to make it whenever she could get her hands on enough caribou. Which wasn't always easy to come by. ""My grandmother used to save every little thing, every bone grease she could get a hold of and bone marrow."" It's a lot of work for anyone, but always worth it in the end, said Pascal.

369,Kenneth Miller,2020-01-18T11:00:00.741Z,A husband pleads for the rights of wife with disabilities,"When I married my wife, Cheryl Miller, I promised to be loyal to her through sickness and in health.  She is my love and soulmate, whom I love dearly.  Unfortunately Cheryl has multiple sclerosis, and has lived with this disease for 45 years.  During this time, I have therefore become an advocate for my precious love — and for all disabled individuals.  Why?  Because they have to spend all their energy trying to live a rewarding life, with many challenges and worries ahead of them.  Many, including Cheryl, meet these challenges with great fortitude and bravery. Therefore it is incumbent on me that I continue to fight for changes that will make their lives better.  What are some of the challenges I see and changes that I would like to see?  Nothing is more frustrating than when I can't find a handicapped parking space — especially when a spot is taken by a vehicle without a handicapped permit.  A painted handicapped parking sign on concrete is useless, because after the first snowfall, it's usually covered up.  What is needed are handicapped signs that are on buildings or above ground.  We also need more of them. A lot more. There are too many places that have a limited number of handicapped parking spots, including close to hospitals!  What's more, these spots are rarely supervised, and offenders are rarely ticketed.  And on the off chance they are ticketed, the fines vary too much. Once we've found a parking spot, things don't get much better.   Many places have no ramps to get to the entrance, and often have two sets of doors to go through at a time, or lack automatic doors.  Access to these buildings is therefore extremely difficult.  Some of the doors also have a lip, where a wheelchair might tip over. (It doesn't take much.) Entrances and sidewalks are often uneven and dangerous.  Many beaches are inaccessible, in my opinion, because of little or no regard for the disabled. At least the beach at Birds Hill Provincial Park has beach access mats, but their handicapped trail cannot be safely travelled in a wheelchair!  Oh well, another battle for me to engage in.  Now let's compare Canada to the United States and their Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991. In it, there are clear federal requirements for accessible parking. What's more, states can also create further requirements and enforcement measures. These requirements also are enforced by local law officials instead of private parking authorities. Cheryl and I have been fortunate to vacation in Maui for several years and we don't think we've seen an individual illegally park in a handicapped zone. We also always find a handicapped parking spot, even when tourism is at its highest. Possible reasons? The signs in Maui state the fines associated with the offence. For example, my wife and I noticed handicapped signs that say ""HANDICAPPED PERMIT REQUIRED MAXIMUM FINE $500."" Furthermore, Cheryl and I witnessed handicapped parking spaces regularly being supervised in Maui.  And unlike here, these parking requirements are enforced by local law officials — the Maui police — instead of private parking authorities. Also, all of their signs are above ground where they are easy to see.  Does the United States ensure better care for the disabled than Canada?  When it comes to accessibility, in my opinion, the answer is a resounding ""YES.""  I have talked to different government agencies and officials about implementing changes to make the lives of disabled individuals easier. It has been a never-ending battle with many obstacles, but one that I will gladly continue.  My God, Canadians with disabilities have enough challenges to contend with every day! On a final note, we have an aging population, which, realistically, could mean an increase of disabled individuals.  What we need are far-sighted and compassionate women and men, who can empathise with the disabled community.  In fact, I invite them to live a day … no, a month … no, a year, with the challenges my wife and I have to contend with.  Until the people in power make the necessary changes to make the lives of individuals with disabilities better, the quest will continue for their human (God-given) rights!  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

370,Chad Pawson,2020-01-26T19:00:00.382Z,Search on for uphill ski route through Whistler Blackcomb to Garibaldi Provincial Park,"It's possible people swooshing downhill at Whistler Blackcomb may soon see dedicated groups of skiers trudging uphill on their way to Garibaldi Provincial Park. Backcountry advocates are working with staff at Whistler Blackcomb to establish a new uphill ski route to the park, which lies in part behind Blackcomb Peak, about 70 kilometres north of Vancouver. Skiers like Bill Maurer with Backcountry B.C. have spent at least two years pushing for a dedicated uphill route.  ""That's probably the most spectacular side of the Spearhead Range,"" Maurer said about the mountains and backcountry area that lies behind the recreational area on Blackcomb. Advocates like Maurer say there is growing interest in having access to backcountry areas in Garibaldi that is free and easier to get to for anyone willing to ski uphill from the base of Blackcomb. According to B.C. Parks, Garibaldi sees around 140,000 visitors each year for day use and camping.  A new corridor is also part of the Whistler Blackcomb development agreement the resort signed with the province in 2017. The 60-year agreement includes land-use contracts between the province and Whistler Blackcomb that detail how the resort will be expanded and operated, including how it must maintain access to Garibaldi Provincial Park, which it borders. Staff at the resort are cautious about how to proceed, citing safety concerns that skiers heading downhill may come into contact with those skiing up slowly, using special skins that help them grip the snow. There is also a concern about how those heading uphill will affect operations such as avalanche control. ""You know for us, we do still think that uphill travel is a risk, can be a risk to public safety,"" said Sarah McCullough, director of government and community relations for Whistler Blackcomb.  Skiers and snowboarders can pay $59 for a backcountry ticket to access more remote areas by riding the resort's lifts. There is also free uphill skiing access to Garibaldi Park, known for its stunning vistas and wild beauty, via the Singing Pass trail from Whistler Village. But according to Maurer, that route takes too long — up to nine hours. ""So it's a really long day to go in from that side. It's not even really that practical,"" said Maurer. He says there are eight to 10 peaks within Garibaldi that would be accessible in a shorter amount of time if a more direct uphill route was in place. On Sunday, Jan. 12, around 20 members of the B.C. Mountaineering Club, accompanied by Whistler Blackcomb patrollers, tried out a potential route from parking lot 7, which hugs the sides of downhill runs Home Run, Shorthorn, Gondola Road, and Sunset Boulevard. Both McCullough and Maurer said the initial expedition was a success, with no problems with downhill skiers, other than the odd one yelling out, ""You're going the wrong way."" Maurer says the loop is doable in about eight hours. The plan is to do other trips this season to test it further. Maurer is hopeful an official route could be in place by November or December of this year. McCullough did not confirm a timeline. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development said in a statement it is supportive of the route and the work being done to establish it.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uphill-ski-access-garibaldi-provincial-park-whistler-blackcomb-1.5431788,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/kees-claire-hut-whistler-garibaldi-1.5292320,N/A
371,Olivia Stefanovich,2020-01-27T02:14:33.884Z,Honouring the Arctic's last known WW II bone collector,"In late May 1940, 20-year-old Qapik Attagutsiak voluntarily picked up a burlap bag, put her one-year-old son in her amauti ⁠— a traditional caribou parka with a built-in baby pouch ⁠— and set off on a grim search.  The new mom went out to the walrus harvesting grounds of her spring hunting camp in Qaipsunik, an island near Igloolik in what is now Nunavut, to fill her sack with animal bones to secretly ship down south. Qapik, who goes by her first name, and other adult members of the camp collected carcasses of walrus, seals and even dogs. The bones were bloody and some still had meat on them crawling with maggots. Regardless, they filled up approximately three bags per day for a full week. They continued that work throughout the war. The byproducts were brought to industrial ports, such a Montreal and Halifax, then processed at rendering plants into cordite for ammunition, aircraft glue and fertilizer to help the Allies fight an ocean away.  ""They did what was important for the elders when they asked them [young people] that you guys have to be collecting bones,"" said Kataissee Attagutsiak, her daughter who translates her story from Inuktitut into English. ""They did it without thought."" Now, nearly 75 years since her efforts helped in the march toward victory and the end of the Second World War, Qapik's lesson in selflessness is being recognized.   The Inuk elder is being honoured on Monday by Parks Canada, in partnership with the Canadian Armed Forces and the Canadian War Museum, during a celebration at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., as a representative of the Inuit wartime contributions.  Qapik is the last known living person from the Arctic to have participated in the bone collection drive of the 1940s, according to Parks Canada.  At age 99, Qapik, who now lives in Arctic Bay, can still vividly recall how she and other Inuit felt when they heard from the local Catholic priest about the Second World War.   ""It was scary for them,"" said Kataissee, who sits beside her mom in a downtown Ottawa hotel room. Even though she was far away from the battles in Europe, Qapik said the Inuit were told by missionaries to get ready for a fight of their own.  ""They warned them that the parachutes, the big airplanes, might be coming in your area,"" Kataisee said.  ""So if the planes are coming in and there's a parachute coming out, jumping out of the airplane, you have to shoot to kill because they might be killing you."" If watching the sky for enemies wasn't enough to worry about, Qapik said many dogs, who the Inuit relied on for transportation, were dying of unknown causes.  Qapik said the Inuit sprang into action when the federal government launched the National Salvage Campaign to help the war effort. Raw materials had become scarce during the First World War. To avoid that happening again, Parliament passed the Department of Munitions and Supply Act in 1939 to centralize and co-ordinate sourcing of resources and industrial production. The Department of National War Services encouraged Canadians to gather rags, rubber, paper, metals, fats and bones, which could be recycled into essential war materials.  It was a tough job, but a necessary one, according to Parks Canada researcher Ray Coutu.  ""It was not very pleasant work picking up carcasses that were rancid, very smelly,"" Coutu said. ""They didn't even think about compensation. Inuit are people who help each other and for them this was normal for them to contribute in their own way."" Coutu is part of a three-person research team that worked with Qapik over the last two years to document her story for the first time.  ""This specific story really struck me personally,"" Coutu said.  ""This happened 79, 80 years ago and people haven't heard about it, so we're quite happy that this elder who hadn't even talked about this to her own children has come forward to allow us to help her tell her story for future generations."" Qapik said one of the greatest pieces of news she's ever heard was when the war ended. ""They were so proud,"" Kataissee said. ""They were so excited when they heard that the war had ended that now they can live until the full end of their lives, so it's not going to be disruptive."" Qapik carried on with her life as a seamstress and midwife, saving several babies and moms.  She is joining a list of more than 140 Canadians who have been recognized by Parks Canada for their endeavours during the First and/or Second World War, as Hometown Heroes.  While Qapik is humbled, she refused to be acknowledged individually. Qapik insisted on representing all of the Nunavut Inuit for their efforts during the Second World War. As she prepares to turn 100 in June, Qapik is reflecting on the lessons the next generation can take from her Second World War experience.  ""The only way you can give peace is to help each other and understand what your responsibilities are,"" Kataisee said. ""To be giving peace starts from you.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stefanovich-honouring-last-known-bone-collector-arctic-1.5434763,[],N/A
372,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:45:54.777Z,"World needs to prepare for millions of climate displaced, UN says","The world needs to prepare for millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday. Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a UN ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments. The UN Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. ""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here."" Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, not least in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Yet the convention relating to the status of refugees, signed in 1951, made no provision for climate change as a reason for people to flee their country and seek asylum elsewhere. As climate impacts grow, legal questions become more complicated. UNHCR, whose budget has risen from $1.3 billion Cdn a year in the early 1990s to $11 billion in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people. Turkey is the largest recipient, with more than 4 million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. That has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe. Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up, and he is now calling for the ""resettlement"" of up to 1 million Syrians in the north of their homeland. Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis, which has affected them since 2015, but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation. ""We must recognize that, for the past several years (Turkey)has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is 'let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-refugees-un-1.5435843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/canada-climate-refugees-1.5165029,N/A

374,Sara Frizzell,2020-01-23T14:36:43.062Z,Nunavut outfitter found guilty of running wildlife tours without a licence,"Arctic Kingdom Inc. has been found guilty of four charges related to running a tour near wildlife without a licence.  The four counts relate to four consecutive days in March 2017, when the Nunavut outfitter ran private tours out of a camp it had set up around 30 kilometres outside of Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut. Arctic Kingdom advertised offering photo tours of polar bears and icebergs.  Section 117(2) of Nunavut's Wildlife Act prohibits running a commercial activity involving wildlife without a licence from the government of Nunavut.  Justice Paul Rouleau delivered his decision by telephone in the Nunavut Court of Justice on Monday — he then distributed his 18-page written decision with his reasons to the parties involved.  The Crown, William Lu, called two witnesses during the trial in Qikiqtarjuaq, both of whom were with Nunavut's Department of Environment.  Joseph Guay was a conservation officer based in the community, who was informed of the camp by local hunters and conducted an investigation.  He testified he found the outfitter had no licence and that the local hunters and trappers organization (HTO) did not approve of the camp's location, which they said interfered with polar bear family groups emerging from a nearby fjord.   Arctic Kingdom had written to the Nattivak HTO that February requesting permission for the camp and enclosed a brochure for a ""Spring Polar Bears & Icebergs of Baffin (Photo Safari)."" In March, the HTO wrote back rejecting the planned activities.  ""Inuit are considered co-managers of wildlife. As such, they are involved and have a say in issues concerning wildlife in their area,"" Rouleau's decision reads.  The Wildlife Act's regulations require the submission of an activity outline — especially in cases where the HTO has reservations — after which the HTO has 40 days to provide comments.  After prompting from the environment department, Arctic Kingdom did file a request for a licence —  three days before the offences. This was not enough time to fulfil the 40-day requirement.  While investigating, Guay visited the camp, which was around 10 tents, including a kitchen tent surrounded by bear fencing. He witnessed Arctic Kingdom's clients taking part in a Parks Canada orientation session and then leaving from the Qikiqtarjuaq airport. Arctic Kingdom has been running private tours in Nunavut for two decades. It was represented by Iqaluit-based lawyer Anne Crawford.  She argued that Lu, when questioning Officer Guay, did not always confirm the information gathered from Arctic Kingdom employees about the activities was given voluntarily by the employees — he only did so some of the time.  Rouleau found the information could be used in court despite the lack of confirmation in every instance, and that voluntarily-given information was enough to convict the outfitter.  Crawford also argued that paper evidence and testimony referred to Arctic Kingdom, Arctic Kingdom Polar Expeditions and Arctic Kingdom Polar Expeditions Inc., so the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Arctic Kingdom Inc. committed the offences.  Justice Rouleau concluded Arctic Kingdom Inc. was responsible because the employees involved responded to correspondence for Arctic Kingdom Inc.  Crawford said Arctic Kingdom had also contracted services from another outfitter, but the judge decided there was no doubt which business was in charge of the operation and therefore responsible.  And finally, Rouleau noted Arctic Kingdom was familiar with the licensing process because it had a licence in 2016 for the months of July to December — and dismissed Crawford's argument the 2016 licence was still valid.  Rouleau found that other instances in which the government waived the requirement for licences before the Act's regulations were in place, or allowed licences to apply retroactively, were not relevant to the offences before him in this case.  Before the trial, Arctic Kingdom had mounted a constitutional challenge to the Wildlife Act. That challenge failed when Rouleau found the act did not infringe on the rights of Inuit to interact with wildlife in non-commercial settings.  This case is scheduled for sentencing on Thursday morning. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-kingdom-wildlife-act-guilty-1.5436272,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-kingdom-wildlife-act-challenge-1.5185760,N/A

But the mystery of what led to the crash of CP Rail Train 301 has lingered, leaving victims' loved ones desperate for answers, and angry and suspicious. ""I hold CPR responsible. They killed those guys,"" says Pam Fraser, mother of Dylan Paradis, the 33-year-old conductor killed in the crash.  ""Their practices, their safety standards, their bottom line, to keep the trains rolling no matter what, killed my son and his crew mates. I want to hold them responsible."" The Fifth Estate conducted a seven-month investigation, talking with witnesses, railroad workers, families and sources within police and government and uncovered a string of failures in the Train 301 tragedy, to be explored in a documentary Runaway Train airing on CBC-TV Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. The program discovered a string of failures that, according to experts, warrants an investigation into potential criminal negligence by CP Rail. Niki Atherton, who lived with engineer Andy Dockrell, says, ""Is there a way to reopen that up again? ""There should be an ongoing investigation through the police if it's criminal negligence. It should be investigated properly."" Watch | 'I hold CPR responsible,' says Pam Fraser, mother of conductor: While the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has power to issue findings and recommendations, it doesn't lay charges or investigate potential criminal wrongdoing. The only formal police investigation was done by CP Rail's own police service, but was allegedly shut down just one month after the crash, according to one of the officers assigned to the case. These events have families of the crew who died calling for an outside police investigation.  CP Rail Police says they conducted a thorough investigation and concluded no charges were warranted. But they also say the scope of their inquiry was to determine actions of the crew members prior to the crash ""regarding any outside factors that may have led or contributed to the incident itself."" CP says it won't comment on causes of the crash until the TSB delivers its findings, not expected for another year. The Fifth Estate talked to dozens of witnesses and other sources inside CP Rail, the TSB, government and police to piece together what happened. On Feb. 3, 2019, blowing snow and a –28 C temperature — colder with the wind chill — hit CP Rail's main mountain line descending through the Spiral Tunnels in Yoho National Park to the hamlet of Field, B.C. It was approaching 10 p.m. as Train 301, composed of 112 loaded grain cars and three locomotives, reached the top of the mountain.   The train began the steep, 20-kilometre decline down Field Hill, named for the railway village where a stop was planned and a new crew would come aboard. But in the extreme cold, the engineer was having trouble controlling the train's speed with the air brakes, according to the TSB.  Fearing a runaway, he applied the last emergency reserves of air pressure to bring the train to a screeching halt on the mountain. The engineer and conductor contacted a CP manager for instructions. It isn't known what was said in that conversation. In the end, no hand brakes were applied. Instead, the crew set ""retainers,"" a temporary measure to hold the air brakes. CP's special policy for Field Hill calls for hand brakes on 75 per cent of rail cars stopped in an emergency ""if abnormal conditions such as weather or poor braking train dictate.""  Hand brakes would have held the train. But applying them takes time, requiring a crew member to walk the length of the train to crank down the brakes on each car. The manager summoned a replacement crew to take over because the emergency stop was about to push workers on 301 past their maximum allowable hours. But the changeover took a long time, according to sources who were there that night. CP's bunkhouse in Field was 20 minutes away by car.  The harsh weather had brought down power and telephone lines as well as cell service, plunging CP's bunkhouse in Field into cold and darkness for 12 hours before the crash. Crews were stranded, unable to get proper meals and rest as they huddled around a kitchen gas stove for warmth. When a van arrived to drive the replacement crew up the mountain, the men were taken by surprise. They asked for their two-hour notice to allow more time to get ready. By the time the new crew arrived at the train and took over, 301 had been sitting for almost three hours. After a job briefing with the manager, the relief crew began work on the train. Andy Dockrell, the engineer, took the controls while conductor Dylan Paradis and trainee Daniel Waldenberger-Bulmer stepped off, about to apply the hand brakes. But 301 suddenly started to roll on its own, gradually picking up speed. The crew clambered aboard. ""Emergency! Emergency! Emergency!"" the veteran engineer called over the radio. Van driver Rob Marshall was still sitting next to the tracks when the train started to roll. ""All of a sudden you hear on the radio 'The train's out of control.' And then, from where I was sitting — I watched the train fly by,"" Marshall said. ""I'm thinking, 'Good God Almighty!' This train could derail and kill these people that I just drove up here.""  In Field, workers told CBC, crews evacuated the bunkhouse, fearing the runaway might roll into town and strike a second train of loaded tanker cars blocking the line. Rail traffic control radioed crews to move it. Watch | Rob Marshall describes the train starting to roll: ""If it had hit a fuel car or something, it could have blown up and caused a major disaster,"" said Marshall, likening it to the Lac-Mégantic disaster in 2013 that killed 47 people. ""it would have blown up the whole valley, and it would have been like another Quebec scenario. Pretty insane."" But Train 301 never made it that far. Dockrell's last words heard on the radio declared the train had hit 57 m.p.h. (92 km/h) on a stretch where the limit is 15 m.p.h. (24 km/h). And then silence. A tearful rail traffic control dispatcher repeatedly called out: ""RTC to Train 301 … do you copy?"" There was no response. CP track workers nearby raced to the scene.   They discovered 301's lead locomotive had flown off the track at a steep turn mid-mountain, landing overturned in the Kicking Horse River, with 99 grain cars crumpled in a pileup behind. Dockrell was thrown from the locomotive and killed instantly. Waldenberger-Bulmer was found in the river. ""He was still breathing,"" said Marshall, recounting how a track worker raced into the frigid water in a failed attempt to save him. ""She was super courageous for staying there and being by this guy's side."" The conductor, Paradis, was found crushed to death in the locomotive cab. Emergency officials, including employees of Transport Canada, the Transportation Safety Board and the local RCMP, provided assistance. But because the crash happened on railway property, the CP Police Service took control of the scene and launched a criminal investigation. While employed by the corporation, CP police officers have the same powers as every other police officer in Canada. Mark Tataryn, one of three CPPS officers assigned to investigate, says supervisors directed him to keep the investigation narrowly focused on the crew, and shut it down one month after the crash when he began to question CP management's role. Tataryn says several questions remain unanswered, including whether there was ""negligence on the part of the company."" CP police tell CBC that Tataryn was a ""disgruntled employee,"" and that he was facing an internal conduct investigation when he resigned. CP police say they concluded Tataryn ""knowingly, negligently or recklessly made false, misleading or inaccurate statements in a CPPS report."" Tataryn disputes that and says he quit to accept a job with the RCMP. CP Rail's CEO Keith Creel says CPPS is not the only police service with jurisdiction in the case. ""We've worked in lockstep with the RCMP from the very beginning,"" Creel said. However, the RCMP says they are not investigating. ""The incident occurred on CP property; as such, that agency has jurisdiction,"" an RCMP spokesperson wrote in an email. ""No independent investigation was commenced by the RCMP."" The RCMP added that they ""of course would be willing"" to step in if asked. CBC's investigation has found Field Hill has been the scene of 25 derailments and runaways in the last 25 years, including an incident on Jan. 14 where a rail car rolled away for more than six kilometres before derailing. The day before the crash of Train 301, Dockrell had a nearly identical problem on a different grain train coming down the same hill.  Dockrell filled out a ""safety hazard report"" documenting the brake problem, CBC has learned. The next day, investigators found the crumpled paper in the wreckage. CP workers filed more than a dozen similar reports to CP's joint union-management health and safety committee in recent years. They document a range of concerns — from problems in the cold, to poorly maintained grain trains with failing brakes, to issues specific to Field Hill. A current CP Rail conductor wonders why the trains were even running, given the weather. ""They could just say, 'No, we're shutting the grain trains down until the weather warms up,' one CP railroader said.  ""Did they do it? No. What happened? We killed three people. Wow.""  CBC agreed to keep his identity confidential as he fears being fired if caught talking to the media. He says the extreme cold in the mountains is a known risk for CP operations. ""Cold weather. Older cars. Rubber shrinking. It all is a recipe for disaster.""  CP's manuals detail how in winter ""cold weather increases air leakage in a train's air brake system,"" calling it a ""major challenge."" Days after the crash, the TSB discovered problems with the air brakes on Train 301's rail cars. Of the 112 grain hoppers, 13 cars remained undamaged and upright on the tracks. TSB tested them on a similar steep grade, in temperatures between -18 C and -24 C.  Brakes on all 13 cars were found to be incapable of holding the train on the hill, and the TSB issued a warning to Transport Canada to take action. CP and Transport Canada have both known for some time that current inspections required by government are failing to catch deficiencies. ""Many cars with zero or very low brake effectiveness"" are not being detected, said a 2018 study by the National Research Council. Immediately after the crash, CN and CP Rail conducted a more concentrated inspection blitz of the aging fleet of government-owned  grain cars like those involved in the crash and discovered widespread problems, pulling thousands out of service for repairs, retiring more than 500 of them permanently. When approached by CBC at a railroad conference in San Diego Jan. 6, Creel declined to comment on specifics of the crash until the TSB investigation is complete.   ""If we've made mistakes then we'll own our mistakes and we'll commit to learning and growing from those mistakes,"" Creel said. ""Anything that needs to be changed to make sure that in the future we don't have any other families that had to experience that same tragedy, I'm [committed] to doing that."" Watch | CEO Keith Creel says CP Rail is willing to work with the RCMP: Immediately following the derailment, CP Rail adopted more stringent instructions for crews to apply a number of hand brakes to all trains parked in ""emergency"" on steep hills. Transport Canada wasn't satisfied and issued an order demanding an even higher number of hand brakes.    CP is appealing that order, but won't discuss why. CBC presented its findings to legal and safety experts. ""There's a compelling case on the facts of criminal negligence, corporate criminal negligence,"" said veteran lawyer Leo McGrady. ""Terminating the investigation a month into the investigation when all of this material wasn't covered — that generates huge suspicions in itself as an additional act of obstruction, so in my view it's a very serious act of obstructing justice."" Rob Stewart, a workplace facilities specialist who is consulting with the TSB, said a criminal investigation is needed. He said it's unclear which police service could step in, since the accident happened on CP land in a national park. ""We have all this confusion going on. The question then becomes … who is supposed to be doing this? Which police service? CP, local RCMP, federal RCMP? Going back to the attorney general?"" Pam Fraser, mother of conductor Dylan Paradis, is calling on authorities to reopen a criminal investigation. ""I don't trust CP to police itself,"" she said. ""What of all these major corporations in the world, that police themselves, ever do an honest and truly investigative job? I simply don't have any faith.""    ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cp-rail-b-c-crash-1.5439690,[],N/A

379,Yvette Brend,2020-01-25T17:00:00.809Z,"Cold snap fatal to spruce beetles will 'knock back' infestation, say experts","Bark beetle experts say a recent cold snap has likely killed some spruce beetle infestations in northern B.C. — especially if the frigid temperatures hit fast, before the bugs could ramp up their protective ""antifreeze.""  That could make a dent in the worst outbreak of the spruce beetle this province has seen. Provincial entomologist Jeanne Robert said temperatures must fall below –40 C for more than two days — as it did in parts of the province this January — to kill the hardy bark beetles. ""It won't cut the outbreak off at the knees. But I think this should knock them back,"" said Robert, a regional forest entomologist for the Omineca and Northeast regions of B.C.'s Ministry of Forests. The wood-boring spruce beetles are only the length of a rice grain. But en masse they are powerful, infesting spruce from Yukon to Utah. How many die will depend on how much snow was present and how sudden the change in temperature was, said Allan Carroll, the director of the University of British Columbia's forest sciences program. Well-adapted spruce beetle larvae create a sort of antifreeze to survive cold, but Carroll said sudden, severe temperature dips can cause mass die-offs. Provincial surveys are underway now to gauge the recent cold snap's kill rate under tree bark. The beetles must be warmed up for several days to see if they reanimate, said Carroll. ""It's hard to tell a live one from a dead one. You need to warm them up to see if they come back to life and if they don't then they are most likely dead,"" he said. Experts say about 95 per cent of the overwintering beetle larvae must die off to stop an outbreak. ""We won't really know until we survey in the summer how much [the cold] knocked them back,"" said Robert. Environment Canada confirmed that Arctic air moved into Northern B.C. between Jan 5 and 19. In some spots it was close to –50 C. ""It was surprising that it wasn't record breaking,"" said Environment Canada meteorologist Matt MacDonald. For at least two days this month — Jan. 14 and 15 — temperatures remained below –40 C in the northeastern part of the province most infested with spruce beetles. ""Good to see a potential benefit from that cold snap,"" said MacDonald. Spruce beetles are nowhere near the threat of the infamous mountain pine beetle that hit peak infestation — the largest seen in the world — about 16 years ago, according to Robert. Pine beetles killed off more than nine million hectares of forests by the peak of the infestation in 2004. In comparison, Robert said, the spruce beetle's unprecedented outbreak since 2014 has hit about 500,000 hectares. But the spruce beetle is tougher to kill, according to experts. Robert said it's easier for mountain pine beetles to hit the 95 per cent death rate for larvae because they remain under the bark over winter. But spruce beetles are trickier because some of the bugs move down to the base of the tree or to the ""duff"" material, the decaying forest floor, where they remain better protected, often under snow, and able to survive colder snaps. Robert said one more cool summer and another cold winter would be enough to kill off the infestation for good, even though beetles can adjust their life cycle to survive. ""But –40 is a lethal temperature. Yeah, when it gets to –40 I cross my fingers and my toes that that will knock the population back,"" said Robert, who doesn't often wish bugs death. ""But there is a lot of spruce beetles,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bark-beetles-hit-by-cold-minus-40-fatal-spruce-mountain-pine-1.5438305,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/mountain-pine-beetle-cold-snap-1.5436844 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/spruce-beetle-spread-1.4478589 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-spruce-beetle-1.3487547,N/A
380,Anonymous,2020-01-21T00:40:52.742Z,Animator from Calgary opens up about her role on Frozen 2,"For those with children or for the Disney enthusiasts, you may know that the company's popular animated film Frozen came out with a sequel in November.  But what you may not know is that some of the scenes in the movie were created by a Calgarian. Jackie Koehler joined the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday to share how she got involved with the film and what her role was. For her, she said, the journey technically started when she was about 13 years old, when she developed an interest in animation. ""I just kind of pursued it ever since.… Every year, you kind of get a little bit better, a little bit more knowledgeable"" Koehler said. ""Next thing you know, you're working at Disney."" She's since worked on big films including Ralph Breaks the Internet and The Book of Life. When it comes to Frozen 2, her job was to work on the very nitty-gritty details of how the characters move. Each movement is crafted ""from scratch,"" she explained. The animators review the script as voiced by the actors. They also take into consideration what the directors say they want out of each scene. ""Then we kind of take it from there,"" she said. That involves deciding how a character might cross a room, for example, or how they might pick up a glass, or the sorts of facial expressions they might have during various segments of dialogue. She was one of about 80 animators working on the film. When Elsa’s powers are overtaken by another force, Jackie Koehler, who animated the scene, collaborated with our Effects Designer, Dan Lund, to choreograph Elsa’s surprise. To support the story point, we changed the speed, color and direction of her magic as it is taken over. <a href=""https://t.co/RJwn7Jb0aJ"">pic.twitter.com/RJwn7Jb0aJ</a> Koehler said she could spend about two weeks for each four seconds or so of animation. ""Each shot is very personal,"" she said, adding the shot she worked on for the lullaby sequence at the beginning of the film took months. ""It's very labour intensive."" ""(The shots) kind of become your babies … but then you watch it in the movie and it goes by in a blink of an eye."" While the process is similar to older methods of working on an animated film, going frame by frame, as technology advances, it's a little bit easier. ""The computer allows us to do more iterations so we're able to sort of explore a little bit more what different acting choices might look like on screen,"" she said. There's also a dedicated room for animators to act out a scene and film themselves so they can transpose those movements to the character. ""We'll use that as a basis to ground our characters to make sure that they look and feel like they're living in a real world,"" she said. There's also are multiple other departments in other very specialized roles, like lighting, who will work on the same scenes, she said. ""It looks and feels like magic but it's really a lot of hard work and dedication to our craft,"" Koehler said.  Next up for the animator is Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon.

382,Sophia Harris,2020-01-26T15:02:04.315Z,"'I was livid': Single mom hit with $32,000 bill to break furnace, air conditioner rental contract","When Tracy Spence tried to get out of her rental contract for a furnace and air conditioner, she was outraged by the price tag.  After paying more than $7,000 total in monthly rental fees since 2016, she was told she'd have to pay another $32,406 to buy out her contract, giving her ownership of the appliances.  ""I was livid,"" said Spence, who lives in Toronto. ""In what universe does a furnace [and] an air conditioner cost that much money?"" According to her contract, Spence's furnace and air conditioner had a combined ""cash selling price"" of $10,798. That's a far cry from the approximately $40,000 she'd be out for renting the appliances and then buying out the rest of her 10-year contract  — which includes service and warranty protection.  ""I feel so completely stupid for getting myself involved in this,"" said Spence, who was sold on the rental deal by a door-to-door salesperson. She's one of many Canadians who've complained to CBC News over the years that they feel duped after signing up to rent a home energy appliance — such as a furnace or water heater Due to a flood of consumer complaints, Ontario banned unsolicited door-to-door home energy appliance sales in 2018. All other provinces, with the exception of Alberta, still allow the practice. Toronto-based paralegal John Robinson said he currently represents more than 50 clients involved in disputes over their home energy appliance rental contracts.  He said the main complaints from clients are that the deal is more expensive than they had anticipated, and that it's too costly to buy out their contract. ""They're feeling very stuck and they're feeling taken advantage of. And they're down, because they think there's no way out."" Fortunately for Spence, her case was quickly resolved after she shared her story with CBC News.  CBC contacted Toronto-based Crown Crest Capital, which took over in July 2017 as Spence's service provider and the lender financing her contract. The company said it had no involvement prior to that date.  Crown Crest's external legal counsel said that an error had been made in quoting Spence a $32,406 buyout price. ""It was just something everyone missed,"" said lawyer Alfred Apps. ""We're going to step in and resolve this positively in favour of the customer."" The matter was resolved to Spence's satisfaction, but CBC isn't privy to the final buyout price. According to Spence's lawyer Tyler Declute, Crown Crest had her sign a confidentiality agreement which prevents Spence from speaking any further about the issue. Before signing her confidentiality agreement, Spence said she felt pressured to sign up for her rental deal when a ""fast-talking"" salesperson showed up at her home on a hot day in June 2016. Shortly before, her air conditioner had died and her live-in brother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. ""It was really a stressful time,"" said Spence, a 59-year-old single mother of two adult sons who also live with her. ""I was really vulnerable."" She said the cost savings the salesperson had promised she would enjoy by switching from her oil furnace to a new gas one never actually materialized, because they were offset by high rental fees. ""The spiel that they gave me wasn't exactly how it played out."" The company that brokered Spence's deal — Consumers Choice Comfort Services — appears to no longer exist. Even so, it currently faces 18 charges under the Ontario Consumers Protection Act, including charges of false or misleading business practices, according to the Ontario government.  Spence decided to quit her contract in December 2019 when she faced complications trying to refinance her mortgage, because a lien for the air conditioner and furnace had been placed on her home. Often, the lender financing a rental contract does this to ensure it recoups its money if the customer sells the property.  ""I just wanted to be out of it,"" said Spence.  Crown Crest sent her documents stating that she owed $32,406 total to buy out her contract. In emails to the company, Spence's lawyer Declute informed Crown Crest that because his client signed a contract with a 10-year term, he calculated that the buyout price should be about $15,000.  The company's manager of collections wouldn't budge on the price, according to the emails. Declute said he got the same response when he called the manager. ""She goes, 'You're under a time crunch. You need this paid out. Here's the payout. If you don't pay us this amount, we're not going to get rid of it.'"" CBC News contacted Crown Crest, inquiring how it justified Spence's $32,406 buyout bill.  Apps responded that the manager was mistaken in how she calculated the bill.  ""She has it dead wrong,"" he said. ""We'll be resolving it today."" CBC News pointed out that other Crown Crest employees were copied on the email correspondence between Declute and the manager, but that no one from the company caught the error.  ""We've launched an internal inquiry to figure that out,"" said Apps. He said that he suspects there are some shady companies in the home energy rental appliance business, but that Crown Crest Capital isn't one of them.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/home-energy-appliance-rental-crown-crest-furnace-1.5439572,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/home-trust-hvac-rental-contracts-1.5067957 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/furnace-sales-prairie-door-1.5100087 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/water-heater-green-planet-1.4535170 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/thunder-bay-furnace-lawsuit-1.4279530 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/oeg-hvac-lien-1.3879196 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/enercare-story-marketplace-1.4598718 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/utilebill-lawsuit-air-conditioner-1.5102956,N/A
383,Anonymous,2020-01-26T14:46:59.297Z,Bringing biology to bricks — concrete details on how to grow building materials,"A team of American researchers has developed a new kind of biological concrete that could redefine what we mean by ""green buildings.""   The concrete, developed by researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, uses bacteria as a binder. This leads to a material that can grow and even heal itself — much like a living organism. ""When we finally hit on a solution that brought the brick to life it really was an 'aha' moment,"" said Wil Srubar in an interview with Bob McDonald on Quirks & Quarks. Srubar is an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and led the work. Concrete is the most widely used man-made material on Earth, but its production has a massive carbon footprint. Cement making is extremely energy intensive and releases large amounts of carbon dioxide. The United Nations Environment Agency has called out for ""dramatic action"" to reduce this footprint in order to limit global warming. ""In our system, we're using no cement and we're actually using an organism that thrives on carbon dioxide to manufacture the materials,"" said Srubar. In traditional concrete, sand and aggregate are bonded together with cement. In this biological concrete, photosynthetic cyanobacteria take the place of cement. The bacteria use carbon dioxide from air to produce a material similar to limestone that glues together sand particles, making robust building blocks. ""The photosynthetic cyanobacteria that we use takes CO2, and some nutrients, and they biomineralize,"" said Srubar. ""It's similar to a process of making seashells in the oceans."" ""And so it, in effect, creates tiny limestone particles as the glue in our brick."" Srubar's process was a little more complicated than simply mixing up a batch of sand and a bacterial culture. The team had to find the right growing conditions for the bacteria, which included appropriate levels of moisture and important nutrients, but still the process was slow. The ultimate key turned out to be adding a jello-like polymer that increased the rate at which the bacteria grew and produced the limestone glue. Another benefit of using bacteria for concrete is that it can be self-healing, and can replicate itself. Srubar's team found that when they split a brick in two, they could cause the broken brick to grow in a mould by adding more sand and nutrients — the cyanobacteria would proliferate by themselves. They were able to continue to ""grow"" new bricks from broken fragments of their biological bricks.  ""So really, what we were demonstrating is a new way to manufacture building materials,"" said Srubar. ""Why not leverage something that grows at an exponential rate that self multiplies and use that to manufacture the materials we choose to build?' Since traditional cement production is responsible for about six per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, the researchers hope that, by not only substituting this biological cement might some day make a significant dent in how much building materials contribute to global warming. Srubar also sees a potential future use of his technology being used to build infrastructure on other planets. ""If we had to build a brand new world, we wouldn't be burning the limestone to make the cement and we wouldn't be melting the sand to make the glass. I think we would turn to biology to help us grow the materials with which we choose to build.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/intermittent-fasting-the-math-of-espresso-biological-bricks-and-more-1.5438088/bringing-biology-to-bricks-concrete-details-on-how-to-grow-building-materials-1.5438097,[],N/A

""There was no negotiation in terms of the facts. There was no negotiation in terms of the pleas.... There was no negotiation in terms of the sentence."" The attack happened in June 2018 on Chebucto Road. The victim was sleeping when Obed appeared in her bedroom.

""A lot of the Indian Act's policy was put into place on the basis of Indigenous people living 'short brutish lives.' It was created with the idea that Indigenous people needed help to make things better for them. When we look at the genesis of the Indian Act, a federal government agent would go around to Indigenous communities around the country, documenting people with the goal to make them 'status Indians.' ""It was about finding ways to legally racially define us and then finding ways to illegally racially define us. Intermarriage played a huge role in the status of Indian men before 1985. If I married somebody who wasn't Indigenous at all, as long as I married before 1985, she could become a status Indian. ""But for women, they lost status. If an Indian woman married a non-Indian man prior to 1985, she lost her status, and so did her children. That meant you couldn't live on the reserve because reserves are set aside for the use and benefit of status Indians. It was very discriminatory against Indian women.""  ""In British Columbia, we don't have treaties. The province has wrestled with what we call 'land claims' or 'the land question.' It's been an important conversation to have. ""When I first started working on this issue, it was a very budding field. We had some tough road to plow — who wants to learn about Aboriginal awareness? That was actually a kind of a hurdle in itself. ""We thought we have to really make it engaging and tackle all of the things that need to be tackled. But I realized that it's okay to actually talk it through and ask about anything.""  ""Every once in a while I just pinch myself —  I get to talk about dismantling the Indian Act. And the book is a bestseller. Who would have thought? But the Indian Act is still here. We have to figure out how to dismantle it and and reach the political objectives of Indigenous peoples across the country.  ""We're looking at three concepts here: self-determination, self-government and self-reliance. The legislation needs to go for these reasons and we're very close. We've abandoned forced cultural assimilation.

The city's water consumption was at its peak in 2008, when it hit 7.1 million cubic metres. In 2019, the rate was down to just under 6.2 million cubic meters — dipping below the consumption rate in 1999. ""With the growth that the city has seen over the last 20 years, that's a remarkable accomplishment,"" said Coun. Jason Coady, chair of the city's water and sewer committee. ""It's a great example of what happens when everybody kind of works together."" In 2015, the city began rolling out a mandatory water-meter program, with the initial target of having meters installed in all homes by the end of 2019.  While the city did not quite meet that goal, Coady said there remain only a ""very small number of non-metered residents,"" and he hopes to see all customers hooked up soon.  He said the metering program has been a success in reducing household and business consumption. ""When you get your bill you can see how much you used and what you're paying."" He also credits customers and businesses ""understanding that it's not an unlimited resource. The due diligence that they have on their part to reduce their water use has gone a long way.""  He believes the city's education campaigns, as well as programs such as rebates for installing low-flow toilets and shower heads have helped to create a conversation around water use in the city, and a focus on water conservation.

Information on the status of schools and bus routes is available on the district's website. Stack said while the storm was ""unprecedented,"" the district has dealt with multiple day closures before and stopped short of suggesting that the school year will need to be extended. ""We know that there's ways to adapt how we deliver the curriculum,"" he said. ""I'm very confident that we'll be able to manage this situation."" The Conseil scolaire francophone said in a statement Sunday that École Rocher-du-Nord will reopen Monday, while École des Grand-Vents will be closed. The CSFP said it is communicating directly with families of students who will be affected by adjustments to bus routes on Monday. Memorial University, Marine Institute and the College of the North Atlantic campuses in St. John's are also expected to reopen Monday. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen says city crews are hard at work clearing roads and sidewalks in advance of what will be the first day back to school and work for many in the city. ""We've done a lot of work on the sidewalks around school zones, we've got a lot of those cleared out and we're continuing to work on those,"" he said. ""There's places in the city where you can get off the road to walk, so it's improving."" Breen said close to 5,000 dump truck loads of snow have already been removed from the streets, and the city's snow clearing equipment remains on the road around the clock to continue the work. He said dealing with all the snow has been a huge challenge, but it's important to remove as much as possible, because there's lots of winter weather left to come. ""Right now, we're concentrating on getting the city back to normal operations, and you know, we're only three weeks into winter,"" said Breen. ""We're going to have more snow, so we've got to get ready to be prepared for that.""

""It has been observed last year in Gaspé, and two years ago there [was] one observed in Maine, which was twice as big as this one, almost 100 metres in diameter."" ""These ice discs have mesmerized people for years and there have been a lot of claims, especially about alien stuff,"" he said. They've also been compared to crop circles.  ""But scientists have been studying the phenomena for years and you know what? They came up with a very simple explanation."" The simple explanation involves ""a magnificent chemical called H2O: water,"" Voyer said. Water is one of the few chemicals with a lower density in its crystallized form, he said. Meanwhile warm water is less dense than cold water, so it rises to the surface. Watch the ice disc slowly revolve in the South Thompson River: Nature's recipe for a rotating ice disc is ""a little open water, a little water current and an ice patch,"" Voyer said. When the temperature warms a bit, water molecules begin to warm up and migrate to the top. If the water surface is covered with an ice patch, those warm water molecules begin to move laterally with the current, creating a vortex like water down a bathtub drain. ""So the warm water vortex will push up the ice cover,"" Voyer said. ""Eventually the ice cover will crack along the edge of the vortex. And the reason for that is because the forces are stronger along the edge and the water is warmer."" The result is a very rough ice disc, which then grinds itself into a perfect circle as it rotates, he said. Ice discs rarely form, because conditions must be perfect: warming temperatures, not too much current and not too much wind.  The phenomenon is often fleeting, lasting a couple of days or a couple of weeks before wind or strong current causes the fragile disc to break apart. ""Also, there is the possibility that during the night there's aliens that will come and throw rocks at it or something like that,"" Voyer joked.  With files from Daybreak Kamloops",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ice-disc-thompson-river-rare-phenomenon-temporary-maine-aliens-1.5436887,[],N/A
393,Erica Johnson,2019-04-02T17:51:22.864Z,"Bell customer's 5-month fight is 1 of almost 10,000 recent complaints to telco mediator","Matthew Tomlinson spent five months trying to get Bell to give him a TV package at the price he was promised. The 47-year-old Ottawa computer analyst says a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package last June, which cost him an extra $50 per month. ""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. Frustrated, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the telecom mediator, the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS). His complaint is included in a mid-year report released today by the CCTS, indicating that the number of Canadians unhappy with their telco service providers continues to climb. The CCTS says it accepted 9,831 complaints between August 2018 and January 2019 — a 44 per cent increase over the same period the previous year. The biggest issues for consumers: billing disputes, misleading contract terms or non-disclosure of information and poor quality of service. ""It's unfortunate that we see the same issues on a regular, recurring basis,"" CCTS commissioner Howard Maker told Go Public. He says by the time consumers have filed a complaint with his organization, they are often at their wits' end. ""It's difficult to see them all have to spend time and resources on things that maybe didn't need to have occurred, if better processes had been in place in the front end."" Ninety-two per cent of complaints to the mediator were resolved, although the CCTS could not address 6,413 other complaints beyond its mandate, including customer service, pricing and operating practices and policies. The country's largest service provider continued to receive a disproportionately high number of consumer complaints - Bell Canada was the subject of 3,034 complaints. Rogers received 915 complaints. For the first time, Cogeco placed third on the list, with 790 complaints, after an upgrade to its computer system led to customers losing service and being unable to contact technical support. Telus received 746 complaints, making it the fourth most-complained-about telecom provider. Freedom Mobile, owned by Shaw, expanded its service areas last year and placed fifth on the list, with 637 complaints. Customers filed the most complaints about cellphone issues (37.1 per cent), followed by problems with internet (27.8 per cent) and TV services (18.2 per cent). Canadians were only recently able to file complaints about TV services. That process was introduced into the CCTS mandate in September 2017. Tomlinson's complaint last fall said he paid an extra $50 per month after a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package.""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. ""Every time they told me that something was being fixed, it was never fixed. Every deadline or date they gave me … none of those deadlines were met."" Tomlinson estimates he went back to a Bell retail store more than 10 times, to try to sort out his billing issues. On top of that, he says, he spent countless hours on the phone to Bell. ""I'd go to sales and sales told me, 'No, this is a billing problem, you have to talk to billing.' So there was this really circular logic they were employing to simply keep me from being able to fix my bill."" Finally, Tomlinson complained to Bell's escalation department — but he still didn't hear back, so he filed a complaint with the CCTS. ""This is the most deplorable customer service I've ever experienced,"" he says. ""And I just didn't want it to go unchecked and unnoticed."" In an email to Go Public, Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson wrote, ""This kind of customer experience is rare, and we apologize to Mr. Tomlinson. We have provided coaching to all team members involved to ensure these kinds of mistakes are not repeated."" Gibson also noted that Bell's share of CCTS complaints ""declined more than any other service provider"" — by 2.4 per cent. Mike Polera says he filed a complaint last fall with the CCTS, after his experience trying to move his wife's cellphone from another service provider to his Rogers account. In terms of frustration, ""on a scale of one to 10, this was a 12,"" says Polera, a small business consultant based in Toronto. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Polera first contacted Rogers using a live chat agent, so he was able to save a copy of his chat and have a record of what was promised. When he went to a Rogers retail store to set up his wife's account, store reps couldn't help him and said there were no notes on his file. ""I actually had everything in writing and then found out that none of it was actually applied to my account,"" says Polera. ""It really made me angry. I felt completely taken advantage of."" In frustration, Polera took his cellphone business to another service provider. He says Rogers then charged him for services the company never delivered, including a $65 charge for a phone number that wasn't Polera's, and an activation fee. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'This is absolutely ridiculous',"" says Polera. ""Then I got angry."" After he wrote to the CCTS, Rogers issued him a credit for more than $350. Rogers spokesperson Sarah Schmidt told Go Public, ""We strive to deliver solutions for our customers the first time they contact us, and in this case we let Mr. Polera down. We see every customer complaint as an opportunity, and we have taken steps to ensure other customers do not experience the same situation."" A telecom watchdog says problems continue to exist in the telecom industry because companies get away with treating customers poorly. ""Fundamentally, the biggest problem with our system right now is there there aren't any strong penalties in place for the telecoms when they do something wrong,"" says OpenMedia's executive director Laura Tribe. ""Clearly, going through the CCTS and having a complaint filed is not a big enough threat to the telecoms to stop this behaviour."" Recently, the CRTC issued a report calling for more measures to prevent telecom companies from using aggressive and misleading sales practices. The recommendations are the result of an eight-month public inquiry conducted by the telecom regulator, prompted in part by months of stories by Go Public about the pressure on telco employees to upsell and mislead customers in order to meet sales targets. Rogers employees say managers turn a blind eye The CRTC report, issued in February, said harmful sales practices ""exist in all sales channels, including in store, online, over the phone, and door to door."" Among other things, the CRTC report recommended creating a mandatory internet code of conduct that could include price protections during a contract, and requiring telcos to allow a cooling-off period after purchasing products and services. Matthew Tomlinson says he still gets angry when he thinks about the hours involved trying to rectify his Bell bill, and the time thousands of other Canadians are spending, in similar situations. ""We don't want to be spending all this extra time away from our children, away from work, away from vacation planning, in order to deal with a problem that ultimately, in the end, it only took about 10 minutes to fix.""

394,Prajwala Dixit,2020-01-26T11:30:00.758Z,"I moved from coding to writing, and found the magic in between ","High school in the India of the early 2000s was an intense time. The rat race was on, and I, a Grade 10 student, was one of those running in it. Eleven exams and a decent score later, a question haunted me – arts or science? At 15, I had to decide whether I wanted to give up physics or English. Tough choice. And it didn't help that the socio-economic construct in India wasn't accepting of the arts. It was seen as more of a hobby. Pragmatically, I chose the sciences, worked really hard and pushed myself through six more years of undergraduate and grad schools of engineering. But 10 years of dedicating myself to the sciences led me, professionally, nowhere. I didn't break into engineering here in Newfoundland and Labrador. It was a challenging time and tested my resolve to stay here. Engineering ring-less, I moved from one gig to another, eventually landing myself in the most exhilarating and challenging job of all: motherhood. Working as full-time parent meant jumping from textbooks like High Performance Computer Architecture to children's books like Goodnight Moon and Barnyard Dance. It meant forgetting Java and C++ to relearning how to recite the Panchatantra. It meant understanding that the animals of Panchatantra could do the Barnyard Dance. It meant creating my first piece of literature. It meant jumping from engineering to English. To the naked eye the arts and sciences are varied but for someone who has straddled both worlds, the common threads run deep. Art is like science. It is measured, deliberate in choice and well crafted. Science is like the arts. It is untamed, fearless and daunting. As a computer engineer, I was programmed to program. From writing code (not very different from writing a short story, since there is a beginning, a middle and an end, and it's designed for a purpose) to debugging it (read as editing in the creative writing) to running a test (which means sending it to your editor or close circle for feedback and knowing it will come back with a million track changes), rejigging based on results (which means pure frustration and wondering why you ever started writing the God damn thing to begin with) to then reaching that glorious moment when the program does exactly what you wanted it to (or, in other words, looking at a piece of your writing and thinking that's decent for the world to see), I have found the beats of creativity the same in engineering and English. Perhaps, I understand both worlds because they're filled with eccentrics like myself. Odd schedules, crazy amounts of determination (or simply stubbornness), the never-ending search for money to somehow reach the end and still survive and copious amounts of coffee are the greatest hits of both engineering and English, therefore, making both worlds an odd concoction of a variety of peculiar personalities. Writers like to think we're the gods and goddesses of our worlds. Anything is possible. Except not. The characters suddenly start speaking to you and you stop ""creating"" them. They take control of their story and you end up becoming a mere conduit for their emotions, rendered powerless at the hands of the beast you believe to have created. Someone who understands this plight is a computer engineer, a coder specifically. The start is hope and ego filled which soon crashes when your program seems to have a mind of its own, and decides to do things you never intended it to do. The rest of the process you bow down to the prowess of not only the code but also the machine running it, praying fervently that it delivers what you promised to your boss or client. I came to St. John's to study engineering but today find myself pursuing English at MUN, making the 15-year-old me hope that the world ahead doesn't bifurcate these two fields, allowing the generations ahead to enjoy the spoils of both fields from a young age. Yes, there is a push towards STEAM from STEM (in other words, adding the Arts to Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) but more needs to happen to understand that one feeds the other. It is when both have succeeded and both have intertwined that society has thrived creating the best works of both realms. Don't believe me? Then turn back the clock and then look at some of the best innovators of our time. Ask yourself, what was Leonardo Da Vinci?

395,Hallie Cotnam,2020-01-22T21:21:32.255Z,"Salty dragonflies mean more mosquitoes, researchers find","Road salt is arguably a life-saving necessity during Canadian winters, but new research shows it may also indirectly boost the mosquito population come summertime. According to a study published recently in the journal Frontiers of Ecology and Evolution, all that salt is leaching into roadside storm ponds, where both mosquito and dragonfly larvae grow. Rosalind Murray, a post-doctoral fellow in biology at the University of Toronto and one of the study's authors, studied storm ponds in the GTA with her research team. These man-made ponds are meant to catch road run-off before it drains into the watershed, but they're also full of tiny life. With no fish or frogs present, the wingless dragonfly larvae, which measure up to three centimetres in length, are the apex predators, and have a voracious appetite: a healthy one consumes an average of 11 mosquito larvae in two hours. ""But the salty dragonflies — the ones that were exposed to the highest level of salt for the longest amount of time — were eating significantly fewer mosquito larvae,"" Murray told the CBC's Ottawa Morning — as few as seven every two hours. ""That might not seem like that big a difference, but if you think about how many ponds and how many dragonflies, this can have a huge impact on ... how many mosquitoes they're actually consuming."" The salt appears to have little effect on the hardy, adaptable mosquito larvae, leaving the population to thrive. ""If you have a very salty environment that has killed off a lot of the potential predators for the mosquitoes, then you might be exposed to even more mosquitoes,"" Murray said. For the good of the planet, can we curb our addiction to road salt? But dragonfly larvae also feed on each other, and salty ones are slower to heal, she said. ""Dragonfly larvae are hugely cannibalistic, so they might pull off a leg. When they're exposed to high levels of salt … they're not as quick at recovering from these wounds."" The researchers followed the salty dragonflies into adulthood, and found they were less healthy. As well as healing more slowly, the insects were also found to be more vulnerable to infection. For humans, this poses a dilemma: using road salt in the wintertime means more mosquitoes in the summertime. Murray said she's not advocating for an end to road salt, but until a healthier alternative is found, she wants municipalities to consider the impact excessive amounts are having on the ecosystem.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/road-salt-environmental-impact-run-off-dragonflies-mosquitoes-1.5435761,[],N/A
396,Richard Woodbury,2020-01-25T10:00:00.470Z,Meet the Smithsonian astronomer who has a donair website,"Like many Nova Scotia expats, Glen Petitpas found himself craving a donair. Luckily for him, his sister had a recipe from a Halifax donair shop, so he took matters into his own hands and started making the much-loved local dish of spiced meat on a pita, sweet white sauce, tomatoes and onions. It was the mid-1990s and the Timberlea, N.S., native was working on his master's degree in astronomy at McMaster University in Hamilton. Fed up with misplacing his copy of the recipe, he started a website and posted the recipe, which meant his other expat friends could easily access it. ""It's funny, I didn't really like donairs when I lived in Halifax,"" said Petitpas, 47. ""I thought they were a little bit too strong. But for some reason, the nostalgia started when going to visit home after I first moved away and tried one. They grew on me and then it was a lot of nostalgia and true love for the flavour after awhile."" Nearly 25 years on, through different iterations, the website continues to live on. Petitpas, who has a PhD in astronomy, now lives in the Boston area and works at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which operates a telescope in Hawaii. He even includes a link to his donair site on his Harvard web page. In the early days of launching the website, which Petitpas pegs as being around 1996 or 1997, he said he'd get emails from people about once a month thanking him for posting a recipe. Thanks to an increase in donair recipes online, he only gets emails about twice a year now. He said the email from the most distant Nova Scotia expat came from Singapore. Besides a recipe for donair meat, the site has two sauce recipes, as well as advice on how to handle donair offshoots like donair pizza, donair subs and garlic fingers. Petitpas doesn't make donairs often these days because he visits home regularly. ""Every time I go home, I kind of binge on them and then really don't feel like eating them again for a few months after three or four days straight of having donairs for lunch or dinner,"" he said. He thinks one of the reasons he didn't like donairs when he was younger was because many people put onions on them, which grossed him out. The combination of a sweet sauce with a spicy meat was also ""very jarring"" initially. These days, he's a meat, sauce and tomatoes kind of guy. Donairs were declared Halifax's official food in 2015. Petitpas, who is married and has a six-year-old son, said the donair love doesn't appear to have been passed on to the second generation. ""He liked them, but he's not really excited,"" he said. ""When I mentioned making them another time, he was like, 'Maybe, sure, whatever.' He was less enthusiastic.""

397,Paris Marx,2020-01-26T10:46:21.903Z,Snowmageddon has come and gone. Let's hope metro St. John's learns the right lessons ,"In the St. John's metro area, winter is synonymous with seasonal depression and months of shovelling out your car. If you don't have one, it can be even worse — nine people were hit by cars in the first half of January. For most people, winter is to be survived, not enjoyed. But our record-breaking snowstorm gave us a glimpse of how things could be different. With cars off the road and our usual obligations suspended, the communal spirit that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians pride themselves on came out in full force. Instead of just grumbling about the snow, digging out the car, and heading in out of it, people bonded with their neighbours over the towering snowbanks and pitched in to dig out anyone needing help. In some cases, it was the first time they'd gotten to know people they'd been living next to for years. People went out walking, snowshoeing, skiing, and even snowboarding on downtown's notoriously hilly streets. People were laughing, having fun, and even hosting block parties in streets that would usually be the exclusive domain of cars and trucks. Stumbled across an impromptu Georgetown block party with bonfire in the middle of what should be a street. Beer and comraderie freely shared with all <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLStorm2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NLStorm2020</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/QxUlea6rti"">pic.twitter.com/QxUlea6rti</a> People described the car-free streets as peaceful, beautiful, even ""pretty romantic."" With the state of emergency lifted, should we just go back to the drudgery we're used to, or learn from this experience to make the city better and more liveable? We proudly champion our communal ethos that came out of the past hardship of outport life — the community spirit, the wealth of musical and cultural talent, and the generosity that reemerges when other people need a helping hand. But all too often, those impulses get suppressed in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Physically separated from one another in our cars, trucks, and homes that are so far apart it's hard to walk anywhere, we lose that personal connection — even to people who live right next door. Yet as soon as we were forced out of our cars, those bonds reemerged, as they always do. That spirit is never lost, it's just smothered by the way the city has been built. In a small community, it's fine for everyone to have a house on its own plot of land, but in a city people have to live closer together or the community spirit gets lost in the sprawl. For me, some of the most moving images from the snowstorm's aftermath were those of people walking around downtown with hardly a car in sight. It brought to mind how the streets of St. John's used to look when they were shared by pedestrians, cyclists, early model automobiles, and even streetcars — before it was all given over to cars in the years after World War II. St. John's city council is moving in the right direction, but not fast enough. It's encouraging development within the city instead of more sprawl, and wants a mix of residential and commercial buildings so it's easier to get places without having to drive — though I suspect Galway will be looked back on as a bad planning decision. Metrobus will also be arriving more often on its main routes, but it needs support from the provincial government to expand and better serve the entire metro area. It missed an opportunity to run free buses during the state of emergency to show how well they could run without cars in the way, making the case for bus priority or dedicated lanes, although it is making up for it by offering free rides until Feb. 7.  But the state of emergency shows residents also need more spaces where they don't risk being hit by cars. With all the parking garages, on-street parking could be removed in parts of downtown to let restaurants and coffee shops add decks for customers to sit outside. Parts of Water Street could be made pedestrian-only, like on Montreal's Saint-Catherine Street in the summer, and more awnings installed so you don't get soaked walking around on rainy days. Scandinavian cities even keep it going into the winter, with blankets draped over the outside chairs. St. John's also lacks a downtown central library. To promote local culture, it could house a recording and media studio like Halifax's new library — called ""a beacon for our city"" — and a small, independent cinema like at Auckland, New Zealand's central library to host MUN's Cinema Series, the Women's Film Festival, and other events to boost our film industry. Beyond downtown, that could mean bungalow courts or townhouses close to shops, workplaces, and key Metrobus routes. Malls around North America have also been adding housing and connecting with their surrounding communities — a missed opportunity for the recent Avalon Mall redesign. Mount Pearl and Paradise should even considering importing the British High Street model instead of building more strip malls, in the same way they adopted roundabouts. I don't want this to come across as an attack on drivers. It makes sense that most people drive when the metro area is designed to make it hard for people to get around in any other way. Most people wanting better transit and more community spaces still have to drive sometimes too; we just think it's time residents have better alternatives. And that's exactly what the young people the province is trying to attract and retain want in a city. It can be hard to imagine a different way of organizing society when we live in it every single day. In that way, the snowstorm was a gift. By taking us out of our usual reality, it showed us how different the city could be if we just had a bit more time and space to get to know one another. Who knows, maybe in 10 years snowboarding down Holloway Street will be seen as normal, and shovelling out your car a memory of another time.

398,Erica Johnson,2019-10-21T12:17:54.616Z,Banks deny compensation when hackers steal customers' money,"Sunjit Lidhar was awoken by a phone call from Scotiabank last February, informing him that $3,000 had been transferred out of his savings account and was gone. ""My heart pretty much dropped to my stomach,"" Lidhar told Go Public from his home in Surrey, B.C. ""We just assume our money's safe."" Soon after, the cybercriminals stole another $2,000. But worst of all, Scotiabank refused to reimburse him. ""It is not acceptable to have your money stolen from your account and the bank — which you trust so much with your life savings — tells you they can't do much to help."" Lidhar is the victim of a ""systemic problem"" of criminals breaking into people's online accounts and stealing money, according to Christopher Parsons, a senior public policy researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Parsons argues that the country's banks, not their customers, should be financially liable when thieves raid customer accounts. ""The banks are responsible — solely responsible — for building and maintaining the infrastructure,"" he said. ""We need to reverse the liability the banks currently impose upon individuals who are using the very services and tools that banks are providing.""  The trouble started for Lidhar on Feb. 11, when hackers broke into his account and e-transferred $3,000 in two transactions — one for $2,000 and one for $1,000 — to an email address he says he doesn't recognize. As soon as he learned about it, Lidhar says he changed his password, got a new debit card, asked Scotiabank to freeze his accounts and stopped banking online. Scotiabank said it would investigate, but when Lidhar didn't hear back after two weeks, he visited his local branch. While speaking to someone in the fraud department, they told him money was again being transferred out of his account. ""I was totally shocked and blown away that this was happening while I was in the branch,"" he said.  Been wronged and you're not the only one? Contact our Go Public team His bank was able to stop one e-transfer for $1,000 but not another for $2,000. Lidhar says Scotiabank took a few weeks to investigate, and then said it wouldn't cover his losses.  In an email, Scotiabank said his claim was denied because the transaction was authorized from an internet address where he has ""extensive history."" Security experts tell Go Public that hackers can access a bank account from a victim's IP address by taking over an infected computer and logging in as if they were that person. Lidhar says Scotiabank wouldn't explain how the fraud happened, adding that only he has access to his account.  ""They're trying to blame me,"" he said. ""And they haven't told me anything about who it went to."" In a statement to Go Public, a Scotiabank spokesperson said the bank ""took immediate action and conducted a thorough investigation,"" into Lidhar's case.  ""We take the concerns of our customers very seriously,"" wrote Douglas Johnson. After Go Public contacted Scotiabank, it offered to compensate Lidhar — six months after his money was stolen.  Go Public has heard similar stories from others — all saying their accounts were hacked, and that the banks often won't reimburse them. In May, Martin Chapman of Peterborough, Ont., lost almost $12,000 when criminals broke into his accounts at TD Bank and Royal Bank. Initially, he says, TD refused to fully compensate him, offering just $1,805. ""They have admitted to me they don't know how the scammer broke through their security system,"" said Chapman. Only after he appealed did TD agree to reimburse all $6,000. RBC refunded the remaining money after a two-week investigation. TD would not respond to questions from Go Public about this case.  Curtis Hamilton of Esquimalt, B.C., says he was targeted by hackers last November who installed a key logger on his computer and sent just over $2,000 to themselves. TD's fraud department said Hamilton didn't protect his password and it was his fault. Hamilton had anti-malware software on his computer. He's hired a lawyer but has yet to get his money back. ""It's been quite frustrating,"" he said. ""The bank is basically saying … 'We're not responsible for anything.'"" TD would not comment on this case, when asked by Go Public. Patricia Widdis of Breslau, Ont., told Go Public that hackers accessed her RBC account and redirected her Visa payments, stealing $12,000 in May 2018. The bank was able to get $7,000 returned, but she is still out $5,000 and feels betrayed. ""They said, 'You made the payments yourself,'"" said Widdis. An RBC spokesperson wrote that potentially unauthorized transactions are analyzed ""on a case-by-case"" basis. Most Canadians are unaware that more criminals are hacking into financial institutions in Canada and around the world, says security expert Limor Kessem.  ""These threats are very real and very problematic,"" said Kessem, an adviser based in Tel Aviv with IBM X-Force, an international team of investigators who track global security threats to the financial sector. ""In the beginning,"" she said, ""we would see that a banking trojan [a type of virus] would be targeting banks through their customers,"" such as GozNym, a malware attack she helped uncover and that was shut down in May, as part of an international law enforcement operation. GozNym targeted two financial institutions based in Canada — which Kessem won't name — and 22 U.S. banks, credit unions and popular e-commerce platforms, stealing sensitive personal and financial information, including online banking login credentials such as usernames and passwords. It's estimated GozNym stole over $100 million from some 40,000 victims. It's an example of the sort of malware that might be responsible for the hacks against Lidhar, Hamilton and Chapman.  ""And then we have a different type of attack,"" said Kessem. ""Cybercrime groups that will invade the banks' actual infrastructure and get into their payment systems and start compromising them internally."" It all points to the need for financial institutions to take responsibility when hackers steal customers' money, says Parsons, the public policy researcher.  ""They can't just provide us tools or push liability upon us and then walk away,"" he said. ""One of the ways of correcting this would be to shift the liability structure. So rather than punishing customers … the banks themselves should be liable, so that they're encouraged to build way better security and protect their customers from this sort of fraud."" In the U.K., says Parsons, banking fraud was such a big problem, the government made banks responsible for financial losses to customers.  ""And as soon as the banks had to take those losses, all of a sudden … fraud plummeted because the banks invested massively in security,"" said Parsons. He says Canada's next government needs to follow the U.K.'s example.  ""If banks themselves won't do it, then it's an area where legislation needs to be seriously considered. We can't rely on customers to know about every kind of security vulnerability, to track every website that has breached passwords,"" he said. ""That's just absolutely absurd and not a feasible solution to the problem."" Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association — which represents Canada's largest banks — whether its members would consider assuming liability when hackers break into the online banking systems they have created. A spokesperson did not address that question, but wrote, banks ""have no higher priority than the security of their customers' money and conduct comprehensive investigations of all fraud cases, some of which are complex and take time to investigate the specifics of the case."" All the banks involved in these cases have told Go Public that customers are responsible for taking precautions to ensure their devices, accounts and information are protected. Sunjit Lidhar says he's stopped doing online banking and now heads to his bank branch instead — a hassle he says is worth it, for peace of mind. He says he wrote to Go Public to let people know that banks could hold them responsible when hackers strike. ""I just want people to know that this is something that's very real,"" says Lidhar. ""It's not safe. And that's something they [the banks] need to work on."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

399,Alex Cooke,2020-01-26T10:00:00.778Z,Hop to it: Rescue group holds 'bunny blitz' adoption event,"Folks looking for a fluffy new friend will get the chance to meet some adoptable bunnies Sunday afternoon. The first rescue group in the Maritimes focused on the long-eared lagomorphs — 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue — is holding a ""bunny blitz"" in Halifax. More than a dozen of the twitchy-nosed animals can be scoped out by potential new owners. Denise Halliday, a volunteer with the organization, said they decided to hold the event following their first successful blitz in September. ""It's quite the day,"" she said. ""It's really interesting to have people come in and go, 'Oh my gosh, this is how many rabbits you guys have!'"" Halliday said the rabbit rescue was started nine years ago ""basically just because there was nowhere for rabbits to go."" Since then, she said the volunteer-run group has rescued and found new homes for more than 700 bunnies. Right now, there's about 17 rabbits up for adoption, but she said the group normally has between 20 and 30 in its care — though it can change suddenly if they take in a pregnant female.  The rescue doesn't have an actual shelter, so its volunteers foster the bunnies in their own homes. People can view available rabbits and apply for adoption through the 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue website. Halliday stressed that while the group wants to help the rabbits find homes, anyone looking to adopt needs to be aware of what's involved. ""They're living, breathing, sentient creatures, and if you're adopting, it needs to be a well-thought-out family decision that everyone is on board [with] and everyone is part of,"" she said.  ""The life expectancy is 10 to 14 years. So, you know, it's a long-term commitment."" Halliday said the rescue organization isn't just trying to find homes for abandoned bunnies. They're trying to keep bunnies from being abandoned in the first place. ""Finding them homes, it's really a Band-Aid,"" she said.  She said around 90 per cent of the rabbits they take in are found outside, which means they were likely dumped by someone who got bored or decided they were too much work. But Halliday noted that rabbits aren't native to Nova Scotia — only hares are — and said domestic rabbits can't fend for themselves or find food in the wild. ""It's the same as dumping a cat or dog. They can't survive outside by themselves,"" she said. She also said it's a bad idea for parents to get their child a pet rabbit because kids don't have the capacity to care for them properly. Halliday said bunnies are social creatures that like to be kept in pairs and that they shouldn't be cooped up in a cage all day. ""Having them in your kid's bedroom in a cage on top of the dresser, they're not going to be happy, they're going to miss that social aspect of being part of the main area, part of the family,"" she said. In fact, the rescue also discourages giving rabbits as gifts in general, so it closes down around Christmas and Easter. But she did say bunnies can make ""amazing"" family pets if the parents know the responsibility falls on them. The 10,000 Carrots Rabbit Rescue bunny blitz is taking place at the Citadel Community Centre on Trollope Street Sunday afternoon from 3-7 p.m. Halliday said anyone is welcome, even those who aren't in the market for a new pet. She said people can come and find out more about what the rescue does and how to care for a bunny. ""Or if you just want to come snuggle,"" she said.

Genevieve Braun of Moncton's Victoria Park area, is fed up with men prowling her neighbourhood and bothering women. ""There's a lot of harassment toward women and girls and it's happening daily,"" said Braun. ""They're not here for the Victorian houses."" Braun refuses to leave her house at night. She was approached three times this summer alone. One of those times happened at the corner of Weldon and Park streets, a few feet from Edith Cavell School, a kindergarten to Grade 8 school. ""He just stopped and waved at me. His window was already down and he said, 'Hey, are you busy right now? Want to go on a date?' And I knew right away what he meant,"" she said.   ""I totally flipped out, called him a whole bunch of names and he sped up and drove away."" Braun has lived in the area for 12 years. She only started noticing that men were loitering and cruising around the neighbourhood after she moved her office into her sun room.  ""I started noticing the same cars over and over everyday."" Around 1 p.m. on a Sunday, Braun witnessed a man picking up a prostitute near her house. Braun called police, but she said it took an hour for them to get back to her. By that time the man had already left the area. She said the police officer told her there's nothing he could do anyway. ""To me, that doesn't make sense.""  Braun has taken matters into her own hands and set up a database to collect images and the licence plate numbers of men in their vehicles, who she believes are looking to pay for sex. She has more than 140 men registered in her database. She's also brought the issue forward to the city and asked for a police task force to be put in place. She also wants surveillance cameras to be installed. Charles Léger is a Moncton city councillor for the area. He's also chair of the Codiac REgional Policing Authority, a group responsible for overseeing planning, police coverage and fiscal management of the Codiac RCMP. Léger said federal changes to prostitution laws in 2014, which shifted to target people who buy and exploit sexual services, have made solving the issues in the Victoria Park neighbourhood ""much more complicated for the RCMP."" But he said the city is rolling out a plan in April to address Braun's concerns. The plan isn't finalized yet, but it could include changes to the design of the neighbourhood, installation of surveillance cameras and better lighting. ""Right now, all of the options are on the table with respect to what other communities have done and the successes they've had,"" he said.  ""The sex workers need to also feel safe in the environment. What they're doing is not illegal."" In the meantime, Léger said people shouldn't hesitate to contact RCMP if they see men harassing women.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-johns-victoria-park-1.5438840,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/john-prostitution-moncton-undercover-st-george-1.3927372 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-prostitution-law-human-trafficking-police-1.4162524,N/A

The 2020 edition, which aims to inspire readers to consider new perspectives, will see Canyon and Brugel face off against Letterkenny actor Kaniehtiio Horn, basketball broadcaster Akil Augustine and YouTuber Alayna Fender with the title they've each chosen to defend. This year's contenders are: ""Reading was such a big part of my life when I was younger. It's how I explored the world,"" Horn said, quipping that being a participant in Canada Reads now is ""like the ultimate book report.""   Augustine — a self-described fan of debates — notes that he's got some strategies in mind.  ""I've watched hours upon hours of my favourite public speakers try to expose their ideas to people who didn't agree with them,"" he said. ""So I feel like I've got a good grasp of a couple of little tricks and tools to throw in there — a little full-court press, some zone. I'm going to play with it."" The books reflect this year's theme — ""one book to bring Canada into focus"" — and aim to inspire readers to consider a different perspective about the country and themselves.  ""With technology and social media and all these things, we've been able to get into our own little bubbles and stay there,"" Canyon said. ""We each need to take time to get out of our own bubble, to understand other people's trials, tribulations. [It's] almost that old saying of walking a mile in someone's shoes to understand their life. That to me is what the theme is all about this year. "" It's important to promote a new generation of Canadian writers, said Brugel. ""We do need new voices and we do certainly need people who haven't been represented to continue to add to our culture and add to the beautiful novels that have already come out of Canada,"" she said. The brisk, passionate daily debates, set for March 16-19, will be moderated for a fourth time by comedian and host Ali Hassan. Canada Reads 2020 will be broadcast on CBC Radio, CBC-TV, cbcbooks.ca and will also be available through the CBC Gem and CBC Listen apps. Books that have won Canada Reads over the years include Ru by Kim Thuy, The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill, Something Fierce by Carmen Aguirre and Max Eisen's By Chance Alone. Their champions were, respectively, TIFF artistic director Cameron Bailey, filmmaker Avi Lewis, hip-hop artist and broadcaster Shad and science journalist Ziya Tong. ""I'm excited to hopefully get others excited about a book that they maybe wouldn't have picked up otherwise,"" Fender said. That echoes a sentiment that author Cherie Dimaline, whose acclaimed novel The Marrow Thieves was a 2018 Canada Reads finalist, told CBC Radio's Here & Now earlier this month. ""The impact of Canada Reads cannot be underestimated,"" Dimaline said. ""Canada Reads put [The Marrow Thieves] out there in the national discussion, and some of that discussion was hard.

402,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:48:01.672Z,"No hesitation to send ambulance for Cynthia Blackjack, nurses tells inquest","Two nurses testifying at the Cynthia Blackjack inquest in Yukon said there was no hesitation to send an ambulance to pick up the ailing woman, the day she died. Nurse Terry Ogilvie was working at the Carmacks Health Centre on Nov. 7, 2013, when the call came for an ambulance to be sent to the house of Blackjack's grandmother. The coroner's inquest, now underway in Whitehorse, is looking at the circumstances around 29-year-old Cynthia Blackjack's death later that day, during a medevac flight to Whitehorse. One of the central questions raised at the inquest so far is whether Blackjack should have been transported to Whitehorse General Hospital sooner. The Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, of which Blackjack was a member, has suggested ""systemic racism"" as a potential factor. In 2018, the Yukon Court of Appeal found that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of severe dental pain. The day before she died, Blackjack was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital — a two-hour drive away. Staff at the health centre say they tried to help find Blackjack a ride, but were unsuccessful.  Ogilvie told the inquest that her memory of the day Blackjack died is spotty, but she recalls at least three nurses and two doctors who saw Blackjack in Carmacks on that day. She said that's an unusually high number of staff. Ogilvie also said anyone with symptoms like Blackjack's would get an ambulance or medevac to Whitehorse as soon as possible. Deb Crosby, the former nurse in charge of the Carmacks Health Centre, also testified on Wednesday and supported Ogilvie's claim that there was no hesitation to send an ambulance. She told the inquest jurors that staff at the health centre could almost always arrange rides to Whitehorse for patients. But Crosby said she had to be cautious about sending Carmacks's only ambulance out of the community. ""You're always thinking about the worst-case scenario,"" she said. When Blackjack arrived at the health centre on Nov. 7, staff immediately called Whitehorse for a medevac flight, Crosby said. According to Ogilvie, the Carmacks nurses were devastated when RCMP later told them Blackjack had died on the plane before reaching Whitehorse. The nurses' testimony marked the start of the Whitehorse portion of the inquest, which is expected to continue at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre until Jan. 31. The first two days of testimony were held at the recreation centre in Carmacks. In Carmacks, the inquest heard from some of Blackjack's family and friends. They described her as a kind and loving person with a lively sense of humour.  The inquest jury heard that Blackjack had problems with alcohol, but her cousin, Dacia Tulk, testified that Blackjack was excited to start a new job with the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation. Blackjack's friend, Vanessa Charlie, said the ambulance she called for Blackjack took more than two hours to arrive. According to logs entered as evidence, it took the ambulance 20 minutes to get to Blackjack and another 20 to get her to the health centre. Witnesses in Carmacks also testified that nurses at the health centre are frequently dismissive of Indigenous patients, especially if those patients have been drinking. ""They [health centre staff] weren't very nice,"" Tulk said. ""Not at all."" Charlie also told jurors that three weeks after Blackjack's death, she called an ambulance for a white man in the community. That time, she said, the ambulance arrived in 10 minutes.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-whitehorse-1.5436843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,N/A

In a paper published Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports, the authors say the technique allowed them to produce a single sound — somewhere between the vowels in ""bed"" and ""bad."" The eerie tone is unlikely to be a precise reflection of the speech of Egyptian priest Nesyamun, whose mummified body the researchers worked with, because the tongue has lost much of its bulk over three millennia. ""We have made a faithful sound for his tract in its current position, but we would not expect an exact speech match given his tongue state,"" said co-author David M. Howard of London's Royal Holloway college. The model alone also isn't enough to synthesize whole words or sentences, the authors said, noting that this would require the ability to calculate the audio output from the vocal tract as its shape is being changed. ""But this is something that is being worked on, so it will be possible one day,"" said Howard. Rudolf Hagen, an ear, nose and throat expert at the University Hospital in Wuerzburg, Germany, who specializes in thorax reconstruction and wasn't involved in the study, expressed skepticism. Even cutting-edge medicine struggles to give living people without a thorax a ""normal"" voice, he said. Co-author John Schofield, an archaeologist at the University of York, said the technique could be used to help people interpret historical heritage. ""When visitors encounter the past, it is usually a visual encounter,"" said Schofield. ""With this voice we can change that, and make the encounter more multidimensional.""

Green, who also goes by the name Neva, plans to officially launch her campaign Friday at a local tavern in Bear River, N.S. The wellness and food nutrition worker said she became politically engaged after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned catastrophic consequences if global warming pushes beyond 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. ""When the IPCC report came out over a year ago, it really hit me that we don't have time to mess around,"" Green said.

""Eco-socialists"" are committed to protecting the environment while pursuing evergreen left-centre policy goals — such as universal pharmacare and free university tuition — and reforming capitalism to reduce economic inequality. On the other hand, Kritsonis, the only Toronto candidate in the race so far, sits on the left of issues and wants to see the Green Party bring an end to government subsidies of corporations. ""In the age of basically the greed of capitalism destroying the planet and capitalism running rampant, someone (running for the Greens) who is a self-described as eco-socialist is a good idea"" said Kritsonis, 62. He said he currently works on contract selling genetic testing for prescribed drug compatibility.

405,Ryan Cooke,2020-01-24T13:01:23.050Z,St. John's has received a full Shaquille O'Neal of snow since Christmas Eve,"As the ongoing state of emergency in St. John's winds down, the city can now boast that it is the snowiest capital city in Atlantic Canada — by a long shot. According to Environment Canada, St. John's has seen 256 centimetres since Oct. 1. The vast majority of that accumulation happened between Christmas Eve and Jan. 19. In that 27-day timeframe, the city saw 221 cm in several significant snowfalls, including an unforgiving blizzard last Friday that has left the city cleaning up ever since, with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces. The average snowfall from the start of October to the end of January is 176 cm — the average height of a North American man — which is about on track if you subtract the major blizzard. ""It's really just one storm that's throwing everything off,"" said Justin Boudreau, a meteorologist with Environment Canada's weather office in Gander. That one storm brought St. John's from snowfalls equalling the average height of a man to beyond the average height of a basketball superstar. It might be hard to visualize these snowfall amounts. Despite the metric system being widely used by our country, the American style of feet and inches is still ingrained in many people's minds. Since Christmas Eve, St. John's has recorded 7'3"" of snow. By comparison, former Los Angeles Lakers centre Shaquille O'Neal is 7'1"" and former St. John's Edge player Satnam Singh is 7'2"". The St. John's snowfall is just one inch short of the late actor and wrestler Andre the Giant. As for the total since the beginning of October, 256 cm stacks up to be about 8'3"", which nearly the exact height of Sultan Kosen, the Kurdish man who holds the current title of the world's tallest person. That's just the snowfall, too. Heavy drifting, much of it caused by hours of hurricane-force winds that continued well into Saturday morning, has left piles of snow that in some cases are higher than houses.  Every day this week, St. John's Mayor Danny Breen has reminded residents of the monumental task the city faces to bring streets to a point where it is safe to drive and walk. It's true — St. John's has a total of 1,400 kilometres of roads running throughout the city. That is equivalent to the driving distance from St. John's to Port aux Basques and back to Grand Falls-Windsor. As the crow flies, it's the same distance from St. John's to Quebec City. Breen told CBC News Friday morning that despite the state of emergency coming to an end on Saturday morning, people should still remain off the road unless they absolutely need to go out. ""There's still a tremendous amount of work to go,"" he said. Businesses are preparing to open after eight days of mandatory shutdown. Employees were allowed to return to their places of work on Friday to prepare for opening on Saturday morning. In true St. John's fashion, people are already talking about the next storm. On Thursday, Premier Dwight Ball stirred the public when he warned about 20 cm of snow coming on Monday, but Boudreau said right now that's not in the forecast. St. John's could see a period of snow on Monday, but Boudreau said it will likely turn to rain. If amounts stay between five and 10 millimetres, it will knock down the snow banks and clean up some of the mess before freezing again. However, Boudreau warned the total rainfall could be between 10 and 15 millimetres, which could result in flooding, especially since many storm drains are covered in snow. Breen said the city is keeping an eye on the forecast, and is worried about the weather. He said staff will analyze their options each day. ""There's going to be a lot of discussion, even as we move towards Monday, about what is going to happen,"" he said.

406,Janet Davison,2020-01-25T09:00:27.803Z,Uncertainty remains over the future success of Harry and Meghan's new life in Canada,"The Royal Fascinator Hello royal watchers and those intrigued by what's going on inside the House of Windsor. This is your deep dive into royal news and analysis. Reading this online? Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox. The breathless headlines over Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior members of the Royal Family have subsided, but uncertainty remains about how their new life will work out for them. Harry spoke Sunday night of the ""many years"" of challenges that preceded the decision, and about taking a step forward ""into what I hope can be a more peaceful life."" Then he returned to Canada to be reunited with Meghan and their son, Archie, in British Columbia, where they had been staying over the holidays. It's not clear how much of their time will be spent in Canada, but for at least one longtime observer, there is a sense that life on this side of the Atlantic may have its challenges, too. ""My fear is that Harry is going to be lost, with not enough to do, and thousands of miles away from his family and friends and everything he has ever known,"" said author Penny Junor, who delved into his life in her biography Prince Harry: Brother, Soldier, Son. Speculation has been rampant regarding what the couple may do now that they have stepped back and seek financial independence. While they won't be using their ""Royal Highness"" titles, they have kept their associations with their private patronages. ""That is where their hearts lie, and those charities would be devastated to lose them as patrons,"" Junor said via email. ""Even without their titles, they will bring in funds and increase profile."" But there is likely to be much scrutiny of how they try to develop their own brand. ""I'm sure the tabloid press will be keeping a close eye and leaping on anything that smacks of either of them exploiting their royal connections,"" Junor said. Media and PR experts in the U.K. are already suggesting it could be an expensive and complicated battle if Harry and Meghan have to change the Sussex Royal brand that they have been promoting. David Haigh, chief executive of a brand valuation consultancy, told The Guardian that they face the ""mother-of-all punch-ups"" protecting it in global markets. ""The fact is, it's a minefield. They are going to have real problems,"" he told the paper. Earlier this week, British media reports were also questioning whether a commercial venture by one of Harry's cousins might offer a look at how Harry and Meghan will chart their own path. The Daily Mail reported that Princess Anne's son, Peter Phillips, who is not a working member of the Royal Family, endorsed milk from Jersey cows in a Chinese television ad. Following last Saturday's announcement of how Harry and Meghan would chart their new course, much attention has revolved around their ""His/Her Royal Highness"" titles and their significance. ""I think what is confusing to the public is the idea they still have these titles but they will not be using them,"" said Carolyn Harris, a Toronto-based royal author and historian. It all sets up an unusual — but not unprecedented — scenario. The Duchess of Kent, wife of the Queen's cousin, the Duke of Kent, stopped using her HRH a couple of decades ago. ""She pursued an independent career as a music teacher in a school and stepped away from royal duties,"" said Harris. Under King George V's letters patent in 1917, the HRH titles were restricted to children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch. ""At [that] time, King George the Fifth was eager to distance himself from some of his German relations in the House of Hanover as well,"" said Harris, ""so restricting royal titles was also a means of clearly defining who was in the Royal Family as opposed to who was more distantly related to the monarch."" If Harry and Meghan had been stripped of their HRH titles, Harris suspects it would have prompted a conversation at the palace over whether other members of the family should keep their titles. ""If Harry and Meghan formally lost their HRH, the question would arise of why does Prince Andrew have an HRH if he is not carrying out royal duties, as he's stepped back from his royal duties in disgrace."" Similar questions might arise for Andrew's daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who have the title but have never been full-time working members of the family. Harris thinks that during the next reign, it's likely Prince Charles, as monarch, will issue new letters patent restricting the HRH to a much smaller number of people, perhaps the heir to the throne and their children, ""in order to avoid these complications."" Harry's departure from the upper echelons of the Royal Family — and the fact that he will no longer formally represent Queen Elizabeth — could pose a constitutional conundrum for the United Kingdom. Harry is a Counsellor of State, one of a select group of high-ranking royals who can carry out most of the official duties of the monarch if they are unable because of illness or absence abroad. In the event of that, two or more counsellors can be appointed. According to law, the counsellors are the monarch's spouse and the next four adults in the line of succession who have reached the age of 21. ""Given that Prince Harry will no longer represent the Queen, Prince Andrew has stepped back from public life and Prince Philip has retired, only Prince Charles and Prince William are available,"" said Craig Prescott, director of Centre for Parliament and Public Law at the University of Winchester in southern England, via email. ""The risk is that their duties as Counsellors of State mean that Prince Charles and Prince William could not do the other things they are expected to do, such as representing the U.K. overseas or taking part in engagements around the U.K."" WATCH | Commentator Katie Nicholl discusses the future of the British monarchy All this means that unless legislation (the Regency Acts 1937-1953) is amended, ""the monarchy may not be able to meet all the expectations placed on it, which questions Prince Charles's idea of slimming down the monarchy,"" Prescott said. Maybe it would be easier, Prescott suggested, ""if the load was shared and those next in the line of succession, such as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, take up public duties and could become Counsellors of State, or other royals who still fulfil their duties, such as Prince Edward or Princess Anne, become Counsellors of State even though they are further down the line of succession."" Buckingham Palace did not respond to a request for comment this week. Prescott said it had been rumoured last year that the palace approached Downing Street about changing the legislation. ""But apparently they were more concerned about changing the law on how and when a regency can be declared rather than looking at the issue of Counsellors of State. However, the two issues really should be considered together."" While Harry and Meghan have been the focus of public attention in the past two weeks, other members of the Royal Family have been out and about on engagements often focused on issues of significance to them. Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, launched a U.K.-wide survey that aims to improve early childhood, a major area of focus for her. Prince Charles was at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he spoke about the world needing a ""paradigm shift"" in how it deals with climate change, and met Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old climate activist from Sweden.

407,Éric Grenier,2020-01-25T15:26:26.498Z,Peter MacKay is piling up the caucus endorsements — but will they matter?,"Peter MacKay's bid for the Conservative Party leadership officially begins today and he's already starting with a big lead — at least among members of the Conservative caucus. Endorsements from MPs probably didn't play a decisive role in the party's 2017 leadership race, but they could have made a difference in what turned out to be a close contest. How important could they prove to be this time? A single tweet from MacKay saying ""I'm in"" was enough to get a few Conservative MPs to announce their support for the former cabinet minister and last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party. As of late Friday, MacKay had received the endorsements of 11 MPs. They include six MPs from Ontario (Dean Allison, Colin Carrie, Scot Davidson, Ben Lobb, Dave MacKenzie and Doug Shipley), two from British Columbia (Ed Fast and Kerry-Lynne Findlay), two from Alberta (Ziad Aboultaif and Blaine Calkins) and one from Quebec (Pierre Paul-Hus). MacKay also has received the endorsement of prominent provincial politicians such as Ontario PC cabinet minister Caroline Mulroney and Tim Houston, the leader of the Nova Scotia PC Party. Now that we know Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre will not be running for the leadership, MacKay's chief competitor appears to be Erin O'Toole, who finished third in the 2017 race and whose own campaign will launch soon. That makes Carrie's endorsement particularly notable, as the Oshawa MP backed O'Toole — who represents the neighbouring riding of Durham — in 2017. He's one of three MPs who endorsed O'Toole in 2017 and are putting their weight behind MacKay this time. It's certainly a show of strength from MacKay's campaign, one that gives an impression of momentum right from the start. But just what tangible impacts do endorsements have in leadership races — and what could their impact be in this contest? According to the rules of the Conservative leadership contest, every riding in the country is worth 100 points and candidates receive a number of points equal to their share of the vote in each riding. The 70 MPs who endorsed a leadership contestant in the 2017 race boosted their candidates by an average of 11 points in their ridings, compared to the candidates' performance in ridings in the same provinces where they did not receive endorsements. This phenomenon was pretty widespread — only five Conservative MPs out of the 70 who made endorsements failed to give their candidates a boost in their ridings. That boost could have made the difference between Andrew Scheer and Maxime Bernier, the top two finishers in 2017. Although these ""endorsement boosts"" represented only a small share of the 33,800 points up for grabs in Canada's 338 ridings, Scheer's estimated boost was larger than the margin that separated him and Bernier. Had Scheer not gotten the endorsements he did, he might not have won such a close race. Endorsements are not necessarily predictive, though. Bernier had little support within the Conservative caucus and still led on 12 of 13 ballots. O'Toole boasted the most caucus endorsements, but finished well back of Scheer and Bernier in third place. Generally, however, candidates who win leadership races in Canada receive a significant number — if not most — of the endorsements from their party's caucus. Why? It's kind of a chicken-or-egg question. Do MPs endorse the people they believe will win out of self-interest, or do MP endorsements help them win? In the end, the MPs doing the endorsing are likely a mix of bandwagon-jumpers and people willing to put in the actual work to help a candidate win. Endorsements could make a difference in the 2020 iteration of the Conservative leadership race. For one thing, with 22 more MPs in the Conservative caucus there are now more endorsements up for grabs. The length of the race also might put a premium on Conservative MPs' pre-existing networks in their constituencies. Candidates only have until April 17 to sign up new members who will be eligible to vote in June — that's just 83 days from now. In the last campaign, candidates had just over a year to recruit new members. They more than doubled the size of the membership base in the process. Unless O'Toole — who had the backing of nearly a third of the caucus in 2017 — can start to build his own roster of endorsements soon, MacKay's advantage might become self-sustaining, discouraging caucus members from backing anyone but the heir apparent. When all is said and done, no one wants to be the losing side. MacKay is already trying to demonstrate which side that is likely to be.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-endorsements-1.5438124,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5437504,N/A

410,Julia Page,2020-01-25T11:00:00.266Z,"Lac-Saint-Jean, 'mecca of snowmobiling,' coping with unprecedented tragedy","It's not uncommon for snowmobilers to call for help after losing their way in the maze of trails in Lac-Saint-Jean's back country, says Charles Tremblay, the president of the region's snowmobiling club. But last Tuesday's 911 call was different. ""As soon as [first responders] understood where the group got lost, everything was put into motion very quickly,"" said Tremblay, speaking to a CBC reporter at his dépanneur in Saint-Henri-de-Taillon, 25 kilometres northwest of Alma, Que. In a region where snowmobile trails nearly outnumber traditional roads, the incident has shaken the entire community. It was here, at Tremblay's convenience store and gas station, located right on the interprovincial snowmobile trail, where three French tourists showed up Tuesday evening, desperate for help. Two were soaking wet — their snowsuits frozen stiff. ""One of them was shaking violently,"" said Janie Lamothe, the 17-year-old clerk on duty. ""It really wasn't pretty."" She dragged out an electric heater and blasted it, handing the men towels with which to dry themselves off. The men told her one of their snowmobiles had crashed through the ice nearby. But they had no idea what had happened to their five fellow travellers or their guide. Lamothe said the men told her the guide had turned back to check on them when he realized they were no longer following the group. When he saw one of their machines had gone through the ice, he sped off to alert the others. ""They waited for about 30 minutes, but when the guide didn't come back they decided to go look for help. That's the last time they saw him."" Lamothe stayed with the men until a social worker came to pick them up. As with many others in this small town, she only found out the extent of the tragedy later, through social media. ""I really don't understand how they ended up there,"" said Tremblay. Local snowmobilers know that the spot where the group was last seen, near a channel where the water drains away from Lac Saint-Jean, never freezes over completely. ""It's a place where there is a lot of current that should really be avoided."" Snowmobiles are allowed on certain sections of the lake during the winter, but only once officials have tested the thickness of the ice and have put up signs indicating it's safe. Snowmobiler Denis Tremblay, who owns a fishing cabin on the lake, says he only drives on it in broad daylight — and never near the channel, known as La Grande-Décharge.  ""We know not to go there,"" he said, when he stopped by the command post set up by provincial police for their search and rescue operation. Denis Tremblay is originally from Alma, but even he has lost his way on the lake. ""Last year I got caught in a storm, and if I hadn't had a GPS..."" his voice trailed off as he looked out past the treeline, to the spot where the French tourists had veered off the main trail. The snowmobile industry is omnipresent in this region: yellow-and-black road signs mark the snowmobile crossings every few kilometres on most roads. People have gone through the ice before, said Alma Mayor Marc Asselin. ""Luckily, usually someone gets to them in time,"" he said. But the outcome of Tuesday's incident — with the guide, 42-year-old Benoît Lespérance, and one of the tourists found dead, and another four men unaccounted for — is the worst incident the region has ever seen, according to Asselin. ""It's a catastrophe. So many snowmobilers — all at once — I've never seen anything like it, ever."" While Asselin himself isn't ""a fan of the noise and the smell,"" he said, in Alma, passion for the sport runs deep. ""We're very close to nature here: people go hunting and fishing; the Innu community is also always out on the land — since they were invented, there have always been snowmobiles here."" He said workers and volunteers maintain the trails as diligently as they would any road or highway. On Thursday, the regional tourism board temporarily pulled one of its ads promoting the sport, out of respect for the families of the missing and the dead. While Asselin said he understands this tragedy may cast a shadow on the sport's image, he doesn't believe it will mar the sport's popularity. It is the region's top winter attraction, with snowmobile enthusiasts booking 165,075 overnight stays in 2017, according to Tourisme Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean. ""It's the mecca of snowmobiling,"" said Asselin. He has pledged to review how the tragedy could have been avoided. ""We don't want this to happen again — we will try to learn from this and see how we can improve security.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snowmobiling-lac-saint-jean-community-in-shock-1.5438917,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/missing-snowmobilers-french-tourists-quebec-1.5439795 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lac-st-jean-snowmobile-french-tourists-search-1.5437306 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snowmobile-ice-fall-1.5435756,N/A

Residents say police arrived to start the eviction at around 8 a.m. At first, crews in white garb, who appeared to be working out of a Servicemaster truck, began cutting the tents and removing the contents. ""Servicemaster was cleaning really super, super fast,"" said tent city resident Dennis Robertson. ""We didn't have much time."" Then, around noon, a front end loader started clearing the property by the St. John River. Residents at the tent city received an eviction notice from the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure earlier this week. A statement from the Department of Social Development, which is assisting with the eviction, said the residents are being moved out over concerns for their own safety. ""There is no heat nor running water available at this site and given the extreme cold in recent days, we are encouraging these individuals to take advantage of the beds available at one of the three shelters in the city.,"" said the department. Robertson was upset as he witnessed the demolition of the place he had called home since last year. ""It's like your house burns down,"" said Robertson, ""But you gotta move on."" On Thursday, both the men's and women's shelters reported having beds available, while the out-of-the-cold shelter has room for 25 people on a first-come, first-served basis. Robertson said he plans to start another camp and said people don't realize that shelters are not a great option for some people. ""I'm not going in the shelters,"" said Robertson. Robertson suggested the people who were responsible for the eviction should try to live in a shelter for a few weeks. He said the shelter has too many rules and that they aren't enforced equally. Robertson admits there were some ""shady"" people who lived in the tent city, but said many became friends with him.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/crews-dismantle-fredericton-tent-city-1.5439392,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-tent-city-eviction-1.5437699,N/A
412,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:56:53.039Z,Trump becomes 1st U.S. president to attend March for Life anti-abortion rally,"Donald Trump called it his ""profound honour"" on Friday to be the first U.S. president to personally attend the annual anti-abortion gathering in Washington called the March for Life. In a speech there, he accused Democrats of embracing ""radical and extreme positions"" on abortion and praised those attending the event, saying they were motivated by ""pure, unselfish love."" He also recited actions he's taken as president that were sought by social conservatives, including the confirmation of 187 federal judges. ""Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,"" he declared. Trump once declared in a 1999 interview that ""I am pro-choice in every respect."" Now, as he heads into the 2020 election, Trump continues to reach out to the white evangelical voters who have proven to be among his most loyal backers. ""Every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting,"" Trump said, prompting loud cheers from the many thousands attending the march. Trump is counting on the support of his base of conservative activists to help bring him a second term in office. ""I think it's a brilliant move,"" said Ralph Reed, chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and one of Trump's most prominent evangelical supporters. Reed said the president's appearance would ""energize and remind pro-life voters what a great friend this president and administration has been."" It also shows how much times have changed. Past presidents who opposed abortion, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, steered clear of personally attending the march to avoid being too closely associated with demonstrators eager to outlaw the procedure. They sent remarks for others to deliver, spoke via telephone hookup or invited organizers to visit the White House. Over the last 10 years, however, the Republican Party has undergone a ""revolution,"" displaying a new willingness to ""embrace the issue as not only being morally right but politically smart,"" said Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List and Women Speak Out PAC. The group is planning to spend $52 million US this cycle to help elect candidates opposed to abortion rights. Its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, will serve as national co-chair of a new campaign coalition, ""Pro-life Voices for Trump."" According to Pew Research Center polling in 2019, roughly six in 10 Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Over time, though, both the Republican and Democratic parties have taken harder-line positions for and against abortion rights. ""There used to be a middle in this country and candidates would not want to alienate the middle,"" said Ari Fleischer, who served as White House press secretary under President George W. Bush. ""And it just seems that that is over and that both parties play to their bases to get maximum turnout from their base."" During his first three years in office, Trump has embraced socially conservative policies, particularly on the issue of abortion. He's appointing judges who oppose abortion, cutting taxpayer funding for abortion services and painting Democrats who support abortion rights as extreme in their views. ""President Trump has done more for the pro-life community than any other president, so it is fitting that he would be the first president in history to attend the March for Life on the National Mall,"" said White House spokesperson Judd Deere. This is not the first time Trump has given serious consideration to an appearance at the event. Last year, he wanted to go and came close to attending, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the trip never came together because of concerns about security, so Trump joined the event via video satellite from the White House Rose Garden instead. Trump's thinking on the matter was simple: If he supported the cause, ""why wouldn't he show up to their big event?"" said Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union and a close ally of the White House. He said the appearance would be deeply significant for those in attendance. ""I've had people be moved to tears over the fact that he's going,"" said Schlapp. ""It's a big deal."" During his video address last year, Trump sent a clear message to the thousands of people braving the cold on the National Mall. ""As president, I will always defend the first right in our Declaration of Independence, the right to life,"" he said. The rhetoric underscored Trump's dramatic evolution on the issue from his days as a freewheeling New York deal-maker, when he described himself as ""very pro-choice"" in a 1999 interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" During his 2016 campaign for the Republican nomination, Trump said his views had changed and that he was now opposed to abortion, but for three exceptions: In the case of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. Yet Trump's unfamiliarity with the language of abortion activism was clear, including when he offered a bungled response during a televised town hall and was forced to clarify his position on abortion three times in a single day. Asked, hypothetically, what would happen if abortion were outlawed, Trump said there would have to ""be some form of punishment"" for women who have them, prompting a backlash that managed to unite abortion rights activists and opponents, including organizers of the March for Life. Asked to clarify his position, Trump's campaign initially issued a statement saying he believed the issue should rest with state governments. He later issued a second statement that said doctors, not women, should be punished for illegal abortions. Critics, for their part, accuse Trump of using the march to try to distract from his impeachment trial in the Senate. Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called it ""an act of desperation, plain and simple."" Alexis McGill Johnson, acting president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, accused Trump of carrying out ""a full-out assault on our health and our rights."" Views of abortion have remained relatively stable over two decades of polling, and it's a minority of Americans who hold extreme opinions — that abortion should be legal or illegal in all cases. But polling does suggest a widening partisan gap on the question of support for abortion rights in all or most cases, along with some movement on both sides of the aisle further into their extreme positions.

413,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-12-05T09:00:15.727Z,"Canadian stats on impaired driving deaths incomplete, years out of date","Canada's statistics on impaired and distracted driving fatalities, as well as drowning deaths, are incomplete and years out of date because the BC Coroners Service has repeatedly failed to share its data with the agencies that compile the national numbers. A CBC News investigation has determined that the information gap, which in some cases stretches back almost a decade, has held up the publication of annual reports and caused safety organizations to guess at countrywide trends and put asterisks next to their findings. And it's creating headaches for advocates and policy-makers who want to know if laws and enforcement measures are working as they should. ""It's appalling,"" said Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada. ""We're almost [in] 2020 and we're still working off 2014 [numbers]. We've had historical events in this country, like the legalization of recreational cannabis, with the big issue and debate around driving and what effect it's going to have, and we've got nothing. Nothing."" The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA), an interprovincial body that deals with highway safety, traditionally releases its annual Alcohol and Drug Crash Problem report each January. Drawing on police, insurance, coroner and medical examiner data from across the country, it's the definitive source on what has gone wrong on the country's roads. But the last CCMTA report came out almost three years ago in January 2017. And it was based on 2014 data — or in the case of British Columbia, extrapolated 2010 numbers.  The Ottawa-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF), an independent non-profit that gathers and analyzes the data for the CCMTA report, says it has been having difficulty prying numbers out of the BC Coroners Service for years. ""We've been trying to get that data because it represents anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of the population,"" said Steve Brown, who oversees TIRF's national fatality database and co-authors the Alcohol and Drug Crash report. ""We're doing everything at our end. We've filled out all the research agreements and that type of thing."" Earlier this year, the BC Coroners Service finally provided its 2011 and 2012 figures. But the holdup continues for the province's more recent years; that's in contrast to other Canadian jurisdictions, which have all provided their road death numbers through at least 2016. ""You think, in the information age, that it would be easier to get data, but that's not always the case,"" said Brown. ""We're … just trying to be as patient as we can with this."" B.C.'s death disclosure problems have also affected an annual report on water fatalities across the country. This past summer, the Drowning Prevention Research Centre released its 2019 findings — based on 2016 data — noting that absence of definitive numbers from Canada's third most populous province. ""They weren't ready and we just made the call that says, better to have three territories and nine provinces with their data, and let B.C. catch up by next year,"" said Doug Ferguson, CEO of Drowning Prevention Research Centre. Ferguson said his centre was still able to glean partial B.C. drowning death information from police and media reports, but it's likely that they missed some cases. He worries that the incomplete report might hamper municipalities or other water safety agencies as they try to fine-tune and target their public awareness campaigns.  ""You're not flying blind, but you're using old data,"" said Ferguson. ""There is no other source as valid as a coroner's office."" Andy Watson, a spokesperson for the BC Coroners Service, attributes the delays to the surge in deaths caused by the opioid crisis and the declaration of a provincial public health emergency in April 2016. ""One of the challenges that we were faced with a couple of years ago, really, it was the illicit drug crisis was expanding, and hitting British Columbia, I think, disproportionately harder than other provinces,"" said Watson. ""It was a reprioritization of resources at the time."" But given that the timely sharing of B.C. data was a problem well before the spike in fentanyl and carfentanil overdose deaths, other issues appear to be at play. In a followup response, Watson allowed that the BC Coroners Service has been slowed by ""a myriad of factors,"" including privacy concerns, revamped research agreements, the creation of a new electronic data management system and turnover in staff. Regardless, the agency is promising to do better and says it will hand over its 2013 through 2017 road death information to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation at some point next year. ""The best I can tell you at this stage is that we are working on that and catching up on that now,"" said Watson. ""We recognize the importance of that data and that's why we're making it a priority at this stage."" For safety groups like MADD Canada, however, the promise rings hollow. Murie says his organization has been looking for alternative data sources so it can analyze trends and critique government policy without having to wait for the various federal and provincial agencies to get their act together. ""To be honest with you, in the last year or so, I have just kind of given up,"" he said. ""Because even if they were to put out data for tomorrow and it's [for] 2015, what does it tell us?"" It's all in sharp contrast to the coroner-based process in the United States, which produces updated national numbers each spring via the federally funded Fatality Analysis Reporting System. ""That's great that B.C. is going to get caught up,"" said Murie. ""But, you know, the Americans have already produced their 2018 data, and next year, in April, they'll do 2019. ""They can do trend data. We can't.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/death-data-information-gap-1.5384278,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fire-truck-stolen-winnipeg-arrest-1.5379840 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drunk-driving-twice-quebec-breathalyzer-for-life-1.5369145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/great-lakes-drownings-2019-1.5231362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-crisis-vancouver-election-1.5284444,N/A
414,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-22T23:59:26.096Z,"How virtual reality may dramatically change eye tests, research","A team at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax is looking at eye testing in a new way thanks to an experiment with virtual reality. The eye clinic works with patients ranging from infants to adults and depends on the subjective responses from patients to help with a diagnosis. That can make their work tricky, especially when small children are expected to undergo exams that can routinely run an hour long. Dr. Darren Oystreck, an orthopist at the hospital who also works with the health faculty at Dalhousie University, estimated his profession has used the same tests for six decades to check for disorders of binocular vision or eye alignment issues. ""You compare it to other areas of medicine where they've had amazing breakthroughs in technology in some of the things they can imagine now and the data they can collect is mind-boggling,"" he said. Oystreck uses equipment like flashlights, pictures and foggy goggles to conduct his work and keep the kids focused. Last year, his team decided it was time to look for new options. That's when they met Ryan Cameron, the CEO of Electric Puppets, a Halifax-based virtual reality company that specializes in children's programming. ""Everything [Oystreck] needed could be applied to many other areas, like brain injury research,"" he said. Cameron has adapted the old vision tests to a virtual reality program. For the team at the IWK eye clinic, the collaboration allows the eye doctors to alter settings and try a wider range of scenarios, all while recording the reaction of a patient's eyes. The hope is that for children in particular, it will lead to more accurate observations. ""They can calm down and relax and feel familiar with the environment quickly and then we can start to put them through the classic tests,"" said Oystreck. The program is being tested and studied at the hospital. The team needs to prove the results are just as accurate — if not more accurate — as the old tests, and they'll produce a peer-reviewed study. Steve Van Iderstine, a research associate at the IWK, said virtual reality systems weren't designed for medical use, but they have great applications for that. ""I'm hoping in a year from now we'll have good data to demonstrate that the virtual reality version of these tests has strong validity, then we'll be able to look forward to the more exciting environments that we can generate with the virtual reality,"" he said. Cameron said those environments, for example, could be a virtual circus where kids would have the impression they're playing a game, when in fact they're being tested. Van Iderstine said because virtual reality systems are commercially available, they're far cheaper than medical equipment. They also take up less space. He hopes headsets sized for small kids will soon be available. For Cameron and his company, this program is just the beginning. They have a patent pending on their work, and they're hoping that virtual reality could be used in the treatment of everything from physiotherapy to psychology.

Pete Fry says it's the first time the city has implemented participatory budgeting, and he's hoping there will be more of it in other neighbourhoods.  ""I'm very excited to see this project succeed,"" Fry said.  ""It's a really good opportunity for communities to come forward and say, 'Hey, this is how we'd like to see our community benefit.'"" Voters choose and rank up to four of 14 projects. The projects with the highest number of votes and that fall within the $100,000 budget will be implemented. Fry said money for the budget came from parking revenues.  Some of the projects include a chalk art block party, a pedestrian crossing and increased mental health services. Voting takes place between Jan. 25 and Feb. 4. People can take part online or in person. Results will be announced Feb. 8 and projects have to be implemented within 18 months.  Fry said participatory budgeting takes place in cities around the world, including Toronto and New York.  The city said it chose the West End to pilot the process because of its manageable size.  Kendal Fish, a volunteer with the project, says the process started last January when citizens submitted more than 1,700 ideas.  Volunteers then grouped those and whittled them down to the current choices, based on inclusivity, the project's impact, and feasibility.  ""It's been extremely interesting. We've been finding our way,"" Fish said, adding that volunteers hope to share what they've learned with other neighbourhoods. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/west-end-vancouver-participatory-budgeting-1.5440846,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/climate-strikes-impeach-o-meter-fixing-democracy-spoofing-downton-abbey-nxivm-whistleblower-more-1.5297400/voters-are-disillusioned-and-often-irrational-but-experts-say-a-democratic-reboot-could-help-change-that-1.5297425 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/kids-voted-on-how-to-spend-1m-on-hamilton-street-projects-1.3762867,N/A
416,Susan Bonner,2020-01-25T15:50:34.410Z,Holocaust survivor in famous Auschwitz liberation photo says rising anti-Semitism 'scares me',"Miriam Ziegler sees it as a call of duty: She's going back to a place of horror to honour those who did not make it out — and to remind the world what unchecked hate can do. On Jan. 27, the 84-year-old Canadian will stand alongside dozens of other Holocaust survivors from around the world as they gather in Poland to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. ""All the six million… I feel I have to honour them,"" said Ziegler. She was nine when the Russians liberated the camp, making Ziegler one of the youngest people to have survived Auschwitz. The number of survivors dwindles every year, which means this year's ceremony is likely to be the last major international gathering of its kind. More than 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Nazi regime made it the key killing ground for its plan to exterminate the Jewish people. It was surreal to meet Ziegler in her lovely condo in north Toronto. An elegant and proud mother and grandmother, she surrounds herself with family photos and mementoes of a life well-lived in Canada. She recounted the trauma and terror she endured as a child during the Second World War in Poland. It's painful to relive. For years, she didn't even tell her own children. And for years, Ziegler herself didn't know that she had appeared in one of the most famous and haunting photos from the end of the war. The image shows Ziegler standing among a group of children behind the wire at Auschwitz. Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on Jan. 27, 1945. The photo appeared in newspapers worldwide. The image is deceiving — the children don't look emaciated, like other concentration camp prisoners. That's because they are wearing several layers of clothing under their striped prison garb. The Germans had fled Auschwitz a few days earlier, and the kids had scavenged leftover clothing from the abandoned barracks in order to stay warm.  Ziegler, second from left, is wearing an old, oversized coat and holds out her arm.  At the time, the Russian soldiers were asking the children their names. In response, Ziegler showed them her tattoo: prisoner number A16891. ""In the camp, they didn't call you by name. They only knew you by number,"" said Ziegler. ""So I wanted to show the Russians."" Before they abandoned the camp, German soldiers led tens of thousands of prisoners on a march out, telling them they would be taken to safety. Ziegler and a cousin joined the line, but a great aunt intervened and told the children to stay behind. She told Ziegler, ""'No! You are not going. If you have to live, you can live here. You are not well enough to march.' And she dragged us [back] and she saved our lives, because [the soldiers] killed everybody ... On the march, they killed every single person."" That's how a group of hungry, sick, freezing children found themselves at the gates of Auschwitz to greet the Russians. Ziegler remembers the moment clearly. ""Of course — I remember everything since I was four years [old]."" Ziegler wants to put the memories that have tormented her to good use while she can. The Holocaust can be hard to comprehend, especially for a generation that has never known war. But she's been amazed at how young people respond. After speaking to a class of high school students, Ziegler was overwhelmed with thank-you notes explaining how her story had helped make the horror real for them. The students told her that reading a book about it was one thing, ""'but to meet a person that went through it and the way you told it... We never believed it before. Now we believe it.'"" Ziegler was four when she saw her first murder: Nazis shot and killed a buggy driver that her mother had hired to try to take Miriam to safety in the countryside, outside their hometown of Radom, Poland. Before that, she'd been a happy child in a large, wealthy extended family that owned several large clothing and general goods stores. But beginning in the late 1930s, Ziegler lived in hiding, sometimes with her parents, sometimes with strangers. She was hidden in farms, work camps or compounds. She was taking refuge in an attic with several people during one particularly gruesome Nazi raid. ""I heard them coming up the stairs. I hid myself under a pile of rubbish and clothes. I pushed myself underneath and covered myself. And they shot everybody in that attic... I was lucky. This was my first real escape from being killed."" In 1944, her family was taken to Auschwitz. She remembers the train trip, the crowded cattle cars filled with terrified people. When they arrived, she was separated from her parents. Tattooed. Shaved. And then sent to the showers.  She was eight years old. ""By that time, we knew already about the gas chambers. From the ghettos in the camps, we knew that this is what they were doing. They were killing everybody and we didn't think we would come out from the showers."" Ziegler lived a year in daily fear, but she survived. She would later learn her mother, grandmother and an aunt had also survived. But not her father. ""He was taken away. I never saw him again. He was put through the gas chamber."" In the final months of the war, the infamous gas chambers at Birkenau were shut down. But Ziegler says the medical experiments continued, and she did not escape that. She doesn't remember much beyond that she was taken to a room one day with instruments and people in white lab coats. And she remembers the pain. She knows it won't be easy to return to the scene of this trauma in the coming days. When she attended the 70th anniversary in 2015, she caught a glimpse of herself in a film clip taken on the day the camp was liberated. ""A ghost,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it. I didn't believe it was me."" What happened to Ziegler as a child was unfathomable to the woman watching. The 2015 trip took a physical toll on her that lasted months. She fell ill when she returned to Toronto. At the time, Ziegler was caring for her husband, Roman, another Holocaust survivor, who suffers from Alzheimer's.  The Auschwitz anniversary experience left her weaker, but Ziegler said she has no choice but to do it again. She sees hatred on the rise again in the world and wants to speak out. ""It scares me. And that's why I want as many people as I can to tell my story to. I wouldn't want anybody to go through what we went through, it doesn't matter what nation. And that's why I'm scared.""

417,Anonymous,2020-01-25T12:30:00.305Z,Pet dogs escaping over snow-covered fences in St. John's,"""We have two dogs in our backyard. Uh-oh! Two big dogs."" A woman's voice in a cellphone video, posted to the Facebook group NL Lost Pets Network. Two large, black dogs can be seen roaming a yard where the snow drifts are piled high against the fence. It's one of more than 50 posts about lost dogs since the big storm Jan. 17. The group is plastered with pictures and videos of dogs, lost and found. Many of the posts show dogs running through snow-covered streets, dodging traffic along the way.  In several of the posts, dog owners explain their pets escaped over a fence by climbing snow banks that built up during the storm. For dog experts, it's sad but far from surprising.  ""You know, when we get hit with the amount of snow that we have, it's really easy for the snow to drift up and pile up against the fences,"" said dog trainer Ken Reid, who calls himself ""Newfoundland's dog whisperer."" ""People let their dogs out, and the dogs walk right over the fence and go on walkabout. Not only that, with the amount of wind we've been having, fences get damaged, gates come down, gates come open, and what was typically a secure backyard becomes a fun zone for the dog."" It's a situation that's already led to tragedy for at least one family. The week before the storm, Matt Murphy came home from work, and let his dog Maggie out in the backyard. What he didn't realize was that a snow removal crew had blown snow over his fence and into the yard, piling up in just the wrong place. ""She found the opportunity to escape into our neighbours yard, and then she was able to get loose,"" said Murphy. ""I put a call out on social media for everyone to keep an eye out for her, she responds to Maggie, the area of town she was in. And then I found out that she had in fact been struck by a car, and by the time I found her at the vet clinic down on Topsail Road, she had already passed."" Murphy says the sudden loss was deeply painful for his entire family. ""It was terrible. My heart jumped up in my throat. It was obviously devastating, the loss of a family member. Very concerned how I was going to communicate this to my two young daughters."" In many of the posts on NL Lost Pets Network, comments indicate the escaped pets have made it home safely. Often, a person spotted the dog and was able to corral them, post a picture, and connect with the owners. But in many other posts, there seems to be no resolution and it's unclear if the missing dogs have been found. With the right training, Reid says, a dog will learn to stay in their own yard, fence or no fence. But for now, the best way to protect your pet is to keep an eye on them. ""Any time your dog goes out, go out with them. Make sure they have their IDs on them. That way, if they do get out, it's real easy to get them home.""

A doctor from Summerside had been seeing patients at a local long-term care facility in Wellington half a day a week, but in November the facility decided it needed that space for beds. The doctor decided to stop making the weekly trip, whether a new space was found or not. Earlier this month, the province said it had found a space but was still looking for a doctor. On Thursday, it announced a doctor would start weekly visits, this time for a full day. Health Minister James Aylward said the new service comes with a bonus for the Acadian region of the province.

419,Nicole Mortillaro,2020-01-24T18:45:12.658Z,Doomsday Clock moves ahead to 100 seconds to midnight,"In its annual announcement, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the Doomsday Clock ahead to 100 seconds to midnight. The clock was introduced in 1947 and is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to destroying civilization. Typically, the hands are moved forward or back depending on how vulnerable the world is. Midnight represents a catastrophe. While the hands of the clock typically move a minute at a time, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved it forward by 30 seconds in 2017 and 2018, stopping at two minutes to midnight. It remained unchanged in 2019. ""It is 100 seconds to midnight. We are now expressing how close the world is to catastrophe in seconds — not hours, or even minutes,"" said Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ""It is the closest to Doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Doomsday Clock. We now face a true emergency — an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error or further delay."" In making the announcement, Bronson said the clock needed to be recalibrated — which is why it was moved 20 seconds — due to new concerns not taken into account in the past, including climate change. The farthest the clock's hands have been from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, at the end of the Cold War.  ""What we called the new abnormal last year … now has become apparently an enduring reality,"" said Robert Rosner, chair of the bulletin's science and security board. In reaching their decision — which was made in November — the scientists said they took into account three concerning issues: nuclear weapons, climate change and cyber-based disinformation. ""As long as nuclear weapons remain in existence, it is inevitable that they will one day be used, whether by accident, miscalculation or design,"" said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, a group of world leaders working to promote human rights and other important world issues. Sivan Kartha, a member of the bulletin's science and security board and senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute, said the state of the world demands an emergency response, citing the record-breaking heat waves and floods in India, recent hurricanes and the wildfires that raged from the Arctic to Australia in 2019. ""If the Earth warms by what we tend to think of just a few degrees … we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization,"" said Kartha, who was also the author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Former California governor Jerry Brown, who is the bulletin's executive chair, gave a fiery speech. He said while he's not a scientist, he recognizes the importance of the symbolic clock and that it's the only way to let the world know the threats to civilization. ""We're on the Titanic ready to hit an iceberg,"" Brown said. ""But we have have an incredible opportunity to reverse.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/doomsday-clock-2020-1.5435940,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-2019-1.5427586,N/A

Go Public has been flooded with messages from some who say when it came time to deliver, the so-called Weight Loss Grants Program wouldn't pay out, or dragged customer claims out for months before cutting a cheque. During our investigation, we heard from dozens of dissatisfied customers unhappy with the program run by a private, for-profit company. Some thought, because of its name, it was a government-run program issuing ""grants."" The Weight Loss Grants Organization now has a notice on its website that the grants program ""has now concluded.""  ""It's good for the consumer,"" said Richel Prevost, of Calgary, who heard about the program on the radio two years ago. At the time, Prevost, 5'6"", was tipping the scales at over 200 pounds and desperate to lose weight.  She thought she'd found the solution — a grant program that would give her access to a high-end diet program then reimburse her for up to 80 per cent of the cost when she lost the weight. She was wrong.  ""I literally worked my butt off and I just don't feel like their end of the bargain is being held up,"" Prevost said. She signed up in September 2017 and paid $2,400 up front to the diet clinic the grants company recommended. She said she was told if she used Dalewood Health Clinic she'd get up to 80 per cent back in a grant, up to 20 per cent if she used a different one.  Prevost said she lost 50 pounds on her own through diet and exercise and reached her weight loss goal five months early. A year later, she is still trying to collect her grant.  ""It felt like they were moving the goalposts,"" Prevost said.""Every time that they asked for something different I complied."" Her grant was recently denied based on a rule that didn't exist when she lost the weight.  The Weight Loss Grants Organization told Go Public Prevost won't be getting her grant because she recorded her final weight five months early instead of on the exact deadline date. That rule was introduced in April, long after Prevost finished the program and submitted her paperwork. ""You can't change the rules like that in the middle and deny me my claim based on something that you implemented after the fact,"" Prevost said.  Jenn Granger from Calgary paid Dalewood $2,100, lost weight, and met all the requirements in October. Her grant was also denied based on the rule that kicked in last month. ""I'm not sure how we would possibly be able to follow such a rule when I submitted [for the grant] six months before they made the change,"" Granger wrote Go Public in an email. The Weight Loss Grants Organization didn't respond when Go Public asked how a new rule can apply to old cases. David Stein, who describes himself as the adjudicator at the Weight Loss Grants Organization, said Granger's grant was denied because the letter she submitted from the medical clinic to prove her weight loss ""does not appear to be legitimate.""  Go Public spoke with some people who say they did get their grants. The Weight Loss Grants Organization's website has a long list of thank-you letters from participants who say the program helped them lose weight.  Those letters are a requirement before the company will even consider paying out a grant.  Larry Smith said he wrote a thank-you letter and last August and received an email saying his $1,920 grant was approved but after months passed with no payout, Smith contacted Go Public. Stein said Smith hasn't received a cheque because he failed to get a required letter from his doctor. No one from the company told Smith. The Better Business Bureau of Central Ontario has given the Weight Loss Grants Organization an ""F"" and Dalewood a ""D"" rating due to the high number of customer complaints. ""Consumers feel like they've achieved the requirements of the grants but for what might be a technical reason, they're not getting the grant at the end,"" said spokesperson Patrick McKeen. Dalewood is now in the process of changing its name to Trillium Weight Loss. It turns out Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are connected. Go Public found the two companies shared an address for years and have a senior manager who works for both companies. In emails and letters to clients, George Scodras refers to himself as the director of operations of Dalewood and of the Weight Loss Grants Program. He was also listed as director of operations for Dalewood on its website, until Go Public started asking questions about his connection to both companies.  All references to Scodras have since been removed from the Dalewood website, while the Trillium website lists him as a ""managing consultant.""  We asked the Weight Loss Grants Organization how much it has paid out in grants since the program started in 2015, and why so many people have complained about not getting money they thought they were due.  ""The total number of grants paid out as of April 30th, 2019, is $733,552.71 (according to info given to me),"" Dalewood spokesperson Marissa Mayles wrote in an email to Go Public. That number can't be verified, but Go Public did speak with other former customers who say they got their full grants after using Dalewood. Clients say they weren't told about any connections between the Weight Loss Grants Program and Dalewood when they signed up. In an email to Go Public, Mayles said, ""we do not feel that there is a conflict of interest … Nobody is obligated to sign up with Dalewood and they can go wherever they like to lose their weight."" Mayles didn't give her exact title, but said she works in the finance and administration departments at Dalewood.  She is also the wife of the company's founder, Darren Morgenstern, who also founded Ashley Madison, the adulterous dating site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Morgenstern sold Ashley Madison in 2007.  Mayles said Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are not connected but, ""the owners are all connected and know each other well and the relationships predate either business."" As for Scodras, she said he's not an employee of either Dalewood or the Weight Loss Grants Organization but ""a temporary consultant ... an impartial disinterested party that is acting on behalf of all parties, including grant applicants.""  Stein said the Weight Loss Grants Organization will continue to honour ""legitimate grant requests,"" even though the program has been shut down. ""There have been too many problems which began for us late last year when we had to start enforcing our rules and having zero tolerance for improper documents, but we had no choice as there were far too many bogus grant claims,"" he told Go Public.

421,Aaron Saltzman,2020-01-25T15:18:48.094Z,Elite talent: The private school education of NHL All-Stars,"Of the 37 North American players named to this year's NHL All-Star game or filling in as replacements, 15 — or 40 per cent —  attended private school. It's a statistic that reinforces the notion that hockey, particularly at its very highest levels, is increasingly a sport not just for those who can afford it, but for those in the highest tax brackets. Some attended athletic academies. The Oilers' Connor McDavid attended Premier Elite Athletes' Collegiate, a now-defunct private school in the Toronto area with an annual tuition that ranged from $15,500 to $27,000. The Maple Leafs' Mitch Marner went to The Hill Academy in Vaughan, Ont., (where Prep Hockey tuition is currently $13,000) and later Blyth Academy (where tuition is $15,995). Carolina's Dougie Hamilton, who was named to the Metropolitan Division team but is injured, and St Louis goalie Jordan Binnington went to Crestwood, a private day school in Toronto, which currently costs $28,500 per year.  Tuition was even higher among some American players. Chicago's Patrick Kane went to Detroit Country Day School, where tuition is $32,200 US. Max Pacioretty of the Las Vegas Golden Knights went to The Taft School, a prestigious private academy in Watertown, Conn., where day school tuition is $46,500 US and boarding runs to $62,500 US. All the private schools offer scholarships and some sort of financial aid to those who qualify. CBC News was not able to determine if any of the NHL All-Stars who attended the schools received scholarships or financial aid. But the number of private school alumni is astounding, considering the chances of any young hockey player having a steady — non-All-Star — career in the NHL are just .02 per cent, according to an oft-quoted study. And it may be the starkest evidence yet of what some say is a growing socioeconomic exclusion in hockey due to skyrocketing costs. ""For generations — and I don't think that's overstating it — generations we've been talking about the cost of the game,"" says Sean Fitz-Gerald, author of Before the Lights Go Out: A Season Inside a Game on the Brink. Fitz-Gerald's book suggests the expense of playing hockey now has the sport approaching a state of crisis, and that expense runs far beyond $300 sticks and $1,200 skates. ""It's power skating lessons, skills, development lessons and skating on treadmills. It's private coaching. It's all of these things and they start from the age of four. Sometimes I bet you you can go out and find one under the age of four,"" says Fitz-Gerald. Parents can pay between $10,000 and $15,000 per year or more for their children to play in minor hockey's highest level, AAA. But as Fitz-Gerald notes, those are just capital costs. ""It's [also] the soft costs, the costs you don't necessarily think of,"" he says. ""Competitive tournaments now start on Fridays. Are you able to get that Friday off of work to go? Your child might have after school skating on a Wednesday or practice before school on a Thursday. Do you have the flexibility in your job to be able to accommodate that?"" All of that has the effect of winnowing down potential players not just economically but also geographically. Fitz-Gerald cites a series of 2016 articles by Teri Pecoskie at the Hamilton Spectator. The series looked at players in the Ontario Hockey League (Major Junior A) and found 80 per cent came from neighbourhoods with median family incomes above the Ontario average of $80,987. Roughly 15 per cent of the players came from neighbourhoods with median family incomes at least 50 per cent higher than average. And the vast majority of players also came from urban areas, which just happen to be where the expensive extra-curricular hockey training and facilities are often located. It's a far cry from the days when NHL legends like Gordie Howe honed their game on used skates on frozen prairie ponds. Wayne Gretzky, whose father worked as a telephone repairman, addressed the differences in an interview on The National in 2016. ""Do you think your parents would have been able to support you through hockey in today's world?"" asked Peter Mansbridge. ""Probably not,"" said Gretzky. WATCH | Peter Mansbridge interviews Wayne Gretzky The possibility that the next Great One might never become great due to lack of financial resources is very real, says Fitz-Gerald. ""Those [less well-off, small town] children statistically don't make it to the NHL anymore. Because today, statistically speaking, you have to be from a well-to-do part of an urban area,"" he says. Overall participation rates in hockey dropped for five straight years from 634,892 in 2013/14 to 626,090 in 2017/18. But the number of registered players in 2018/19 leapt back up to 643,958, thanks a huge jump in female players. Hockey Canada is well aware of the economic constraints in the sport. ""When it comes to the cost of hockey, I think there's no doubt with hockey, just like all sports, as you get to the higher levels and more competitive levels, that cost does go up,"" says Corey McNabb, Hockey Canada's director of player development. McNabb says Hockey Canada has several programs designed to make the game more accessible financially. The First Shift program offers full equipment and six on ice sessions for $200 as a way of introducing new players to the game. There are also 150 Hockey Canada Skills Academy programs across the country that operate with local schools. They allow kids to get on the ice up to four times per week at a cost of about $750 per year. At the same time, McNabb attributes some of the soaring costs of the sport to parents spending far more than required. ""I think parents need to sometimes take a step back and really look at how much is too much,"" he says. ""You don't need to be going to six hockey schools in the summer and being on the ice 12 months a year. I think that's one of the things that is a little bit of a misperception in the game right now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/nhl-allstar-leafs-habs-canucks-sens-oilers-jets-flames-private-school-education-hockey-1.5437356,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-oct-2-2019-1.5304832/adults-can-ruin-anything-kids-hockey-is-facing-a-crisis-in-canada-says-author-1.5304835 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/kids-multiple-sports-1.4726140 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/sports-participation-canada-kids-1.3573955,N/A

423,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-05T10:30:00.081Z,NB Power spent more than $178K US on Florida lab this year,"NB Power has spent more than $178,000 US this year to run a lab in Florida at the home of Joi Scientific, a company that claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen. But the lab may not be open for much longer, as questions swirl about whether Joi Scientific's technology works as previously described. NB Power spent $178,413 US (about $237,325 Cdn) on costs associated with the lab, according to records obtained by CBC through access to information. The records capture costs between February, when NB Power opened the lab, up to Oct. 16, 2019. The biggest expense in running the Florida lab has been the $42,372 US for standard lab equipment, followed by  $38,694 US for support staff. The records don't specify how many people were considered support staff or how many people may have been brought in to work in the lab. Other costs included instrumentation, H2 specific equipment, a work station and rent and utilities at the facility, located at the Space Life Sciences Lab at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., where Joi Scientific is headquartered. Two former Joi Scientific employees interviewed by CBC News have raised questions about Joi's technology, saying it doesn't work as previously described. Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland has also said there's no proof Joi's technology is viable. Earlier this month, Holland said the NB Power lab in Florida will continue to stay open until the end of 2019, as a final test is underway to determine the technology's viability. ""Once [the test is] completed, either you send me somebody from MIT who says, 'Eureka!' or it didn't deliver the results and then we wrap things up,"" Holland said on CBC New Brunswick's Political Panel in November. A spokesperson for Joi Scientific did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday before deadline. Last month, Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, acknowledged the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them. Her emailed statement didn't elaborate on those delays or challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement from November said. NB Power spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology, with the help of the Regional Development Corporation. NB Power planned to keep the Florida lab operating ""until we can make a decision whether we can go forward or not,"" NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas told CBC News last month. He said the utility was doing that to ensure it could recoup some of the investment it made in Joi's technology. But the utility hasn't budgeted any money for its Florida lab in the 2020-21 fiscal year, according to documents the utility filed with the Energy and Utilities Board on Tuesday. ""NB Power is obligated to make payments related to the lab space and related equipment until the end of January 2020,"" the documents say. ""The payment for January 2020 is US$16,717. There are no other continuing obligations. NB Power will maintain the licensing rights should there be no further testing or funding by NB Power."" After NB Power's latest rate application, New Brunswick's public intervener, Heather Black, asked the utility to provide Joi Scientific's ""most recent evaluation of the technology and its potential economic viability."" But in its response, NB Power said it couldn't answer those questions ""due to strict confidentiality requirements."" In response to a question from Black about whether NB Power has decided to ""pull the plug"" on the initiative, NB Power said Joi's ""technology is producing hydrogen from seawater,"" but the utility didn't provide further details. ""Additional testing is scheduled in the December time frame which will determine future direction,"" NB Power wrote in its filing. In a separate filing, the EUB asked the utility whether outside experts were asked to help evaluate the investment in Joi Scientific. ""With respect to the Joi Scientific initiative, NB Power had access to third party validation testing,"" NB Power wrote in response. ""NB Power also engaged its own third party to conduct testing."" The utility has never identified the third party that may have validated the testing and hasn't released copies of the those tests, citing a confidentiality agreement signed with Joi Scientific. Both the public intervener and NB Power declined requests for interviews about the utility's EUB filings. Do you have a tip about this story?

425,Patrick Twagirayezu,2020-01-19T09:00:00.675Z,'It is not your duty to be average': Here is why we celebrate Lincoln Alexander's legacy,"This column is an opinion by Patrick Twagirayezu, a recent graduate (Magna Cum Laude) of the University of Ottawa's Faculty of Law. He works as an articling student in labour and employment law at Emond Harnden LLP, as well as with numerous organizations in the Ottawa community on issues relating to youth poverty and civic engagement. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Canadians celebrate Lincoln Alexander Day on Jan. 21, and there is a lot of value in revisiting the indelible mark this remarkable man has left on the country. I first heard of Lincoln Alexander while working on a project in elementary school. At the time, I didn't have the maturity to comprehend his important role in Canada's history, but one thing did register – like me, and many of my friends, he was the son of immigrants. And like many immigrants, Alexander's parents made unimaginable sacrifices so that he could have a better future. Later on during my teenage years, his journey acted as a blueprint. By working hard, pursuing an education, and giving back to the community, he showed how one can honour one's parents' desire to see their child succeed. As Alexander once wrote, ""It is not your duty to be average. It is your duty to set a higher example for others to follow.""  Lincoln Alexander was born on Jan. 21, 1922, to West Indian immigrants living in Toronto. His father was a railway porter and his mother a maid. In a memoir entitled Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy, Alexander recounted the importance his parents placed on education as a good means to building a better life.  Not only did he heed his parents' words, he would do so with an unwavering commitment to excellence. After serving in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War, he became the first member of his family to attend university, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from McMaster University. Thereafter, he attended Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1953.  In 1968 he became the first black member of Parliament, and in 1979, the first black federal cabinet minister. After leaving federal politics, he became the first black Chair of the Worker's Compensation Board in 1980.  Alexander was appointed as the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario in 1985. At the time, no other visible minority in Canada had served in a position of that nature. He would later go on to serve an unprecedented five terms as Chancellor of the University of Guelph from 1991 to 2007. WATCH | The National's tribute to Lincoln Alexander on the day he passed away, Oct. 12, 2012: The many community projects that I've had the chance to work on have galvanized me to share the power of Alexander's example. While assisting in after-school programs in low-income neighbourhoods, I met a number of young people who, like me at their age, had developed a certain level of cynicism because of their circumstances. I would often invoke Alexander when speaking to them, and explain how he inspired me. I emphasized that Alexander did not allow himself to be defined by his circumstances, and that because of his example, my friends and I believed at an early age that we did not have to be defined by ours.  Such is Alexander's impact on the lives of young black men coming from environments in which positive role models are not always easily accessible. These environments often create a sense of powerlessness in the face of difficult socioeconomic forces, a feeling that can lead to poor decision-making. The narrative is a familiar one – young men from low-income neighbourhoods being shepherded along the wrong path as a result of their circumstances. Without basic structures for support, it can be difficult to imagine a better future for oneself; and yet, Alexander's life illustrates that there can be agency in facing these challenges. Gallery | Canadians reminisce about Lincoln Alexander after his passing in October 2012: Alexander's inspirational life should not be limited to its impact on black Canadians. Rather, his legacy stands for the broader proposition that Canada is a country in which many things are possible through hard work and perseverance.  In my first summer job as a university student, I had the opportunity to work as a tour guide on Parliament Hill. I can recall one particular tour I gave that included a family of new immigrants. They approached me afterwards to ask questions, and our conversation naturally led to Alexander and his role in Canadian history. To share his story inside the halls of Parliament remains to this day one of my most cherished memories.  While working to help new immigrants adapt to Canada by connecting them to volunteering opportunities, the discussions I've had with them at times revealed a certain anxiety about what type of future their children might have in this strange land. In these moments, I would talk about Alexander and his parents to explain that, despite their difficulties, this is a country in which their kids can ultimately succeed. Alexander's tireless commitment serves as a lesson that optimism should always be the mantra of those seeking to do their part in building a better Canada. However, he also understood that civic excellence is not an exercise in blind praise, but rather a continuous exercise in trying to improve our country by acknowledging its shortcomings. As he once said, ""Canada [is] the greatest country in the world, but it isn't perfect."" In many ways, Alexander exemplifies the brave people that Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of when he alluded to those who ""work while others sleep, who dare while others fly."" Lincoln Alexander Day is a reminder to all Canadians to commit ourselves to setting a high example for others to follow.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-lincoln-alexander-day-1.5426137,[],N/A
426,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-26T18:49:14.806Z,"2020 Grammy Awards: The Canadians, the contenders and the controversy","With Canadian stars Drake and Shawn Mendes among the nominees, breakout artists Lizzo and Billie Eilish considered top contenders and controversy looming behind the scenes, this year's Grammy Awards are already shaping up to be must-watch TV. Here's what you need to know about this year's big night in music. Truth Hurts singer Lizzo leads this year's nominations, with eight, including best new artist and record of the year. Her album Cuz I Love You is up for the coveted album of the year prize. Lizzo, 31, has been working in the industry for years but only recently captivated mainstream audiences with her body positivity and empowerment anthems, unfiltered social media commentary and classical flute playing. In fact, Truth Hurts was originally released in 2017 but didn't get any traction on the charts. It was re-released in 2019 and added as a bonus track to Cuz I Love You after gaining popularity on the short-form video app Tik-Tok. The catchy tune was further bolstered when it was featured in a pivotal breakup scene of the Netflix romantic comedy Someone Great. ""Lizzo, I work with her and it's just such an amazing story,"" Atlantic Records executive Juliette Jones told CBC News in Los Angeles. ""She's been working so hard and I think it's so cool that this black girl who plays the flute has become a pop star."" Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X are close behind, with six nominations each. Like Lizzo, Eilish scored nominations in the top four categories (best new artist, song of the year, record of the year and album of the year). At age 18 — she was 17 when the nominations came out— Eilish is the youngest artist in Grammy history to do so. Lil Nas X, 20, will compete against both women for best new artist as well as album and record of the year for Old Town Road, featuring a collaboration with country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The three artists are among those expected to perform as well. Eilish and Lizzo are leading the charge against another all-too-common facet of the music industry: judgment over a woman's physical appearance. Both have eschewed industry stereotypes in favour of staying true to themselves. Eilish refuses to conform to a particular pop star look and has been called the voice of her generation as much for her music as for her defiance of convention. Lizzo, who celebrates being black and having a curvy body, has developed a significant social media following and fan base for her refreshing take on beauty and image. But her outlook has also invited critics to take aim. Fitness enthusiast Jillian Michaels criticized Lizzo's size in a recent Buzzfeed interview, saying: ""It isn't gonna be awesome if she gets diabetes."" Michaels, known for her appearances on the weight-loss reality series The Biggest Loser, faced backlash for the comment and later said she regretted involving the pop star in her discussion. Watch as female artists take centre stage:  Lizzo, who stepped away from Twitter due to persistent negativity, told Rolling Stone in a feature released this week that people just have to get used to her. Because she's not going anywhere. ""That's not new — for her to feel good about herself and be comfortable in her own skin,"" Jones said. ""I love her response to it all."" Another musician pushing against double-standards in the industry is Toronto-born Jessie Reyez. Reyez, who says, ""I still deal with people that are trying to tell me what to wear,"" is a first-time nominee in the category of urban contemporary album for Being Human in Public. ""Through my experience, through my growth, through thickening my skin, through knowing how to handle hate with a smile, through learning all those things, I feel like that's a positive change that I've been able to see in the last few years,"" Reyez said about navigating the music business while attending soundcheck for a performance at L.A.'s iconic Troubadour club Wednesday. Watch Reyez talk about her Grammy nomination: Drake, Shawn Mendes, Michael Bublé, and Daniel Caesar are among the other high-profile Canadian nominees. A number of other canucks are vying for hardware as well, including central Alberta's Northern Cree, based in Maskwacis, Alta., for best regional roots album When It's Cold – Cree Round Dance Songs. ""We want to show all the youth back home ... that you don't need to be somebody else,"" said group member Joel Wood. ""You can be proud of who you are."" London, Ont.-based Dan Brodbeck, who's engineering and writing on The Cranberries' final work, In The End, earned a nod for best rock album. The Irish band's lead singer, Dolores O'Riordan, died in 2018 at age 46. Despite the alternative rock group's massive success in the 1990s with hits such as Linger, Dreams and Zombie, The Cranberries have never been nominated for a Grammy until this year. ""It means a bit more to me because it's their first nomination and she's not with us anymore,"" Brodbeck said about O'Riordan while attending a pre-Grammy event held by SOCAN celebrating Canadian nominees in Los Angeles. ""And we were very close friends."" Despite the shining talent, there's a cloud hanging over the Grammys after its CEO was ousted from her position less than two weeks before the ceremony.  Deborah Dugan was hired last May by the Recording Academy, the non-profit which oversees the awards and which has been facing ongoing criticism for a lack of diversity and inclusion. She alleges she was put on leave after reporting sexual harassment as well as conflicts of interest in the nomination process. Dugan filed a discrimination complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission this week. People in the industry recognize the seriousness of the allegations but hope they won't take the spotlight away from nominees. ""This is real stuff we're talking about and we have to get to it,"" said Yvette Noel Schure, head of Schure Media Group and Beyoncé's publicist, at a red carpet event Thursday in Hollywood. ""But just for Sunday I want us to focus on the artists that so deserve to be celebrated. And then come Monday, let's get back to what's really going on."" The Grammy Awards, hosted by Alicia Keys, will be broadcast live at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on Sunday, Jan. 26 from Los Angeles, Calif. CBC News will be on the red carpet.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammy-awards-2020-1.5440687,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/tuesday-april-16-2019-the-cranberries-jessica-chiccehitto-hindman-and-more-1.5098659/the-cranberries-on-their-final-album-and-life-after-dolores-o-riordan-1.5098671 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/2020-grammy-nominations-1.5365980 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grammys-cdn-nominees-1.5366102,N/A
427,Erica Johnson,2019-05-27T19:20:39.139Z,Man with severe asthma says new police powers unfair for people unable to do breath test,"LATEST UPDATE | After this story was published, the RCMP sent another statement to Go Public, saying the force's national impaired driving policy is based on the Criminal Code. The available options to screen for impaired drivers are legislated by Parliament, it said, and police are not permitted to use alternatives. If a driver feels they had a lawful excuse for failing to comply with an impairment-screening test, ""they are encouraged to speak with legal counsel and consider bringing their concerns before the courts,"" the statement said. A B.C. man with severe breathing issues who recently had his car impounded and driver's licence suspended — twice — says new rules that allow police across the country to pull over any vehicle and force the driver to take a breath test are causing undue hardship for people who cannot blow into a breathalyzer. Jimmy Forster, 63, suffers from severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and takes daily medications to help him breathe. He lives in the small village of Chase — population 2,300 — in the B.C. Interior. In recent months, Chase RCMP have pulled Forster over twice and charged him with failing to provide a breath sample, after he was unable to blow hard enough into a breathalyzer device to register a reading. ""I'm just totally stressed right now,"" says Forster, who has an audible wheeze when he speaks and slightly slurred speech due to a childhood brain injury that also left him with a limp. He's on a disability pension, but is now on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get his car out of impound and his driver's licence reinstated, and says he has no idea how he will pay. There are almost 200,000 Canadians living with severe asthma and more than two million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the Canadian Lung Association. Thousands of others have disabilities — such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis caused by stroke — that may make them unable to perform a breath test, causing concern for human rights advocates. ""I think it's important that the police consider human rights principles,"" says Dylan Mazur, a lawyer with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, ""including the duty to accommodate people with disabilities who can't provide a roadside test."" A spokesperson with the RCMP's national headquarters, Sgt. Marie Damian, did not respond when Go Public asked whether a specific policy exists to provide an alternative for people with disabilities who can't do a breathalyzer test. In an email she wrote, ""The determination as to whether the subject was 'able and unwilling' or 'legitimately unable' to provide a sample will be up to the investigating officer."" ""The actual volume and force of breath required for a sample is not significant."" Forster says his first police run-in occurred when he was returning from a trip to the post office on the afternoon of Feb. 14, and an RCMP officer pulled him over and accused him of not wearing a seatbelt. Forster says he was belted in. The officer decided to employ the alcohol screening powers that came into effect on Dec. 18, 2018, granting police the right to demand a breath sample from any driver they pull over. In the past, police couldn't require a roadside breath test unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a driver had consumed alcohol. In B.C., any driver who refuses — or, like Forster, fails to provide a breath sample — faces an immediate roadside prohibition (IRP), where their licence is suspended and their vehicle towed, even though there is no evidence of any alcohol consumption. In other provinces, drivers face a potential criminal charge for refusing to blow. Forster says he blew into the breathalyzer device, but couldn't get a reading. He says he explained that he has severe asthma, but the officer didn't believe him. ""He just said, 'Blow harder! Blow harder!'"" says Forster, who says he tried about a dozen times to breathe deeply into the device, and thought he was going to fall over because he was getting dizzy. The RCMP officer issued an IRP, despite a lack of any evidence that Forster was impaired. ""I just couldn't believe it,"" says Forster, whose doctor told Go Public his patient has no history of a drinking problem.   Forster appealed to an adjudicator, submitting his medical records. The adjudicator dismissed the case and Forster got his licence back and his car out of impound, without financial penalty. A few weeks later, on the morning of March 20, police pulled Forster over again, just after he'd gone for a haircut and filled up his car at a gas station. ""He [the officer] didn't ask me any questions,"" says Forster. ""He just brought the breathalyzer and I blew five to six times and had the same thing happen again."" This time, Forster says, he asked the officer if he could take a blood test instead. ""He totally ignored me,"" says Forster. ""Just in one ear, out the other."" Once again, police impounded Forster's car and suspended his licence for 90 days. When he appealed a second time, an adjudicator said he believed police notes that said Forster was ""putting on a show"" to make it look as though he was unable to provide a breath sample. The notes do not claim that Forster appeared to have been drinking, smelled of alcohol, or was driving poorly. ""I was so choked,"" says Forster, who faces about $1,400 in fees to get his car released from impound and his licence back next month. He has already spent $200 each time he appealed the IRPs. Forster lives with his cousin Sandy Johnston, who relies on him to drive her places since having a stroke 10 years ago. ""I'm totally dependent on Jimmy,"" she says. ""After his car got taken the second time, he was just in tears. And then I broke into tears, too. And we were crying together."" A leading researcher on lung disease says assessing whether or not someone's lung function is adequate to obtain a breathalyzer reading is not something that can be easily done in the field. ""The concern I have is that there likely are people that have lung function that's so low that they can't do the tests,"" says Dr. Christopher Carlsten, division head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of the Occupational Lung Disease Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. He says viral infections and other stressors, such as being pulled over by police, can affect the breathing capacity of someone with compromised lungs. Go Public has tracked down other cases in B.C. — as well as in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick — in which people with disabilities say they struggled to provide a breathalyzer test. One of the more prominent cases has prompted a charter challenge against mandatory alcohol screening. Norma McLeod, 76, of Victoria, was pulled over on Feb. 14, and says she was unable to provide a breath sample due to a chronic lung condition and an implant in the roof of her mouth that's a result of cancer. Police towed her car and suspended her licence. ""It's happening more frequently now that the federal government has introduced the provision which permits mandatory alcohol screening based on absolutely no suspicion of alcohol consumption,"" says criminal lawyer Jennifer Teryn, part of the legal team representing McLeod. ""If someone's unable to provide a sample upon demand, it's my position that the police should have to get engaged in some minor investigation to find out for themselves whether there's a legitimate reason for that or not,"" says Teryn. Mazur says he also expects police to ask people whether they have a disability preventing them from complying with a roadside breath test demand. ""I've heard this from people with disabilities who have mobility issues or who have speech issues — that they can be perceived as intoxicated,"" says Mazur. ""What the RCMP has to do is look at their policies, and look at whether there are provisions of reasonable accommodation based on disability."" Go Public asked Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s minister of public safety and solicitor general, about the difficulties some people with disabilities have  providing breath tests. In a statement, Farnworth wrote, ""I plan to raise these concerns with my federal counterparts. In addition, I've asked my staff to research whether there are any amendments that could be made to the immediate roadside prohibition appeal process in these situations, including options to reduce any financial barriers for requesting a review."" His ministry said that of 2,558 IRP reviews conducted last year, 491 were dismissed. The office could not determine how many of the cases were dismissed due to disability or medical issues. Jimmy Forster is due to get his driver's licence back on June 20, but says he's anxious police will keep pulling him over. ""I can't afford it, I'm on disability,"" says Forster.

Me and my brother were really close,"" said Sarah Wall on Friday morning. ""He is my role model. He really is. My parents, they're very upset about it."" Wall said she anticipates they'll find her brother alive, whether it takes another day, or another week. The family put a call out on Facebook for volunteer searchers, and was met with an overwhelming response. Offers of help came from as far away as the United States. Volunteers met at 379 Roaches Line on Thursday morning, and roughly 40 gathered again at 8:30 a.m. Friday before heading out on snowshoes and snowmobiles. They were given snowshoes, an emergency blanket, food and a whistle in case Wall is found or an emergency arises. ""There's a lot of support coming from the community and we're all so grateful for everything,"" Sarah Wall said. Wayne Wall, Josh Wall's father, said his son deals with anxiety and was not feeling well last Friday morning before he ventured out in the blizzard.  The last contact with Josh Wall was a text message to his friend saying he was lost and his phone battery was low.   Searchers are being supported by a family well-versed with searching for a missing loved one.  Lisa Lake, mother of 24-year-old Cortney Lake, was on the ground Friday morning and her sister put out a plea to help the Wall family's search on Thursday night.  ""I felt I had to come out and support, but it's bringing back flashbacks. But I don't regret coming out, not one bit, and I'll be out again,"" Lisa Lake said. Police believe Cortney Lake was killed by her ex-boyfriend in 2017, but her remains have never been found. Her family has led tireless searches in the years since — lending a hand with the search for Trevor Hamlyn as well. Hamlyn, who was 33 years old when he was last seen in his Paradise home in 2018, has also never been found.  Read more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/volunteers-search-josh-wall-1.5438949,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/storm-missing-newfoundland-1.5431916,N/A
429,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:39:54.065Z,National public health data finds vaccine rates for kids falls short,"New data suggests vaccination rates among Canadian children are falling short. The Public Health Agency of Canada says none of the country's national vaccination goals were met in any of the age groups surveyed in 2017. Dr. Theresa Tam says that means more kids need their shots if we're going to reach sufficient community immunity to prevent disease and outbreaks. While at least 95 per cent of two-year-olds should ideally be covered, researchers found just 75.8 per cent received the multidose vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island were the only provinces to cover more than 80 per cent, while Manitoba and Nunavut were below 70 per cent. Adult immunization: Are you up to date?

Among seven-year-olds, only girls vaccinated for rubella met the 95-per cent coverage goal at 95.8 per cent, versus 93.8 per cent for boys. That vaccine only requires one dose, compared to two doses for measles and mumps where the national rate was 87 per cent and 86.4 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, none of the three routine vaccines for adolescents met the national coverage goal of 90 per cent, although the Tdap booster came close at 89.3 per cent. Kids aged 14 and 17 get up to three routine vaccinations in school-based programs, depending on the jurisdiction, including for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). The Public Health Agency of Canada routinely monitors childhood vaccination rates through the childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey, which began in 1994 and has been conducted approximately every two years. Experts set vaccination goals in 2017, with the aim of reaching them by 2025. Although the numbers fall short of ideal, Tuesday's study said vaccination coverage among two- and seven-year-olds have not changed much in recent years. The agency said an upcoming report will look at knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Canadian parents regarding vaccination. In other data, the survey found polio coverage for two-year-olds higher at 90.7 per cent, but Newfoundland and Labrador was the only province to reach the 95 per cent goal, at 96.9 per cent. Other provinces and territories came close — including P.E.I. at 93.9 per cent, Nova Scotia at 93.5 per cent and the Yukon at 93.7 per cent. Coverage was lowest in British Columbia at 87.5 per cent, Manitoba at 85.6 per cent and Nunavut at 82.1 per cent. Measles coverage for two-year-olds was 90.2 per cent but when doses administered to those under the recommended 12 months were excluded, coverage dropped to 87.6 per cent. The lowest coverage for seven-year-olds involved five doses or more for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, where only 80.5 per cent of kids were covered. In 14-year-olds, HPV coverage in girls increased to 83 per cent from 74.6 per cent, likely due to increased availability and awareness of this relatively new vaccine, said the study.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-vaccine-kids-1.5436161,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-infants-study-toronto-1.5367821,N/A

Phase one was purchasing the building. Phase two is going to be the toughest part of the process, according to Belland, because they'll have to deal with hazardous materials like asbestos and address structural issues in the nearly 70-year-old building.  Once those concerns have been addressed, Belland and his partners Spencer Kerr and Casey Wright are planning some major renovations to the theatre.  Their vision is to mimic the original art deco interior, with a coffered ceiling, wooden wainscotting, wall sconces, velvet drapes and a hardwood dance floor. Belland estimates the project will cost about $1.2 million, which the trio are working to raise from investors and funding agencies. All three of them have construction experience; Belland has worked in construction for more than 20 years, Wright and Kerr own a local roofing company and Kerr is a journeyman plumber, so they feel fit for the task.  As for running a theatre, Belland's 30 years of involvement in the Cranbrook arts scene, including concert promotion, makes him confident it will work out.  Belland hopes to have the theatre up and running for July 1, 2021, but because he is familiar with the way construction projects often work out, he's not rigid with the completion date.  ""As anybody knows, taking on projects like this, things flex and the schedule goes into flux,"" he said.  Once it's done, he wants it to be open for use as a venue for dance recitals, concerts, lectures, film screenings and more.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/armond-theatre-cranbrook-1.5438575,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/kamloops-arts-centre-referendum-1.5349399 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-heritage-society-seeks-city-council-help-to-revive-part-of-historic-capitol-movie-theatre-1.5284440 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/construction-site-of-former-canada-post-building-1.5363928,N/A

A string of break-and-enters in the town over the past three years coincides with the arrival of the man, who most residents of Cottrell's Cove believe is the perpetrator. ""Cabin owners and homeowners have come to our door and said we have to do something,"" said Fran Boone, a member of the local service district committee.  She said some property owners have proposed organizing a petition, and the Local service district is allowing the organizers to use the local fire hall.  The small town of less than 150 permanent residents has experienced more than two dozen break-ins over the past three years.  The nearest police station is in Grand Falls-Windsor, about 1½ hours away. Boone said while the RCMP are doing their job and have investigated the offences, the residents feel the justice system is not following through. ""They can charge him and when it goes to court he just walks away with it,"" Boone said. ""The justice system is failing us. He was in court the last year or so. He has been out and going back and forth. But he broke into four more places since he's been going back and forth to court."" William Smith is a member of the local service district committee that runs the community, and is also supporting the petition.  He said while there is no guarantee that a petition can force the man to leave the community, they are willing to try anything.  ""We don't know but we're going to try anyway to see what happens,"" Smith said. ""I mean at least we're going to try and get him out of town if we can."" He and many other residents in Cottrell's Cove are at their wits end with the man.  ""He is no longer welcome at my home. He's not my friend no more. Everybody has had enough of it,"" Smith said. ""I just don't know what to do with the guy anymore."" Boone said the man blames alcohol for his desire to commit the break-ins.  ""He did tell one person here that he breaks in only when he's feeling good — when he's drinking a few drinks."" She said the petition will be available for signatures starting May 23 of this year, since many cabin owners return to their properties after that date.  The RCMP did not comment on the petition, but in a statement to the CBC, did acknowledge they are investigating multiple break-ins in Cottrell's Cove, two of which have occurred since the start of January.   ""Charges can only be laid when there is evidence supporting them,"" the statement reads. ""The investigations are ongoing."" Police urge anyone with information on the crimes to contact the Grand Falls-Windsor RCMP.

432,Roshini Nair,2020-01-27T02:49:09.540Z,"When Carol met Anas: A story of friendship, love, and death","When Carol Taylor ended her life with medical assistance last week, the Kelowna woman spent her last moments surrounded by her dearest friends. But closest to her, holding her hand until she passed, was a young man from Syria she lovingly called her grandson, Anas Qartoumeh. Theirs was an unlikely friendship, and one that will endure in Qartoumeh's heart for a long time.  ""She was my all in Canada, and I lost her,"" he said, his voice breaking. The 80-year-old, whose two-year battle with cancer had taken a turn for the worse, chose death in the way she had lived her life — with courage and conviction.  ""I've had a most wonderful life. It's time to move on, and I'm on my way happily,"" she told CBC a few days before she died. Taylor, who hailed from a family of ""lefties"" from the San Francisco area, initially came to Canada to protest the Vietnam War, and activism remained the crux of her life. She protested against nuclear proliferation in the 1980s, against homophobia in the 1990s, and in her later years, co-founded the Dying with Dignity chapter in Kelowna.  One fuzzy photo of Taylor shows her at one of the first pride marches in Kelowna in the late '90s, surrounded by her friends from the Kelowna Women's Book Club.  ""We were on the front lines 20 years ago [and] the mayor refused to sign the proclamation [in support of the LGBTQ community],"" she said.  ""We were vilified ... they were saying terrible things to us."" In 2015, Taylor, whose common-law husband had died a few years earlier, was looking for a way to help the influx of Syrian refugees arriving in Canada. Living alone, she figured she could host a family in the extra rooms in her house.  ""And Anas came into my life ... with a 22 kilogram suitcase."" Qartoumeh, now 36, came to Canada as a refugee to escape the Syrian civil war and a conservative culture that forced him to keep his homosexuality a secret.  When he arrived in Kelowna, he found in Taylor not just a roommate, but a kindred spirit, mentor, and someone he could confide in.  ""She was there to support me since the day I arrived,"" he said. ""She stood up for me when I was vulnerable."" Taylor introduced Qartoumeh to her wide circle of friends, and she watched closely as he blossomed in his adopted home.  ""He was invited to his first gay New Year's party and I drove him to it,"" she recalled. ""Up in Glenmore, somewhere snowing."" The following morning, Taylor said she listened carefully as Qartoumeh recounted every detail of the party, especially because, she joked, she hadn't been invited. ""Anas said, 'Carol! I have had my first gay kiss!' And he told me about what it was like and [how] this man kissed him."" With Taylor's encouragement, Qartoumeh got a job, moved out, and took on a prominent, vocal role in Kelowna's LGBTQ community. Qartoumeh was named the Grand Marshal of the 2018 Kelowna Pride March. ""I knew he could speak well. He looks good, and he's proud and out as a gay man,"" she said, beaming. ""He's the poster man for inclusion in Canada."" But to Taylor, who has no children of her own, he was more.  ""He's the grandson I would have wished for."" When Taylor decided to have a medically assisted death, she told Qartoumeh. He immediately moved in to the house to be with her in the weeks leading up to the day she had chosen to die. The night before her death, Taylor held a living wake for her close friends. She insisted on happy music and no tears.  Qartoumeh said the event, complete with a riotous appearance from Kelowna drag queen Freida Whales, was joyful. But he admitted to escaping to his own room to cry.  ""I do not want to disappoint her — I've never disappointed her — and show her my sadness, but when I am in my room and on my own, I just do it,"" he said.  When he insisted on being there for her final moments, Taylor hesitated. She said it would be too emotional. ""Then she changed her mind and she said, 'Yeah I'd like you to stay with me,'"" he said. ""I held her hand to the very end."" As Qartoumeh moves on in his own life, Taylor will always remain close to him — like an old fuzzy photograph of a determined woman, marching with a hand-written sign at one of Kelowna's first pride parades, that sits framed in his home.   When Taylor was shown the photograph before her death, she laughed. ""I had said, 'Anas, take anything you want because I'm getting rid of stuff here.' And he took it. I kind of forgot he took it,"" she said. ""I was so honoured that he would do that.""

433,Ainsley Hawthorn,2020-01-11T11:30:00.842Z,When every January is dry: The surprising appeal of living without alcohol ,"It's January, a month that many people now observe as 'Dry January' — a period to set aside alcohol and focus on health.  It's not something I will be observing as a special occasion, because I don't drink at all. I can't remember when I decided not to drink. It was before I turned 19, because my celebration didn't include the traditional first (legal) bar visit. It was before I started university, because I was able to enjoy being the only sober person at the end-of-orientation-week party, where I banked some wild stories to recount to my friends once they recovered from their hangovers. I had had the occasional sip of alcohol as a teenager, and I thought it tasted terrible. I never enjoyed the astringent kick of wine, the malty foulness of beer. But, honestly, who does? Alcoholic drinks taste objectively bad to most people at first. As the saying goes, you don't drink them for the taste, and it's likely that if alcoholic beverages were uncoupled from their euphoric effects we wouldn't drink them at all. The difference between me and most of my peers, I suppose, is that I wasn't enthusiastic enough about the idea of getting buzzed to push through the nasty flavour. My choice puzzled my friends at the time. After all, in our society we drink alcohol not only for its pleasurable effects but as a rite of passage. Alcohol is a symbol of our transition into adulthood, and most teenagers are anxious to enjoy adult freedoms and to prove themselves worthy of adult responsibilities. We indulge in alcohol furtively when we begin to feel suffocated by the authority of our parents and guardians. We partake in alcohol openly to celebrate when our numerical age makes us legally (if not actually) independent from them. When I declined a glass or bottle, I often found myself in the hot seat, being grilled on my reasons for abstaining. Not drinking, I've discovered, is one of the few purely personal choices that can make even strangers deeply uncomfortable. It's a singular experience to be questioned about why you don't drink alcohol, because there are a limited number of answers people consider legitimate. An illness, a religious doctrine, a family history of alcoholism — these seem to be acceptable explanations for abstaining. My reasons? I don't like the taste, I'm having a good time already, I just don't feel like it? These never seem to be good enough, so much so that I've sometimes fallen back on the excuse that there's been alcoholism in my family (which is true, but not a factor) just to cut these awkward conversations short. Why all this public concern over one aspect of my diet? I don't like spicy food or cilantro either, but no one interrogates me about that. Not drinking, on the other hand, is often taken as an affront. This is probably a legacy of the temperance movement, the organized crusade against alcohol consumption that snowballed during the 19th and early 20th centuries and eventually led to prohibition. The temperance movement took a moral stance against alcohol and portrayed drinkers as reckless libertines or hopeless degenerates. As a result, when you say you don't drink, even today, the people around you begin to wonder if you're looking down your nose at them like the temperance teetotallers of yore. Add to that the fact that our society considers alcohol essential for relaxing, socializing, and partying, and the non-drinker becomes a very suspicious animal indeed. Is she a puritanical square, the sworn enemy of all things fun? This heap of cultural baggage makes it difficult for each of us to untangle how we really feel about alcohol from how we're supposed to feel about it, how alcohol really affects our bodies from our expectations of how it should affect them. I know a number of moderate drinkers who've recently given up alcohol after realizing they don't actually enjoy drinking. Alcohol is a depressant. It can lower your inhibitions and relax you, but it can also dampen your mood and make you feel gloomier than you did before. If you're already prone to depression, drinking alcohol may not be a fantastic experience. Others quit drinking because it's getting in the way of their fitness goals (many alcoholic beverages are high in calories but, because they're liquids, don't fill you up) or because they want to save money. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians spend $1,056 per person on alcohol each year. Each of us deserves to assess for ourselves whether drinking works for us, our bodies, and our pocketbooks. So, I propose a reality-based reset of our society's approach to alcohol: Whether you'll be enjoying the occasional drink this month or having a dry January, just remember that, if you're of legal age, drinking is an option, not a requirement.

434,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:06:55.726Z,Duelling demonstrations held for and against Teck's $20B Frontier oilsands mine ,"Duelling rallies held up traffic Wednesday on Ninth Avenue in downtown Calgary as opponents of a proposed oilsands mine faced off with demonstrators who came out to show their support for the $20-billion project. A few dozen activists with Extinction Rebellion stood outside the office building where Teck Resources has an office. They displayed signs calling for Ottawa to reject the company's bid to build the Frontier mine north of Fort McMurray, Alta., which would produce 260,000 barrels of oil a day. ""Just reading the news and headlines that are available to me as a layperson, there are some economic issues, there are Indigenous rights issues, there are environmental issues, habitat issues, and then of course the big one being greenhouse gas emissions, climate emissions,"" said Extinction Rebellion member Sarah Flynn. ""Ultimately, this mine will be so devastating to the climate, and we're in a climate crisis … so the short-term advantages of the jobs and the income that this mine will offer will be far outweighed by the climate devastation that the whole world will experience."" At the same time, a counter-rally organized by Canada Action drew a greater number of people, who came out to voice support for the project. On its Facebook page, the pro-resource sector group said the mine has the potential to boost government coffers by $70 billion over its lifespan and provide thousands of jobs. Canada Action reminded its supporters that its event was intended to be non-partisan, positive and respectful. As members of Extinction Rebellion made speeches opposing the project, some protesters with the other side chanted slogans such as ""approve that mine"" and ""let us build."" That prompted counter-slogans shouted back by the other group. A supporter of Canada Action said oil from Canada's energy industry is more ethically produced and cleaner than that which comes from the Middle East, for example. ""If we don't put Canadian energy out, such as Teck mines, it will be replaced with foreign oil, such as Saudi Arabia, Argentina, other countries that do not live up to the same standards that we have here,"" said Josh Metz. Metz said he thinks the opposing sides need to meet in the middle, acknowledge climate change is real, and take measured steps toward cleaner and renewable energy.  ""But we've got to have a real conversation on how we get there,"" he said.  Teck has projected the open-pit mining operation, covering 292 square kilometres, will emit 4.1 megatonnes of carbon dioxide a year over its four decades in operation. But some environmental groups say that estimate is too low. Frontier got the green light from regulators in July 2019 after a joint panel of officials from both the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency recommended the project receive the final approval from the federal environment minister. The panel concluded that, even if Frontier is built, Alberta would be able to keep emissions from the sector below the 100 megatonnes cap for greenhouse gas emissions that the former provincial NDP government imposed on the industry. Ottawa must make a decision on the project by the end of February under the Environmental Assessment Act. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for swift approval of the project, warning that rejection would send a signal that Canada's oil-and-gas sector has no future. Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says Ottawa must assess how Frontier fits into the government's promise to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Teck Resources Ltd. says it has spent more than a decade on community engagement, including signing agreements with all 14 Indigenous communities in the project area. The agreements set out a framework for co-operation in areas like environmental stewardship and economic opportunities, it says. About 7,000 jobs would be created in building the mine and 2,500 workers would be needed to operate it.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/rival-rallies-teck-frontier-mine-approval-ottawa-oilsands-calgary-protests-1.5436228,[],N/A

And how much freedom should they get?  I reached out to Chris Burt, who's the clinical director at HollyBurn Family Services in North Vancouver, B.C. Hollyburn offers counselling and workshops for teens and their parents as they transition through the sometimes tumultuous years. Burt says that while research has shown certain areas of the teen brain develop at certain ages, other areas only start to percolate once they are kicked into action. ""If you're not asking that brain to work and function, i.e.. forecast for the future, try something ... if you're taking that away from that young person, then that part of the brain isn't going to develop because you're doing all of the thinking for them,"" Burt says.  They wouldn't have learned to walk as toddlers if we kept carrying them around — so, it's the same basic principle.  Even if you have a great and trusting bond with your kids, they are still going to face peer pressure and some potentially scary situations when you aren't around. So when does a parent know to step in and take the reins? Unless you have firm proof that the worst case scenario is about to unfold, you need to step back.  ""If we can get in the way of them having a true, traumatic experience, then of course we're going to step in,"" says Burt. ""But my experience tells me that parents forecast that way, way too soon and without the evidence that it's going to happen."" These teen years are tricky. I haven't doubted my decisions and my fundamental role as a mom this much since I had a newborn. I may not agree with all my daughter's decisions — I still think wearing a crop top in sub-zero temperatures is ridiculous and I will die on that hill — but I agree with her desire to make them, and I trust her ability to solve most of the problems that might arise as a result.  If she needs me, I'll be there and we can work through her problem together.

437,Ariel Fournier,2020-01-23T17:32:00.563Z,"For this Alberta woman, the good news was she had contracted a rare, deadly parasite","Cassidy Armstrong went in for surgery last fall to remove what doctors thought was a tumour on her liver. She had been diagnosed with a suspected rare cancer that, even with the surgery, would probably have left her with only a few years to live. Instead, doctors found something even rarer: a grapefruit-sized mass caused by the eggs of a tapeworm.  Armstrong was still recovering in a Calgary hospital in November when doctors told her she likely had a parasite called Echinococcus multilocularis, previously confirmed in fewer than 20 Canadians, almost all of them in Alberta. ""I was still a little doped up on painkillers,"" she said. ""So I said, 'Is that a good thing?' And they said, 'It's definitely better.'"" It was certainly an improvement on the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma, a rare form of liver cancer that typically attacks otherwise healthy patients under the age of 40. It wasn't until a pathologist analyzed the mass that the parasite was discovered.  But it's still a dangerous infection — without surgery, she would have died.  The parasite lives as a tapeworm in coyotes, foxes and, increasingly, domestic dogs. The tapeworm's eggs are spread to other animals, such as rodents, from the feces of infected animals.  When a person accidentally swallows the microscopic eggs, the infection can lead to cyst-like lesions on the liver. But it will only cause minimal symptoms until the growths reach a significant size.  The tapeworm had likely been growing inside Armstrong, 36, for more than a decade.  ""It was almost a Christmas miracle,"" she said. ""It could have been a lot worse."" Armstrong had worked physically demanding jobs — she'd been a motorcycle mechanic in Edmonton before moving to Banff last year to work as a stage carpenter — and was in good health, though occasionally noticed she was fatigued. About two years ago, she felt tenderness in her ribs. X-rays didn't find anything, she said, and eventually the pain subsided.  While in Banff, the pain in her side returned and became almost constant. It was accompanied by a new pain in her shoulder.   She worried she had gallstones and insisted on an ultrasound. That's when the mass was discovered, she said, leading to the cancer diagnosis and grim news that surgery wouldn't guarantee her more than a few more years. ""I would have lived maybe another two to five years. There were a lot of things going through my mind,"" she said. ""Mainly, what's the point?"" Her cancer surgery was the equivalent of an open-heart operation. Surgeons removed her gallbladder, 65 per cent of her liver and cut several nodes off her lungs, in addition to scraping the cyst off her diaphragm. She has a 14-inch, L-shaped scar on her chest that is still not completely closed, two months after surgery.  Armstrong's parasitic clump is one of the largest physicians have seen in Alberta. And they've seen a few. ""We're definitely the hot spot,"" said Dr. Stan Houston, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta.  To date, there have been 15 cases of Echinococcus multilocularis in Alberta. When Armstrong's case is scientifically confirmed, she will be number 16, he said.  It's believed the strain has been arriving in Canada in dogs brought over from Europe and in foxes imported decades ago for hunting.  It has existed in Europe for around 150 years. There are about 1,800 human cases every year,  the majority of which are found in China and Tibet. A 2012 study found that the parasite was well-established in Alberta's wild animal population, with about one-quarter of the province's coyote population infected with the tapeworm. The first Canadian human case was diagnosed in 2013. ""[Before the last decade] we never had people with this disease in all of North America,"" Houston said. ""In the last six years, we've had 15 definitely proven cases, just in Alberta."" Since 2014, Canadian researchers have warned that the parasite could easily be misdiagnosed by physicians as another liver disease or ailment. ""About half our cases were found by accident,"" Houston said. In those cases, imaging revealed an abnormal growth in the liver.  There's no guaranteed cure for Echinococcus multilocularis. Infected patients must take a parasite medication for the rest of their lives to prevent the tapeworm eggs from causing further growths.  A drug called albendazole, normally used to treat other tropical parasites, can act as a preventive treatment. While it is widely available in Africa, Europe and Asia, the drug company hasn't applied to Health Canada to access the Canadian market.  Houston said he applies for special access to the drug every six months on behalf of his patients.  A spokesperson for Health Canada said there are clinical trials in Canada that may lead to approval in the future.  Armstrong doesn't know how she was infected, but suspects it could have come from her work fixing farm equipment or from produce purchased at farmer's markets. Houston said most patients in Alberta were dog owners, but Armstrong hasn't had pets since she was a kid. Houston's main advice for prevention is meticulous hand-washing, particularly if you have dogs at home. Regularly de-worming your dog can be helpful as well.  ""We're hoping to learn more about the ecology of this disease in Alberta so we can give more precise advice,"" he said.  After Armstrong's cancer diagnosis, she went on sick leave and moved back to Edmonton to be close to family during her recovery. She is still struggling with pain as her incisions heal. Armstrong may never know how she got sick, but she believes it is important to raise awareness about the disease. ""It's a scary thing and there's still so much we don't know,"" she said. ""I would like to see more funding for research so more people don't have to go through what I went through.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/parasite-cassidy-armstrong-tapeworm-alberta-1.5436828,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.5166570/brain-surgeons-went-looking-for-a-tumour-but-found-a-tapeworm-instead-1.5166571 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tapeworm-echinococcus-multilocularis-alberta-klein-calgary-veterinarian-disease-coyotes-dogs-1.5224864,N/A

440,Jackson Weaver,2020-01-25T09:00:00.141Z,Stand by your man — and woman: Country music radio station pledges equal play,"Brittany Thompson has worked in radio for over 10 years and been a fan of country music her whole life, but thinks they've been fundamentally broken for a long time.  And it only took a few seconds to fix them. ""I spoke to a couple other program directors,"" Thompson said from the back office of her station, ""and really it was just a matter of coming in, and just a few simple clicks of the keyboard."" Those few clicks changed the lineup at her country radio station in Kingston, Ont., and were part of a pledge that ran through the week, starting on Jan. 20. Pure Country 99, where Thompson is program director, would play an equal number of women and men from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, revising a pattern that goes back years. Watch | Kingston, Ont., program director pledges equal airplay: Female country artists are far outplayed on the radio by male artists — in some cases by nearly 10 to one — based on the idea that audiences will turn the dial if they hear too many women.  Thompson explained male performers test better with audiences. She hopes that initiatives like hers can change that mentality. ""We can't change the past,"" Thompson said. ""I believe we just have to start putting more equality into the decisions that we're making for new music, and then once the new music becomes a recurrence ... we're gonna see that there's going to be more women testing better, because they had a fair chance from Day One."" While the issue of women on country radio, Thompson says, has gone back at least as far as the beginning of her career, it recently came to a head when Michigan radio station 98 WKCQ-FM tweeted they ""cannot play two females back to back,"" in response to a Variety writer joking that a different station might be fined for doing just that. The station's parent company, MacDonald Broadcasting, soon issued a statement saying they had never had such a policy, while listeners posted angry responses online. Country music stars Kacey Musgraves and Kelsea Ballerini stepped in, with Musgraves tweeting that — despite stations' seeming inability to play women — ""they can play 18 dudes who sound exactly the same back to back.""  Ballerini argued that it is ""incredibly disappointing"" that stations are made to follow these rules. I turned on the 105.1 country station in L.A. just now, and they were playing the new song by Gabby Barrett, and then, without any pause or interruption at all, they went into a Kelsea Ballerini song. Can’t they get fined for that? The next day, comedian Samantha Bee dedicated a segment of her show Full Frontal to the issue. Soon after, CMT announced they would include equal airplay on CMT and CMT Music channels, and Thompson said she made her change because of the the online responses she witnessed. Jada Watson, a professor at the University of Ottawa who has studied gender representation in country music, describes the focus on the issue as a turning point. Watson's 2019 study Gender Representation on Country Format Radio found that in 2000 male to female artists were played at a ratio of 2.1 to one, increasing in 2018 to 9.7 to one. That study was widely cited as evidence of an endemic problem, even if it wasn't exactly surprising to most in the industry.  Like MacDonald, most broadcasters state that their stations have no official policy limiting female artists. But the evidence, Watson says — like the tweet from 98 WKCQ-FM — often points in the other direction. ""I think what surprised me about it was that this individual from radio was so comfortable tweeting that it was a rule that her station had to abide by,"" Watson said. ""Here's somebody from inside radio speaking so very openly about rules that we all believe to be myths."" Watson said ""anecdotal discussions"" in the industry around the lack of woman have been significant for years. Canadian country musician George Canyon has observed and discussed the issue for the 29 years he's been a musician and audio engineer.  ""I've never really come to the decision, personally, why it's happened,"" Canyon said. ""I think it should be completely about your talent, not about whether you're a man or a woman, it should be your talent, your music, your song, your craft."" Canyon said he agrees with Thompson's strategy. ""We have to do whatever is needed to make the situation correct."" Watch: George Canyon advocates eliminating bias against women: Watson says she is ""very optimistic"" initiatives like Thompson's could be the first step to overhaul country radio, while Thompson is a bit more conservative. She has experienced some pushback — including one U.S. distributor who warned her she was ""going down a rabbit hole"" that would eventually tank her ratings — but hopes to show other stations what's possible. ""The biggest mission is, don't be afraid of women on country radio,"" Thompson said. ""If we can accomplish that, if people at the end of this week can say people want to hear this, we have some kind of tangible support that we can show other industry members that people want to hear women. I think that's a great place to start.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/country-radio-gender-problem-1.5437479,[],N/A
441,Leigh Anne Power,2020-01-25T21:30:00.757Z,"Gander penalized 'for doing the right thing' on wastewater cleanup, mayor says","The mayor of Gander says his town's taxpayers are getting a raw deal when it comes to paying for their new wastewater treatment system, and that they are being penalized because the town has played by the rules.  Gander is one of only three municipalities in Newfoundland that obeyed changes to the federal Fisheries Act, which required towns to meet tougher standards for treating effluent.  Communities whose wastewater outfalls produce more than 100 cubic metres of effluent per day must treat the water before it goes into the ocean or rivers, according to the 2012 changes.  If communities were not compliant, they were required to request an extension to upgrade their systems. Mayor Percy Farwell says taxpayers in his town are covering 37 per cent of the total cost. However, municipalities who were late can have the federal government paying the greatest share of their systems. ""It's punitive,"" Farwell told CBC's Newfoundland Morning.  ""The taxpayers of Gander are being expected to contribute more toward their waste water solution than in other communities and we just don't think that's fair."" Farwell worries federal infrastructure money will now be diverted to wastewater treatment after his town has already paid its share. ""We've invested our money in wastewater treatment while others were investing their money in recreational facilities and other priorities,"" he said. ""Now there's likely to be very little if any money available for these other priorities because everybody waited."" He added that higher levels of government are ""penalizing us for doing the right thing."" Now Gander wants a better deal from Ottawa.  ""We're not too keen on being penalized for doing what's right, and if that's the way it turns out, then I think there's a message in it for us that when guidelines come out, perhaps it's more advantageous to ignore them and move on and do what you like."" Farwell says he's asking his member of Parliament to intervene.  ""They want to go from 37 per cent contribution down to 33 or less,"" said Coast of Bays-Central-Notre Dame MP Scott Simms. ""I think they have a valid point. And my job, as member of Parliament, is to fight on their behalf."" He says he's not sure whether the federal government will reopen the agreement it signed with Gander, as the money has already been allotted.  Farwell hopes the fact that Gander not only followed the rules but brought in its project well under budget will encourage the federal government to be more generous. Municipalities that don't comply with federal regulations or request an extension by the end of this year can be fined, and their managers face criminal charges.

442,Joanne Chianello,2020-01-25T21:56:14.180Z,Councillors shocked by how poor SNC-Lavalin's winning Trillium Line bid was,"Some Ottawa city councillors are calling for answers in the wake of revelations the city's technical evaluation team wanted SNC-Lavalin thrown out of the bidding process for the second stage of Ottawa's north-south rail line. Instead, the company was eventually awarded the $1.6-billion contract for Stage 2 of the Trillium Line. ""I was absolutely shocked with how poor the proposal was,"" said Coun. Carol Anne Meehan. ""I was blown away that they really didn't have a clue what they were actually bidding on and that their bid contained so many gaps in what was essential."" CBC first reported in March 2019 that SNC-Lavalin did not achieve a minimum technical score for the project. In August the city finally admitted that the Montreal-based engineering firm failed to reach the minimum threshold not just once, but twice. But documents released by the city this week revealed for the first time details of the technical evaluation team's report on SNC-Lavalin's bid. Among other issues, the SNC-Lavalin bid failed to include a signalling and train control system, had no plan for snow removal and, at one point, referenced equipment used on an electric train system as if the current Trillium Line trains were electric, and not, in fact, diesel. The team had reached a ""unanimous consensus that the proposal should not be considered further in the evaluation process,"" describing SNC-Lavalin's proposal a ""poor technical submission throughout."" Coun. Jeff Leiper said the documents were ""startling in terms of the lack of information that was provided by the bidder that you would expect to see in a professional complete bid."" When looking at the questions from the bid evaluation steering committee, which oversaw the city's procurement process and demanded that the technical evaluators review the bids after SNC-Lavalin originally scored only 63 per cent, Leiper said it's difficult not to think that ""someone had their thumb on the scale"" for SNC-Lavalin. ""It's hard not to read the bid evaluation committees questions as loaded, as clearly indicating that the technical evaluation committee is going to come up with a different answer,"" Leiper said. Leiper said by contrast the technical evaluation committee showed ""professionalism"" and ""clear rigour"" in their exchanges. ""I was left feeling very comfortable that the technical evaluation committee took their job seriously,"" he said. Coun. Shawn Menard called for an independent public inquiry. ""It is startling to read the lucid staff descriptions of the [SNC-Lavallin] bid, knowing that our senior leadership ultimately accepted that submission,"" he wrote in an email. ""I voted against Stage 2 LRT precisely because I was concerned about the procurement and rush to make a decision. My fears have now been confirmed.""  A number of councillors said privately they are taking the weekend to absorb the documents — which were released at 9 p.m. Thursday, after a marathon emergency transit meeting — and may have more to say next week. Councillors weren't the only ones questioning how the bid was approved. At least one resident on Twitter said he wanted to see city councillors hold city staff accountable.

SNC-Lavalin was then allowed to proceed to the financial evaluation round and because its bid was so much lower than the other two finalists, it came out on top as the preferred proponent. Council awarded the company the contract last March. The city's auditor-general has already looked at the contract procurement process for the second stage of the LRT line and found that the city had broken no rules, a point made in statements sent out from Mayor Jim Watson and O-Train construction director Michael Morgan on Friday.

444,Anonymous,2020-01-24T01:43:52.993Z,Quebec urged not to rush expansion of medically assisted death to mental health patients,"The Quebec government has promised to hold ""at least one day"" of public consultations about its intention to allow people with mental illness to seek a medically assisted death. Health Minister Danielle McCann was facing outcry after announcing earlier this week that the government would comply with a Superior Court decision that struck down the ""end-of-life"" requirement in Quebec's law on medically assisted death. McCann's announcement meant that as of March 11, medically assisted death would be accessible to people with mental illnesses, as well as others with incurable but not terminal symptoms. That sparked concern the government was pushing ahead with a major change without thinking through the consequences. McCann responded to the pressure on Thursday, saying a public consultation will take place next month. It may include an online component. The minister also sought to reassure those who feared the new policy will make it too easy for people with mental illnesses such as depression to receive a medically assisted death. ""We're talking about exceptional cases,"" McCann said Thursday in an interview with Radio-Canada.  ""We're talking about people with extremely severe, persistent disorders, decades of inefficient treatments — people who are resistant [to treatment]. It's a very small number of people who would be able to receive medical aid in dying in this context."" McCann has asked the Quebec College of Physicians to draft guidelines for determining when a patient with mental illness can qualify for the procedure. These requests will take time in order to be properly evaluated, said Dr. Yves Robert, a representative of the college. ""Several mental disorders involve a wish to die as a symptom,"" he said. The challenge for doctors will be distinguishing between a wish to die that is a symptom, and one that is ""free and informed.""  Robert said it was important to remember that not all requests for a medically assisted death are granted. ""It's a constitutional right to make the request. But it's a conditional right to obtain it."" But even with McCann's promise to hold public consultations, opposition parties remained worried the government was pressing ahead too quickly. ""It's clear more time is needed,"" said Véronique Hivon, the Parti Québécois's critic for end-of-life care, who also played a key role drafting Quebec's assisted dying law. Hivon said the government should have asked the court for an extension. ""You can't just be in a legal bubble and say there's a judgment and it's going to land like that, like magic, without preparing things,"" she said. Hivon's concerns were echoed by a leading expert on the issue. Éric Racine, who heads a health ethics research unit affiliated with the Université de Montréal, said the Superior Court ruling threw Quebec into uncharted territory.  ""We're in grey zones here and we're at the very beginning of what should be a debate, but is going fast, fast, fast at the legislative level,"" said Racine. ""The need for dialogue may be even more crucial, but we haven't really been able to prepare for this."" Racine said the Superior Court decision, which removed the end-of-life requirement, is prompting Quebec to think hard about the ethics of well-being. Without that requirement, more weight will be placed on the evaluations done by the health professionals considering the application for an assisted death. In mental health cases, these are more subjective, Racine said.  ""As you can easily understand this is not easy.... These are assessments that need to be thoughtful,"" he said. ""It raises questions about how we view suffering and the well-being of the person.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-urged-not-to-rush-expansion-of-medically-assisted-death-to-mental-health-patients-1.5438517,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-to-expand-assisted-death-to-mentally-ill-but-few-expected-to-qualify-1.5437030,N/A
445,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-05-06T11:36:21.452Z,Brothers have the same deadly disease but only 1 gets what their parents hope is life-saving treatment,"Two young brothers, both with a deadly genetic disease, could face two very different futures because only one has access to cutting-edge medication. Andre Larocque, 8, and his younger brother, Joshua, 6, have cystic fibrosis.   The relatively rare disease leads to the destruction of the lungs and an early death for most people who have it. There is no cure. Once lung function is lost, there is no way to get it back. ""When I put them to bed at night, I hear Andre go to sleep peacefully and then I hear Josh laying awake in his bed coughing himself to sleep,"" mother Sasha Haughian said during an interview from the family's home in the small Ontario town of New Tecumseth. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling of listening to that and knowing it's just gonna get worse."" Andre is on a medication called Symdeko through a drug trial, but Joshua wasn't selected for the trial and has no access to two similar Health Canada-approved medications. That's because the Ontario government doesn't fund the drugs for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients and his parents can't afford to pay out of pocket. ""It's a progressive, fatal disease ... we have medication right now that more than half the population [with cystic fibrosis] could benefit from, and we're not getting access to it,"" Haughian said. About 4,200 Canadians have cystic fibrosis. There are three gene-modifying drugs available — Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi — that are believed to slow down lung damage caused by the disease. Other treatments only ease symptoms. Access to all three medications is severely limited.  Unlike many other countries, Canada does not have a special process for evaluating drugs for rare diseases. Clinical trials for such drugs are limited by their small pool of potential participants. This makes proving a drug's effectiveness more difficult — which makes convincing provincial governments and private insurers to cover the cost for patients more unlikely, health advocates say. ""It's a heartbreaking situation ... These are symptoms of a larger issue, which is essentially our system was not built to evaluate and fairly assess drugs for rare diseases,"" said Kim Steele, director of government and community relations for Cystic Fibrosis Canada.  Haughian and her husband, Jamie Larocque, say Symdeko has been a life-changer for Andre since he started taking it in January 2018. While he can run around and play hockey with his friends, his younger brother's condition is deteriorating.  ""When we first found out Andre was accepted for the trial, we were so excited,"" Larocque said. ""And then after a couple days, I realized, 'Oh wait, Josh has nothing.' Now that it's been over a year, we're really starting to see Andre just shoot ahead and Josh falling behind, and that's tough."" The family and their doctor believe Orkambi would change that. But the family can't afford the annual cost of $250,000. Their private health-care plan won't pay for it either. They are desperate for Ontario to cover the medication for their younger son. They say the criteria for who qualifies for coverage are too strict.  The medication is only funded for children between the ages of six and 17 who are really sick for a long time — it's called the ""exceptional cases"" criteria. To qualify, a patient must show that they lost 20 per cent of their lung function for a six-week period over the course of six months. That's the standard in three provinces — Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The other provinces and territories don't cover the drug at all and no province funds the drug for adults. Under the rules, less than two per cent of children with cystic fibrosis qualify for Orkambi coverage in Ontario, according to Cystic Fibrosis Canada. And Joshua isn't one of them.  The Ontario Health Ministry says it has not received any requests for coverage since the introduction of the exceptional cases criteria on Feb. 20. The board that recommends whether medications should be publicly funded is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). It's made up of representatives from the health-care system, academia and the public. It decided there wasn't enough evidence of therapeutic value to recommend governments cover Orkambi, but provinces aren't bound by CADTH's decisions.  Steele says a lot of good medications are rejected for coverage because the testing criteria are designed for drugs that treat more common diseases and can be evaluated in large clinical trials. ""We can't do that in small populations. And so, often when our evidence goes to the table for government to look at, they say there's not enough evidence. And our problem is there's not enough people to give you the evidence that you want."" Then there is the cost.  ""It's expensive,"" Steele said. ""I'm not going to shy away from saying price is definitely a concern. However, it's very hard to put a price on life."" The three cystic fibrosis drugs are priced at about $250,000 a year in Canada. But Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society, which advocates that patients with the disease should have access to any medication their doctor prescribes, says that doesn't reflect what the real cost would be if Canada did a better job negotiating with drug companies. He points to other countries where the drugs are available for less than half that price.  The problem, he says, is Canada does not negotiate prices with drug companies until the end of the CADTH review, so many drugs end up being rejected for coverage because of cost. In some cases, provinces won't negotiate at all, or they go it alone instead of negotiating on a national scale and buying in bulk to lower the cost. ""Canada is an outlier. We're the only developed country that either doesn't have a deal, or isn't negotiating a deal,"" MacLeod said of Orkambi. ""Quite frankly, I think it's bureaucrats that have become so baked in the system that they've lost perspective."" Meanwhile, Canadians like Joshua Larocque go without the medications they need, he said. ""It's shameful. Absolutely shameful."" MacLeod is also a lawyer and is heading up a class action lawsuit against the B.C. government, federal government, CADTH and others over the lack of funding for Orkambi. The suit claims governments are ""denying access to lifesaving drugs in a very non-transparent, non-evidence-based manner."" None of the allegations has been proven in court. In an email to Go Public, B.C.'s Ministry of Health said CADTH recommended Orkambi not be funded due to a lack of evidence on two separate occasions.  ""These recommendations are based on clinical and cost factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""And with Vertex setting the cost of Orkambi at $250,000 a year per patient, its cost is unsustainable for public and private drug plans."" In an email to Go Public, a CADTH spokesperson said that over the past five years, the agency has taken steps to clarify and enhance processes to address the unique challenges of evaluating drugs for rare diseases.  Andre and Joshua's parents have repeatedly reached out to Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott.  In October, the family asked for a meeting with Elliott. They said they were told by her office it would happen. They're still waiting to hear when, and their followup messages have gone unanswered.  As opposition health critic, Elliott criticized the government at the time for not funding Kalydeco, one of the three gene-modifying cystic fibrosis medications. The drug was later added to the coverage list in Ontario, but few patients qualify. It's a similar story with Orkambi. In February, Ontario agreed to fund the drug on a case-by-case basis under what's called the Exceptional Access Program. So far, not one cystic fibrosis patient has qualified for provincial coverage under the program's criteria, said MacLeod.   Watch: Elliott challenged the Liberal government to cover Kalydeco several years ago when she was Opposition health critic. The minister turned down a request for an interview with Go Public and didn't respond to specific questions we sent about Joshua and Andre's situation and about access to the cystic fibrosis medications, providing instead a general statement from a spokesperson.  ""Young Ontarians with rare diseases deserve every opportunity to enjoy healthy and happy childhoods,"" spokesperson Hayley Chazan wrote in an email to Go Public.  ""Orkambi, which helps treat pediatric cystic fibrosis, is currently considered for funding in Ontario in exceptional cases … consistent with clinical evidence."" Joshua and Andre's parents are still hopeful the federal government will deliver on a 2019 federal budget promise to implement a rare disease strategy that could help people like Joshua. The family believes Andre will continue to get access to Symdeko indefinitely. The trial is to test the medication on younger children and track it as they grow. It's already approved by Health Canada for children ages 12 and older. Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes both Orkambi and Symdeko. It tells Go Public it has no plans to ask CADTH to review Symdeko for provincial funding, saying the present system for assessing drug coverage in Canada ""has challenges.""  When asked why the cost of Orkambi is so high, Vertex didn't answer, but Cystic Fibrosis Canada says developing medications for rare disease is expensive because the market for them is so small. ""That leaves Symdeko and the other drugs coming down the pipeline completely inaccessible,"" Haughian said. ""Without a proper rare disease strategy for evaluating drugs in place, there is not much incentive for drug companies to even try to develop drugs for rare diseases."" She and her husband worry their younger son will never get the medication he needs. ""I fear Joshua will spend his childhood getting sicker, living in and out of the hospital, needing more and more treatments, and ultimately dying young,"" Haughian told Go Public in an email after the interview, because she didn't want her sons to hear about her fears. ""While Andre is out playing hockey and hanging with friends … and as he gets older and understands more and more, the 'survivor's guilt' he could potentially feel is a dangerous thing.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

For the past nine years, her family has gathered at the corner of Selkirk and King Street to honour the missing 21-year-old and mark the last time she was heard from. A round of drumming, prayers and smudging opened the vigil at 7 p.m. on Saturday. ""Everybody hurts the same. Everybody waits for answers everyday,"" said her mother, Brenda Osborne. ""We're not going to give up, ever."" Trains screeched in the distance as family, friends and community members huddled in front of the Church of the Rock to reflect on Osborne-Tyo's disappearance. ""We want people to know that this is the last known place where she was so that if anybody, you know, remembers something or knows something about what happened to her,"" said her sister, Bernadette Smith. Osborne-Tyo's disappearance is being investigated by Project Devote, a joint task force between the RCMP and the Winnipeg Police Service that focuses on cases involving missing and murdered exploited people. Smith said her family gets a monthly call or email from investigators.  ""Basically it's the same thing, no new information,"" she said. ""Unfortunately for us, we expect that every month. I wish we could say we foresee something else in terms of the police giving us answers."" Osborne-Tyo was last seen at Winnipeg's Lincoln Motor Hotel, now renamed as the Four Crowns Inn, on McPhillips Street, Smith said. It took two years for police release the location of her last phone call, she said. After leaving the hotel on a mid-summer night, Osborne-Tyo made numerous calls on pay phones before placing her last call on one that used to be located at the Selkirk Street intersection, about a block away from Main Street. No one has seen or heard from her since then. The family is not alone when it comes to searching for answers about how and why their daughter, sister or mother went missing. She is one of thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Canada. After more than 1,000 hours of testimony from survivors and families, Smith, who is a Manitoba MLA, remains critical of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. ""The national inquiry has done absolutely nothing for our family,"" Smith said, adding that they had ""no support"" and paid their own fare to attend last year's final report announcement. Smith said she wonders how long it will take to implement the 231 recommendations that came out of the inquiry — if it ever happens. She said the $92 million spent on the inquiry would have been better spent on prevention. ""While the inquiry went on there were still women going missing, there were still women being murdered, and still we have no resources that came out of that,"" Smith said. Smith said she believes all levels of government need to do more to protect Indigenous women and girls. Until then, families will continue excavating dumps and scouring the rivers in search of signs of the missing and murdered. ""You can't go on with your life when you have your loved one missing,"" Smith said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/claudette-osborne-tyo-annual-vigil-1.5440822,[],N/A

Scheer addressed his caucus during a strategy session on Friday as MPs and senators return to Ottawa after the holiday break. ""The Trudeau government might think our leadership race will give them a free ride, they're wrong,"" Scheer told his caucus room, capping off a week that saw multiple high-profile potential candidates announce they won't run. At least three sitting Conservative MPs are launching leadership campaigns, and former MP Peter MacKay is picking up support from many others.

448,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-07T18:30:27.851Z,'A slap in the face': Little-known rule says airline can keep your money without delivering what you pay for,"A Calgary-area couple is fuming after paying Air Canada hundreds of dollars for an upgraded flight package, then being told a little-known rule allows the airline to keep their money without delivering on what it advertised. Instead, the airline offered Linda and Rick Borsato 20 per cent off a flight within the next year. ""You're treated like you're an afterthought,"" said Linda. ""'We have your money and sorry you weren't happy. Maybe we'll do better next time. Here's a discount.' That's a slap in the face."" Aviation experts say airlines can upsell passengers without being obligated to deliver or to pay compensation — because the industry's regulator lets them make their own rules outlining their obligations to passengers during a flight. ""It's not really fair,"" says Prof. John Gradek, who lectures about aviation management at McGill University in Montreal.  ""Unfortunately, that's the conditions by which the Canadian Transportation Agency has allowed the airlines to promote their fares."" Go Public found WestJet, and some U.S. airlines like American Airlines and Delta have similar rules as Air Canada. Air Canada and WestJet both say they deal with such situations on a case-by-case basis.  On a trip to Hawaii in April, the Borsatos paid $519 extra to upgrade from the airline's ""basic"" economy fare to ""comfort"" economy, which includes advance seat selection. That was the selling point for Rick, who is six feet, four inches tall and wanted more legroom. Air Canada changed their itinerary three times after the Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March.  But it wasn't until the Borsatos arrived at the airport on April 13, that they discovered they'd be getting fewer than half of the extras they bought. The airline didn't deliver on the advance seating, the early boarding or the complimentary alcoholic beverage — though the couple was able to check their first bag for free and got extra travel points. The Borsatos say an Air Canada agent told them they could get a refund when they returned home. But their refund claim was rejected based on a set of rules that Air Canada wrote itself, and which passengers automatically agree to when they book. The airline's Rule 30 says services that are part of a fare package, like the one the Borsatos purchased, are ""not guaranteed,"" and ""no compensation will be offered for their unavailability."" ""I just can't wrap my head around how that happens,"" Rick said. ""We've paid them for a service and didn't get it, but they've written [this rule] in such a way that they don't owe us anything. What other industry can do that?"" The airline won't disclose how often passengers don't get the services they pay for under the various fare packages. In an email to Go Public, spokesperson Angela Mah says Air Canada ""always makes every effort to ensure that services are provided to the best of its abilities."" She added that the ""no compensation"" clause was included in the rules ""for additional clarity."" Compensation is handled on a ""case-by-case basis,"" she said.  After the couple escalated their complaint to Air Canada management, the airline upped its offer by adding a $200 coupon to the 20 per cent discount. They declined that offer. ""We don't want to travel with Air Canada knowing that we can pay for a service that they don't have to provide us and that they don't have to refund our money,"" Linda said. The Borsatos complained on May 27 to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the industry regulator which decides whether an airline's rules are reasonable, and has the authority to force airlines to drop or amend rules. The Borsatos' complaint is among 33 filed over Air Canada's Rule 30 since the CTA began tracking disputes related to the rule two years ago. In its nine-page response to the Borsatos' complaint, Air Canada says Rule 30 is ""reasonable,"" and that the complaint should be dismissed because the grounding of the 737 Max planes was out of Air Canada's control. The Borsatos say they understand operational issues come up, but say Air Canada shouldn't be able to keep the money if the purchased services can't be provided. After Go Public contacted the airline, it agreed to issue a full refund, but only if the Borsatos signed a confidentiality agreement and drop their complaint with the CTA. The couple refused. Mah, the spokesperson, said ""such agreements are common in business during dispute resolutions.""  It's common for airlines to advertise certain perks but not deliver on some or any of them without compensating passengers, according to Prof. Brent Bowen from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.  ""Most of the travelling public is not aware of it,"" said Bowden, who has been running an online study on airline quality for years.  ""This is how the airlines have gone from rags to riches in the past decade … they unbundle everything and don't really reduce the ticket cost to you."" He says occasional travellers should be wary of booking bundled fares that promise — but don't guarantee — extras, because they'll rarely get their money's worth. Air Canada started offering bundled fare packages in 2003 and it expanded and renamed the packages last year.  Fare packages aren't addressed under Canada's new Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which kicked in July 15. But they should be, according to Ian Jack of the Canadian Automobile Association, who had input into the new regulations through the government's various consultations with stakeholders.  The new regulations are ""not perfect"" and fare packages are ""one area for future improvement"" Jack said.  Officials should improve ""the way that various fare classes are advertised and… [how] carriers to make clear what you're getting."" In the meantime, the Borsatos hope the CTA will force Air Canada to drop or modify Rule 30, and want their refund with no strings attached. Their case is still under review.  ""How many people aren't getting what they're paying for?"" Linda Borsato asks. ""That's why we pursued this and are following through on it… either way we have nothing to lose now."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-rule-30-fare-classes-1.5304450,[],N/A
449,Anonymous,2020-01-27T02:08:37.404Z,"From masks to mail, health experts answer your questions on the new coronavirus","With the first ""presumptive"" case of the new coronavirus confirmed in Canada, and growing concern about its transmissibility, Canadians are wondering if they're at risk. In the Chinese province of Hubei — believed to be the virus's epicentre — officials have reported 76 deaths related to the coronavirus. Five cases have been reported in the U.S., including two new infections confirmed on Sunday — one in Los Angeles County in California and the other in Maricopa County, Ariz. In total, 10 countries have reported cases of the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. While federal health officials said Sunday that they expect more cases of the coronavirus in Canada, they say the risk of an outbreak in this country remains low. From using masks to opening overseas mail, health experts answered listeners' commonly asked questions about the new coronavirus Sunday on Cross Country Checkup. Toronto General Hospital Research Institute infectious disease specialist Dr. Susy Hota says that masks can be helpful — but only in certain scenarios. She says that the average Canadian should not yet worry about using a mask. ""Right now, there is really not a role for everyone putting on a mask to protect themselves,"" she said. Those working in hospitals — or visiting an affected patient — do require personal protective equipment, including masks. Viruses like the new coronavirus require close and ""sustained"" contact for transmission, Hota said. ""It's usually larger, respiratory droplets that are generated from when you cough or sneeze … that, actually, can only travel for about two metres or so,"" she said. Hota said that we don't know how long the new coronavirus lives on surfaces — and that its lifespan likely depends on the surface. Hota acknowledged that many surfaces, including those at airports, are not cleaned all the time.  With that in mind, she advised people to take additional precautions to protect themselves. ""Keep sanitizer with you [and] wash frequently, especially after you've been in public areas,"" Hota suggested. When it comes to travel, including to Asian countries, York University professor and global health expert Steven Hoffman said that he would still board a plane — and encouraged callers to do the same. ""I think what's important now, from a big picture perspective, is that there are no travel bans or travel advisories,"" he said. ""There is a notice if people are planning to go to affected areas to be extra cautious,"" he warned. Hoffman encouraged travellers to stay updated with the latest information about the coronavirus while travelling. What's important to remember about a virus like the new coronavirus is that it only spreads within close proximity, Hoffman noted. Hota said that people travelling in crowded situations, including on public transit, can take extra precautions to avoid exposure. She encouraged additional hand washing, and to avoid holding poles and handles with your bare hands. People should also consciously avoid touching their face. ""For those of us who start to feel ill, it's really important to practice what we call 'respiratory etiquette,'"" Hota said. ""If you feel like you need to cough or sneeze, make sure you cough or sneeze into your sleeve or into a tissue."" Anyone feeling really ill should take a sick day at home, she said. Hota said there's little risk of infection from items mailed to Canada from China. Responding to listeners' concerns about mail entering the country from affected areas, Hota said that packages and envelopes are unlikely to carry the new coronavirus. ""Yes, we do lick stamps to put them on, or envelopes to close them — but generally we don't lick them to open them,"" she explained. In order to contract a virus, it would need to survive the transportation from one country to another. ""Likely, it wouldn't remain viable in that sense over that period of time."" Food that is thoroughly washed or cooked is typically safe to eat, even if it has come into contact with bacteria or a virus, Hota said. ""As long as you're following the usual food safety guidelines that we have out there, [it] should be effective here,"" she explained. Hoffman said that Canada has one of the world's ""safest"" food supply systems.  ""We have some of the most rigorous regulations anywhere in the world,"" he said.  Written by Jason Vermes with files from CBC News.",https://www.cbc.ca/1.5441030,[],N/A

He said he went to bed a few nights ago pledging that if he did not feel ""all in"" for the job when he woke up, he'd drop out. That's what he did Thursday, throwing a bombshell into the ongoing campaign. Poilievre, known as a hard-edged, scrappy fighter on the floor of the House of Commons, grew emotional as he described his decision to back out.

MacKay also called attention to divisions within the Conservative Party and referenced his role in establishing the party in 2003, when he merged the Progressive Conservatives with Stephen Harper's Canadian Alliance.  ""We've all lived through the realities of what can happen when Conservatives are not united. We know firsthand how important it is that we do our part not to divide ourselves, our party or our nation,"" MacKay said.  ""If divided, we falter, we fail. And I've done my part and I've played my part in uniting the Conservative family into one big blue tent."" Mackay revealed his intention to enter the leadership race Jan. 15 with a four-word tweet, putting to rest months of rumours about whether he would run for the party's top job. I'm in. Stay tuned. MacKay — who served in three cabinet roles under Harper before leaving politics in 2015 — reflected on his political career in his speech. ""Some of the proudest moments of my life are seeing what Canadians have accomplished both at home and abroad,"" he said. ""As Minister of National Defence I was deeply honoured to do my part in supporting the men and women in uniform."" He also explained how his time as Justice Minister was shaped by his earlier work as a crown prosecutor.  Watch: Peter MacKay says Conservatives need to earn Canadians' trust:  MacKay made no mention of climate change in his speech, though he said Canadians are ""stewards of the environment"" and that the ""country and our planet face big challenges.""  He closed his speech with a reference to Canada's LGBTQ community.  ""I stand here before you today with my heart on my sleeve, for every Canadian, whoever you love, wherever you live,"" MacKay said just before leaving the stage. On Tuesday, MacKay was one of many Conservative MPs who criticized prospective leadership candidate Richard Décarie after the former Harper adviser called being gay a ""choice"" on CTV's Power Play.  Watch: Peter MacKay on why he's running Mackay's launch comes on the heels of several significant leadership drop-outs, including Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre, who abruptly exited the race on Thursday, saying he was committed to spending more time with his family.  Former interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose revealed the day before Poilievre's exit that she had made the difficult decision to remain focused on her private sector work.  Former Quebec premier Jean Charest also pulled out of the race earlier in the week. The evolving list of leadership hopefuls positions MacKay as one of the most well-known contenders.  Before Saturday's announcement, MacKay had already garnered support from a bevy of current and former Conservative MPs and prominent provincial politicians.  He told CBC News he hopes to run in Central Nova again if possible.  His father Elmer MacKay, who previously held the riding for much of the 70s and 80s, said his son's recent absence from political life made him a stronger candidate.  ""I told him that he had to do the very best he could for as many people as he could and I think he's going to do just that,"" he said. ""I think he did the right thing by taking a break and assessing things from the point of view from someone who wasn't in Parliament. Now he can come back with a renewed sense of purpose."" The last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party has enlisted former Conservative MP Alex Nuttall as his campaign manager and Michael Diamond as director of communications. Nuttall previously helped Maxime Bernier organize his bid for the Conservative leadership race in 2017, while Diamond ran Ontario Premier Doug Ford's successful 2018 campaign. MacKay, MP Marilyn Gladu and MP Erin O'Toole are the most prominent Conservatives to announce leadership runs so far.

The number of deaths from the flu-like virus in Hubei climbed from 56 to 76 overnight, health commission officials said, with four deaths elsewhere in the country. The total number of confirmed cases in China had risen to 2,744. China's cabinet said it would extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. The Hubei city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is already under virtual lockdown, with severe restrictions on movement in place in several other Chinese cities. Beijing has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003. The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. The virus, believed to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has already spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. The World Health Organization (WHO) last week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Saturday he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus. ""My @WHO colleagues & I would like to understand the latest developments & strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak,"" he said on Twitter. Watch: Coronavirus misinformation | The Weekly with Wendy Mesley Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has six confirmed cases and said it would ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days. The ban does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts. France, Italy, Japan and the United States all said they were working to evacuate citizens from Wuhan. France said it expected to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area. Evacuees would have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France. Hubei's governor, Wang Xiaodong, said at a news conference on Sunday he felt ""agonized"" and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight. News of the press conference sparked anger on Weibo, China's equivalent to Twitter, although social media platforms in China usually delete such sensitive content. ""He thinks one sentence of apology will be enough to solve the problem? Let's await the judgment of the people of the country,"" one user posted. China's health minister has indicated the ability of a new strain of coronavirus to spread in his country is getting stronger and the number of infections could continue to rise. Ma Xiaowei spoke Sunday after China released new figures showing the death toll from the virus. ""The transmissibility shows signs of increasing and the 'walking source of infection' [where patients have few signs of disease] has made it difficult to control and prevent the disease. ""For this new coronavirus we have not identified the source of the infection and we are not clear about the risk of its mutation and how it spreads. Since this is a new coronavirus there might be some changes in the coming days and weeks, and the danger it poses to people of different ages is also changing,"" he said. The minister declined to estimate how long it would take to bring the situation under control, but said travel restrictions and other strict measures should bring results ""at the lowest cost and fastest speed."" The U.S. has five confirmed cases, all among people who travelled to Wuhan, health officials said Sunday. Two new cases were reported Sunday — one in Los Angeles County in California and the other in Maricopa County, Ariz. The latter case was someone with ties to Arizona State University who did not live in school housing, state health officials said. The three previously reported cases were a patient in Orange County, California; a man in his 30s in Washington state; and a woman in her 60s from Chicago. The U.S. patients generally have been reported to be in good condition and were hospitalized in isolation for monitoring. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects many more Americans to be diagnosed with the newly discovered virus, which is believed to have an incubation period of about two weeks, as worldwide the number of confirmed cases nears 2,000. The CDC is screening passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan at five major airports in Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. CDC officials noted Sunday that more than two dozen people who had been suspected of having the illness ended up testing negative. In Canada, health officials in Ontario on Saturday confirmed its first ""presumptive"" case of coronavirus, a man in his 50s who was in Wuhan before flying to Toronto on Jan. 22. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-china-wuhan-buses-1.5440899,https://www.cbc.ca/news/theweekly/in-china-people-wonder-how-open-government-is-being-over-coronavirus-1.5441061 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-hajdu-tam-health-china-1.5440950 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canada-1st-case-coronavirus-toronto-1.5440760 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/beijing-struggles-keep-up-with-virus-1.5437234,N/A

456,Craig Silliphant,2020-01-25T19:18:19.606Z,Drivers often entitled and distracted — and that's no fun for pedestrians,"I've never been one for physical activity, but when I feel like I'm more beer and cheese than man, I try to spend more time exercising and less time lying on the couch. The problem is, I'm risking my life with my preferred form of extreme fitness: walking outside. I went for a walk a few weeks back and was almost hit by a car. I was in a marked crosswalk with the right of way. I heard the anti-lock brake system of the car kick in as it skidded to a stop in front of me, close enough to spray me with snow. I threw my arms up in shock and fear and gave the driver my best, ""Ay! Ah'm walken here-yuh!""  He rolled down his window and shouted something about me being a, ""stupid idiot for walking,"" and that he was, ""20 feet away from me,"" so to, ""quit being a baby.""  I felt bad for him, since having a cognitive spatial disorder must wreak havoc with his life. I mean, how can you even drive a car if two feet looks like 20 feet? Imagine how far the poor guy thinks he can throw a football.  Unfortunately, this day was not an isolated incident. With a family history of widow maker heart attacks and a baby daughter and young son I'd love to watch grow up, I've been dedicated to walking for a while. And I am almost hit by a car at least once a week. Drivers are often entitled and distracted. In 2018 in Saskatchewan, 15 pedestrians were killed and 214 were injured. The scary thing is, usually my wife and kids are with me.  When I complained about this on Twitter, they told me pedestrians need to make eye contact with the driver when crossing. Sure, that's sound advice. But while I recognize that innocently walking down the street somehow makes me party to a complex and life-threatening system, I don't think the onus should be solely on the pedestrian.  You need a licence to drive. It's a privilege, not a right. But the pedestrian ends up being the second-class traffic citizen, simply for having the gall to be on foot.  Cue the online backlash of entitled drivers saying, ""Hey, if you don't like dying, don't leave your house!"" I'd also expect backlash if this was just a recipe for butter tarts -- because that's who we are now -- but do I really have to wear an armoured Iron Man jogging suit? I just want to better my health and model for my children that exercise isn't stupid (exercise is stupid, but whatever).  This isn't an anti-car rant. I'm also a driver. In fact, I'm so famously lazy I drive to the store that's 30 seconds from my house. I'm not without my share of bonehead moves or tickets. But I also recognize that I'm driving a motor vehicle, thousands of pounds of plastic and metal, hurtling down the street, at the very whim of my attention and reflexes. I don't use the phone while I'm driving. And it's silly, but I try to look the direction the vehicle is headed.   Let's make a promise together to give a bit of care when we're behind the wheel. It might save a life. Selfishly, I need to stay alive if I'm going to watch my kids grow up and keep my appointment with that massive heart attack.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

The 21-year-old was the only Canadian in the field at the inaugural event last year and was officially invited back on Saturday. Participating in the first-even women's event at the prestigious course was the start of a career season for Thibault. She went on to win the Ontario Women's Amateur Championship and NCAA Mountain West Conference Championship. ""I didn't want to set expectations because I didn't know if they were keeping the same procedures, I didn't know how they would select the people this year,"" said Thibault. ""So I didn't want to set expectations, but I knew I had a great year. I did a lot of things right."" Thibault, who is a member of Golf Canada's national amateur squad, is entering her third season on Fresno State University's golf team. She was also part of Canada's bronze-medal team at the Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, with Mary Parsons, Austin Connelly and Joey Savoie. After her productive 2019 Thibault was named the female amateur of the year by the Golf Journalists Association of Canada.

458,Anonymous,2020-01-25T12:54:30.856Z,"A virtual plague that decimated World of Warcraft could hold lessons for real-world outbreaks, researchers say","In the late summer of 2005, a mysterious plague affected an estimated four million people, but caused no deaths — at least not in the real world.  When an update to the multiplayer online game World of Warcraft introduced an in-game condition called Corrupted Blood that acted as a viral disease, players around the world faced a virtual pandemic as their characters unwittingly infected others and rapidly perished. Today, some epidemiologists believe it can offer insight into the spread of viral infections, including a new coronavirus that has killed 41 people in China as of Friday evening. ""What we saw is some remarkably not-real-world behaviours, but things that are analogous to real-world behaviours,"" said epidemiologist Eric Lofgren, who was an active Warcraft player when the disease broke out. The Washington State University assistant professor recalls seeing players share information about the illness, including areas to avoid, and others acting as first responders. Others still holed up in self-imposed quarantines. Corrupted Blood was designed to only afflict high-level players who travelled to an isolated part of the Warcraft world known as Zul'Gurub.  But thanks to an unintentional coding error, the condition could be spread to their virtual pets. When players returned back to densely-populated areas of the game — cities where players buy, sell and trade goods — those pets would infect lower-level players unable to fight the illness. For Lofgren, who was a Tufts University biology student at the time, the experience was a valuable snapshot into human instincts during a pandemic — something computer models can't perfectly replicate. Much remains unclear about the coronavirus strain that is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, including its animal carrier or mortality rate. More than a dozen cities in China have had transportation halted and businesses closed to slow the disease's spread. Cases have been confirmed in at least a half-dozen countries, including France and the United States. In 2003, a separate coronavirus that originated in China led to a worldwide SARS outbreak, resulting in nearly 800 deaths, including 44 in Canada. As worries about the spread of the new strain grow, some Chinese social media users are drawing parallels between the World of Warcraft incident and today's ongoing outbreak. ""We have gone through 2003, and then 2005 gave us a perfect experiment and textbook example of how people could behave,"" said Josh Ye, a writer for the China-based technology website Abacus. ""Now, in 2020, they are looking at these past examples and trying to understand what could possibly happen."" Researchers took particular note of the way that Corrupted Blood was spread in World of Warcraft, and what developer Blizzard did to mitigate it. Ultimately, Blizzard was forced to reset the servers, which eliminated the disease's spread beyond Zul'Gurub's borders. A key driver of the disease's spread, according to Lofgren's research, was players' ability to teleport from one part of the world to another. While teleportation doesn't exist in the real world, high-speed travel via train or plane has officials worried about the spread, particularly as residents prepare to celebrate Asia's Lunar New Year on Saturday. ""The traffic around Lunar New Year is actually the biggest human migration of the year,"" Ye said. ""A lot of people are travelling back and forth."" In-game quarantines were also attempted, but ultimately failed. According to Ye, that has some social media users wondering whether quarantining entire cities will have any benefit. Watching a pandemic unfold in a virtual environment not only provides a look at human behaviour, Lofgren says it confirms what epidemiologists already knew. ""Humans are imperfect and, at times, a little bit irrational,"" he said, adding that often they will defy quarantine orders and other mitigation efforts. ""If you tell people to stop shaking hands and, if you're feeling sick, don't go to work ... there's a lot of both social and economic pressures to ignore those things,"" he explained. When it comes to the Wuhan outbreak, Lofgren says that the Warcraft incident can offer some key insight: ""Expect things to not work the way you think they do."" While the Corrupted Blood outbreak may have been the result of an unintentional coding error, Lofgren sees potential value in unleashing intentional pandemics in safe, virtual environments. ""In the real world, we can observe people's behaviour, but we don't know everything about the rest of the universe. We don't know perfectly if you're sick or not,"" he said. ""In a game, we can, at least in theory, know all of those things. They're programmatic; you can record them."" Lofgren says that unleashing a virus inside a game can be a more ethical — and engaging — approach to gathering data about outbreaks. ""One of the things that's important for me as both a researcher, and then also a player of games, is you need to not get in the way of people's fun.""

459,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:52:51.772Z,Waubgeshig Rice balances historical accuracy with dystopian future in new novel,"This segment originally aired January 27, 2019.   Whether it's in the classroom or a work of fiction it's important to get the history right. For author Waubgeshig Rice, balancing historical accuracy with a dystopian vision of the future in his new novel, Moon of the Crusted Snow, was essential.  In the novel, winter is looming when cell service suddenly goes down in a small Anishinaabe community in northern Canada. When the power goes out, the residents are cut off, food supply dwindles and outsiders come looking for help.  Rice, a journalist and host of Up North, CBC's afternoon show in Sudbury and Thunder Bay, grew up in Wasauksing First Nation, Ontario. He said it was a challenge to include historical context without it sounding like a history lesson and while he drew on his own lived experience he also spoke with others who live farther north to get it right. The Anishinaabe language is also peppered throughout the novel. Rice said he wanted to include the language in a way that's authentically representative. ""It was just about reflecting the day-to-day parlance that thrives in a lot of our communities. [Language] is part of band council meetings, it's part of family gatherings,"" he explained. In some places the words are defined, in others they can be figured out in context, but the book doesn't have a glossary and pronunciation guide. A choice Rice said was intentional. ""There's some work that I think people need to do on their own and I think that's part of active learning."" Understanding who he was writing for, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, was another challenge Rice thought about while writing the book. ""I think it goes beyond that though, when you're considering things because there are a lot Indigenous people who don't necessarily have all the knowledge of this historical context either."" For example, Rice said Indigenous people who were scooped from their families and adopted by non-Indigenous parents, and urban Indigenous people who were not taught Indigenous history in the school system, would not carry that knowledge. Rice said he wasn't exposed to Indigenous authors at school, but acknowledged reading something that reflected his life and experience would have had a profound impact.  ""It would have meant a lot. To have read a book by an Anishinaabe author would have changed my world at a younger age."" Fortunately, an aunt gave him books from authors like Jordan Wheeler, Thomas King, Lee Maracle, Louise Erdrich and Richard Van Camp. ""It was the first time I realized that Indigenous people could be authors,"" he recalled. Rice is optimistic that with increasing appetite for Indigenous stories by Indigenous authors, kids going through the school system now will be able to read a range of books that reflect who they are.   ""Fortunately nowadays there is so many brilliant authors and storytellers out there producing books for young people and I think we're going to have a much more engaged and much richer palette of storytelling coming out of younger Indigenous communities because of that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/radio/unreserved/they-don-t-know-what-they-don-t-know-teachers-reach-out-for-tips-on-integrating-indigenous-content-1.4990312/waubgeshig-rice-balances-historical-accuracy-with-dystopian-future-in-new-novel-1.4992026,[],N/A
460,Jean Laroche,2020-01-24T21:03:26.588Z,Province guarantees loans for forestry contractors caught up in Northern Pulp shutdown,"Forestry contractors who need money to try to weather losses from the Northern Pulp shutdown are being offered up to $180,000 in short-term loans. It is an effort to tide them over while they search for new buyers for their wood. Jeff Bishop, executive director of Forest Nova Scotia, helped create the new program. He said much of the money would go to forest workers dealing with payments for equipment. By freeing up loan payments, Bishop said there might be money to pay workers or to cover other business expenses.  But Bishop said it would not help everyone in the industry who is struggling with big bills. ""That's the hard part of looking at a program like this, that looks at assistance,"" said Bishop. ""You know, when you look at it, there's going to be people that it's just not going to help. ""You hope that it helps as many people that are are willing and able to stay working in the sector."" The Nova Scotia government is guaranteeing the loans, meaning taxpayers will be on the hook if any of that money cannot be repaid. The province is setting aside roughly $5 million for the program. It's the latest aid to be rolled out by the McNeil government in recent weeks to try to cushion the blow from Northern Pulp's decision to shutter its mill in Pictou County. The company will need to cease operations in a week to comply with a law enacted five years ago mandating the closure of the provincially owned effluent treatment plant that has processed the mill's wastewater for a generation. According to a news release issued Friday afternoon, the loans will be available through the 16 credit unions that offer the Small Business Loan Guarantee program. Bishop said the plan was to create a line of credit that people could access for up to a year. Then that money would need to be repaid over the three following years.

461,Steven Webb,2020-01-25T19:51:00.737Z,Romeo Cormier's alter ego Bobby Kay helped define 'golden age of Maritime wrestling',"In the world of professional wrestling, there are two types of wrestlers: ""faces""  and ""heels."" That's wrestling lingo for white hats and black hats, heroes and villains, good guys and bad guys.  And Memramcook's Romeo Cormier, who starred in the wrestling game as Bobby Kay in the 1970s and '80s, was definitely a ""face,"" both in and out of the ring. ""Well, I mean, he was a nice guy."" said wrestling writer Greg Oliver, who met Bobby Kay during a hometown celebration of the famous Cormier brothers. ""Bobby wasn't a braggadocio guy at all."" Romeo Cormier died Jan. 17 at the age of 70. But Bobby Kay lives on in the minds of those people who remember spending Saturday afternoon in front of their TV sets for Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling, long before the days of simulcasting and pay-per-view. The youngest member of the wrestling Cormier brothers, Bobby Kay often teamed up with Rudy Kay (Jean-Louis Cormier), Leo Burke (Leonce Cormier) and the Beast (Yvon Cormier) to do battle with assorted ""heels"" in the ring. In fact, Oliver said the four would often all take part in introducing a new villain. ""So, the new bad guy, Archie (the Stomper) Gouldie may come in, and then he beats Bobby Kay, and then he meets Rudy Kay, but it's a tougher fight, but he beats Rudy,"" said Oliver. ""Then he has a real tough go with, you know, Leo Burke, and that feud goes on for two, three weeks. And, then, of course, at the end, he has to face the Beast, the mad man, 'How's he going to survive this?'"" ""They didn't promote them as brothers, but everyone knew,"" Oliver said. The Cormiers were members of a big Acadian family, 11 children in all, eight brothers, three sisters raised on a farm in the southeastern New Brunswick community of Memramcook. But in the ring, they were always introduced as being from nearby Dorchester, likely because the prison there made the place better known to Maritimers. Romeo followed his brothers into the wrestling game at a young age, heading to Calgary to train at 17. In the late 1960s, Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling was the place many wrestling hopefuls headed. They would train at Hart's school, known as ""the Dungeon,"" a better name than ""Stu's Basement,"" which is what it really was. Hart was known for his punishing training techniques, but Oliver said the few moves Cormier learned there were far less important than the exposure Hart could offer. ""The fact is that you learn more on the road than you do in somebody's basement,"" Oliver said. ""He gave them a chance to perform, right, to actually go out and test your skills and get better at things. If he didn't have access to that, then you're training in a void."" He spent two years wrestling with Stu Hart's organization, under the name Norton Jackson. But the Maritimes beckoned, as wrestling had become a big hit here. Every summer, there were regular weekly stops on the East Coast scene. Monday night, Moncton. Thursday night, Halifax. Saturday night, Berwick, N.S., and later, New Glasgow. The other cities and larger towns also got to see at least one night of wrestling each season. And the Cormier brothers were a big part of those shows. In 1969, their agent Al Zinck set up the Eastern Sports Association in partnership with Jean-Louis Cormier.  From May to October, the brothers would wrestle in a different community each and every night, seven days a week through most of the 1970s. It wasn't an easy life. ""Back in the day, for sure, the guys like Leo made a living out of it, "" Oliver said, ""He travelled, he went around, he knew how to stay fresh and move somewhere else, which is, of course, key to the whole business right."" ""You can really get burnt out."" Then there's the wear and tear on his body. At five feet nine inches tall and 220 pounds, Romeo Cormier was built to take the punishment of the falls and body slams.   But in a business with no health care, no trainers and no doctors, injuries were common. ""Bobby knew enough that, you know, 'I'm never going to dedicate my life to this the way, you know, Leo did,"" Oliver said. ""And he went and got a real job, with a pension, you know, support a family."" ""A lot of guys had to make that decision along the way and it was obviously a tough decision because there's a lot of joy to being on the road,"" Oliver said. ""There's a lot of, you know, pain and heartache, too.""  Cormier also had a second performing love: country music. He would often play and sing songs during the interview portions of his wrestling career, and it became part of the character of Bobby Kay. ""This guy's got a guitar, he can strum, he must be a good guy,"" Oliver said. ""So I think that was a big part of Bobby sticking in people's memory, too."" So much so that Cormier would go on to front the Bobby Kay band. His wrestling name followed him into his music career. And he was good at it, playing clubs regularly in Moncton, when he wasn't at his grocery business day job. But he didn't really leave the game entirely, making several comebacks and special appearances with his brothers. Robert Maillet grew up watching the Cormier brothers wrestling on TV in his hometown of Sainte-Marie-de-Kent. In 1990, he began his wrestling career on a summer tour of Atlantic Grand Prix wrestling. The Cormier brothers, including Romeo, were part of that tour. ""They opened their arms to me,"" Maillet said, ""So I listened to them, I opened my ears to them."" ""I do remember Romeo as a gentleman, you know, in how he conducts himself in the ring. ""I tried to learn from the best."" Romeo Cormier's death means Leonce is the only wrestling Cormier brother still alive. Jean-Louis died in 2008, and Yvon died in 2009. ""I would say they put the Maritimes on the map,"" said Maillet, who himself went on to a career in the World Wrestling Federation. ""It was the golden age of wrestling."" Oliver believes the Cormier brothers' willingness to stay in New Brunswick is a big part of why audiences have so much affection for them. As proof, he points to Nova Scotia-born wrestler Rocky Johnson, who went to the U.S. to become a star. ""He's not celebrated the same way in Nova Scotia as the Cormiers are in New Brunswick because he didn't stay at home, right,"" Oliver said. ""He wasn't on the screen bragging about being from Nova Scotia. ""So I think the Cormiers took that with them everywhere…they took this love and the celebration of the Maritimes with them.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/memramcook-romeo-cormier-bobby-kay-wrestler-singer-1.5439154,[],N/A
462,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-11-28T19:42:49.629Z,Customers file record number of complaints about Canadian telcos,"David Marco has no shortage of unflattering adjectives for Bell Canada — a telecom service provider he says convinced him to sign on as a customer by misrepresenting the true cost of a two-year deal for internet, TV and home phone. ""It's outrageous. It's patently wrong. It's deceptive,"" Marco, 65, told Go Public from his home in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. In October, he filed a complaint with the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) — and he's got company. According to the industry mediator's annual report, consumers filed a record-breaking number of complaints against Canada's telecom companies in 2018-19 — nearly 19,300.  The CCTS says that figure is a 35 per cent increase over 2017-18 and an all-time high in the organization's 12-year history.  ""It's disappointing to see … issues that customers shouldn't have to deal with,"" said CCTS Commissioner Howard Maker. ""It tells us that there's still room for improvement."" The report, released Thursday, tracks complaints received between Aug. 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019, of which the greatest share (over 40 per cent) were billing errors, followed by contract disputes (over 30 per cent) and dissatisfaction with service delivery (over 20 per cent).  CCTS says it ""successfully resolved"" 91 per cent of all concluded complaints. Bell Canada, the country's largest telecom, with 22 million subscriptions, received the most complaints — almost 5,900. (A customer with multiple services from the same provider can be associated with several subscriptions.) Complaints against Bell about incorrect charges and ""disclosure of important information"" were ""disproportionately high,"" according to the report.  A Bell spokesperson notes the company's share of total complaints declined slightly over the previous year, and that it is reviewing the report to ""ensure that they continue to provide customers with the best experience.""  Rogers, which has about 16 million subscriptions, received just over 1,800 complaints. Its share of complaints also slightly decreased over the previous year.  Rogers had a ""disproportionately high percentage"" of complaints about incorrect charges on wireless accounts, but received a slightly lower proportion of complaints about credits and refunds that weren't received on internet services.  A Rogers spokesperson said the company had the fewest complaints per subscriber among the national carriers and has ""started to see progress"" in improving its customer service. Telus, with 14.5 million subscribers, received just over 1,600 complaints — up 71 per cent.  Most of those were about either changes to wireless contracts (28 per cent) or wireless price increases (30 per cent), according to the report. It received a lower proportion of complaints about incorrect wireless charges and contract disputes. ""Shame on us that we had language that was confusing and not transparent,"" Tony Geheren, executive VP at Telus, told Go Public. He says the increase in complaints was a result of a ""poorly executed rate change"" for wireless customers and that Telus has since simplified its contracts.  The report notes 158 violations of the Wireless Code — a 42 per cent increase. Most involved a failure of companies to provide customers with key documents, and not giving proper notice before disconnecting a customer's service. Bell accounted for 29 per cent of all Wireless Code breaches, while Rogers and Telus each accounted for 20 per cent.  Marco's frustration began last March, when he says a Bell sales representative promised him internet, TV and home phone service for $119.90 a month for two years. But in September, the price for his TV service went up by $3.50. When he called Bell, he recorded the conversation, and a second rep told him to look at the contract the company emailed him after he verbally agreed to sign up — it mentions that prices are ""subject to change."" Marco says he didn't scrutinize the contract, because he was going with what the first rep offered him on the phone. He requested a transcript of that conversation but was told that wasn't possible.  ""There will be no way for us, sir, to send you a copy of the transcript,"" the rep said. Marco says that's nonsense. ""The contract was the phone call. They're denying that they have the contract,"" he said.  He says a story reported by Go Public last year supports his argument — a case that went to small claims court determined that a verbal agreement between a customer and Bell trumps any written contract that the telecom giant emails after the fact. CCTS investigated but said it couldn't help, because according to Bell the transcript no longer existed. The company only holds them for six months which, according to a Bell spokesperson, is ""standard practice"" in the industry. ""I think that's problematic,"" said Maker, the head of the CCTS.  ""We've spent a lot of time asking the CRTC … to ensure that service providers are retaining records so that an independent investigation can be obtained and the actual facts can be determined."" ""The ability to … investigate what happened is limited in the absence of that phone call."" Consumer advocate John Lawford says what's really needed is a ban on price increases for internet and TV during the life of a contract — the same way companies aren't permitted to jack up prices during a cellphone contract. ""The Wireless Code doesn't let you change your wireless pricing for two years,"" Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, told Go Public. ""It kind of sets the trap for consumers who are expecting the same protections on internet and TV as they have on their wireless phone."" He says the CRTC missed a ""golden opportunity"" when it created similar rules for internet service, which come into effect on Jan. 31.  ""They allowed the Internet Code to go into effect without the rule that you have to keep the price the same,"" says Lawford. ""It is a very big missed opportunity."" Lawford doesn't think the telco giants will lock in prices for internet and TV contracts unless the regulator demands it. He says people fed up with ""unfair"" contracts should complain to the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and their MP.  ""Put pressure on those powers that be — to make the rules for internet and TV the same as they are for as they are for wireless,"" says Lawford.  Meantime, Marco says he will find another provider when his two-year contract is over. For now, he has advice for anyone calling a telecom.  ""Record the conversation. Record anything — incoming and outgoing,"" he says. ""Because it's the only protection that they'll get.""

463,Anonymous,2020-01-25T09:00:00.369Z,A 'dish that cannot miss': Congolese newcomer serves up popular soup ,"Anuarite Manyoha drops the frozen package of pounded cassava leaves into the pot of boiling water. Next, she adds a bright green blend of onions, leeks, garlic and green peppers — the base of a dish called pondu soup. ""In Congo, pondu is our traditional dish, and cassava is one of our staple foods,"" Manyoha explained. ""It can be eaten at home and even at parties. It's one dish that cannot miss. Everybody likes it!"" Manyoha, the eldest of 11 siblings, came to Canada with her family in 2014 as a refugee. She  said her mom taught her to cook when she was young. Baro Nafissatou Touré watches carefully. She came to Canada from Cameroon three years ago, and misses the flavours from Africa.  Manyoha and Touré, who both arrived in Canada during the coldest time of the year, said they had a hard time adjusting to both the temperature and the food here. ""I had cheese shock. Macaroni and cheese, rice and cheese, burgers and cheese. Everything has cheese here!"" Touré joked. For Manyoha, the sweetness of many Canadian meals, cooked with honey or sweet sauces, was hard to stomach. The two met at church two years ago and have since found time to cook together, sharing tastes from home. When the pondu is nearly cooked, Manyoha gets out a new pot to make the accompanying fufu — a type of dumpling. She measures boiling water and semolina flour, stirring quickly. Once the consistency is right, she takes a small portion of the gluey mixture and tosses it into a ball in a small plastic bowl, repeating until each dumpling is formed. The two sit down to eat in the traditional way, using just their hands instead of spoons and forks. ""There's a saying that if you don't eat with your hands, you haven't eaten,"" Touré says, explaining it doesn't taste the same if you don't eat with your ""natural forks."" For Manyoha, the flavours remind her of big family gatherings, with all her siblings gathered around one table, eating off one large dish. ""Even when we prepare it, it brings back so many memories."" she said. Touré agrees. ""It brings home here."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/what-i-bring-to-the-table-episode-3-congolese-dish-1.5433219,[],N/A
