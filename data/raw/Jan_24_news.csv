1,Anonymous,2020-01-23T01:46:25.214Z,Hit-and-run trial adjourned until Friday over security video time code dispute,"The hit-and-run trial of Maurice Johnson in the death of Brady Francis came to an unexpected halt Wednesday for the third time, following a dispute between the Crown and defence about security video time codes. The Crown was expected to wrap its case with the testimony of the lead investigator, who analyzed security video of the road in Saint-Charles where Francis, 22, of Elsipogtog First Nation, was found dead on Feb. 24, 2018. RCMP Const. Mathieu Richard told the Moncton Court of Queen's Bench he reviewed footage taken from two locations along Saint-Charles South Road — the Saint-Charles gas station and the home of Louis Daigle. Richard said he first observed a light-coloured pickup truck similar to the 2003 GMC Sierra seized from Johnson in the gas station video. It was heading eastbound at 9:40 p.m., according to the time code, but the ""readjusted"" time would be 9:33 p.m., he said. On Tuesday, Richard had testified the time on the security camera was about 7.5 minutes fast, so he adjusted the time codes, based on the time on his cellphone. During cross-examination Wednesday, defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux questioned what steps Richard had taken to verify that the time on his cellphone was correct. ""Am I right in assuming you didn't take any steps?"" he asked. ""Yes, you are correct,"" Richard replied. Lemieux also challenged the officer about what he had done to verify no one had tampered with the security camera system or whether there had been a power outage. Richard said he didn't check either. Lemieux argued Richard had improperly modified his document, entitled Timeline of Events, and that it should not be entered into evidence. Crown prosecutor Pierre Gionet requested time to prepare his response. Justice Denise LeBlanc agreed and adjourned the trial until Friday at 9:30 a.m. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. Richard is expected to be the Crown's final witness. The defence is expected to call four witnesses. It's not clear whether the accused will take the stand. Earlier in the trial, the former owner and operator of the Saint-Charles gas station testified the time code on her security camera was about seven or eight minutes off from the actual time. The court also heard from the stepdaughter of Louis Daigle, who said the time code on his security camera was off by about two or three minutes. The gas station video shows Francis walking eastbound along the road a few minutes before the light-coloured truck drives past. Lemieux pointed out eight other vehicles are captured on the videos, five travelling eastbound and three westbound. He asked Richard whether any of them were checked for damage. They were not, said Richard. The court has heard the damage to the front of Johnson's truck was consistent with a pedestrian being struck. Francis's body was found lying on the side of the westbound lane, between the gas station and a friend's house farther east down the road, where he had attended a diaper party. The Crown argued the video evidence helps complete the picture and prove the Crown's theory that the truck Johnson was driving was the one that struck Francis. Earlier this week, the court watched Johnson's videotaped statement to police and heard from officers who questioned him following the incident. Johnson told police he initially thought he had struck a deer in Saint-Charles during a leisure drive with his wife the night Francis was killed. Under police questioning, Johnson said he had not consumed any alcohol or drugs. Elsipogtog First Nation Chief Arren Sock was among those who attended the proceedings on Wednesday. He was in the adjacent courtroom, where a volunteer is providing translation for the family and friends of Francis who do not speak French. The trial, which began on Jan. 13, is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-8-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5435631,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-7-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5434158 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-6-brady-francis-trial-1.5432117,N/A

Olympian Waneek Horn-Miller. Lawyer Pam Palmater. Surgeon Donna May Kimmaliardjuk. These are some of the women a national awareness campaign wants people to know and recognize for being strong, resilient, inspiring, wise, nurturing and trailblazing First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women across Canada. The campaign is called She is Indigenous. Funded by the Province of Ontario, the campaign is led by Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak, the national organization representing Métis women, and supported by a number of provincial and national Indigenous organizations. ""We really want to re-write that narrative that Indigenous women are vulnerable and at-risk individuals. Instead, we see Indigenous women as profoundly kind, ambitious, and inspirational,"" said Tamsin Fitzgerald, senior policy analyst at Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak. Close to 100 women have been featured since the campaign launched in June 2019 online with the goal of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls. It launched the same month as the release of the final report of the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak issued its own report in the fall. With She is Indigenous, Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak wanted to work toward the same goal of reducing violence against Indigenous women and girls but from a different approach.  Fitzgerald said the campaign challenges negative stereotypes, educates Canadians about First Nations, Inuit, and Métis issues, and supports Indigenous women by honouring their unique strengths and accomplishments. ""The main goal is to support everyday Indigenous women and highlight their contributions,"" she said. One of those women is Celeste Beauchamp. The 20-year-old Kanien'kehá:ka (Mohawk) from Kahnawake works as a youth reconciliation initiative co-ordinator at Canadian Roots Exchange in Ottawa. She said she likes that the campaign focuses on the inherent strengths of Indigenous women. ""We're empowered in just being women,"" said Beauchamp.  ""We get really caught up in our resilience, constantly fighting for our community, constantly fighting for our land and our languages, that we forgot that we're whole in ourselves. We have to take care of ourselves and honour our own power."" Tenille Campbell, the Dene/Métis poet of #IndianLovePoems and photographer behind Sweetmoon Photography, is another woman profiled in the campaign.  ""I really like the idea of visually taking up space,"" she said. Every other day, She is Indigenous posts a profile of an Indigenous woman on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The plan is to continue indefinitely, and encourage others to participate by nominating themselves or an Indigenous woman in their life. ""So often, one of the main narratives about us is our struggle, which is important, but there's also joy, strength, intelligence, and kinship. There's so many other aspects of being an Indigenous woman other than just surviving,"" said Campbell. ""I like the idea that it was positive-based — highlighting our strengths and not what we overcome to become who we are but celebrating who we are.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/she-is-indigenous-campaign-1.5435108,https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-inquiry-police-followup-1.5335784 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/mmiwg-indigenous-policing-program-1.5339727,N/A
3,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-22T23:06:04.104Z,Judge rules Jason McKay had clear operating mind while saying 'I killed my wife',"Jason McKay answered his door covered in blood and proceeded to tell police officers without emotion that he had killed his wife, according to testimony heard last week at Regina's Court of Queen's Bench.  One officer testified that McKay said verbatim, ""She's dead. I ​f--king killed her."" Testimony from the two officers who went to the McKay home in the early morning hours of Sept.6, 2017, was given as part of a voir dire. Video recordings of McKay in the police car shortly after his arrest and evidence about what happened at the police station were also subject to the trial within a trial.  At issue was whether Jason had spoken voluntarily to police with a ""clear operating mind."" Justice Michael Tochor found that he did in all cases, presenting his decision Wednesday at the Court of Queen's Bench in Regina.  The judge noted Jason was informed of his right to a lawyer and to silence after his arrest, yet made unprompted statements like ""I already know I'm charged for murder because she's dead,"" ""I've got nothing to lose,"" and ""she's cold as ice.""  These statements were all caught on camera.  Tochor was satisfied that Jason understood these words could be used to his detriment. Even at the police station, Jason continued to say things like ""I know my wife is dead, I watched her for two hours,"" and ""I killed my wife.""  ""He had the cognitive ability to understand what he was saying,"" Tochor ruled.  Defence lawyer Thomas Hynes suggested that Jason made the statements while intoxicated. Jenny's cousin had spoken with him on the phone earlier in the evening and suspected he was intoxicated and Jason's mom said he wasn't making sense on the phone. Still, Tochor found the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Jason voluntarily made statements in the presence of police officers with an operating mind. Furthermore, he found Jason spoke in the absence of threats, promises, an atmosphere of oppression or police trickery.   Tochor was also tasked with ruling on a second voir dire that involved evidence meant to illustrate the state of their relationship and Jenny's state of mind. He ruled that most of the evidence would be considered admissible to the trial.  Only days before her death, Jenny had called 911 after Jason returned to their home following a dispute, saying ""he said he's going to kill me."" During the call, she described Jason as violent, unpredictable and threatening.  Another police officer testified Jenny told him she didn't feel safe and wanted an exit plan.  Her coworker testified that Jenny said ""he beats me in ways no one can see,"" and another testified that Jenny referred to being hit often.  A text message from Jenny to Jason read: ""I'm afraid of you.""  Hynes had argued that Jenny was unreliable because of her alleged problem with alcohol. He also suggested Jenny had a motive to fabricate statements to coworkers, as a possible excuse for work performance. Tochor was unsatisfied with both arguments, finding the evidence to be corroborated and consistent.  Tochor ruled that some testimony about Jason's behaviour toward Jenny was also admissible. This included Jason's daughter's account of Jason allegedly striking Jenny, as well as information from Jenny's coworker who said she saw Jason attempt to strike Jenny in the stomach.  The judge reminded the lawyers that while much of the voir dire evidence is admissible, relevance exists on a spectrum and he couldn't yet say how relevant these bits of evidence are or whether they will be relied upon in the final decision.  Crown prosecutor Adam Breker concluded his case after the judge ruled on the voir dires. The defence will begin its case on Thursday morning. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-murder-trial-voir-dire-1.5436612,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-pleads-not-guilty-second-degree-murder-1.5425288 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-forensic-pathologist-1.5431074 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-degree-murder-1.5427060 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-trial-second-week-second-degree-murder-1.5433136,N/A

An Alberta biologist is refusing to be a gloomy Gus, however, and says there is an upside. ""There was a significant killing of mountain pine beetle in those areas as a result of these very low temperatures,"" Janice Cooke at the University of Alberta told The Homestretch. ""We are seeing patches where we see better than 95 per cent death, so less than five per cent are living in these areas. We will know for sure when May rolls around and surveys are done."" That's two years of help in the fight against those devastating little critters that ravaged much of British Columbia and parts of Alberta in the 2000s. ""From last year, we had a nasty winter as well, and we saw in those May surveys confirmation that a lot of beetles had been killed."" Currently in Alberta, mountain pine beetle are concentrated east of Jasper and around Hinton. ""We also see them trying to make their way into the jack pine of the boreal forest, in the east-central part of the province,"" Cooke said. The mountain pine beetle are tricky to deal with because they spend their entire life underneath tree bark, forcing the province to take a scorched-earth approach. ""The province surveys for beetle-attacked trees in the autumn, creates maps and sends crews in the winter who fall them on the spot and burn them to kill all the larvae."" But even then, the most biologists can hope for is management, not complete eradication, she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/mountain-pine-beetle-cold-snap-1.5436844,[],N/A
5,Jean Laroche,2020-01-23T20:28:26.185Z,Premier rejects call for all-party committee to deal with Northern Pulp closure,"Premier Stephen McNeil has dismissed a call by the Official Opposition to create an all-party committee of the Nova Scotia Legislature to tour the province so that elected officials could hear directly from those who will be most affected by the impending shutdown of Northern Pulp. ""The last thing we need is to politicize this issue,"" McNeil told reporters in North Sydney, N.S., on Thursday following a government announcement. McNeil said he specifically chose not to put politicians on the forestry transition team, which is made up of senior bureaucrats and industry representatives. They've been tasked with finding ways to cushion the blow for those who work at the mill or rely on the forest sector for all of part of their livelihood. McNeil said government officials have been working diligently with the transition team, investments have been announced and there will be more to come. Earlier Thursday, PC Leader Tim Houston characterized the Liberal government's response to the Pictou County, N.S., company's shutdown as ""failed,"" ""ill-prepared"" and ""confused."" He said the provincial government can't answer basic questions about the $50-million transition fund that will help those in need. ""Who would qualify for transition funding? How they would qualify for transition funding?"" said Houston at Province House. ""We've seen a lot of confusion, a lot of mixed messages."" Although the PC leader said he was ready to work with the governing Liberals to find solutions, he spent as much time criticizing McNeil and his cabinet for what he claims they have failed to do. McNeil said the forestry transition team is getting input from MLAs, including at least one member from the PC ranks: Cumberland North MLA Elizabeth Smith-McCrossin. McNeil said McCrossin is ""holding meetings and sending in constructive ideas that the committee is looking at and using. That's where elected officials can play a role."" McNeil also made mention of a loan program for small and medium-size contractors that he said was announced Wednesday. In fact, the program is expected to be announced Friday. This isn't the first time someone has called for a special committee of the legislature to be created to look at forestry in Nova Scotia. In 1985, the government of John Buchanan created a select committee to examine ""the use of wood chips, wood residue and other forest biomass from Nova Scotia forests, as an energy source for domestic industrial commercial, agricultural and industrial energy needs in Nova Scotia.""

The project was two years in the making for Matthew Serge Guy, a London-based cat lover who raised $74,575.78 on Kickstarter to make it happen.  The approximately 170-cm tall bronze statue shows the French feline perched atop a globe and gazing toward the stars. It was quietly unveiled at the university near Strasbourg last month. ""I'd just like to thank the over 1,000 backers that came together to fund the project, and willingly put their trust in a somewhat naive person who's never made a statue before,"" Guy told As It Happens in an email. ""I think it turned out pretty well."" The statue was designed by sculpture Gill Parker, and forged by Sculpture Castings in Basingstoke, U.K. Félicette  — also known as ""Astrocat"" — was blasted 200 kilometres above Earth on Oct. 21, 1963, in a liquid-fuelled French Véronique AG1 rocket, and returned 13 minutes later.  It's not clear whether Félicette was purchased from a pet shop or hauled off the streets of Paris, but she was one of 14 felines put into training for a French space mission. While much has been written about the other animals of the space race — including Laika the Soviet dog, and American monkeys Able and Miss Baker — Guy says there's been little fanfare about Félicette. ""The space race [was] very much between the dogs in Russia and the monkeys in America,"" Guy told As It Happens host Carol Off in November 2017, shortly after he kicked off the crowdfunding campaign. ""The cat in Europe was kind of forgotten about along the way."" Whitehorse schoolteacher Emily Macht was so inspired when she heard Félicette's story on As It Happens, that she decided to tell her Grade 5 class about it. ""Kids at this age are really drawn to stories that involve animals, first of all, and this class in particular has a lot of animal lovers and specifically cat lovers, so I knew they would love it,"" Macht told As It Happens in December 2017. The students also wanted to honour the unsung space kitty, so they sculpted their own clay models of Félicette. ""Kids this age are also really drawn to notions of fairness and unfairness,"" Macht said.  Guy called the kids' sculptures ""magnificent creations."" On hand for Félicette's unveiling were Lilla Merabet, vice-president of the GrandEst region; astronauts Helen Sharman, Paolo Nespoli and Reinhold Ewald; and Philippe Jung, co-author of the academic paper ""Felicette, the only space cat."" If you'd like to see it in person, Guy recommends getting in touch with university officials first. ""It is a working university, and sometimes the hall Félicette is in is used for exams or other such activities, so it's not always accessible,"" he said in a Kickstarter post announcing the unveiling.""But with some notice, I'm sure they could accommodate you.""

He was 100. Smith was born in East Brighton, England in 1919 and came to Winnipeg in 1933 where he enrolled at the Winnipeg School of Art. His career as a painter and teacher spanned right up until his death. ""A key figure in Canadian art, Smith lived his life with a generosity and grace that was a gift to the world,"" said Vancouver's Equinox Gallery in a statement. Most of Smith's work reflected the landscape and natural world around him. His pieces are often a sweeping tangle of form and colour. He had his first professional exhibition in 1938.  His artistic career included two major retrospectives at the Vancouver Art Gallery, more than 25 solo exhibitions at Equinox Gallery, participation in biennial exhibitions in Canada and Brazil, as well as significant commissions including the design of the Canadian Pavilion for Expo '70 in Osaka, in collaboration with Arthur Erickson. He also produced and major works for public buildings in Washington, D.C. and London, U.K. In 1941 he married Marion Fleming and their marriage spanned 70 years. Fleming died in 2009, but together they founded the Gordon and Marion Smith Foundation for Young Artists which supports art education for young students. Robert Heffel, the vice president of Heffel Fine Art Auction House, began selling Smith's work in 1995. Heffel and his wife, along with his brother David and his wife,became close with the Smiths. ""Gordon Smith is probably the most loved artist, the most loved you'll ever know, everybody that met him, loved him."" said Heffel. ""He was just such a warm, genuine person."" Heffel said every day, right up until the end of his life we went to his studio. ""Everyday he painted, that was his life, that's what he lived for."" Smith taught at the Vancouver School of Art and at UBC from 1956 to 1982 when he retired from teaching to focus on painting full time. In 2017, he created an exhibition called ""Black Paintings,"" which reflected his time as an Intelligence Officer in the Canadian Infantry. In the past decade his works became more sought after as buyers around the world paid record amounts for Canadian works from artists such as Emily Carr, Jean-Paul Riopelle and The Group of Seven painters. In 2013, Smith's 1965 abstract Red Beach was featured on the cover of Heffel Fine Art Auction House's contemporary catalogue and ended up fetching $93,600, three times the high-end of its presale estimate. ""It's fair to say that when you put his great paintings beside other great paintings, he stands out as one of the greats, for sure,"" said Heffel. Smith received many accolades over the course of his career including the Order of Canada in 1996, the Order of British Columbia in 2000, the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts in 2009 and the Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Visual Arts in 2007. ""Gordon Smith, an exceptional artist and uniquely generous human being, will be greatly missed by all who had the privilege to know him,"" said Equinox.

9,"Tyana Grundig, Jeannie Stiglic, Makda Ghebresslassie",2019-11-22T09:00:00.413Z,Hidden camera investigation reveals 'scary' and 'misleading' sales pitches to sell blue light lenses ,"It's no secret that we're spending more time in front of screens than ever before. Canadians say they spend almost 11 hours a day in front of them — at their desks, on their laptops and especially on their smartphones. But after a long day at work, our eyes often start to feel dry, tired and strained, and many people are desperate for a solution.  Enter blue light filtering lenses. Optical chains say they protect our eyes from blue light emitted from digital screens, and consumers are buying in.  And it turns out it's not just eye strain they want to warn us about. A hidden camera investigation by CBC's Marketplace found sales associates at some of Canada's largest optical chains making ""misleading"" health claims about blue light from digital screens, but experts say there is no scientific evidence that blue light from computer monitors and screens is harmful. Staff at four leading chains cautioned buyers that digital screens could damage their retinas and could lead to serious eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. Two opticians at Hudson's Bay Optical suggested a link to cancer based on an in-store pamphlet provided by lens manufacturer VisionEase, while Vogue Optical's website suggests blue light may increase the risk of ""certain types of cancers."" Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery later told Marketplace the pamphlet is ""incorrect"" and will be pulled from Hudson's Bay Optical stores.  But experts in the fields of optometry and ophthalmology say there's no evidence that blue light from digital screens is harmful.  Dr. Rahul Khurana, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said the idea of blue-light blocking is ""flawed on so many levels."" ""Blue light fear, paranoia, is really out there,"" said Khurana. ""But there's no evidence to show it's truly dangerous and blocking it has not ever [been] shown to [have] any benefits."" Marketplace producers went undercover and visited multiple Hakim Optical, Vogue Optical, Hudson's Bay Optical's Glasses Gallery and LensCrafters locations in southern Ontario to see how the companies market the lenses to consumers.  Several dispensing opticians and salespeople told the producers that blue light from digital screens can lead to fatigue and headaches. One optician said blue light has ""very sharp rays, penetrating at the back of the eyes,"" while another salesperson said ""it tears the eyes right out of you."" Watch Marketplace go undercover at optional retailers: But more ""serious"" and even ""scary-sounding"" to ophthalmologist and macular specialist Dr. Sunir Garg were claims that blue light from digital devices might lead to retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and possibly cancer.  Buying blue light filtering lenses, it was suggested, might eliminate these risks. ""They're introducing this technology that blocks [the digital blue light] out,"" said one student optician. ""So we are not going to be seeing things like cataracts or macular degeneration, damage to your retina, things like that.""  Many of these claims are also found on Vogue Optical, Hakim, and LensCrafters websites and promotional material. Marketplace asked Garg, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and an ophthalmologist at the Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, to review the hidden camera footage.  He was concerned about how salespeople and opticians were ""misleading"" customers with claims about how the light from screens can damage eyes. Retinal damage and macular degeneration are ""serious"" claims, Garg said, ""but the blue lights from your screen is not the cause of that stuff.""  ""I think a lot of this is just to create fear and confusion and when people have fear and are confused, they end up spending money on things they don't need to spend money on,"" said Garg.  Garg's research has led him to conclude that far from benefiting customers, these lenses are mostly benefiting the companies that are selling them. ""Maybe those [blue light filtering lenses] are decisions made in different boardrooms across the country and around the world,"" Garg said, ""but from a science perspective, I don't think people need to worry about this at all.""  He doesn't blame the staff at these chains for spreading these claims, however.  ""I can't fault them [because] I'm sure they're getting a little info sheet that says here's three talking points about blue light-blocking lenses, but it's not based on scientific data,"" Garg said.  ""People will quote that blue light can hurt retinal cells,"" Garg said, ""but what they're not telling you is that it's not been shown in any group of people who are using their screens.""  The science into the harms from blue light is mostly done with retinal cells in a petri dish, he said, ""or taking a poor mouse and and shining a blue light ray intensely into their eyeball for hours on end."" Both Khurana and Garg told Marketplace there's no research that suggests blue light filtering lenses are necessary.  Phillip Yuhas, an assistant professor of optometry at Ohio State University, agrees. He said studies have shown people blink far less during computer use and that blue light filters have not shown any improved ""visual comfort"" for digital eye strain.  Khurana said if the problem people are having is from digital eyestrain, then blue light filters are doing nothing to address the core issue and ""could be doing more harm than good.""  But that hasn't stopped eyeglass retailers from promoting them. One optician told Marketplace  the blue filter lens is like an ""extra shield on top of your eyes to protect your eyes from harmful rays.""  The lenses can be purchased with or without a prescription and range in price from $20 to more than $100.     Global sales of the lenses reached $18 million US in 2019, according to Marketwatch.com, and are projected to exceed $27 million US by 2024.    Staring at screens for a long time can make eyes feel dry, tired and strained, but blue light is not the culprit, said Garg, and purchasing special lenses won't fix the issue. ""What's bothering [people] isn't the blue light. It's the fact that when they're staring at their screen a lot they're not blinking as often. ""That causes the eye to dry out, [and] when your eyes become dry, they become irritated and scratchy and tired.""  To deal with that, he recommends a simple fix. It's called  ""the 20-20-20 rule.""  Look at least 20 feet (six metres) away from your screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes.  Blue light does wake us up and make us more alert, so too much late at night can make it hard to get to sleep. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends turning off devices or turning on blue light filters, a couple of hours before going to bed.  In the United Kingdom, claims like the ones heard in Canada by Marketplace producers aren't allowed. Opticians and eyeglass retailers risk being fined if they make unproven claims about blue light from digital devices. In 2015, Boots Opticians were reprimanded and fined 400,000 pounds for making ""misleading"" claims that blue light causes retinal damage.   Dr. John O'Hagan, an optical radiation expert who works for Public Health England's (PHE) centre for radiation, chemical and environmental hazards, conducted a study on blue light from digital devices on behalf of the organization.  He analyzed the amount of blue light coming from various sources including the sky, lightbulbs, mobile phones and computer screens.  ""Blue light in our normal environment is not dangerous at all,"" O'Hagan told Marketplace ""The main source of blue light for us is from the sky and a nice sunny day."" The PHE study found that for smartphones, laptops and digital devices, the amount of blue light emitted was less than one per cent of the safe exposure level, even if stared at all day.  O'Hagan said that the light levels from a smartphone, tablet or laptop are ""considerably below the levels that we experience outside, even in winter."" We get about 30 times more blue light just by being outside, he said.  ""You could stare at your phone all day long, right above the face, and the amount of blue light is not significant,"" O'Hagan said.  ""There is no evidence that blue light from your mobile or other devices is harmful.""  Marketplace reached out to the four eyeglass retailers visited by producers.  Hudson's Bay Optical/Glasses Gallery said Marketplace was given wrong information when it comes to cancer and macular degeneration from digital blue light, and says it will be pulling all Vision Ease pamphlets and marketing materials immediately from all stores. It says all staff will be retrained in the coming weeks and it is ""committed to providing the very best experience for our customers."" Manufacturer Vision-Ease said they ""stand by their marketing materials"" and say the science around blue light is ""conflicting"" and ""ambiguous"" and more studies are needed.  LensCrafters said ""while we train our associates on all products, including blue light and blue IQ lenses, some inconsistencies are possible in how individual associates articulate this topic across our stores. We plan to reinforce our in-store training as the awareness around the potential risks of blue light grows."" Vogue Optical said ""optical science evolves very quickly"" and ""there is a high volume of ongoing studies on blue light, some of which point to damaging effects on the eye."" They also said they are putting considerable effort into educating staff to help educate consumers about what's available on the market and help them make the best choices.   Hakim Optical says there is evidence that blue light is damaging, and they ""will continue to respect and support the licensed optician's obligation to protect and educate the public with all available information and options related to their eye health care."" They also said ""there is no evidence of harm from the blue-light filter upgrade.""  Health Canada says prescription lenses are regulated through the Medical Devices Regulations and the Food and Drugs Act.   As the Food and Drugs Act ""prohibits false, misleading or deceptive advertising of a medical device, such as the promotion of claims without safety and effectiveness data,"" Health Canada said it will follow up with the optical chains to determine whether medical devices are being advertised or sold in Canada with unsupported health claims. The Ontario Opticians Association told Marketplace ""there is an overwhelming number of clients who have expressed satisfaction with their blue light filters, in that they reduced or eliminated headaches, fatigue, eyestrain and the like."" For people who are concerned about good eye health, Garg has some other suggestions — and they don't include lenses to block blue light.  ""Do things like take a break periodically, start quieting down before nighttime, eat a good diet, exercise and not smoke … all those things will help eyes way more than spending money on these blue blocking lenses.""  Sit about 63 centimetres (arm's length) from the computer screen. Position the screen so you are gazing slightly downward. Reduce screen glare by using a matte screen filter if needed. Take regular breaks using the ""20-20-20"" rule: every 20 minutes, shift your eyes to look at an object at least 20 feet (six metres) away for at least 20 seconds. When your eyes feel dry, use artificial tears to refresh them. Adjust room lighting and try increasing the screen contrast to reduce eye strain. If you wear contact lenses, give your eyes a break by wearing glasses.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-blue-light-lenses-hidden-camera-investigation-1.5364678,[],N/A
10,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-07T22:08:05.248Z,Medical device used during labour falls out of patient 10 weeks later,"As Laura Jokinen made her way home from a walk with her newborn son in October 2018, the shooting pain she'd been experiencing in her abdomen for weeks became unbearable. She limped home and buckled to the floor, screaming for her husband to help. ""It was at that point I reached down and felt a metal device protruding out of my vagina,"" said Jokinen, who works in health care as a risks assessment researcher. ""I freaked out … I didn't know what the device was or where it came from. It looked almost like a battery, and there were wires that were running up inside me. I was afraid to remove it, because I wasn't sure if it was attached to my insides."" The experience points to alarming statistics. Canada saw a major jump — 14 per cent over the last five years — in the number of medical items left inside patients after procedures, according to a study released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), a not-for-profit group that collects data on the quality of health care in the country.  CIHI said 553 such objects were left inside patients over the last two years.  Canada has the highest rate among developed countries of medical items being left inside patients, according to a separate study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That means medical teams across the country need to do a better job of following existing safety procedures, according to Sandi Kossey, senior director of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI), a not-for-profit healthcare watchdog. ""There are checks and balances that should happen,"" said Kossey. ""There are enough preventative measures that should be in place, that these things should not happen."" Jokinen, who lives in Parksville, B.C., had to have an emergency caesarean section on Aug. 11, 2018, at the Nanaimo General Hospital. Before surgery, the medical team attached an electrode to the baby's head while he was still in the womb to monitor his heartbeat. Part of the monitor was removed during the C-section. But the medical team forgot to take out the rest.  Two weeks after Jokinen was discharged, she started having complications: an infection of her surgical incision and heavy, prolonged vaginal bleeding. Her doctors prescribed antibiotics but didn't detect what had been left inside her. It remained there for 10 weeks until it dislodged. Jokinen tried to find out, through the regional health authority, what the monitor was made of and how the mistake might have affected her health and that of her baby. ""At that point, he was two months old and I was breastfeeding, so I was really concerned about what risks this posed to his health,"" Jokinen said. Jokinen says she was on pins and needles for more than a month waiting to hear back. The response she finally got, she says, was less than helpful. The Vancouver Island Health Authority told her even the manufacturer couldn't say what the effect might be since the device was only designed and tested for use over periods of 24 hours or less. It said it looked at devices made of similar materials and didn't believe there were any long-term risks to Jokinen or her baby from the breakdown of the components.  Jokinen says she wanted the health authority to take responsibility, but it refused, saying the failure was by the surgeon who is an independent contractor and not an employee.  ""Physicians in B.C. are independent contractors who are licensed and regulated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C.,"" the authority said in an email to Go Public.  Jokinen said she was surprised by  the health authority's reaction. ""They're responsible for their subcontractor's actions and … providing safeguards to make sure that people aren't harmed."" Kossey, at the CPSI, agrees. ""Certainly, they are responsible for what happens under their watch and within their facility,"" she said.  Jokinen chose not to pursue action against the surgeon. Go Public reached out to HealthCareCAN, an organization that represents hospitals across Canada, for comment but did not immediately hear back.  According to the most recent report on the quality of healthcare in OECD countries, a foreign body — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — is left inside a patient in Canada 9.8 times out of every 100,000 surgeries. That's three times the average. The next-highest OECD results were Sweden at 8.3 followed by Netherlands with 4.6 per 100,000. ""The data shows that we're not doing as good as we should be as a developed country,"" Kossey told Go Public.  But she also suggests the reason Canada appears to have more mistakes could be in the accuracy of the reporting itself. ""Some of the other countries … being compared against may have different cultures around how they're collecting and using that information … it's a bit of a mixed signal,"" she said.  Kossey says medical teams need to ensure they do an appropriate inventory of equipment used during all procedures and to communicate clearly with the patient and family members — even in the most chaotic situations — what's being done so there are no surprises. Jokinen was surprised to hear how often something goes wrong. ""That points at a systemic flaw in our healthcare system,"" she said. ""In order to address that, we need to first acknowledge that it's happening. The health authorities need to take responsibility for the actions of their subcontractors and they also have to come up with a mitigation plan to avoid these types of events,"" she said.  The Vancouver Island Health Authority told Jokinen it has made changes. Non-surgical devices like the monitor that was left inside her were added to a checklist of items that need to be retrieved after medical procedures. ""We deeply regret that this patient had a poor care experience and we sincerely apologize to her,"" a spokesperson wrote in its email to Go Public.

11,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-22T15:11:34.498Z,"As teen recovers from near-fatal accident, his family bonds with teen who struck him","As Alex Nelson lies in a dimmed room at the Saint John Regional Hospital, he grips a set of cream-coloured rosary beads.  They were a gift from Hanna Bordage, the 16-year-old girl who was driving the black Honda that struck him earlier this month near the corner of Prospect Street and Duncan Lane in Fredericton. ""Alex has not let go of it since,"" said his mother, Terri Taylor. The crash left the 18-year-old with a serious brain injury, and he spent days fighting for his life. ""I just keep trying to remind myself of the little bits of light through all this darkness,"" Taylor said. Although Taylor wishes she could go back in time and change what happened that day, she wouldn't take back meeting the Bordage family. The near-fatal crash on Jan. 8 sparked an unlikely friendship between the two Fredericton families, who otherwise might never have met. The families have supported each other in Facebook messages, a joint visit to the hospital where Alex is staying and a handwritten note about forgiveness. ""We're going to get through this together,"" Taylor said. Over the past two weeks, Taylor has used Facebook posts to keep family and friends updated on Alex's recovery from the crash. One of the posts asked readers to pray for the driver who hit him. That's when Hanna decided to reach out to Alex's family. She sent a Facebook message to Julia, Alex's 16-year-old sister. Hanna introduced herself and asked how Alex was making out in hospital and apologized over and over again for striking him.  ""She didn't mean to hurt him,"" Taylor said. The two families decided to finally meet in person. Hanna, her mom, aunt and grandmother met over the weekend at the hospital in Saint John.  ""You don't know what to say,"" said Hanna's mother, Joemana Bordage. ""You just know you have to be there."" Hanna sat outside while her mother went into Alex's hospital room. She wasn't ready to meet him face to face just yet.  Both mothers understood. When Alex's mother told him Hanna's mother had come to visit, he reached out and squeezed Bordage's hand.  Weak and unable to speak clearly, he whispered into his own mother's ear. He asked about Hanna. ""He is fighting for his life in a hospital bed and he is concerned about Hanna,"" said Bordage, who held back tears at the time. Then Bordage gave him Hanna's rosary beads, which she'd received after her baptism at six months old. He weaved the beads through his fingers. ""That's how we get through things,"" said Bordage. ""We pray.""' Hanna, a Grade 11 student at École Sainte-Anne in Fredericton, was driving home from school in a snowstorm on that day in early January. The newly licensed driver knew the roads were poor. And Hanna's father cautioned her to be careful and drive slowly — even if it angered other drivers. The teen even turned the music off inside her car to concentrate. The avid soccer player and straight-A student said she was driving 20 kilometres below the speed limit when she spotted a pedestrian walking in the same direction on the side of the busy street. There aren't any sidewalks in that area. She swerved into the median of Prospect Street — putting herself in danger — while trying to dodge the pedestrian, who was Alex.  But it was too late. Her car hit Alex and sent him into the ditch. Hanna immediately called 911. When paramedics arrived, Alex's face was swollen and covered in dirt.  There was blood everywhere. Just before the crash, Alex told his mom he was going for a walk to Tim Hortons.  The Grade 12 Fredericton High School student battles anxiety and depression, so walking was a way to clear his head. ""The last thing I said to him was, 'Be careful and I love you,'"" said Taylor. About 20 minutes later, she heard sirens about 100 metres from her home. She didn't think anything of it and drove her daughter, Julia, to work at the north-side Dairy Queen. When she returned home, Taylor noticed her son's black Sorel boots weren't in the doorway. ""I had this sickening feeling consume me."" Instinctively, Taylor ran out of the house, in her navy snowflake pyjamas and white slippers, to the accident scene, where police confirmed it was her son who had been hit. Alex was immediately sent to the Saint John Regional Hospital. He had surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The surgery lasted just over an hour, but ""felt like a million years,"" Taylor said.  ""We were just moments away from losing him."" Taylor is adamant the crash wasn't Hanna's fault. In fact, she believes the teen's quick reaction is what kept Alex from suffering more serious injury. ""She is as damaged emotionally as my son is physically,"" Taylor said. There haven't been any criminal charges following the crash. Alex will be staying at the hospital for several months and will move to the Stan Cassidy Centre for Rehabilitation in Fredericton after that. Taylor and Bordage have been texting and talking over the phone — especially on the bad days. They share jokes, laugh and cry together. ""We'll forever be family now,"" Taylor said. Alex has broken bones on the right side of his skull and his maxillary sinuses are shattered. He is relearning how to walk and eat on his own. The right side of his face is paralyzed.  In the future, Alex could struggle to walk and talk — he could even lose his memory and cognitive ability. Doctors still don't know whether he'll be the same person he was before the crash. But he did manage to write his first sentence this week:   ""I'll always forgive.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/car-crash-friendship-mothers-brain-injury-1.5433745,[],N/A
12,Jonathan Montpetit,2020-01-22T21:02:51.940Z,Jean Charest unloads on Quebec's anti-corruption unit as he opts out of Tory leadership race,"Former Quebec Liberal premier Jean Charest has sought to undermine the credibility of an ongoing corruption investigation into his political career, slamming the provincial anti-corruption unit as he announced he won't be running for the federal Conservative leadership. In an interview Tuesday with Radio-Canada, Charest accused Quebec's anti-corruption unit (UPAC) of conducting a ""fishing expedition."" He also cast doubt on the reliability of information gathered by UPAC investigators and defended a friend suspected of defrauding the government. It is the first time since leaving office in 2012 that Charest has directly addressed allegations that engineering and construction companies in Quebec were able to secure government contracts by donating to the Quebec Liberal Party. After Charest had stepped down, a public inquiry heard evidence that during his time as premier, the provincial Liberals benefited from millions in illegal donations. The anti-corruption unit, which Charest's government created in 2011, subsequently opened an investigation into Liberal fundraising practices. Media reports suggested Charest was a key figure in that investigation. In his comments Tuesday, Charest confirmed he'd been singled out by UPAC. He said investigators had questioned a wide circle of his contacts, including former political organizers from as far back as the early 1980s. ""What do you call it when, suddenly, you begin an investigation and you interrogate 300 people about someone's life? Is that not called a fishing expedition?"" asked Charest. The investigation has been going on for six years, and no one has yet been charged. It was ""common sense,"" he said, to ask for the investigation to end. Charest's demand was echoed by the party's current house leader, Marc Tanguay. ""We're asking UPAC, really, to close this investigation one way or another,"" Tanguay said Wednesday. ""It doesn't make sense that it's been six years."" The government, though, scoffed at Tanguay's remarks. ""It's very audacious for a Liberal MNA to make that request,"" said Andrée Laforest, the interim public security minister.  ""We're going to let the investigation follow its course."" MNAs for Québec Solidaire and the Parti Québécois made similar comments. ""Me, I'll believe UPAC,"" said Manon Massé, parliamentary leader of QS. On Wednesday afternoon, UPAC issued a statement saying it was important that the anti-corruption unit ""be able to make its operational decisions with complete independence."" The head of UPAC, Frédérick Gaudreau, said in the statement that he understood the ""impatience"" for answers, and promised to inform the public when the investigation was completed. Tanguay tweeted later to say he respected UPAC's independence.   Though Tuesday's interview with Radio-Canada began with Charest's announcement about the Conservative leadership, the questions focused on the UPAC investigation and the allegations of wrongdoing that hounded his goverment.  Charest said his government wasn't aware that firms were reimbursing employees to get around political fundraising laws in Quebec that prohibit companies from making donations. When his government learned about the reimbursement scheme, which benefited other provincial parties as well, Charest said he immediately tightened the Quebec Liberal Party's fundraising rules. Many of these allegations resurfaced last week when Marc Bibeau — a former Liberal fundraiser and close friend of Charest's — lost a bid to block the publication of UPAC affidavits.  The affidavits were filed in support of search warrant applications — part of UPAC's investigation into Bibeau.  They contained summaries of police interviews with several witnesses, many of whom were high-ranking executives at engineering companies who allegedly said they felt pressured by Bibeau to illegally donate to the Liberals.  In one summary, a witness said Bibeau went around with a business card embossed with a Quebec government logo, even though he had no position within the government. ""I don't believe it. I don't believe one word,"" Charest of the allegations against Bibeau. He said that information in UPAC affidavits had been wrong in the past. He also raised the various governance problems that have checkered the anti-corruption unit's reputation in recent years. ""Do I need to remind you that UPAC is currently under investigation?"" Charest said, referring to its bungled arrest of a sitting MNA in 2017. Though the information contained in the affidavits published last week wasn't new — much of it was initially heard during the public inquiry into corruption known as the Charbonneau commission — it reignited debate in Quebec about Charest's ethics. Several columnists questioned why he would want to re-enter the political fray given the questions raised by the open UPAC investigation.  ""What could be going on in Jean Charest's head?"" began one recent column in the Journal de Montréal. ""Think about it carefully,"" counselled a columnist at La Presse. In Tuesday's interview, Charest said the publication of the documents last week played no part in his decision not to run for the Conservative leadership. ""All this was already in the public domain,"" the former premier said. ""I would never have evoked the possibility of becoming a candidate if I felt for one instant that something like this would lead to criminal charges or would have hindered me."" Charest said he opted not to run because, among other things, he felt the party had changed too much since he led the Progressive Conservatives, from 1993 to 1998.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-charest-unloads-on-quebec-s-anti-corruption-unit-as-he-opts-out-of-tory-leadership-race-1.5435062,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/jean-charest-upac-michel-massicotte-1.5431436 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bibeau-documents-revealed-1.5429946,N/A

The City of St. John's granted an state-of-emergency exemption to the Canada Post processing plant Thursday morning, according to Craig Dyer, the regional spokesperson for the postal union. Dyer said clerks have been in the St. John's plant since 8 a.m., sorting through nearly a week's worth of mail that arrived on trailers from Port aux Basques. Canada Post said in an e-mailed statement on Thursday afternoon that items destined for areas not affected by the ongoing state of emergency will be delivered as soon as possible as mail coming through St. John's International Airport is beginning to roll through. For the Avalon East area, including St. John's and Mount Pearl, mail will be delivered starting next week. All outbound mail will be shipped out of the province to their destinations as soon as possible, Canada Post said. ""The bulk of the mail that comes into the province does get processed in St. John's, and that's because most of it gets flown in,"" Dyer said. For that reason, deliveries throughout Newfoundland and Labrador have been backed up, despite the worst of the weather hitting only the eastern portion of the province. Dyer said some deliveries had been possible from Port aux Basques in the last week, as trucks made dropoffs in major centres, including Corner Brook, Gander and Clarenville. But distribution province-wide had been very much affected by the shuttered St. John's processing plant, he said. He's expecting the next few days to be busy ones given the backlog. ""It's just like Christmas for us,"" he said. ""Processing is very difficult."" Delivery, too, may pose a challenge, with mailboxes potentially buried under snowbanks. Dyer said the coming days will likely have contractors out in ""full-blown attack"" mode to clear paths to dropoff points. ""Customers should continue to expect significant delivery delays as we work to recover,"" said a statement from Canada Post, which has repeatedly turned down requests for interviews.

14,Anonymous,2020-01-23T23:21:45.738Z,Canadian truck driver who shares last name with Iranian general says he can't cross U.S. border,"A Canadian truck driver says he's worried about his livelihood after he was denied entry to the United States by border guards who questioned him about his last name — one he happens to share with an assassinated Iranian general. Babak Soleimani is a Canadian citizen who left Iran in 2009. He says he has no connection, familial or otherwise, to Qasem Soleimani, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general who was killed on Jan. 3 in U.S. drone strike. ""I tried to explain it for U.S. border [guards], and I want to explain it for you — this is a very popular last name in [the] Middle East,"" Soleimani told As It Happens host Carol Off.  ""I'm a truck driver. I'm not part of any government. I'm not a part of any political system."" The Toronto resident has been working for a cross-border shipping company for the last four years and says he's never had any trouble crossing the border before this month. But on Jan. 10, he says he was stopped at the crossing between Windsor, Ont., and Detroit, Mich., where he was held for seven hours and questioned repeatedly about his name, before being denied entry and sent back to Canada. ""The worst thing is that my wife, she was very worried about me,"" he said.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed in an email that Soleimani was ""deemed inadmissible and was refused entry into the United States"" at the Detroit crossing on Jan. 10, but did not say why. ""Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labour certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,"" CBP said. Soleimani showed As It Happens his Notice of Refusal of Admission slip from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which also says that he was denied entry without citing a reason.  The Canada Border Services Agency declined to comment, directing questions to the CBP. According to an email from a U.S. border officer obtained by CBC News, U.S. border officers working at multiple Canada-U.S. border crossings were instructed to target and interrogate Iranian-born travellers in early January. Soleimani says U.S. border agents took away his phone and passport. Then, he says a man who was not wearing a uniform questioned him about his last name, his Iranian military record and his political opinions.  Soleimani says he served two years in the Iranian military when he was 18, which is mandatory in Iran. But he says he hasn't had any contact with the Iranian military since. In fact, he says he left the country to get away from the Iranian regime, of which he was an outspoken opponent. ""I am a Canadian. When I'm going anywhere. I'm going to introduce myself [as] Canadian,"" he said. ""I thought that I'm escaping Iran, I'm running from all madness in Iran."" When the agents asked him his opinion about the ongoing tensions between Iran and the United States, Soleimani says he told them that Trump ordering the execution of Gen. Soleimani led to Iran shooting down Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752 on Jan. 8. Of the 176 passengers and crew killed, 57 were Canadian citizens and 29 were permanent residents. ""I answered them honestly,"" he said. ""Maybe that's my fault."" Soleimani says he hoped this incident at the border was an outlier. But when he tried to cross again the next day between Port Erie, Ont., and Buffalo, N.Y., he says he was turned away by two men who identified themselves as FBI agents and told him not to return to the United States.  Now he says he's worried about his employment prospects in the future. ""I cannot cross the border,"" he said. ""They try to keep me as a local driver around Toronto, but definitely I cannot make the same money I make before. But I have no idea about [the] future and how long they can keep me like this."" Soleimani's employer, a cross-border shipping company, did not respond to a request for comment. In the meantime, he says he's most worried about his family.  ""I have a newborn girl and that's the big problem for us right now,"" he said. ""I'm worried for her. She got my last name too.""

15,"Caitlin Taylor, Makda Ghebreslassie",2019-12-04T20:00:17.049Z,Plastic surgeon vows to fight potential class-action lawsuit alleging he filmed patients without consent,"UPDATE: Since the publication of this article, Dr. Martin Jugenburg has responded to CBC's request for comment. The article has been updated to reflect that response.  A Toronto plastic surgeon who could face a class-action lawsuit over allegations he breached the privacy rights of patients by recording them without their consent using surveillance cameras at his clinic said the suit is without merit and that he intends to vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Dr. Martin Jugenburg — known online as Dr. 6ix — is well-known on social media and was the focus of a Marketplace investigation last year that found security cameras in examination rooms at his clinic in the Fairmont Royal York hotel.  The petition to have the lawsuit certified as a class action was filed on behalf of former patients on Nov. 28 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. It alleges that Jugenburg failed to act in the class members' best interests and that he placed his interests over theirs ""in pursuit of his own personal and commercial gain.""  J.C., a representative plaintiff in the case, went to Jugenburg's clinic for a breast lift consultation and said the behaviour alleged in the lawsuit is unacceptable.  ""I can't imagine how many other women out there don't even know this has gone on. No doctor should be able to get away with this type of behaviour.""   The statement of claim also alleges that Jugenburg's clinic posted images of patients on social media without their consent. The allegations have not been proven in court. In a Dec. 2 statement to CBC News, Jugenburg said patient privacy continues to be his highest priority. ""We believe this legal action is without merit and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit,"" he said. Jugenburg said he has apologized to his patients for not posting visible signage alerting them to the security cameras in his clinic and said the footage was ""protected, secure, and auto-deleted itself after a time delay.""  If given the go-ahead by a judge, the class-action could represent patients who visited Jugenburg's clinic, the Toronto Cosmetic Surgery Institute, between January 2012 and February 2019.   ""The heart of the lawsuit is really to get damages for women who had their trust abused by Dr. Jugenburg and who suffered some pretty serious mental health effects as a result of realizing that they were filmed without their consent,"" said Tina Yang, one of the lawyers involved in the case.  WATCH: Clinic staff says security camera in consult room is for 'the doctor's record' The plaintiffs are seeking $50 million in damages, including aggravated damages, and $25 million in punitive damages, plus an amount to be determined for special damages. Lawyers say these numbers could change if the lawsuit is certified, the number of plaintiffs in the class is determined and their additional experiences are gathered.  Last year, while reporting undercover for a story on breast implants, Marketplace producers spotted security cameras in a closed-door examination room where patients are asked to undress, as well as in the waiting area. The small black-and-white devices were attached to the ceiling in the corners of the rooms. At least some of the cameras in these rooms were also recording audio. Following CBC's coverage, Jugenburg said in an email that he provided clear signs about security cameras and removed the cameras from examination rooms.  J.C., one of two representative plaintiffs on the statement of claim, had read Marketplace's article last year.   ""I remember I was walking through my basement reading it and then I ... literally fell onto the chair and I was overcome with humiliation."" J.C. visited Jugenburg's clinic in the summer of 2018. She said a nurse asked her to remove her top and bra so that photos of her breasts could be taken for her medical record with a hand-held camera, which is common practice.  At one point, J.C. also took off her pants so the nurse could examine her for a ""tummy tuck."" J.C said that at no point during her consultation did staff tell her about the additional security cameras in the room. ""The entire time I was there, it wasn't private,"" she said. At one point during the consultation, the nurse left the room to give J.C. and her friend who accompanied her to the appointment a moment to discuss their thoughts, J.C. said. ""That private conversation for starters wasn't private,"" she alleged. ""But [the nurse] knew it wasn't private.""  Both Ontario's Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) launched investigations into Jugenburg's clinic following Marketplace's reports in December 2018. The commissioner's investigation found that the clinic's use of security cameras went against Ontario's Personal Health Information Protection Act and that the clinic did not obtain patients' consent to film them with security cameras during appointments.  The commissioner reported that the clinic had a network of 24 security cameras that were recording 24 hours a day in examination rooms, the operating room, pre-operative room, reception areas, hallways, administrative offices, a computer workroom and the staff kitchen.  According to the commissioner's report, some cameras were first installed in 2012 but stopped working sometime that year. When the clinic expanded to two floors, the system was reset. These recordings began running in January 2017. The clinic said it shut off the cameras on Dec. 13, 2018.  The footage was available for Jugenburg to view live through a secure application on his phone. Footage from the security cameras was also stored on devices that were automatically overwritten with new footage approximately every 30 days, the report said. Jugenburg told the IPC that the cameras were installed for the security of the clinic, staff and patients and not for health-care purposes.  As part of the investigation, the clinic gave the IPC examples of when footage from the surveillance cameras was reviewed by staff. On two occasions, the footage was reviewed to verify statements made by staff to patients during consultations and on another occasion to review staff conduct.  In the spring of 2019, the college told Jugenburg to remove all cameras from rooms where patients undress and required that the clinic post clear signage alerting visitors to video surveillance.  WATCH: A plaintiff says security cameras were a huge violation of her privacy The clinic told the IPC that there are now only two security cameras — one at each of the two reception desks on both floors of the clinic. These cameras are only recording after office hours.  The clinic confirmed with the IPC that it destroyed all footage recorded prior to January 2019 except for footage that was seized by the college for its investigation.  ""Even though the cameras are no longer rolling, he still has to be held accountable for what he's done,"" said J.C.  Neither of the two representative plaintiffs know if the clinic shared photos of them on social media. ""We're alleging that there were photographs taken of patients that were then placed on social media without consent,"" said Kate Mazzucco, another lawyer involved in the claim.  The lawyers who launched the lawsuit said these allegations are in the statement of claim based on a pending case against Jugenburg with the CPSO that alleges Jugenburg engaged in ""disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct"" by allowing a film crew into a patient's surgery without her consent, touching her inappropriately and posting photos of her on social media without her consent.  When asked previously about these allegations, Jugenburg said they are ""denied and being defended."" These allegations, and allegations that Jugenburg used video recording devices at his clinic, will be addressed at a college disciplinary hearing in May 2020.  If you have a story you'd like to share, send it to caitlin.taylor@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-plastic-surgeon-class-action-1.5376239,https://www.cbc.ca/news/marketplace/toronto-plastic-surgeon-marketplace-cameras-1.5137052 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-breast-implant-cameras-1.4944628,N/A

She donated a kidney to him Dec. 5, and the two of them were still not cleared for strenuous activity following the operation. With the two of them unable to shovel, the blizzard put him at the mercy of complications from the transplant. ""We weren't 100 per cent sure if we were even going to be able to get an ambulance close enough to the house,"" she said. ""We had no idea that it was going to get this bad.… We have a 14-year-old who did the best he could but it was just way too much."" The couple asked the city for help Monday night and were relieved to wake up to find six soldiers clearing snow from much of their property. ""When we looked out, there was a team of Canadian force members shovelling our driveway,"" said Carolann Harris. ""My daughter had made some cupcakes. We brought them out and got a couple of pictures of [the soldiers]."" Harris said the soldiers began shovelling her driveway at 8 a.m., and shoveled everything in an hour and 45 minutes. ""They had a system going, and they got it out in no time."" Harris said the help from those soldiers is letting her sleep better at night. ""I can go to bed tonight knowing that if something happens to my husband, an ambulance can get close enough to my house to get him out. He's six-foot-five and to carry him through any amount of snow, it's just not doable,"" she said. Her message to the troops clearing the streets of St. John's? ""Thank you. There's just no words. It seems so minuscule … but there's no words to even say. It's not as high risk as it was when we woke up this morning.""

Joan Vey is another resident of St. John's who appreciates the help. ""I think it's wonderful. There's nothing like the military men,"" she said. Soldiers helped shovel her driveway and dig out her vehicle after the blizzard shook her and her husband's home. ""I think it was excellent indeed. Oh my god, I'd keep them any time.

17,Travis Dolynny,2020-01-24T09:00:00.029Z,This family has a warning after 9-year-old daughter sexually exploited on Instagram,"A London, Ont. family was jarred awake to the sound of door knocking at about 6:45 a.m. last Friday. Seven police officers were there with a warrant to come in. The kids were still in bed and parents Trevor and Crystal had no idea what was going on.  ""They came in and one officer was talking to my husband, while another ran upstairs to the bedroom, asking where my daughter's room was,"" said Crystal. CBC is withholding the family's last name because their children's social media accounts are traceable. What happened next shows just how vulnerable one child had already become.  ""[The officer] went directly into my daughter's room, along with a child interviewer, while we were still trying to process what was going on."" The serious and chaotic situation at the family home was the result of an online exchange of messages and photos between the 9-year-old daughter and an unknown person on Instagram in late November and early December. Crystal said the photos were flagged by the social media giant and reported to police. ""Somebody online had sent her, and we found this out afterwards, multiple pictures of his penis, and requested her to send back multiple pictures in the poses that he requested,"" she said. The little girl sent multiple naked pictures to the stranger, her mother said.  Investigators had a warrant to collect all electronic devices from the home, which the family handed over. According to London police, when a social media platform comes across any online material that's exploitative to children, it's forwarded to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in the United States. ""That centre reviews the report and if it's determined that the source was from Canada, then they forward the report to the National Exploitation Crime Centre, which is run by the RCMP,"" said Const. Sandasha Bough, media officer for the London Police Service. If the RCMP determine the source was from London, the London police Internet Child Exploitation Unit is notified. That's what happened here.  The harrowing series of events have left the family shaken as police continue to investigate the case. Crystal says she had talked to her daughter about Internet safety before the incidents occurred and that she should never send photos to strangers, as there are people who can take advantage of her. ""She's nine. How detailed do you want to get into it with a nine year old about what these predators do,"" questioned Crystal. ""There's a certain degree of you wanting to preserve her innocence but at the same time they're not fully understanding."" As police continue to investigate the case, the family is now left feeling unsafe in their own home and wondering how the situation is going to affect their daughter in the future. According to Crystal, there have been no suspects identified in the case. She hopes that by sharing their story, parents will be aware of how easy it can be for children to become victims of online exploitation. ""Spot check your kids' phones constantly, do not sugarcoat the dangers of sharing photos and talking to strangers online,"" warned Crystal. ""The process of trying to preserve your child's innocence, you could put them in physical danger and that's where we're at right now."" Be aware of exactly what applications or platforms their children are using. Know how to use those applications and platforms. Check their child's device(s) and add them to their own phone, along with their child's account(s). Monitor their child's content and messages. Make sure their child feels comfortable coming to them when they receive messages or requests from strangers. When children are interacting online, make sure its in a common area, such as the living room and never alone in their bedroom.

18,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:25:01.242Z,'She didn't deserve it': Gilles Duceppe's family suing seniors' residence where mother died,"Transcript Former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe says he's forced to relive his mother's death every day because the luxury seniors' residence where she froze to death last year has not been held responsible.  ""It is like it is yesterday,"" Duceppe told As It Happens host Carol Off. ""They made a lot of mistakes, and we have to change the way of taking care of the old age people in the future.""  Duceppe and his siblings announced Monday that they are suing the Lux Gouverneur Montreal for gross negligence. Hélène Rowley Hotte Duceppe died of hypothermia outside the Montreal residence on Jan. 20, 2019. The 93-year-old was stuck in an outdoor courtyard for six hours after exiting through an emergency exit because of a false fire alarm. It felt like - 35 C outside, with strong winds and blowing snow.  A coroner's report that was released last summer said there was video surveillance, which showed her desperately trying to get back into the building in the early hours of the morning, before collapsing at 11:02 a.m.  Staff didn't find her until 11:40, but by that time she was already dead. The report found that while her death was accidental, it was entirely preventable.  ""She didn't deserve it,"" Duceppe said.  Duceppe said his mother had a ""great fear"" of fires, which came from growing up with stories about the tragic 1927 Laurier Palace Theatre fire in Montreal that killed 85 children — many who were crushed to death as they tried to escape.  When she heard the fire alarm in her residence, she was just following the rules, he said.  ""They didn't look at the cameras, said Duceppe, referring to employees at the residence. ""They told the firemen that they checked if everyone was back in the room, which was not true, and they waited five months before apologizing to the family."" Her access card would not allow her back inside through the emergency exit, and no one at the residence noticed that she was missing. The coroner said an alarm was triggered when she exited, but an employee turned it off 20 minutes later without checking outside. Duceppe said this is unacceptable.  ""Instead of just changing the alarm, you look on the other side of the door,"" he said. ""She was there trying to get back inside.""  None of the claims has been proven in court. The family is seeking $1.25 million for both the suffering experienced by Rowley Hotte Duceppe and the pain her death has caused her seven children. The management of the residence said in a statement Monday that staff remain ""extremely shaken by the death of Mrs. Rowley-Hotte.'' ""The safety and well-being of residents is a top priority for management. Due to the ongoing legal procedures, we will not be granting interviews,'' the statement read. Duceppe said the day before his mother died she told her daughter that she was worried about the people who were living on the streets because it was so cold. She said that she was going to spend the next day knitting warm clothes to give to people in need.  ""And she's the one who died because of the cold,"" Duceppe said.  His mother was in ""great shape"" for her age, he said. Just a month before she died, her doctor told her that she had the ""heart of a young girl.""   She loved to read the newspaper, and she read one book a week, Duceppe said.  His mother didn't want to leave eastern Montreal, where she was born and raised, but the family convinced her to move to an apartment at the Lux Gouverneur Montreal because it was advertised as being secure. Duceppe said they were paying $3,700 a month in rent, not including food, for the apartment.  ""But, the thing is, even if you have the cameras, if you don't use them, it serves nobody,"" Duceppe said.   Duceppe said he wants the government and residence to take action and implement the recommendations made by the coroner in the death of his mother and others. Some of those recommendations include installing an intercom and doorbells outside each emergency exit, and to check stairwells and exits after an alarm is triggered.  ""At least that would prevent … tragedies like that. And I think … we should protect better the old age people,"" Duceppe said.   Written by Sarah Jackson with files from The Associated Press.

20,Erica Johnson,2019-04-02T17:51:22.864Z,"Bell customer's 5-month fight is 1 of almost 10,000 recent complaints to telco mediator","Matthew Tomlinson spent five months trying to get Bell to give him a TV package at the price he was promised. The 47-year-old Ottawa computer analyst says a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package last June, which cost him an extra $50 per month. ""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. Frustrated, Tomlinson filed a complaint with the telecom mediator, the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS). His complaint is included in a mid-year report released today by the CCTS, indicating that the number of Canadians unhappy with their telco service providers continues to climb. The CCTS says it accepted 9,831 complaints between August 2018 and January 2019 — a 44 per cent increase over the same period the previous year. The biggest issues for consumers: billing disputes, misleading contract terms or non-disclosure of information and poor quality of service. ""It's unfortunate that we see the same issues on a regular, recurring basis,"" CCTS commissioner Howard Maker told Go Public. He says by the time consumers have filed a complaint with his organization, they are often at their wits' end. ""It's difficult to see them all have to spend time and resources on things that maybe didn't need to have occurred, if better processes had been in place in the front end."" Ninety-two per cent of complaints to the mediator were resolved, although the CCTS could not address 6,413 other complaints beyond its mandate, including customer service, pricing and operating practices and policies. The country's largest service provider continued to receive a disproportionately high number of consumer complaints - Bell Canada was the subject of 3,034 complaints. Rogers received 915 complaints. For the first time, Cogeco placed third on the list, with 790 complaints, after an upgrade to its computer system led to customers losing service and being unable to contact technical support. Telus received 746 complaints, making it the fourth most-complained-about telecom provider. Freedom Mobile, owned by Shaw, expanded its service areas last year and placed fifth on the list, with 637 complaints. Customers filed the most complaints about cellphone issues (37.1 per cent), followed by problems with internet (27.8 per cent) and TV services (18.2 per cent). Canadians were only recently able to file complaints about TV services. That process was introduced into the CCTS mandate in September 2017. Tomlinson's complaint last fall said he paid an extra $50 per month after a Bell sales agent signed him up for the wrong TV package.""I felt like I was misled at every portion of my transaction with Bell,"" says Tomlinson. ""Every time they told me that something was being fixed, it was never fixed. Every deadline or date they gave me … none of those deadlines were met."" Tomlinson estimates he went back to a Bell retail store more than 10 times, to try to sort out his billing issues. On top of that, he says, he spent countless hours on the phone to Bell. ""I'd go to sales and sales told me, 'No, this is a billing problem, you have to talk to billing.' So there was this really circular logic they were employing to simply keep me from being able to fix my bill."" Finally, Tomlinson complained to Bell's escalation department — but he still didn't hear back, so he filed a complaint with the CCTS. ""This is the most deplorable customer service I've ever experienced,"" he says. ""And I just didn't want it to go unchecked and unnoticed."" In an email to Go Public, Bell spokesperson Nathan Gibson wrote, ""This kind of customer experience is rare, and we apologize to Mr. Tomlinson. We have provided coaching to all team members involved to ensure these kinds of mistakes are not repeated."" Gibson also noted that Bell's share of CCTS complaints ""declined more than any other service provider"" — by 2.4 per cent. Mike Polera says he filed a complaint last fall with the CCTS, after his experience trying to move his wife's cellphone from another service provider to his Rogers account. In terms of frustration, ""on a scale of one to 10, this was a 12,"" says Polera, a small business consultant based in Toronto. ""I've never seen anything like this."" Polera first contacted Rogers using a live chat agent, so he was able to save a copy of his chat and have a record of what was promised. When he went to a Rogers retail store to set up his wife's account, store reps couldn't help him and said there were no notes on his file. ""I actually had everything in writing and then found out that none of it was actually applied to my account,"" says Polera. ""It really made me angry. I felt completely taken advantage of."" In frustration, Polera took his cellphone business to another service provider. He says Rogers then charged him for services the company never delivered, including a $65 charge for a phone number that wasn't Polera's, and an activation fee. ""The first thing that came to my mind was, 'This is absolutely ridiculous',"" says Polera. ""Then I got angry."" After he wrote to the CCTS, Rogers issued him a credit for more than $350. Rogers spokesperson Sarah Schmidt told Go Public, ""We strive to deliver solutions for our customers the first time they contact us, and in this case we let Mr. Polera down. We see every customer complaint as an opportunity, and we have taken steps to ensure other customers do not experience the same situation."" A telecom watchdog says problems continue to exist in the telecom industry because companies get away with treating customers poorly. ""Fundamentally, the biggest problem with our system right now is there there aren't any strong penalties in place for the telecoms when they do something wrong,"" says OpenMedia's executive director Laura Tribe. ""Clearly, going through the CCTS and having a complaint filed is not a big enough threat to the telecoms to stop this behaviour."" Recently, the CRTC issued a report calling for more measures to prevent telecom companies from using aggressive and misleading sales practices. The recommendations are the result of an eight-month public inquiry conducted by the telecom regulator, prompted in part by months of stories by Go Public about the pressure on telco employees to upsell and mislead customers in order to meet sales targets. Rogers employees say managers turn a blind eye The CRTC report, issued in February, said harmful sales practices ""exist in all sales channels, including in store, online, over the phone, and door to door."" Among other things, the CRTC report recommended creating a mandatory internet code of conduct that could include price protections during a contract, and requiring telcos to allow a cooling-off period after purchasing products and services. Matthew Tomlinson says he still gets angry when he thinks about the hours involved trying to rectify his Bell bill, and the time thousands of other Canadians are spending, in similar situations. ""We don't want to be spending all this extra time away from our children, away from work, away from vacation planning, in order to deal with a problem that ultimately, in the end, it only took about 10 minutes to fix.""

21,Tom Ayers,2020-01-24T10:00:00.958Z,CBRM committee under fire for discussions behind closed doors,"Cape Breton Regional Municipality is under fire again for possibly discussing public business in private. CBRM had to backtrack on its in-camera meeting practices in 2015 and 2018, and now questions are being raised over the municipality's agenda review committee. According to CBRM's agenda policy, meeting agendas are set by the agenda review committee. It consists of the mayor, deputy mayor and three senior staff and, under its terms of reference, the committee sets the agendas for council or committee meetings. However, no records of the committee's deliberations exist. Cape Breton University political scientist Tom Urbaniak said, under the Municipal Government Act, committees have to follow the same rules as council. ""If the agenda-setting committee is meeting as a committee, then the CBRM does have the obligation to tell the public when that meeting is happening and for that meeting to be open to the public,"" he said. In addition, Urbaniak said the agenda committee seems to be straying beyond its mandate. According to policy, the committee can add items to an upcoming agenda, defer them to a later meeting, or refer the topic to another committee or level of government. However, at a public meeting earlier this month, Mayor Cecil Clarke told councillors the details of a proposed youth council, contained in a staff issue paper, had been decided on by the agenda committee before coming to council. ""At the agenda setting, we talked about that in terms of definition and we defined youth to be any youth residing in the CBRM,"" Clarke told council. In interviews, the municipality's solicitor and chief administrative officer said the committee is not shaping policy. However, CAO Marie Walsh said the committee might make ""tweaks"" on wording or grammar. In an interview, the mayor said any changes the committee makes are simply to clarify the meaning. For example, he said, the agenda committee recently changed the wording of a staff report that said the proposed youth council could ask CBRM council for financial resources. Instead, the committee changed the wording to say the youth council could ask for support, to include the possibility of in-kind or other non-financial resources, Clarke said. ""So that's cleaning it up, as opposed to changing any of the fundamentals,"" he said. ""Any of that housekeeping that might come up when you're reviewing a document is meant, which it should be, so that when you consider it, it's in the best form possible."" Clarke said CBRM's agenda committee is not really a committee of council and does not have to be open to the public, and the Department of Municipal Affairs agrees. However, Urbaniak said council itself calls the agenda committee a committee, and he said that ""changes the game.""

23,Katy Parsons,2020-01-24T18:31:49.898Z,"Projects that would include Lunenburg waterfront, seabed concern community group","A community group in Lunenburg is raising concerns about developments being floated by a manufacturer that could alter the appearance of the heritage town's iconic waterfront. Save Our Lunenburg formed last year after local residents and property owners became aware of ABCO's plans to purchase and infill parcels of federally owned seabed extending into Lunenburg harbour. George Wyatt, a spokesperson for the group, said people learned of the plans after the company, which has a long history of aluminum boat construction in the area, asked town council for a letter stating no objection to its proposal to purchase the land for a possible residential-commercial development. At a public meeting of council last March, ABCO outlined two-storey townhouses as a development option for the infilled harbour area. Save Our Lunenburg members let residents know about the matter by distributing flyers around town. ""First and foremost, we didn't think putting townhouses in the middle of the harbour would really be in keeping with the character of the town,"" Wyatt told CBC's Information Morning, also citing concerns about environmental impacts. ""Our objective really here is we want to promote appropriate and sustainable development in Lunenburg."" Wyatt said Save Our Lunenburg is also concerned about ABCO applying to remove properties from areas under architectural control. Lunenburg has two such areas — along Falkland and Dufferin Streets and along Tannery Road, where ABCO's properties are located. In those areas, there are requirements for new main buildings and additions to be similar to pre-1940 buildings, and restrictions on the size of additions and such things as cladding, roof shape and style.  ABCO plans to develop a brew pub and cidery on Lunenburg's harbourfront, in partnership with Mahone Bay Brewing Company. There has been some confusion around whether that's why ABCO wants to be freed from some of the town's architectural limitations. According to ABCO, the brew pub and cidery, which will be called Lightship Brewery, will follow local bylaws and be built ""reminiscent of the fishing shacks that once occupied the same shores."" In an email to Information Morning, ABCO manager Jason Huskilson stated the company has requested to be removed from the architectural controls because ""current rules limit ABCO from realizing its potential"" by expanding its current manufacturing operations. ABCO's application for removal has to go before a public meeting and a public session of council before it can be approved.  Rachel Bailey, Lunenburg's mayor, told CBC that the company has made no formal applications to develop either the brew pub and cidery, which would be located on existing harbourfront land, or the mixed-used development along the harbour. The town has not sent a letter of no-objection to the federal government for the company's proposed purchase and infilling of portions of Lunenburg harbour. ""We found out there's a lengthy process, it involves the three levels of government, and our role doesn't come into play until the end,"" said Bailey, adding that the purchase and the infilling would require environmental assessment before being addressed by the municipality.   MORE TOP STORIES",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/save-our-lunenburg-concerned-about-proposed-harbour-developments-1.5438998,https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/stain-on-a-seaside-town https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/plastic-free-lunenburg-open-house-1.4994795 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285,N/A
24,Erica Johnson,2019-05-13T19:21:56.898Z,RBC customer out of pocket after fraud: What you need to know if you e-transfer money,"A system to transfer money online — used over a million times a day in Canada — is not as safe as it advertises, says a Royal Bank customer who had $1,734 stolen during an e-transfer. The theft occurred after Anne Hoover of Peterborough, Ont., e-transferred money from her RBC account to her friend Fran Fearnley, only to have a fraudster intercept the transaction and divert the money to his own account at another bank. ""I always use e-transfer,"" says Hoover. ""I thought it was a safe way to send money."" An RBC manager says an internal investigation indicated that Fearnley's email account had been hacked, and when Hoover sent the e-transfer, the fraudster figured out the answer for the security question necessary to deposit the money, and then redirected it to a different bank account. An expert in online privacy protection and security says financial institutions have opted for convenience over security, which makes strong email passwords and equally strong e-transfer questions and passwords essential. ""How you manage those passwords is very important,"" says Claudiu Popa, author of The Canadian Cyberfraud Handbook and a cybersecurity expert who advises government and companies. ""Banks and financial institutions have made it very easy to transfer money via email. Unfortunately, with convenience comes lack of security."" Hoover and Fearnley had just returned from a trip to Mexico on March 18, when Hoover went online and used her bank's Interac e-transfer system to reimburse her pal for trip expenses. But when Fearnley opened the email and tried to accept the payment, she got a message saying the e-transfer had already been deposited. The women called RBC's fraud department and a bank employee provided the name of the fraudster, his email, and said he'd transferred the money to a TD Bank account. ""This is clearly a complete stranger,"" says Fearnley. ""How could that possibly have happened?"" The two friends headed to their local RBC branch, where they are both customers — Hoover, for more than 30 years. The bank blamed the theft on Fearnley's email security. Hoover's security question to her friend was: ""Who is my favourite Beatle?"" The fraudster would have had a one in four chance of getting it right — John, Paul, George or Ringo. In a test of RBC's Interac system, Go Public was given four chances to answer the security question correctly. ""The manager continued to insist ... that it wasn't really their problem. It was now our problem,"" Hoover says. Eventually, the manager offered Hoover half the missing funds as a ""gesture of goodwill."" Hoover filed a report with Peterborough police, but an officer told her that it's difficult to clamp down on online fraud and her fight to recoup the money could take ages and would likely be fruitless. Hoover says she feels misled by the bank's website. A webpage about RBC's digital security tells customers they're ""fully protected"" and will be reimbursed ""for any unauthorized transactions."" But when Hoover pointed that out to bank officials, she was told customers aren't protected if they use weak passwords when transferring funds online. RBC declined an interview request from Go Public. In a statement, AJ Goodman, RBC's director of external communications, wrote: ""As part of our electronic access agreement, clients commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" That information is on the bank's website, but only if a customer reading RBC's ""Security Guarantee"" clicks on a few different links to get to a clause in the fine print of a section called ""Security."" Interac makes the same security promises online as RBC, telling customers in bold print that they are ""protected from fraud losses."" No one from Interac would agree to an interview with Go Public, directing questions to RBC. In a statement, the company's senior manager of external communications, Adrienne Vaughan, wrote that Canadians must ""protect their email and passwords so they do not fall victim to cybercrime and they can safely transact online."" In another, similar case, Dr. Sylvia Veith of Prince Albert, Sask., lost $7,000 when she used Interac to e-transfer money to her son's hockey league in June 2017. That money was intercepted and her bank — RBC — blamed a weak password to a security question and told the physician there was nothing that could be done. RBC would not comment on Veith's case, except to reiterate the importance of strong passwords. Police say an investigation is ongoing. ""This idea of transferring money by email is much more risky than people realize,"" says Popa. ""Companies don't report [incidents] because they don't want an investigation from the privacy commissioner, from other regulatory bodies."" Popa says people have been desensitized to the risk of email transfers ""very quickly, almost too quickly"" because they use email all the time, so they figure it's safe. What banks and other financial institutions have done, he says, is sacrifice security to get a high number of people using the system. Last year in Canada, there were more than 371 million e-transfers worth more than $132 billion, according to Interac Corp., the biggest online funds transfer service in the country. The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre told Go Public that it received 163 reports in 2018 involving e-transfers that were compromised, resulting in money being transferred to fraudsters. Popa did a quick search of Fearnley's email on www.haveibeenpwned.com, a website that tracks data breaches and reports almost eight billion occasions when personal accounts have been exposed. The same email address could be acquired from several different sources. Popa found her email was compromised on two sites when hackers attacked LinkedIn and Verification.io ""That means people have found those e-mail lists. They have sold them to others,"" says Popa. ""Different people have taken what they've needed from those lists, and that's how they got compromised, very likely."" The cybersecurity expert says financial institutions and Interac need to require something called ""two-factor authentication"" to better protect people's accounts. ""Every time you log into an account you need to use a second factor,"" explains Popa. ""A code that arrives as a text message or as a separate email to a different email address that is only valid for a few seconds or a few minutes after it's received."" He says the financial industry knows more security is needed, but is more concerned about getting customers to use the e-transfer system. Some financial institutions offer two-factor authentication as an option, not a requirement. Go Public asked RBC and Interac why they don't require two-factor authentication. Both declined to address the question. Hoover says she's learned the hard way that strong security questions and passwords are crucial. She's escalating her case to the RBC Ombudsman, hoping to prompt the bank to better warn customers they could be liable for losses even if they're victims of fraud. She's also closing her business account at RBC, after decades of loyalty. ""How can I feel confident [in RBC] when, in fact, I've had money stolen from me — clearly stolen,"" says Hoover. ""This isn't secure, and people need to know."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

25,Anonymous,2020-01-22T22:34:55.925Z,Volkswagen ordered to pay $196.5M after pleading guilty to all Canadian emissions-cheating charges,"German automotive giant Volkswagen was ordered to pay a $196.5-million fine to the Canadian government after pleading guilty in a wide-ranging emissions-cheating scandal on Wednesday. Judge Enzo Rondinelli handed down the record-setting fine hours after the automaker formally pleaded guilty to all 60 charges it was facing, including admitting — among other acts — to secretly importing cars that violated polluting standards. The Crown and Volkswagen jointly suggested the penalty, which falls short of the maximum $265 million the company could have been forced to pay. But prosecutors said the penalty is more than 20 times higher than Canada's previous record environmental fine, a contention Rondinelli supported as he ushered in what he described as new standards for environmental accountability. ""The proposed fine here indicates that a new era of environmental protection is upon us,"" Rondinelli said in his decision. ""The proposed fine here would be the biggest fine imposed in Canada for an environmental infraction, by a wide margin."" The German automaker and the Crown submitted an agreed statement of facts in a Toronto court, acknowledging the company imported 128,000 Volkswagen and Audi vehicles, along with 2,000 Porsches, that violated the standards. Reading from the statement, prosecutor Tom Lemon noted that certain supervisors and other employees at Volkswagen ""knew that VW was using software to cheat the U.S. testing process,"" the results of which are used by Canadian authorities. The federal government charged the auto giant last month with 58 counts of illegal importation under the Environmental Protection Act and two counts of providing misleading information. The penalty proposed by both sides was significantly higher than the $7.5 million fine incurred by a mining company in 2014. The money paid by Volkswagen would go to the Environmental Damages Fund, and both parties suggested distributing it to the provinces and territories based on how many affected vehicles were sold in each jurisdiction. The statement of facts notes that the automaker has already tried to make some amends in Canada. Volkswagen ""has devoted significant resources to, and undertaken extensive measures for, the remediation of the subject vehicles,"" Lemon read in court. ""VW settled Canadian consumer claims by providing compensation and benefits for emissions modification and buyback options to remediate the subject vehicles ... or remove them from the road."" Those settlements, according to the document, provided benefits ""of up to a potential maximum"" of $2.39 billion, and were completed by Aug. 31, 2019. But the company refused to admit any actual human or environmental harm caused by its pollution, saying only that the scheme had the potential to cause harm. In court last month, defence lawyers said they intended to plead guilty, but the resolution was delayed while three people sought to make victim-impact statements and provide other input. Rondinelli ruled against them, saying it's not their role to prosecute the company accused of harming them. Lemon said at the time he would gather victim impact statements and review them before submitting them to the court on Jan. 22, in line with the typical process. On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that the ""community impact statement"" turned in to them was not admissible in court. The seven-page document — accompanied by 520 pages of reference materials — was an attempt to enter untested expert testimony into the record, they said. Rondinelli accepted that argument. ""We are at a sentencing hearing, not a trial,"" he said. Volkswagen previously pleaded guilty in U.S. court to three felonies in 2017 and was fined $4.3 billion. German prosecutors fined the company  €1 billion euros in the emissions-cheating case in 2018. Several company executives and managers were also charged in the U.S. and Germany, and some were sent to prison.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/volkswagen-pleads-guilty-emissions-cheating-canada-1.5436346,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/volkswagen-intend-plead-guilty-environment-charges-ontario-court-1.5395132 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/beetle-volkswagen-us-1.4822626,N/A
26,Neil Macdonald,2019-12-17T09:00:00.948Z,Why are photo ops (except Trump's) so brutally boring?: Neil Macdonald,"Any reporter who's ever covered the Middle East can tell you about the Arab leader photo op. It is one of the most curious acts of solipsism ever invented. The beloved leader-for-life, a king or a president, always a man, appears on some hideous filigreed-and-gilded couch or chair, chatting with an important visitor. Maybe sweet tea is served. No questions are allowed. That's it. Lickspittle journalists from the state-controlled media are invited to record the event (usually, no audio is permitted), which is then broadcast at the top of the evening newscast, with gushing narration about the awe and respect and deference shown the leader by his important visitor. I've seen Jordanian television lead its newscast with three identical, consecutive scenes, all on the same royal couch. It's hilarious, and most Western reporters cackle sarcastically when they first see it. I certainly did. In reality, though, photo ops in our democracies aren't much different. Politicians pose and grip and grin, and mouth blandishments, and, like the beloved Arab leaders, are careful to say nothing.  The prime photo op directive, it seems, is to say absolutely nothing. The only difference in the West is that leaders don't order journalists to turn off the audio. (I'll bet they would if they could). So reporters scrutinize faces for the slightest flicker of authenticity. Did the Italian PM roll his eyes for a moment? Did Angela Merkel seem to suppress a snicker? Did Melania Trump look exhausted and scared? The exception, of course, is Donald Trump. No need to examine him for tells or tics. Ever since his elevation by the American public he represents so perfectly, he's been barging into photo ops, elbowing his way to the front, running his mouth, looking desperately bored when anyone else is speaking, using other leaders as props, and disrupting everything. I love it. After a lifetime of suffering through photo ops, it's refreshing. Trump might have a mouth like an open sewer, but at least he says something. Watching him crash around NATO's 75th anniversary get-together earlier this month was particularly enjoyable. He turned a photo op with NATO's obsequious secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, into a 52-minute news conference starring himself, bellyaching about Congressional Democrats. He then did the same thing to French president Emmanuel Macron, beside whom he held court for 41 minutes, telling Macron he should take back French citizens who went off to fight for ISIS and are now stranded in detention camps in Syria. ""Would you like some nice ISIS fighters?"" he asked Macron. ""I could give them to you."" Macron sputtered that Trump should be serious, and that foreign fighters are a tiny part of a big problem. It was fascinating: problems normally handled quietly by diplomats, erupting like burst pimples, right out in the open. During Trump's relatively brief 35 minutes with Justin Trudeau, he bluntly asked our prime minister, in front of everybody, why Canada isn't contributing two per cent of GDP to NATO, as required. Actually, asked Trump, ""What are you at? What's your number?"" Trudeau flailed, tried a little boring message track about his government's commitment to raise defence spending (I was sure he was going to start talking about helping the middle class), and finally, after consulting with his retinue, replied 1.4 per cent.  Well, maybe Canada should be put on a payment plan, gloated Trump. It was those Trump performances that Trudeau and Macron were giggling about at a reception later, when they were caught on camera with the audio turned on. The video went viral, and made headlines, because it was normally scripted leaders caught in a rare moment of honesty. Trump, on the other hand, prefers making fun of people to their faces. A colleague, after watching the NATO coverage for a few days, wrote me asking: ""Why don't more politicians besides an old white racist use these deadly dull canned moments to actually say something?"" Good question. Great question, really. Instead of sniggering at receptions, why don't our leaders stop behaving like wax sculptures of themselves? Wouldn't it have been wonderful, when Trump started bitching about Canada's NATO contribution, if Trudeau had had the bottle to say something like: ""Sure, let's talk about American military leadership. Your country invaded Iraq based on a lie, solved nothing, and caused not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but created ISIS. And now we're learning from your own government correspondence that you had no idea what you were doing in Afghanistan, a mess you actually managed to drag Canada into, and we all spent a lot of blood and treasure for nothing. Great job, Mr. President. Everybody's impressed."" Or, when Trump made his smarty-pants offer to send France some nice ISIS fighters, if Macron had replied: ""Really? Well, let's talk about that. You've been dumping your own prisoners on another country's soil, and holding them indefinitely without due process. Your country has also practised torture as an official policy, and you just pardoned three war criminals. Spare me, Mr. President. Also, and I say this as a Frenchman, your long-tie look is ridiculous."" Instead, the posing and empty statements live on, and will be happening long after Trump lurches off to enjoy the money his resorts have raked in during his presidency. Why does such photo-op mummery persist? Vanity and fear, I'd submit. Some of our leaders, like the Arab potentates, actually think they're so interesting they need only mouth pleasantries to make people listen in fascination. Others take refuge in scripted replies and posed photo ops because they're afraid, probably with good reason, that they'll say something stupid. But Trump has made that all right. Hasn't he? *** Author's Note: A rather doleful column I wrote last September about wrestling with a decision on whether to have surgery done on my Border Collie pup Lola, after we discovered she'd been born with hip dysplasia, generated an awful lot of response from commiserating dog-owners. I can report that we went ahead and basically had her hip joints removed that month, and that she has recovered brilliantly, and now runs like the wind. She's young and light and flexible and athletic, just like me, and that apparently made all the difference. As did post-op laser therapy and underwater treadmill exercise.

""Winter is the water main break season and ... it's often due to the change in temperatures and if we have a rapid drop in temperature, as we've had over the last three or four days, it can affect our infrastructure. ""It drives the frost under the ground and if there's a little bit of movement in some pipes that can cause a break and that's what we have in a couple of these situations."" The latest break occurred on Armcrescent East Drive and caused service disruptions for customers on Benjamin Green Drive, Third Street and Fourth Street. The utility said service was restored to those customers at around 1 p.m. Halifax Water said it has also now restored water to customers on Cobequid Road between Glendale and Zinck avenues in Lower Sackville. The break on Cobequid Road happened Wednesday evening. The utility is reporting another break near 37 Micmac Dr. in Dartmouth. There's no restoration time for that water main repair. ""We appreciate that it's a nuisance to be out of water service, but crews are doing the best they can whenever there's water main break to get that water back on,"" Campbell said.

28,Anonymous,2020-01-24T02:02:25.873Z,"The new coronavirus: Symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you think you're infected","So far, there have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Canada. But China has confirmed there has been human-to-human transmission of the virus, and Canadian public health agencies say they have been making preparations for any potential case or outbreak. Meanwhile, airports in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal — all of which have direct flights from China — have begun screening passengers.  Here are some basic facts about the virus, its symptoms, prevention, and what to do if you believe you are infected. The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest X-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs.  According to the World Health Organization, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 after exposure.  In general with coronavirus, when you have symptoms, you're most infectious. If you have travelled to Wuhan, China and develop symptoms of 2019 Novel Coronavirus infection, avoid contact with others and follow up with your health-care professional, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) website. People who have been to Wuhan arriving in Canada will leave the airport with information in English, French and simplified Chinese on what to do if they do experience symptoms within 14 days. If you do see a doctor, the PHAC website stresses you should make sure to tell them: Respiratory samples are processed by provincial labs. The labs may screen for other things first like flu. The sample is also sent for confirmation at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. People who have been to Wuhan but have no symptoms are not tested, but it's an opportunity to give them leaflets and information if they get symptoms in 14 days, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, but health organizations, like the CDC in the U.S., recommend these everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of any respiratory viruses: After the SARS outbreak. the PHAC asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks. Watch| Prime Minister Justin Trudeau comments on the virus: The report found that masks can offer protection, but there's no evidence inexpensive masks can protect against flu virus particles small enough to be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract or the lungs.  It did find that the N95 masks are the most likely to be efficient because they filter particles smaller than one micron and provide a tight facial seal.. It's unclear however if those masks would be effective against this particular virus. Tam told reporters that wearing a mask when you're well is not an effective measure. However, health officials might want to put a mask on someone who is sick, for example when they enter the health system. But there's no recommendation to wear a mask for people going about daily activities.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/coronavirus-risk-to-canada-low-hajdu-1.5438030 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-masks-1.5437209,N/A
29,Anonymous,2020-01-23T19:39:04.974Z,Greenpeace loses Norway Arctic oil lawsuit appeal,"An Oslo appeals court approved Norway's plans for more oil exploration in the Arctic on Thursday, dismissing a lawsuit by environmentalists who had said it violated people's right to a healthy environment. The verdict upheld a ruling made by a lower court, rejecting arguments by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group that a 2015-2016 oil licensing round that gave awards to Equinor and others had breached Norway's constitution. ""The verdict is unanimous,"" the Borgarting Appeals Court said in its written decision. Greenpeace immediately said it would appeal the case to Norway's supreme court. Beate Kristine Sjaafjell, a law professor at the University of Oslo, said the supreme court may give a clearer answer on whether handing out new licenses violates Norway's constitution. ""It should not evade the big question of whether continuing with oil and gas exploitation contributes to dangerous climate change and conversely whether doing that is in line with Norway's expressed commitments to contributing to staying within the Paris agreement goals,"" she added. The lawsuit is seen as part of an emerging branch of law worldwide where plaintiffs seek to use a nation's founding principles to make the case for curbing emissions. The green groups cited article 112 of Norway's constitution, which guarantees the right of current and future generations to a healthy and sustainable environment, as well as the Paris climate agreement to limit global warming. ""The court's verdict is a big step in the right direction, and the reason is that the right to a healthy environment according to the constitution is acknowledged by the court of appeal,"" Greenpeace Norway chief Frode Pleym told reporters. ""The court of appeal also acknowledges that the emissions from Norwegian oil burned abroad are relevant,"" he added. Oil and gas extraction has helped make Norway one of the wealthiest nations on earth, with a $1.1 trillion sovereign wealth fund stemming from petroleum income. The government gave out ten Arctic exploration permits in the contested 23rd licensing round, including three in the southeastern part of the Barents Sea, near Norway's border with Russia. Norway's energy ministry welcomed the verdict. Oil companies have already drilled exploration wells in some licences, but have not made any significant discoveries. Aker BP plans to drill a well in one licence later this year. A win at the appeals court could have set a precedent for other climate cases globally, while limiting exploration by western Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, the plaintiffs said at the outset of the trial. But while environmental groups said more petroleum resources had already been discovered than could be exploited without breaching the Paris goals, the government argued that any decision to drill was for parliament to make, not the courts. There has been a surge in climate-related lawsuits in recent years, with campaigners viewing even unsuccessful litigation as an effective way of pressuring governments to be more ambitious about averting climate catastrophe. Over 1,500 climate-related cases were brought in 28 countries, mostly in the United States, between 2007 and 2020, according to Joana Setzer, a fellow at the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics. Most defendants are governments, but lawsuits are increasingly targeting big oil and gas companies, she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/greenpeace-loses-oil-appeal-norway-1.5437657,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-drilling-appeal-norway-1.5349086 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/norway-court-arctic-drilling-1.4472884,N/A
30,Kerry Campbell,2020-01-24T00:00:00.569Z,"Crapaud could be 'perfect model' of rural health care on P.E.I., says minister ","Minister of Health and Wellness James Aylward says his government is committed to filling a doctor vacancy in the Crapaud area — and that it's ""looking forward to setting Crapaud up as a perfect model"" for health care in rural P.E.I. The statement comes one day after community volunteers appeared before the province's health and social development committee, describing their ongoing two-year struggle to fill the position, and an apparent lack of commitment from the province to maintain a doctor in the community. Aylward said Thursday filling the position for a doctor based out of Crapaud has ""always been our plan,"" since the PC government came to power following the April 2019 provincial election. ""What we would envision for a community like Crapaud, for example, would be a full-time physician complemented with a nurse practitioner complemented with an RN that would visit the community who maybe specializes in COPD,"" said Aylward. There has been some confusion recently — expressed by members of all three political parties in the legislature Wednesday — over what the Dennis King government's plan might be to provide primary health care in rural communities. Community members in Crapaud built their own new 3,000-square foot clinic building and purchased the necessary medical equipment. That building is currently home to a walk-in clinic and a single nurse practitioner. Members of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc. told a committee of MLAs Wednesday they were advised by the province's deputy minister of health of a new direction in primary care, with clinics operating with a minimum of four to five physicians working under the same roof. But Aylward said Thursday that's not a policy his government is pursuing — that it remains committed to Crapaud and other rural communities operating with only one physician. With a ""standalone practice, like in Crapaud for example, we want to ensure that the doctor is supported by other health-care professionals"" such as nurse practitioners and registered nurses, Aylward said. And if communities want to advertise their own doctor vacancies to try to find a physician to fill them, ""full steam ahead,"" he said. The South Shore group told the committee they were asked by the province not to include that the vacant position was in Crapaud in ads they were running. They continued to do so regardless. ""I'm not sure where that came from, it may have been the previous administration,"" said Aylward. When contacted by CBC, Matt MacFarlane, co-chair of South Shore Health & Wellness Inc., said ""it's great to hear"" that the current government has planned all along to fill the doctor vacancy in Crapaud.

31,Anonymous,2020-01-24T18:05:12.207Z,Decision to bow out of leadership race weeks in the making: Pierre Poilievre,"Conservative MP Pierre Poilievre said today that weeks of uncertainty about whether he actually wanted to enter the party's leadership race came to a head as deadlines to sign contracts loomed. He said he went to bed a few nights ago pledging that if he did not feel ""all in"" for the job when he woke up, he'd drop out. That's what he did Thursday, throwing a bombshell into the ongoing campaign. Poilievre, known as a hard-edged, scrappy fighter on the floor of the House of Commons, grew emotional as he described his decision to back out. ""A friend of mine was texting me back and forth a few weeks ago and said, 'Are you going to do this?' I said, 'I don't know. Should I do it?'"" Poilievre said on his way into a Conservative caucus meeting today. ""And he said, 'You should write two letters to your daughter. One telling her why you did it and one telling her why you didn't.'"" Poilievre said he liked the second letter better and decided he was tired of constantly sacrificing his personal life to his professional one. Poilievre made the comments today on his way into a meeting of Conservative MPs and senators gathered to discuss strategy for Parliament's return last week.

32,Anonymous,2020-01-24T18:35:59.435Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence can keep working","An obstetrician at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital accused of sexual misconduct and professional incompetence by the province's physician regulator whose final day of work was supposed to be Friday is now allowed to continue working. On Thursday, the Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons announced Dr. Manivasan Moodley would face a hearing over allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. As a foreign-trained doctor, Moodley is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship was being withdrawn, and his last day of work was supposed to be Friday. However, the college announced today that another sponsor had come forward, which means Moodley will be able to continue practising medicine. His hearing over accusations of sexual misconduct and professional incompetence is scheduled to begin next month. On Thursday night, about 80 people rallied outside the Cape Breton Regional Hospital to show their support for Moodley. In a news release, the college said there has been significant public response to the allegations against Moodley.""Outrage towards women who come forward alleging sexual misconduct is exactly why sexual misconduct is under-reported,"" Dr. Gus Grant, the college's registrar, said in a news release. ""Dr. Moodley is owed and will receive due process. At the same time, the complainants are owed privacy, safety and freedom from intimidation. Given the nature of public and social media postings, they understandably feel threatened, and see the support of Dr. Moodley as a response against them."" The college alleges that in the case of a patient referred to only as A.B., Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in a sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. For patient C.D., the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace.

Seventeen of the 34 are still under medical observation, according to Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesperson. U.S. President Donald Trump had initially said he was told that no troops had been injured in the Jan. 8 strike. The military said symptoms were not immediately reported after the strike and in some cases became known days later. After the first reports that some soldiers had been hurt, Trump referred to them as ""headaches"" and said the cases were not as serious as injuries involving the loss of limbs. Hoffman's disclosure that 34 had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, was the first update on the number injured in Iran's missile attack on al-Asad airbase in western Iraq since the Pentagon said on Jan. 17 that 11 service members had been flown out of Iraq with concussion-like symptoms. Hoffman said that of the 34 with TBI, 18 were evacuated from Iraq to U.S. medical facilities in Germany and Kuwait, and 16 stayed in Iraq. Seventeen of the 18 evacuees were sent to Germany, and nine remain there; the other eight have been transported to the United States for continued observation or treatment. The one American sent to Kuwait has since returned to duty. All 16 of those who were diagnosed with TBI and remained in Iraq have since returned to duty, Hoffman said.

34,Anonymous,2020-01-23T23:39:25.185Z,"Brexit bill becomes law, paving the way for Britain to leave the EU next week ","Britain's delayed and disputed Brexit bill became law on Thursday, removing the last parliamentary obstacle to leaving the European Union in just over a week. The U.K. is finally leaving the 28-nation bloc more than 3½ years after voters narrowly opted to do so in a June 2016 referendum — and after interminable rounds of political wrangling. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans announced Thursday in the British House of Commons that the Withdrawal Agreement Act had received royal assent from the Queen, the final formality in its legislative journey. An identical announcement was made by the Speaker of Parliament's House of Lords. Evans's brief announcement, which drew cheers of ""Hear! Hear!"" from some Conservative lawmakers in the Commons, came hours after the bill completed its passage through Parliament late Wednesday by getting approval from the House of Lords. ""At times, it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The EU parliament also must ratify the Brexit divorce deal before Jan. 31, Britain's scheduled departure date. The EU parliament's constitutional affairs committee voted by a large margin Thursday to approve the Brexit withdrawal deal, preparing the way for a vote of all European lawmakers in Brussels next Wednesday. ""It's a historical moment, albeit a sombre moment, for us. We deeply regret this outcome,"" committee chair Antonio Tajani said after the 23-3 vote. After years of divorce negotiations between the British government and the EU, U.K. lawmakers repeatedly defeated attempts by both Johnson and his predecessor Theresa May to finalize Britain's departure terms with the other 27 nations of the bloc. That changed when Johnson's Conservatives won Britain's Dec. 12, 2019, election, giving his government the ability to override the objections of opposition parties. Opposition members of the House of Lords battled to amend the withdrawal bill but were overruled by Johnson's 80-strong majority in the Commons. But deep divisions over Brexit remain. After the royal assent was announced, Scottish National Party lawmaker Ian Blackford said the U.K. was in a ""constitutional crisis"" because the legislatures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland did not back the Brexit bill. ""Boris Johnson has trampled over the democratic votes in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff,"" Blackford said. The Scottish National Party says Scotland should hold a referendum on independence from the U.K., which Johnson refuses to allow. Despite Johnson's repeated promise to ""get Brexit done"" on Jan. 31, the day of departure only marks the start of the country's EU exit. Guy Verhofstadt, the leading EU lawmaker on Brexit, said the bloc's parliament would continue to scrutinize the way Britain implemented the divorce agreement — especially to ensure that the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. are protected after Brexit. In February, Britain and the EU will begin negotiations on their future ties, racing to strike new relationships for trade, security and a host of other areas by the end of 2020. Johnson insists he won't agree to any delays in those talks beyond the end of the year. The U.K. is also keen to begin talks on a free trade deal with the United States, and intends to negotiate simultaneously with the EU and the U.S. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a deal with Britain was ""an absolute priority"" of President Donald Trump and the U.S. expects to complete it within the year. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said a trade deal between the two countries shouldn't be too difficult because their economies are similar. ""Both are very heavily services oriented, and within services, such as financial services, there's already a pretty high degree of integration and co-ordination, so it should be much easier mechanically,"" he said in Davos. But British opposition politicians are already raising concerns about issues ranging from food-safety standards — especially the U.S. practice of chlorine-washing chicken to kill germs — to drug prices. Ross sought to dampen concerns that a trade deal would mean higher drug prices in the U.K. as U.S. pharmaceutical companies look to gain concessions from Britain's state-run National Health Service. ""What we think is that drugs should have similar prices wherever they are, but I don't believe we are in any position to tell the U.K. what they should pay for drugs,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brexit-law-1.5438234,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/eu-u-k-deal-european-commission-impossible-to-agree-1.5418687 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ireland-election-feb-1.5425981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933,N/A
35,Nahlah Ayed,2020-01-24T10:40:56.616Z,'Historic day for international justice': UN Rohingya ruling brings glimmer of hope,"Is it possible for a court to stop ongoing violence aimed at genocide? A group of international lawyers believes it is, and that in persuading the UN's top court to act, they may have saved thousands of lives. The genocide accusation brought forward by Gambia against Myanmar is still far from settled. But on Thursday, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ordered Myanmar and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to do everything possible to protect Rohingya Muslims remaining in the country until the bigger question is settled. To Myanmar's many critics, the unanimous court decision is a flicker of the official rebuke the country has long deserved for its treatment of Rohingya people. It's an embarrassment for Suu Kyi. But in the ICJ's public takedown of her best arguments against accusations of genocide, lawyers and advocates also see another glimmer: a possible turn for the moribund international justice  system. ""Today is a historic day for international justice,"" says Payam Akhavan, a Canadian professor at Montreal's McGill University and a lawyer with the team representing Gambia. ""To their credit, the judges rose to the occasion … and if [Thursday's] order can buy a measure of protection for the 600,000 Rohingya that remain in that country and prevent further atrocities against them, I think this effort will have been very well worth all the trouble that it has taken."" The ICJ, which resolves disputes between states, isn't used to hearing about accusations of systematic sexual assault and murder and alleged attempts to destroy a people. Nor is it accustomed to the kind of spectacle unleashed when Suu Kyi decided to come, in the flesh, to the hearing back in December to defend her country against such accusations. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 that Human Rights Watch characterized as a ""campaign of ethnic cleansing."" UN investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent."" Six weeks after hearing Gambia's argument for ""provisional measures"" to protect Rohingya still in Myanmar, the court was of the opinion that they do ""remain extremely vulnerable."" The judgment, read by court president Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf, poked holes in Suu Kyi's repeated argument that the violence in Rakhine state amounted to an internal conflict with an armed Rohingya group. ""Irrespective of the situation that the Myanmar government is facing in Rakhine state,"" the court noted, ""Myanmar remains under the obligation incumbent upon it as a state party to the Genocide Convention."" All 17 judges unanimously agreed Myanmar must protect Rohingya Muslims against genocidal acts, and exceeded Gambia's requests by requiring a check-in report from Myanmar every six months until the case is resolved. Such unanimity is exceedingly rare. Such decisions by an international court even more so. ""More recently, international justice has suffered a few setbacks,"" Gambia's justice minister, Abubacarr Tambadou, said following the ruling. ""I think [the decision] is a huge boost for international law and international justice."" The order is legally binding, but the court has no way to enforce the decision, short of reporting its decision to the Security Council. But the top UN body has failed to act on Myanmar in the past. Advocates still believe that Suu Kyi and her government, keen on international investment, will seek to comply. A UN fact-finding mission concluded that Myanmar's military acted with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine state, and the UN General Assembly passed a resolution late last month condemning Myanmar for human rights abuses. Yet Myanmar has largely avoided international action thanks in part to China, which opposed referring the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC). The presentation of the case to the ICJ was an attempt to work around the inertia — though the ICC has now opened an investigation into the matter. Thursday's decision quoted extensively from both the UN assembly resolution and the UN fact-finding mission report, which was also heartening to international justice advocates. ""The international justice road ahead is long,"" said Pam Singh, a Canadian with the international justice program at Human Rights Watch. For now, she adds, the order ""offers a much-needed reminder of what international justice can deliver when a country like Gambia shows moral courage, vision and leadership."" Myanmar has always denied persecuting Rohingya or committing anything resembling genocide. Suu Kyi, once a human rights icon, has been roundly criticized for failing to stand up for Rohingya people. Among other things, the Nobel laureate was stripped of her honorary Canadian citizenship. Canada's Parliament was the first to declare what happened in Rakhine state a ""genocide."" Suu Kyi published a letter in the Financial Times on Thursday quoting her own government's investigation, which concluded there was no evidence of genocide. It did, however, indicate there is some evidence of possible war crimes. She also cautioned against the international court's reliance on the UN fact-finding mission, which in turn relied on testimony from refugees which her government's investigation says may be ""inaccurate."" She said Myanmar has been condemned ""on unproven statements without the due process of criminal investigation."" Myanmar can only deal with any violations ""if adequate time is given for domestic justice to run its course,"" she added. A release from Myanmar's foreign ministry was more blunt, blaming Myanmar's accusers for presenting a ""distorted picture of the situation in Rakhine, and [affecting] Myanmar's bilateral relations with several countries."" François-Philippe Champagne, Canada's foreign affairs minister, urged Myanmar to comply with the court's ruling. As did Tambadou, who said the decision presented an opportunity to Myanmar for a change in course. For the more than 700,000 Rohingya displaced over the border in Bangladesh, the ruling changes nothing. Many of them nonetheless tuned in on radios and phones to hear the proceedings. Among the most persecuted people in the world, there were many who took heart. ""It has been a very, very painful journey for us to get here,"" said Yasmin Ullah, a Canadian Rohingya activist who was in the court at The Hague. Despite the failings of the international justice system, she added, ""we got here — and that says something about the resilience of our people.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/icj-rohingya-ruling-1.5438557,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/world-court-myanmar-protect-rohingya-genocide-1.5437258 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/suu-kyi-denies-myanmar-genocide-allegations-at-international-court-of-justice-1.5391947,N/A
36,Eric Rankin,2020-01-24T12:00:00.144Z,The pain of the missing pleasure craft: Surrey family fights for return of its boat,"When Matt and Justine Brown decided to sell their boat through a Surrey broker, they had no idea they'd be left high and dry — no boat, no money, and no one able to help get their property back. Yet, they know exactly who has their boat. Their 2007 Bayliner disappeared at Breakwater Marine last summer, right before the company was raided by the RCMP in a major fraud investigation.  Then mysteriously, their boat showed up last month in the possession of a Pitt Meadows man, who claims he bought it. With ownership now in dispute, the RCMP, Transport Canada and the Brown's insurance company say there's nothing they can do. ""It just boggles my mind and doesn't make sense how it happened,"" said Matt Brown, 34. He says he and his wife are ""completely devastated and just bewildered."" Justine Brown, 30, is unshakeable: ""It's our boat 100 per cent."" But that's what the new owner says, too. On July 20, the Browns consigned their six metre-long Bayliner with Breakwater Marine owner Aaron Fell. Fell signed a contract promising they'd receive $17,000 — money the Browns felt would be better spent raising their two young boys. But on Aug. 8, Surrey RCMP swept in to Breakwater Marine, alleging fraudulent business practices. Fell was arrested but has not been charged. He has denied any criminal wrongdoing, saying he merely ran into financial difficulties. The RCMP has appealed for potential victims to come forward.   The Browns realized their boat was missing and opened a file with investigators. They also contacted Transport Canada, which grants pleasure craft licences, alerting the regulator to the Breakwater raid — and asking it to be on the lookout for attempts to re-register their vessel's hull ID number.  There were no leads for two months — then, a break. In October, Aaron Fell resurfaced on Facebook after his arrest. When the Browns asked him what happened to their boat, Fell had a surprising answer — he claimed another customer had stolen the boat from his lot, just before the raid. CBC News is withholding the customer's identity since he hasn't been charged with a crime. He, too, appears to have been caught up in Breakwater's meltdown. ""We owed him $8,000 for a consignment [on his boat],"" wrote Fell in a text to the Browns. ""And the next thing we knew he had hooked up and drove away with your boat.""  Armed with the name, the Browns hired a private investigator. In December, the P.I. discovered their missing Bayliner in the yard of a Pitt Meadows mini-storage, just a block away from the man's home. But when the RCMP were called in, the man produced a bill of sale, purporting to show he had legally purchased the boat from Fell with an $8,000 trade-in and $8,500 in cash. The new owner had used that document to register the Bayliner in his name with Transport Canada —  despite the Brown's earlier warning the boat had disappeared and despite discrepancies in the bill of sale. The hull serial number was wrong by several characters but corrected in the online application for a pleasure craft licence issued by Transport Canada.  Initially, police seized the Bayliner. But on Dec. 18, after the new owner's lawyer got involved, investigators returned the boat to the Pitt Meadows man. The only thing the Browns ended up with was their boat trailer —  because police told them it was still registered in their name through the Insurance Corporation of B.C. and there had been no transfer of ownership. It now sits empty in their driveway. ""It's a constant reminder of the frustration for us"", said Matt Brown.  In a statement to CBC News, Ridge Meadows RCMP say they ""wholeheartedly empathize"" with the Browns but had no choice. ""Unfortunately ... two separate parties have reasonable documentation showing ownership and police cannot determine who lawfully purchased or owns this property,"" said Const. Julie Klaussner in a written statement.  ""Therefore, the avenue we are suggesting to resolve the matter is through a civil court process."" The Browns say they don't have money for a lawsuit against Fell or the new owner. Transport Canada says it's in communication with police and ""has provided all relevant files"" but won't say more because the wider investigation against Breakwater is still active. Aaron Fell, contacted by the CBC, claims there was no fraud on his part —  and the bill of sale was simply a draft for a proposed deal he was trying to work out, before the customer drove off with the Brown's boat. ""My assumption was once I gave the RCMP and the Browns the information about the person that was trying to buy the boat, that they simply could just go to his house and take it because it's not paid for in full,"" said Fell. ""If I was the Browns, I'd be livid."" The CBC contacted the man who now possesses the Brown's Bayliner. He declined to comment. Matt Brown says he is frustrated and ""let down big time"" over the loss of his boat. ""It's $17,000 ... that's multiple years of savings for us,"" he said. ""Whether it was potentially activities or trips or savings towards our sons' education, those options are gone for us now."" Justine has a simple appeal to the new owner. ""I would just hope that he would find kindness in his heart to realize ... he's been involved in something wrong, whether intentional or unintentional,"" she said.

37,"Katie Pedersen, Eric Szeto, Asha Tomlinson",2020-01-20T16:56:56.850Z,Nearly half of Canadians are concerned about vaccine safety. Here's why.,"Like many new parents, Meggan Larson was anxious to learn everything she could about keeping her kids healthy. So, she joined community groups and forums on Facebook, hoping to learn the ins and outs of healthy living as she navigated her new role as a parent. What she found instead were piles of warnings about vaccines. ""It seemed like everywhere I looked, there was [a post about] another child being injured by vaccines — and not a child getting polio,"" she said. ""It was definitely convincing."" As a result, Larson became ""vaccine hesitant."" Unlike strident anti-vaccination activists known as ""anti-vaxxers,"" those who are ""vaccine hesitant"" don't consider themselves against vaccination necessarily; they are just unsure about the safety and/or efficacy of vaccines. The number of vaccine-hesitant parents worldwide is growing. Last year, the World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy a Top 10 threat to global health. ""You just kind of go down a rabbit hole of information,"" said Larson. ""It seemed like the more you clicked on links that people would post, the more stories you would see. And it just seemed so loud."" WATCH | CBC Marketplace's Asha Tomlinson is joined by associate medical officer of health for Toronto Public Health Dr. Vinita Dubey, answering your questions on vaccinations and myths. Have a question? Ask on YouTube here: About half of Canadians have some level of hesitancy, according to the Wellcome Global Monitor, a survey by a U.K.-based health foundation that looks at global confidence in immunization. In its latest 2018 survey, only 53 per cent of Canadians chose ""strongly agree"" when presented with the statement ""vaccines are safe"" while 58 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are effective"" and 76 per cent strongly agreed with ""vaccines are important."" Marketplace sifted through studies and arguments, examined anti-vaccination documentaries and attended an anti-vaxx rally in Washington, D.C., to get a sense of the information being distributed. The team also spoke with more than a dozen vaccine-hesitant and anti-vaxx Canadians and heard from many more via email. Many of the arguments and scientific studies seemed reasonable, so Marketplace ran them by specialists. Journalists further consulted with toxicologists, vaccinologists, microbiologists, psychologists and academics throughout this investigation, all of whom confirmed the safety and efficacy of vaccines. So, why does anti-vaxx messaging remain so effective at sowing doubt? Some experts point to our cognitive biases, mental shortcuts that help us understand and remember information. The way that misinformation is disseminated on social media manipulates us — intentionally or not — into wanting to believe it. Dr. Olivier Drouin, a Montreal pediatrician with a background in behavioural psychology, sees these biases at play with parents of his patients. ""They just care deeply about their child, and so those cognitive biases are amplified,"" he said. One bias that vaccine misinformation plays on is our omission bias, or our tendency to prefer inaction over action when we are faced with potential negative consequences, because we will feel less personally responsible for the outcome. Larson says she can relate. ""For me, the worry is paralyzing initially because I don't want to hurt my kids,"" she said. Larson said the misinformation she'd read was convincing, so she was delaying making a decision about vaccination until she felt more sure. ""My kids will be fine for now while I figure out what I'm going to do,"" she recalls thinking. ""And the years just go by — and suddenly, you have a five-year-old who's never had a single vaccine."" Another bias that makes us susceptible to misinformation is our identifiable victim bias, or our tendency to feel more connected to the emotional story of a single victim, rather than a larger cause backed by statistics. If a charity wants to inspire people to donate to its cause, for example, it might tell the story of a single victim rather than explaining why a cause is important through figures and facts. Even though she'd seen the statistics proving the benefits of vaccines, Larson said the individual horror stories were more impactful and sowed doubt. ""I was like, 'Gosh, this is happening all the time, I can't do this to my children,'"" she said. Much of the anti-vaccination information spread online is anecdotal. When parents come to Drouin with doubts about vaccines, he says, they often start with an anecdote they read or a video they saw. ""They always start with the story of somebody — either a celebrity, or some relative, or their hairdresser, or somebody in their environment who had a personal story — so they feel that connection,"" he said. ""I think that's one of the strongest biases I see when it comes to vaccinations."" Another big issue, Drouin says, is a bias called probability neglect, or our tendency to disregard numbers when there's a highly emotional potential outcome — even an extremely unlikely one. ""If I'm with my patient, and I speak about the risk of [requiring] a transfusion, for example, it's one in a million. Well, you know, they're not listening to the number,"" said Drouin. His patients immediately start to worry about their child having to be in the ICU and being really sick, he said. ""The minute I mention the risk, it's forgotten,"" he said. ""They're focusing on the vividness of the image it brings to mind."" The bigger the number, the harder it is to put into context, he says. ""What is one in a 100,000 versus a one in a million chance? Like, it's really kind of a strange number to think about,"" he said. ""We don't even really have context about what it means, even though something might be 100 times more likely."" Larson says she struggled with the numbers even after she had decided to vaccinate. ""It was still scary because I'm like, 'Oh my gosh, I hope they're not the one in a gazillion who is going to have some horrific reaction,"" she said. So, what convinced Larson to vaccinate? She had started questioning the rhetoric behind the information she was reading and was talking to her doctor about it. ""I started clicking on the sources that anti-vaccine campaigns were linking [to] and realized that most of them were garbage,"" she said. The scientific studies were not the hard evidence she thought they were. ""Once you actually followed it to the conclusion, it didn't actually state at all what [the messaging] said it did."" WATCH | Meggan Larson's children, along with her sister's kids, came down with whooping cough: Just when she was about to book an appointment to vaccinate, Larson's unvaccinated niece came down with whooping cough — and it quickly spread to all five of her niece's siblings, as well as to Larson's three kids. It was a scary reminder of how contagious many vaccine-preventable diseases are, she said. ""Coming across someone with whooping cough or polio, I mean, you're going to get it, it's a miracle if you don't."" All of Larson's kids fully recovered and have since been vaccinated, along with the children of her her sister, Tara Hills. Hills spoke out about vaccine misinformation back in 2015, but it has taken Larson four years to go public about her experience. ""The only reason that I wanted to share my story is because I don't want people to sit in fear anymore,"" she said. Here are some of the most pervasive concerns Canadians have about vaccines, and why experts say we shouldn't worry about them: It's true that vaccines contain chemicals that would be considered toxic at very high doses. But so does pretty much everything humans interact with daily. Even water is toxic in high enough quantities. Although the idea of a ""chemical"" may sound harmful, everything we eat can be broken down into its chemical makeup. A banana, for example, contains dozens of chemical compounds. The vaccine ingredients that most people are concerned about — mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum — are present in very small, non-toxic quantities. Mercury was previously used as a preservative in some vaccines in the form of thimerosal. It was one of the first ingredients that parents took issue with, and there was so much public concern that it was removed from almost all vaccines, despite the fact that it never existed in quantities that would be considered problematic. Vaccines only ever contained 50 micrograms of thimerosal (equal to 25 micrograms of mercury) per 0.5 millilitre dose. For comparison, that's about the same amount of elemental mercury in a three-ounce can of tuna. Nowadays, mercury only exists in certain types of flu shots. Formaldehyde is another ingredient often of concern. There is only between 0.1 mg and 0.003 mg of formaldehyde in a single dose, depending on the vaccine. Compare that to a 200-gram pear, which contains 12 mg of formaldehyde, or 120 times as much. Formaldehyde is actually a chemical that your body creates itself as part of the metabolic process. Aluminum is another ingredient people are concerned about. It is also found in very low quantities in vaccines for diseases such as HPV and hepatitis. Aluminum is one of the most common metals found in nature and is present in air, food and water and breast milk. Keep in mind that very few vaccinations contain aluminum, and those that do, only contain 0.85 mg per dose. Compare that to 10-20 mg of aluminum in one tablet of buffered aspirin. Antacids can contain anywhere from 104 to 208 mg of aluminum per tablet, or more than 100 times more aluminum than any vaccine. The reason it is added to vaccines is because it helps create the immune response needed to develop immunity. Vaccines work by injecting a dead, weakened or partial version of the virus into the body so the immune system can learn what it looks like and how to fight it the next time it is encountered — before it gets deep within the body and causes physical harm. Adjuvants, like aluminum, make that dead virus look more threatening than it is in order to activate an immune response, prompting the body to learn how to fight the disease instead of immediately flushing it out. It is important to note that all traces of aluminum (and the rest of the ingredients in the vaccine) would still be flushed completely out of the body within a day or two, leaving behind only the lessons learned by your immune cells. The ingredients don't build up in the body, therefore, receiving many vaccines will not stack up the levels of aluminum or other ingredients. Learn more about aluminum and other adjuvants here. The claim that links vaccines and autism originates from a now-discredited 1998 study published in the prestigious Lancet medical journal by former gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield titled ""Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis and pervasive developmental disorder in children."" There were 13 authors listed on the study, with Wakefield being the lead author. But in 2004, 10 authors retracted the interpretation of the study after ""serious allegations of research misconduct"" were brought to the attention of The Lancet, including allegations of biased selection of patients and unethical, invasive procedures. The journal also found Wakefield had unreported conflicts of interest, namely, that some of the research was funded by lawyers who were acting on behalf of parents suing vaccine manufacturers. As a result, Wakefield lost his medical licence. Many studies have since been done to test his hypothesis, but all scientifically reputable studies found no link. A 900-page analysis by the American Institute of Medicine (IOM) looked at all relevant studies and meta-analysis, finding that ""the mechanistic evidence regarding an association between MMR vaccine and autism is lacking."" This may sound like the science is simply insufficient, but microbiologist Jocelyn Srigley explained that in scientific terms, ""lacking"" is tantamount to saying evidence is not just weak, but absent altogether. The biggest and most recent study looking for a correlation between vaccines and autism followed 657,461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 2013. This study compared MMR-vaccinated with unvaccinated children and found ""no increased risk for autism."" This study even looked at sub-factors, such as sibling history of autism, autism risk factors or other childhood vaccinations to see if those factors could combine with a vaccine to create a higher risk. But again, it found no increased risk. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a profitable industry, but vaccines are not big money-makers compared to other drugs. Only two to three per cent of the global pharmaceutical profits come from vaccines, despite the fact that most people on earth are vaccinated. In fact, most childhood vaccines have expired patents, and it's estimated that once a generic drug enters the market after a patent expiration, name-brand sales drop by 80 per cent. Physicians often lose money on the administration of vaccines, and some governments have to incentivise drug companies to keep making them because of the fact that the profit margins are so low. Vaccines take lots of time and money to develop because the regulatory standards are higher than for other drugs since they are being injected into healthy people. They may make some money in the first few years, but they also have to carry the burden of cost for all the years of research and development. Vaccines prevent millions of people from getting seriously sick every year. If you're worried about motives, keep in mind that Big Pharma makes a lot more money off people who are sick than people whom vaccines have kept healthy. Even though we rarely encouter certain diseases anymore, such as pertussis or polio, they are only kept at bay because the vast majority of the population is vaccinated. If you talk to older generations, they'll tell you stories of their friends who became deaf, blind, disabled or died from the diseases that vaccines have eliminated in North America. In areas where vaccination rates drop past a certain threshold, we can see resurgence of these diseases, which can be picked up and brought back to countries that had virtually eliminated them. For example, Samoa had a significant drop in vaccination rates over the past few years due in part to anti-vaccination campaigns and an MMR scare after a nurse accidentally mixed up two shots with an expired anesthetic, resulting in two deaths. When measles made it into the community, it quickly infected thousands of people; 81 of those infected died, and almost all of them were babies and young children. Authorities arrested an anti-vaxxer for spreading misinformation during the epidemic while the government was frantically trying to get everyone vaccinated. The only disease that has been entirely eradicated worldwide is smallpox. This was because of a very effective mass-vaccination initiative in the 1960s that managed to drive the disease into extinction. Polio is a candidate for eradication, with only three endemic countries left. Until complete eradication is reached, vaccination is still necessary for highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Measles can live for two hours while airborne, which means if an unvaccinated person entered a room where someone with measles coughed an hour earlier, they would still be likely to catch the virus.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccine-myths-biases-1.5429845,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/marketplace-anti-vaccination-hidden-camera-washington-1.5429805 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccines-trust-1.5181208 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/facebook-and-twitter-won-t-block-anti-vaccination-posts-1.5142617 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/anti-vaccination-threats-against-canadian-doctors-1.5115955,N/A

""I feel like it is my responsibility to take care of this. It's the minimum I could do,"" he said. Masoumeh Ghavi and her sister, Mahdieh, died two weeks ago when Iranian forces shot down Ukraine International Flight 752 as it left Tehran. Fifty-seven Canadians were killed — revised down from an earlier estimate of 63 — plus dozens of students travelling to Canada to study. Masoumeh had been studying engineering at Dalhousie University since August. In her apartment on Queen Street, the apples in the refrigerator were still fresh. ""I still am shocked. I can't believe she's gone. I was texting with her right before takeoff. She was giving me the time that she would get here, so I could pick her up. It's really hard,"" Hamidi said. He's been close with Ghavi's father for 20 years. She was working part time for his technology company while she studied. Her younger sister, Mahdieh, was travelling to Halifax for the first time, also to study. Masoumeh bought a new toaster and kettle for their apartment, which were still in the box as Hamidi packed them up. This process of packing up is being repeated in homes across the country. ""Everybody who knows ... anybody who has been in this tragic accident, you feel pretty much the same. They all are in pain,"" Hamidi said. One of the men helping Hamidi empty the apartment broke down weeping as he watched two others dismantle Masoumeh's bedframe. Mohamed Barzeghar has a picture on his phone of Masoumeh standing by a Christmas tree at the Halifax airport. He took it when he dropped her off for her flight to Iran. The men used a dolly to move boxes and furniture to load a white pickup truck parked in the frigid cold. Hamidi said he'll keep Masoumeh's belongings in storage for now because he can't bear to ask her parents and brother for further guidance. ""To be honest with you, I didn't have the courage to talk about this stuff [with them]. I just asked them, 'I could take care of those?' and I'm just doing it,"" he said. Hamidi said the family may come to Halifax. He said it's vital that a tragedy like the shooting down of a civilian airliner never happens again. ""How can we guys do something in a different way to stop such disasters ... That's the question,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/masoumeh-ghavi-halifax-student-plane-crash-iran-apartment-1.5436859,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotians-don-t-need-be-overly-concerned-coronavirus-1.5436584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/pads-and-tampons-not-part-of-halifax-region-s-budget-1.5436427 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/advocate-medically-assisted-dying-law-1.5436436 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ar-15-handgun-theft-break-and-enter-aylesford-1.5436065 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-to-stage-league-s-1st-regular-season-game-in-halifax-1.5436219,N/A
39,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-28T16:10:35.194Z,"'Companies knew they had a big problem': Kia, Hyundai owners say they were knowingly sold defective vehicles ","A group of vehicle owners is going after two major automakers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, claiming they were knowingly sold defective vehicles then left to pay for losses and repairs when the engines failed or caught fire.  In a lawsuit filed this week, Hyundai and Kia are accused of intentionally concealing the defect from buyers of vehicles with Theta, Nu, and Gamma engines. ""When complaints came ... [owners] were told 'gosh we haven't heard of that happening. Isn't that weird?' And in fact the companies knew they had a big problem,"" Regina lawyer Tony Merchant, who is heading up the lawsuit, told Go Public. The class action was filed in Court of Queen's Bench in Regina on Monday, but has yet to be certified by the court. It names Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and their American counterparts — Hyundai Motors America and Kia Motors America. None of the allegations in the lawsuit have been proven in court. A Go Public investigation revealed concerns about Hyundai and Kia engines failing at high speeds or spontaneously bursting into flames — putting some drivers and their passengers into life-threatening situations and leaving others with thousands in repair bills. Consumer and safety advocates have criticized the South Korean automakers for taking too long to issue recalls of too few models with the Theta-family engines. The recalls started in 2015 and are still rolling out. ""Their difficulty is that they can't fix the problem. They don't know what to do about the problem. So a recall where there's no fix is really no recall at all,"" Merchant said. Go Public asked Hyundai if it had a fix for the engine problems, but it didn't respond to that question directly. Merchant says the proposed class-action suit involves 37 Hyundai and Kia owners, and seven different models ranging in years from 2011-16 — but he expects the number of drivers and vehicles involved to grow once word gets out about the lawsuit.  The legal action is also looking for compensation for owners with the problematic engines who haven't had failures or fires, but are facing a loss in vehicle value. ""For the vast majority of people, they're not going to have a safety problem. And many of them are going to be compelled to continue to operate these vehicles because they can't afford the hit of getting rid of them. So they're entitled to financial compensation that flows from having a vehicle that's significantly depreciated,"" Merchant says. Hyundai Auto Canada, Kia Canada and Kia Motors America all told Go Public they do not comment on any current or pending litigation. Hyundai Motors USA responded to Go Public's questions about the latest Canadian lawsuit with a general statement.  ""Nothing is more important than the safety and security of Hyundai customers,"" spokesperson Michael Stewart wrote in an email. ""Hyundai actively monitors and evaluates potential safety concerns, including non-collision engine fires, with all of our vehicles and acts swiftly to recall any vehicles with safety-related defects … Hyundai quality and safety is among the best in the industry.""  Go Public continues to get complaints from Hyundai and Kia owners, who say they are interested in joining a class-action suit if it means the automakers would have to take responsibility. Marnie and Adam Nelson contacted Go Public after seeing previous engine stories. The couple's 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe caught fire while it was parked in their driveway last March. They bought it six months earlier and paid more than $50,000 for the SUV. They contacted Hyundai's head office by email to report the fire and ask for a refund on the extended warranties they had purchased, but say no one followed up to investigate. Instead, the couple says most of their messages to head office were ignored and the local dealership was only interested in getting them to buy a new vehicle. ""As soon as they [the dealership] found out we weren't going to come back in and buy another car, we were persona non grata, they wanted nothing to do with us. No return calls — nothing,"" Adam said. ""They should be standing behind their products better,"" Marnie told Go Public.  The dealership declined to respond to Go Public's questions about the couple's situation directly, referring us to head office.  Hyundai says its records show the Nelsons went directly to their insurance company to report the fire and only reached out to the company for a refund on an extended warranty they had purchased for the vehicle. The couple says they received a partial refund. The company wrote in an email to Go Public that its policy is to investigate every case of a fire, ""that we are aware of and requested to investigate to determine if the cause is attributed to neglect, abuse, environment or the product itself."" The Nelsons say their fire was never investigated by the company. The company did reach out to the couple after Go Public inquiries.  The engine in Daniel Roukema's 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe didn't burn — it died in 2016 while he was driving on a highway near Toronto. He says he had to pay about $9,000 to replace it. When he asked the company to cover the cost, Roukema says it refused and blamed his lack of upkeep for the engine failure, which he denies.  Two recalls were issued for the vehicle after he paid to replace his engine. ""I think the way they've handled the situation is absolutely abhorrent … we [owners] ought to be compensated,"" he said. Hyundai did not respond to specific questions about Roukema's case, but said ""if a customer previously paid for repairs in advance of a recall being issued, and it is determined that the repairs required were a result of a recall, Hyundai will reimburse the customer for the recall-specific repairs to their vehicle."" Hyundai says it will soon launch what it calls a microsite that aims to answer questions for customers affected by recalls. In Quebec, the Automobile Protection Association and a group of Kia owners are suing Kia for compensation for alleged engine problems with the 2010-15 Kia Forte. Fires are not part of that class-action lawsuit. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September. The transportation authority is asking owners who have had problems to contact the department.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

40,Shane Magee,2020-01-23T09:00:00.931Z,"Moncton, Dieppe break building permit records as construction booms","The skyline tells the tale: new buildings are popping up across the Moncton region thanks to a construction boom that's seen record-setting building permit values amid an increasingly competitive residential housing market. ""We have some pretty impressive stats,"" Moncton Mayor Dawn Arnold said at a city council meeting Monday.  ""We're shattering building permit records … We've got cranes every direction we look, and we are, as has been said, the economic engine of the province."" Across the metro area, new hotels and apartment buildings are rising as large new commercial and industrial buildings are built or expanded. John Wishart, CEO of the Greater Moncton Chamber of Commerce, called it ""a nice collision of metrics"" leading to economic growth. Building permits worth $378 million were issued in Moncton, Dieppe and Riverview last year, the municipalities reported. The building boom comes as residential vacancy rates continue a multi-year decline and rent costs rise. That can make it harder to find an apartment, particularly one that's affordable. The region's residential vacancy rate fell from 2.9 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in October 2019, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The low vacancy rate has prompted developers to build homes and apartment buildings. ""You just have to look around Dieppe, Riverview and Moncton to see the amount of building complexes going up, and the majority of them are apartment or condo buildings,"" Nadine Fullarton with the Moncton Northeast Construction Association said in an interview.  The organization represents general contractors, trade and sub contractors and suppliers to the construction industry. Fullarton said members of the association have reported a 30 to 40 per cent increase in developers offering contracts for apartment and condo buildings. In 2019, Moncton issued building permits for 16 new apartment buildings with 727 units, 68 new single-unit homes, and 114 duplex units.  Combined, residential permits accounted for 37.7 per cent of $257.4 million in building permits issued last year, a new city record. Last year was also record-setting for Dieppe, where permits worth $96 million topped a $90 million record set in 2016. Dieppe's figures include permits for 314 new housing units, though the largest single permit was for the city's new arena complex. In Riverview, the town issued permits worth a total of $25 million, shy of the 2015 record of $29 million.  All of the construction activity means steady employment for people in the construction industry, Fullarton said. It's meant a shortage of workers in some trades that prompted the organization to plan a national and international recruitment campaign. The region's immigration strategy calls for 2,700 to 3,500 immigrants per year by 2024 to sustain economic growth and fill jobs.  Wishart said there are downsides, including the increase in the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment from $698 in 2018 to $732 in October 2019. ""If you're bringing jobs to the community and you need to find housing for them, that is becoming difficult, especially for families,"" Wishart said. ""Maybe it's a good problem to have, but I'm not sure we can build (housing) fast enough and or at the right types."" In recent years, monthly home sales reports from the Greater Moncton Realtors du Grand Moncton have described the region's housing market breaking records. Parise Cormier, president of the association, called it a sellers market. The inventory of homes on the market has hit a 15-year low, which she said has resulted in some homes getting multiple purchase offers. ""Prices are slowly creeping up, but we don't have markets like you see in bigger cities,"" Cormier said. The average price for a single-family detached home in Greater Moncton stood at $197,600 in December 2019, up 4.6 per cent from a year before and 18.9 from five years earlier. Cormier said while the association representing realtors doesn't have firm data, anecdotally they're seeing a lot of people moving from more expensive markets in Canada.  A home selling for about $200,000 here would sell for about $1 million or more in Oakville, Ont., she said.  ""A lot of people are coming back home, a lot of people are retiring here, a lot of people coming here to start a family,"" Cormier said. ""We have a better quality of life, we see a lot of immigration and our employment is pretty steady."" But rising prices and increasing rents also make the city less affordable for those with a low income. Moncton has struggled to deal with people who are homeless. Lisa Ryan with the Greater Moncton Homelessness Steering Committee told CBC in December that there needs to be a stronger push to build more affordable housing.  ""When we see developments coming into our community, or no policies attached to that, we need to get brave at saying this is wrong,"" Ryan said.  On Monday, Moncton council ratified a new policy to be implemented later this year that could allow developments with affordable housing to move through the city's approval process faster. The decline in vacancy rates isn't limited to residential housing.  Ian Franklin, a vice-president with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield Atlantic, said the office space vacancy rate downtown is ""quite low,"" around four per cent. ""There's obviously a need for more office (space) downtown,"" he said. But he said he's not aware of any firm plans for new office buildings over the next two years.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-dieppe-construction-vacancy-rates-housing-1.5436533,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-construction-permits-development-1.5315065 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/charles-leblanc-moncton-fire-department-homeless-tent-city-1.5298120 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/moncton-council-downtown-development-1.4949560 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-greater-moncton-riverview-dieppe-1.5093986,N/A
41,Tom Ayers,2020-01-23T10:00:00.421Z,"As CBRM violated in-camera rules, documents show governance was 'pretty sloppy,' says prof","The Nova Scotia government is making changes to its training materials for municipalities after CBC News reported on Cape Breton regional council's in-camera practices. In 2018, Cape Breton Regional Municipality admitted it breached the Municipal Government Act by dealing with its own pay in camera four times over a period of two years. There is no penalty for breaching the Municipal Government Act, but the province now says training materials for councils are being revised to specifically forbid discussing pay behind closed doors. Those training materials are expected to be provided to CBRM as soon as possible and will be rolled out to all councils after the general municipal elections scheduled for this fall. An access-to-information request by CBC for correspondence covering the two years in which council pay was discussed in camera show some senior staff were OK with it, but does not clearly say whether any staff advised against it. ""One takeaway is that the governance of CBRM is not a well-oiled machine,"" said Tom Urbaniak, a political science professor at Cape Breton University. ""It's pretty sloppy."" In 2015, CBRM had to change its practices to start notifying the public about in-camera meetings after it was discovered council had held 31 secret meetings over a span of 22 months. The municipality was not saying ahead of time when it was meeting in camera or what was being discussed, and that is not allowed under the law. In 2018, after CBRM revealed it had been discussing council remuneration in camera, officials said they believed council could do that under rules allowing in-camera discussion on personnel matters. After CBC reported that, the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a ruling saying council members are not staff or personnel. The department said remuneration for elected officials must be discussed in open public meetings. In a recent email, the department said it provided CBRM with a training session on the Municipal Government Act — including a session on in-camera meetings — in April 2018. Departmental documents don't specifically say council pay can't be discussed in camera, but the training materials emphasize that municipal government should be conducted in public as much as possible. Urbaniak said access-to-information documents from CBRM at the time do not show whether staff, the mayor and councillors understood that. ""Even though there are ambiguities in the Municipal Government Act, the expectation is that our elected officials will err on the side of transparency,"" he said. Despite that, the documents show the municipality's chief administrative officer and clerk believed council pay could be discussed in camera. The documents also show the solicitor seemed to disagree, but they also show he deferred to the clerk on that. Urbaniak said that's interesting, but isn't as important as what council members thought. The documents show very little, if any, discussion among councillors on whether they could — or should — discuss their own pay behind closed doors. ""Councils themselves have to take responsibility for their effectiveness as governing bodies,"" Urbaniak said. ""These are elected officials and they have a public trust to uphold."" The issue was discussed briefly at a public council meeting in March 2017, when the mayor decided not to refer a discussion on remuneration to an in-camera session after senior staff disagreed on whether that was allowed. In any event, council pay was discussed in camera three times after that — twice after the April 2018 training session by the province. ""There was that one little experiment with going public and then it went back into confidential session,"" Urbaniak said. ""Unfortunately, the documents don't give us a clear indication about the sequence of events leading from that public meeting to putting this back into confidential session."" Mayor Cecil Clarke said after the Department of Municipal Affairs issued a clear ruling late in 2018 that council pay must be discussed in the open, CBRM changed its practice. ""When the department had made an indication it should be public, it quickly became public and that's the standing practice and will be going forward,"" he said. Clarke said CBRM is more open than it used to be and he said council goes beyond the requirements of the legislation, for instance, by holding public budget consultation sessions. ""Council ... as far as procedures and activities, has evolved and council will evolve because some of the complexities of issues today require to have that level of openness and transparency, and that's a good thing,"" he said.

42,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-12-09T01:00:00.670Z,Car owner forced to replace engine twice within weeks despite safety recall,"A B.C. man says he's in ""disbelief"" after learning he'll have to swallow the cost of replacing his SUV's engine — not once, but twice, within weeks — despite the vehicle being part of a major recall that was issued before the breakdowns. And he's not the only one facing thousands of dollars in repair bills for vehicles under recall. In June, Rick Lingard's 2011 Hyundai Tucson's engine seized and died while he was driving down a major highway near Cranbrook, B.C. ""They showed me the engine after they took it out and there was a hole in it. It was destroyed,"" said Lingard, who lives in Nelson.  He paid more than $7,000 to replace it, opting for a used engine with 40,000 kilometres on it, through an independent mechanic, after a Hyundai dealership quoted him more than $10,000 for a new one. A few weeks later, it happened again. ""The same kind of high-pitched rattle-y sound … and then all the lights came on again and — boom! I was in disbelief,"" he told Go Public. Then, another twist: Just three days after the second catastrophic engine failure, Lingard got a recall notice describing the same problem. The recall was issued in February, but the notice didn't arrive in the mail until August. Lingard says no one at two Hyundai dealerships he'd contacted about his engine breakdowns mentioned anything about a recall. ""To me, it's just irresponsible to the core,"" he said. Transport Canada could easily fix the problem, according to one automotive consumer advocate, by forcing Hyundai to cover Lingard's costs. But the federal agency, says George Iny of the Automotive Protection Association, tends not to use the full extent of its powers.  The agency also has the power to force recalls — under changes made last year to the Motor Vehicle Safety Act — but has never used it.  ""Transport Canada is a bit like an out-of-shape person who just got a gold-plated membership to the gym. That doesn't automatically put you in shape,"" said Iny. ""Transport Canada needs to act more assertively."" After getting the recall notice, Lingard submitted his receipts to Hyundai Canada. It rejected the claim, saying his first engine failure was due to ""insufficient engine maintenance, not the recall"" because Lingard didn't do sufficiently frequent oil changes prior to 100,000 kilometres of driving, and didn't provide receipts for subsequent changes.  The company says he changed his oil every 20,000 kilometres instead of every 12,000 as required by the manual. After the warranty expired, Lingard says he stopped going to the dealership for oil changes.  Iny says using oil changes as a reason to deny claims is common but puzzling.  ""The fact that you didn't keep records of oil changes doesn't make you negligent. That's just an invention,"" Iny said. ""It's not a valid reason for refusing coverage.""  He says both Kia and its part-owner Hyundai have admitted, in some cases, that such engine failures stem from metallic debris left inside during the manufacturing process.  In those cases, ""whether you did oil changes or not,"" Iny said, ""the debris was already there."" Lingard's recall notice doesn't mention debris.  Hyundai Canada also denies responsibility for Lingard's second blown engine because, according to a spokesperson, the engine was not ""provided, installed or inspected by a Hyundai dealer."" When Go Public asked why his recall notice took months to arrive, and why no one at the company told Lingard about the recall, it didn't respond.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they, too, are being left out of the recall. Scott Wild and his wife Donna Stewart, of Cambridge, Ont., experienced the same dangerous breakdown as Lingard, when the engine of their 2013 Kia Sportage suddenly failed at high speeds on June 4. Their mechanic also found a hole had been blown in the side of the engine and it needed to be replaced. ""I said, 'You can't be serious … this vehicle has 140,000 kilometres on it and it's finally paid off,'"" Wild said. That's when the couple discovered there's a recall on the 2013 Kia Sportage, but their specific vehicle isn't covered. Kia told them their vehicle identification number was not listed under the recall.  ""It was really weird, "" said Wild. ""What happened to our vehicle is exactly the same as what happens to all the vehicles that are on the list."" Kia Canada told Go Public that the couple's vehicle had an MPI (""multi-point injection"") engine — and only those with GDI (""gasoline direct injection"") engines are part of the recalls.  What's the difference? When Go Public asked, the company didn't answer. But independent mechanic Chris Solodko, in Hamilton, told Go Public he's repaired dozens of both types and, in his opinion, their engine problems are almost identical. ""They all have the same noise, the same problem. One [type of engine] is running on a high pressure and the other one is running on a low pressure,"" he said.  Transport Canada told Go Public it has received 65 complaints of engine failures not covered by the Kia and Hyundai recalls since March and says it is investigating whether more vehicles should be added. Iny says they have to move faster. ""There is a pattern here. What we need of the carmakers is an open mind that the complaints that fall outside of the group are not just turned down but that they are looked into,"" he said. Wild and Stewart ended up selling their vehicle for parts, then joined one of at least four Canadian, engine-related class-action lawsuits against Kia and Hyundai. The lawsuits have not yet been certified by the courts.  Both Hyundai and Kia have been dogged with engine failure and fire complaints and lawsuits in Canada and the U.S. Hyundai and Kia have recalled almost 500,000 vehicles in Canada for engine-related defects since 2015, due to manufacturing debris that could cause the engines to fail. The problem can also cause fires. Millions of other vehicles have been recalled in the U.S. and, in October, the companies agreed to set aside $758 million US to settle related class-actions in the U.S. and South Korea, pending approval by the courts. Iny is hopeful a U.S. settlement might mean one is coming for drivers in Canada, but it could be a while before that happens — if at all. ""We would want total parity,"" he said. In the meantime, Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a safety-related problem with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Wild and Stewart have filed complaints with Transport Canada. They are waiting to see what the agency decides. ""Zero compassion. Zero empathy. Zero everything,"" Wild said about his interaction with Kia staff. ""Basically, 'Sorry about your luck.'""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hyundai-kia-engine-failure-recalls-1.5382373,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-owners-claim-they-were-knowingly-sold-defective-vehicles-1.5073563 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/father-outraged-after-engine-fire-puts-family-at-risk-1.5064230 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-maintenance-kia-hyundai-oil-change-1.5309293 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/calls-for-answers-from-hyundai-kia-following-recalls-1.5200078 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/car-giants-delay-recall-on-engine-known-to-fail-1.5044866,N/A

44,Dan Ralph,2020-01-23T19:22:24.808Z,CFL to stage league's 1st regular-season game in Halifax,"Brett Lauther will be returning home this summer. The CFL announced Thursday it will hold a regular-season game in Halifax in July. The Toronto Argonauts will host the Saskatchewan Roughriders on July 25 at Huskies Stadium at Saint Mary's University. It will be a homecoming for Lauther, the Riders kicker and Saint Mary's alumnus who hails from Truro. N.S. And with Regina hosting the Grey Cup in November, Lauther has another big reason to look forward to the 2020 season. ""It's going to be surreal,"" Lauther said. ""Getting to come home and be with family and friends who've kind of followed me on this journey and getting to play in my own back yard is going to be something I'll never forget. ""My first (CFL) game was in Moncton and I thought it couldn't get better than that so I kind of feel pretty spoiled right now."" Saskatchewan, under first-year head coach Craig Dickenson, finished atop the West Division with a 13-5 record before losing 20-13 to the eventual Grey Cup-champion Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the division final. Toronto (4-14) missed the CFL playoffs for a second straight year. The Argos have a new head coach in Ryan Dinwiddie, a former quarterbacks coach with the Calgary Stampeders. Lauther, 29, made his CFL debut Sept. 21, 2013 with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats when they dropped a 28-26 decision to the Montreal Alouettes before 15,123 spectators at Moncton Stadium. The CFL staged an exhibition game at Huskies Stadium in 2005 as 11,148 watched Toronto and Hamilton battle to a 16-16 tie. A three-day festival will precede the game in what the CFL says will mark its biggest Touchdown Atlantic ever. ""Our league belongs to Canadians from coast-to-coast-to-coast — and for one fabulous weekend this July, the east coast will be its capital,"" CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. ""We are bringing the football and the fun. ""We're inviting everyone in Atlantic Canada to join the party, and everyone in the rest of the country to come for the game and stay for a vacation."" The CFL said roughly 6,000 temporary seats will be installed at Huskies Stadium to boost capacity for the game to 10,000. The previous four Touchdown Atlantic games were held in Moncton, N.B. Last year, Montreal defeated Toronto 28-22 before 10,126 spectators at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium. ""We've got that loyal fanbase that just loves it and giving up that game is tough for them, especially doing it two years in a row,"" said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. ""But we've all been asked to have that greater vision. ""One of the most important pieces of the puzzle when you look at our growth and where we're going is a team in Atlantic Canada. To me, truly uniting us from coast to coast is a significant sacrifice for our season-ticket holder but it's a small sacrifice as we look at the vision of the league and where we're trying to go."" Schooners Sports and Entertainment (SSE), a group trying to secure a CFL expansion franchise for Halifax, is again sponsoring the game. It did so also last year. ""The game here in 2005 had over 10,000 fans and I think having a regular-season game is super exciting,"" said Bruce Bowser, a founder and owner of SSE. ""We've been promoting Saskatchewan as a sort of a role model for what football in Atlantic Canada could look like with the fans, fanbase and enthusiasm they have around the team. ""Atlantic Canadians seeing Roughriders fans and Riderville here is going to really be inspiring."" Last month, Halifax Regional Municipality voted in favour of providing a one-time $20-million contribution to a proposed CFL-friendly stadium so long as it was located at a site other than Shannon Park. SSE had settled on a six- to eight-hectare site at Shannon Park, a surplus military site in north-end Dartmouth, for $110-million stadium. But a report suggested the site lacks transportation options to get spectators to and from the venue and would need millions of dollars in infrastructure investment. Ambrosie has remained bullish on Halifax becoming the league's 10th franchise. But he has stated repeatedly it's contingent on a suitable stadium being built in the largest city in Atlantic Canada. ""It's a slow process, a lot slower than what I'm used to as an entrepreneur,"" Bowser said. ""We're now out looking at other sites, we're working very closely with the league and some of the teams to bring in their areas of expertise in buildings and team operations and management so we put the right plans together."" Tickets will go on sale at the end of next month. Although prices weren't announced, Ambrosie stressed the game will be affordable with an average ticket price of approximately $50. For Lauther, a 10th team in the CFL would only reinforce what he's continually told people across the league about the Maritimes. ""I'd like showing off where I'm from,"" he said. ""I always try to tell my teammates coaches and everyone else, how awesome it is out here and what it's like. ""No one really has a chance to come out . . . but for me to be able to come back and at least play a couple games each year where friends and family could come see would be so special.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/cfl-to-stage-league-s-1st-regular-season-game-in-halifax-1.5436219,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/atlantic-schooners-cfl-franchise-halifax-hfx-wanderers-fc-1.5262867 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/grey-cup-rescued-kenora-hotel-fire-1.5432185,N/A

The 18-year-old, who cannot be identified under a court-ordered publication ban, appeared at the John Sopinka Courthouse in Hamilton on Friday morning for a bail hearing. The Crown withdrew the murder count. He's now charged with assault with a weapon, administering a noxious substance and unauthorized possession of a weapon. Outside of court, the 18-year-old embraced more than a dozen family members and supporters, who filled three benches in the courtroom during the hearing. ""He's spending time with his family now,"" defence lawyer Jordana Goldlist said after her client was released from custody. ""He's been improperly in custody for two months, shuffled between three different institutions. He spent a significant amount of time in segregation, so right now he's just looking forward to going home with his family as he should be."" She said the Crown had to withdraw the murder charge, because ""there was no reasonable prospect of conviction."" The 18-year-old was released to two sureties — one of whom will have to pay $20,000 if he doesn't comply with conditions and the other who will have to pay $5,000. His conditions include not being within 100 metres of Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School or the Pat Quinn Arena, observing a curfew between 10 p.m. ET and 6:30 a.m. ET and not having contact with a list of 63 people or anyone with a criminal record. He also cannot possess any weapons. The 18-year-old and his 14-year-old brother, who can't be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, were initially both charged with murder in the Oct. 7 stabbing of Devan, 14, outside Winston Churchill Secondary School. CBC News previously spoke with witnesses who said that bear spray had been used on a crowd of people standing in front of the arena, causing them to scatter right before the stabbing, which happened behind the school. Police allege the 14-year-old is the person who stabbed Devan, so he's still charged with first-degree murder. Devan died in the arms of his mother, Shari-Anne Selvey. Selvey was briefly spotted outside court Friday but appeared upset and did not speak with reporters. Devan's death kickstarted a community conversation about bullying and led to the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board setting up a panel to examine its anti-bullying practices. Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce also pointed to what happened to Devan as one of the driving factors behind the changes the provincial government introduced last month to tackle bullying.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/slevey-stabbing-charges-downgraded-1.5394357,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/devan-selvey-stabbing-1.5332475 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/school-violence-marketplace-1.5224865 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/student-violence-data-reporting-1.5331967 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/marketplace-school-violence-sexual-violence-1.5329520 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/bracci-selvey-stabbing-court-accused-1.5328849,N/A

""It's no secret in the last campaign we had some financial pressures,"" NDP National Director Anne McGrath said. ""We didn't have the money that we needed to run the campaign that we wanted to run."" McGrath said the party borrowed $10 million and spent $11 million during the 2019 campaign. The party has a $7 million balance remaining, she said. ""We want to go into the next campaign with our campaign debt retired and having raised enough money to run a competitive campaign,"" McGrath said. ""And to go toe to toe with the other candidates."" Huffington Post reported in January that the NDP national council voted in December to put off its national convention until 2021. McGrath said Wednesday the party didn't want to incur more debt by hosting a costly event; the NDP heavily subsidizes convention attendee registration and travel, unlike other parties. Suspending the convention until 2021 delays a membership vote on Singh's leadership planned for the convention — one Singh said Wednesday he welcomes. ""Why I am confident of where I stand is because we ran a campaign that put people first,"" Singh told reporters. ""And we saw a lot of support from the membership and a lot of support from Canadians."" McGrath said she regrets the delay, saying a convention would be an ""awesome"" way ""to build on the momentum of the campaign.""

47,Anonymous,2020-01-21T17:12:47.018Z,Trucker recounts finding frigid Yukon travellers burning vehicle to stay warm,"Yves Lafond was about half an hour up the road from Carmacks, Yukon, last Monday morning when he spotted it. ""I came out of that curve, and gee, it was a vehicle on fire,"" he recalled. ""You know, you look twice — what do I see? Yeah, it is a vehicle on fire!"" The long-distance truck driver from Whitehorse was the first to find them — three men whose pickup truck went off the road the night before, leaving them stranded in –50 C weather. They had set it on fire to keep from freezing to death. As he approached, Lafond only saw the flaming wreck. ""If there's no vehicle around, like another vehicle around, that means nobody came to help. Where is the driver? Or the people? And I was kind of freaking out a bit,"" Lafond said. Then he spotted them, on the other side of the flames. ""They started waving their hands ... 'OK, alive,' I thought."" The three were alive, but in deep distress. By the time Lafond rolled up, they had been waiting for hours and were dangerously chilled. They scrambled to get into Lafond's warm truck, but it was a struggle.  ""They were moving like robots, really."" Lafond said. By that time, another truck had pulled up behind Lafond and took one of the three stranded travellers in. Then they left the burning wreck behind and headed up the road to Pelly Crossing. Lafond offered them some fresh coffee, but one of the men immediately spilled his cup because his hands were too cold to hold it. As they drove, Lafond heard more about their ordeal.  ""They were telling me some parts, and my foot was going down on that fuel pedal, instinctively. I thought, man, I have to get those guys in the heat, fast."" The men told him they had tried to get wood for a fire, but there was too much snow in the bush. One of them had also started out walking to get help, but soon decided that was a bad idea. Early the next morning, they told Lafond, they were in serious trouble. No cars had passed. One of the men said he had started to feel warm and unzipped his coat — a sign that confusion was setting in. ""So he told the two other guys, 'This is it, we're in the life-and-death scenario right now, so we have to do something fast, because in five minutes, well, we won't be able to take any decision,'"" Lafond said. ""They had a quick meeting and finally the guy who owned the truck agreed, and they set it on fire."" Lafond thinks they did the right thing. He says it's easy for other people to judge, but they weren't there. ""You're in the heat of your house, you think about all the possibility, what you could have done, and this and that, and it's easy to think — it's like the 'hockey pro' at the tavern,"" he said. RCMP said last week that two of the people were being treated for injuries due to exposure to the cold, but there's no word on their condition. Lafond says stopping to help was a no-brainer for him. Working as a truck driver in the North means you don't take life for granted, he says. ""We've got to help each other on the road up here.

49,Don Pittis,2020-01-23T15:35:02.431Z,Millionaires at the World Economic Forum are demanding higher taxes: Don Pittis,"A group of rich people from the United States want governments to raise their taxes. Yesterday, Patriotic Millionaires, the exclusive U.S. club that also includes billionaires, released a letter at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, demanding that the global rich add their names to a new plan to make the world a better place through global tax reform.  If you own a house in Vancouver or Toronto and are considering signing on — you may not be rich enough. Membership requires a minimum annual income of a million U.S. dollars or assets of five million.  Tax evasion has reached epidemic proportions &amp; contributed to extreme inequality.<br><br>At one of the most obnoxious displays of privilege that is found on the world stage, we're proud to release 'Millionaires Against Pitchforks'<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/WEF20?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#WEF20</a><a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaxTheRich?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TaxTheRich</a><a href=""https://t.co/1rEj0530OS"">https://t.co/1rEj0530OS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/l97DGbQhJ5"">pic.twitter.com/l97DGbQhJ5</a> The Davos letter addressed to ""Our Fellow Millionaires and Billionaires Across the Globe,"" appears to be just the latest move to draw media attention to the idea that at least some of the world's richest people think the growing gap between rich and poor is a problem. The PR move, however, has not garnered much coverage in the world's billionaire-owned media. Certainly, governments worried about lost tax revenue have repeatedly struggled to devise global plans to prevent corporations and wealthy individuals from hiding their money offshore — with limited success.  ""Extreme, destabilizing inequality is growing across the globe,"" says the letter released in Davos. ""Despite vocal protests to the contrary, most reasonable people understand that philanthropy has always been, and always will be, an inadequate substitute for government investment."" Like Bregman, signatories to the new letter say extreme inequality is driving the world toward a crisis point. In fact, they warn the rich of a potential uprising by the poorer classes. The threat of revolution, they warn, creates a tradeoff between ""those who prefer taxes and those who prefer pitchforks."" As the shortage of signatures on the document may show, if a popular uprising to overthrow the rich is brewing, elites believe they can handle  it. All around the world, including in Canada, Britain and the United States, political parties that favour tax cuts and leaving tax havens alone get the vast majority of financial support from donors. Rather than sign documents to raise their taxes, even the moderately rich often vote with their wallets to make sure taxes stay low. Those donations, often used for campaign advertising, represent money well spent. In the United States, the populist Trump garners support from many poor voters who believe they are opposing government elites; many of the less well off seem willing to vote against their own best interests. In the U.S., lower middle class and poor Trump supporters effectively voted against their own medical coverage. Opponents of pro-tax campaigns often suggest that those who want to pay higher taxes should do so, but of course that would just make the shirkers richer in relative terms. Yesterday's letter is unlikely to be more successful than previous campaigns, including a 2019 effort by the self-described Patriotic Millionaires to persuade government to raise taxes on the rich in New York. At that time, Patriotic Millionaire member Abagail Disney, heir to part of the Disney fortune and a well known advocate of progressive causes, was backing the tax increase.  ""New York will always be New York,"" she said. ""There's no other place like it, and millionaires are concentrated here because of that."" Polls of people across the global wealth spectrum, including U.S. viewers of Fox Television, have shown a majority would like to see higher taxes on the rich. Many of the world's richest people, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and financier Warren Buffet, have complained that the tax system is unfair. But until people are willing to elect governments that promise to raise taxes, changes are unlikely. Despite a widening gap between the richest and everyone else, there are few signs of people sharpening their pitchforks.  Follow Don on Twitter @don_pittis",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-poloz-1.5436058,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5436112/patriotic-millionaires-urge-the-rich-to-pay-higher-and-fairer-taxes-1.5436119 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fighting-the-corporate-tax-tricks-that-lead-to-inequality-1.2666148 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/business-media-fake-news-rutger-bregman-1.5027881 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.4769851/ontario-pc-voter-worried-about-family-s-future-without-basic-income-pilot-1.4769853 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inheritance-tax-canada-1.4771304 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/inversions-panama-revenue-quandary-1.3521358 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/paradise-papers-rent-capitalism-tax-havens-1.4389079,N/A
50,Inayat Singh,2020-01-23T23:08:46.165Z,Alberta's looming multibillion-dollar orphan wells problem prompts auditor general probe,"Alberta's energy minister is faulting the previous government for allowing the number of oil and gas wells left behind by bankrupt companies — known as orphan wells — to grow to the point where the province's auditor general is now examining how the problem got so big. ""Considering the previous NDP government took no action on the issue, it is unfortunate that the auditor general now has to intervene,"" Sonya Savage said in an email Thursday.  The comments from the United Conservative Party minister came after CBC News reported on the audit earlier on Thursday.  There are currently 3,406 orphan wells scattered around the province, usually on the properties of rural landowners, where they lie untended. There are another 94,000 inactive wells in the province, with the worry that many of these may become orphaned as their owners struggle — and taxpayers could be left with the bill. The auditor general's office will look at whether the province is doing enough to prevent wells from becoming orphaned in the first place, and whether it is prepared for more to be added to the list due to ongoing pressure on Alberta's energy economy. ""We will be focusing on both whether the government — and specifically the Alberta Energy Regulator — has the systems and processes to assess whether orphan oil and gas sites are being managed and reclaimed efficiently and economically in the best interests of Albertans,"" said Val Mellesmoen, spokesperson for the Office of the Auditor General of Alberta.  Meanwhile, the government is also reviewing its own processes to deal with orphan wells. Savage says the government will be proposing a suite of new regulations ""covering the entire lifecycle of wells in the first quarter of the year."" The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), an arm's-length agency of the provincial government that oversees the energy industry and its activities, has a liability management system that is supposed to make sure companies that are permitted to drill have a healthy enough bottom line to pay for cleanup later on. If a company's estimated assets fall below the cost of its environmental liabilities, the AER can collect and hold what's effectively a security deposit to make sure there's money on hand for cleanup if the company later walks away from the well. But the regulator has been using a formula based on out-of-date commodity prices that has inflated the assets of many companies. As a result, companies were not asked to put down large enough security deposits for future cleanup. The province's own estimate of the eventual cleanup bill for every oil and gas well in Alberta is $30 billion, while the AER only holds $227 million in financial security. ""The promise of this production was that companies would clean up their mess,"" said Nikki Way, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, a clean energy think-tank based in Calgary.  ""I'm disappointed that we're at the point where the 'polluter pays' principle is not being upheld and we're considering cleaning up a bill that was always supposed to be accounted for."" Alberta has asked the federal government to help pay for cleaning up orphan wells. In a November 2019 letter sent by Alberta Finance Minister Travis Toews to Bill Morneau, his federal counterpart, the province asked Ottawa for funding and tax instruments to encourage investment in well reclamation. ""This system is just not sustainable,"" said Lucija Muehlenbachs, an economist at the University of Calgary who specializes in the energy industry. ""It's not functioning, so it will have to be completely thrown out the window. But it's many years too late."" The AER uses a liability management rating, or LMR, to determine whether a company has enough money to clean up its wells down the line. If the company's estimated assets — calculated based on the amount of resources in its wells — are less than the estimated cost of cleaning up the wells, the company has to pay a security deposit. But the AER has been using commodity prices from 2008-2010, back when oil prices were much higher, to estimate the value of assets. Even though the regulator assesses these assets every month, because of its use of old commodity prices, many companies that should be putting up security deposits have not had to.  And simply adjusting the calculation now to account for current prices isn't an easy fix, according to the AER, because it could force struggling companies into bankruptcy. ""In many cases, this would have negative consequences for those already facing financial difficulties, and increases the risk that end-of-life obligations would not be addressed,"" AER spokesperson Shawn Roth said in an email. Meanwhile, landowners who agreed to lease their land to oil companies so they could drill wells were promised the companies would clean up after the wells were done producing and restore the surface of the land to its original state. Instead, many are left with inactive wells that nobody is monitoring, let alone cleaning up and closing. Dwight Popowich has an oil well on his property near Two Hills, Alta., about 100 kilometres east of Edmonton, that was drilled in 2008. It stopped producing in 2012, and its owner, Sequoia Resources Corp., stopped operating in March 2018. No remediation work has been done on the well. Popowich is waiting for the well to be transferred to the Orphan Well Association, which is an industry- and government-supported group that is trying to manage orphan wells. But, in the meantime, no one is monitoring the well on his property. ""We don't know if it's safe. We don't know if it's leaking. Nobody's showing up to even take a look at it,"" Popowich said. Sequoia held licences for 2,300 wells when it ceased operations in 2018. For Popowich, the well has become a financial headache in addition to an environmental problem. He wanted to subdivide his land and sell off half of it to help pay for his retirement. But the well is in the way. ""Nobody wants to buy the land if they have to deal with a well that's in limbo,"" he said. Across the border in North Dakota, as oil prices declined, the state saw a growing number of inactive wells, but it has not experienced the same problem with orphan wells as Alberta. North Dakota has strict timelines in place to deal with inactive wells. If a well stops producing for as little as three months, it's immediately flagged. The state also collects a bond from companies upfront — $50,000 US if the company is drilling one well — and can use that money to pay for plugging and remediating wells.  North Dakota, which is the second largest crude oil producer in the U.S. after Texas, has only 1,683 inactive wells — and not one of them is an orphan. The head of North Dakota's regulator says a combination of a bond system and plugging and reclamation fund is essential for preventing orphan wells. ""You've got to start somewhere,"" said Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Alberta, on the other hand, does not have any timeline for how long a company can leave a well inactive. This has raised concerns that many of the approximately 94,000 inactive wells in Alberta may become orphaned before their owners clean them up.  Alberta's industry knows the liability management system needs to change, and the AER and provincial government have said they are reviewing the program. The AER says a new system would gather more company-specific information to gain a more holistic view of whether a company can meet its environmental obligations.  But the government and regulator have to tread lightly on an industry that's struggling. ""We want to see progress on the file, but you have to manage the unintended consequences,"" said Brad Herald, vice-president of Western Canada operations for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. ""You don't want to create more defaults. There are a lot of companies struggling. We are empathetic to that."" Nikki Way of the Pembina Institute says concerns over low oil prices should not stop the government from taking action now. New wells can be treated differently, with more financial security collected prior to drilling. She points out that while the government has to balance the profitability of the industry with any new regulations, the liability problem will continue to grow if nothing is done. ""The pressures aren't going away any time soon,"" she said. ""So the scope of the problem needs to be front and centre and transparent.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-orphan-wells-liability-audit-review-1.5433603,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-redwater-investment-consequences-1.5359734 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/crown-drilling-rights-alberta-bc-saskatchewan-oil-1.5371524 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-orphan-wells-1.5427559 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unpaid-taxes-oil-industry-rural-municipalities-1.5433435,N/A
51,Michael Gorman,2019-12-18T10:00:00.750Z,N.S. won't protect land with 'globally rare' ecosystem that company eyes for golf resort,"In the tiny community of Little Harbour on Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore sits 285 hectares of coastal Crown land known as Owls Head provincial park. The name is misleading: it's not actually a provincial park and there are no obvious markings or trails to enter the coastal barrens and wetlands. But the headland, which has been managed as a park reserve, is notable for some of its characteristics. According to the province, it's one of nine sites in Nova Scotia with a ""globally rare"" ecosystem and home to several endangered species. For six years, Owls Head has been one of the provincial properties awaiting legal protection. But that changed last March when, after several years of lobbying by and discussions with a private developer who wants to acquire the land as part of a plan to build as many as three golf courses, the Treasury Board quietly removed the designation, according to records CBC News received in response to an access-to-information request. This sets up the latest situation in Nova Scotia where conservation and environmental protection efforts appear poised to collide with economic development interests as the developer hopes to bring the kind of tourist attraction and job opportunities to the Eastern Shore that Inverness is realizing from the Cabot Links and Cabot Cliffs golf courses. The decision to de-list Owls Head was made using a minute letter, which is protected by cabinet confidentiality and thus not available for the public to see. Government documents, however, make clear a plan which, until now, has been unknown to the public. Lighthouse Links Development Company, which is owned by American couple Beckwith Gilbert and his wife, Kitty, is behind the proposal. They already own 138 hectares of land next to the Owls Head property. Gilbert has a background in merchant banking and has been heavily involved in medical research. He was not available for an interview, but in an emailed statement he said the couple fulfilled ""a dream to own and preserve an unspoiled, natural ocean beach"" when they started buying land in Little Harbour 16 years ago. As he and his wife got to know the community, Gilbert said ""it became quickly apparent that additional employment opportunities in the area were needed to encourage people to move to the Eastern Shore, rather than move away."" The idea for one golf course blossomed into two or three after talking to architects, he said. ""They emphasized that multiple adjacent courses were necessary to achieve profitable operations. Since we didn't have enough land for more than one course, we approached the province and proposed acquiring their unused adjacent land."" Gilbert's vision, according to a letter sent on his behalf to then-natural resources minister Lloyd Hines's executive assistant in 2016, which CBC obtained, is for something similar to the Cabot resort or Bandon Dunes golf resort in Oregon. Chris Miller, a conservation biologist and executive director of the Nova Scotia branch of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, called the proposal ""deeply concerning."" Miller said the land is important because of how much there is, allowing for more extensive ecosystems than what is typically found along the coast and because so little of the province's coast is publicly owned and protected. ""It's a place where conservation values and nature need to come first and human and economic development is only within the context of protecting those values,"" he said. Like Miller, Nova Scotia Nature Trust executive director Bonnie Sutherland said she had no idea about the change in designation, which still has not been updated on the provincial website. Sutherland's organization was intending to include Owls Head as part of its 100 Wild Islands project, which aims to protect the archipelago off the Eastern Shore. About 85 per cent of that work is complete. ""We're very surprised and disappointed,"" she said. ""To lose that habitat is very significant."" Sutherland pointed to the endangered species known to live and, in some cases, nest on the land, including piping plovers and barn swallows. Other species of ""conservation concern"" known to be there, according to government documents, include the ruby-crowned kinglet and common eider. There are ""unique boreal and temperate plants and lichens"" and Owls Head is one of nine sites in the province with ""the globally rare coastal broom crowberry heathland ecosystem,"" said the documents. But Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin said the government was comfortable removing the designation because the land isn't a priority for legal protection. By removing the designation, the government can now have the land appraised and begin more formal negotiations for a potential sale, said Rankin. The final decision was made by weighing the option to protect with the potential for economic development in a rural area, he said. ""There isn't high biodiversity value when you compare [it] to other pieces of land that we've advanced [for legal protection],"" said Rankin. He said the decision would not affect the government's ability to reach its goal of legal protection of 13 per cent of all Nova Scotia land. The golf project has had the support of Central Nova MP Sean Fraser and Eastern Shore MLA Kevin Murphy. In August 2018, the company hired former provincial Liberal cabinet minister Michel Samson to lobby on its behalf. Owls Head isn't the only Crown land Lighthouse Links wants to acquire. The province is in negotiations with the federal government on behalf of the company to buy about 17 hectares of surplus Crown land next to Owls Head that's home to an automated light beacon and helipad. Ottawa would keep 0.09 hectares, including the helipad and light, and sell the rest to the province for $167,500. Originally the land was offered for $1, but that required the province to use it for a public purpose. Had the province not engaged Ottawa on the offer, the land would have gone to public sale. An order in council approving that negotiation was passed in August (unlike minute letters, orders in council are posted online). Rankin said he sees the company's proposal as a good opportunity and said any kind of development would still have to respect the applicable environmental regulations. ""I see golf courses coexisting with opportunities for protecting the environment,"" he said. Miller, who said such a development would irreparably alter Owls Head, disagrees. There remain about 90 properties with pending protected status from the Parks and Protected Areas Plan of 2013 and Miller has repeatedly called on the province to confer legal protection to all of them, a move that would result in about 14 per cent of Nova Scotia's land being protected. ""The government has been dragging its feet and this is exactly the problem,"" he said. ""The longer it goes before the legal designation is applied, the more and more likely that it's going to get chipped away and that one site here will get tossed [and] another site will get tossed. ""Some economic opportunity of this or that will come along and before you know it the entire plan is undermined."" A spokesperson for the Lands and Forestry Department said officials are unaware of any other negotiations or requests from private parties for land on the Parks and Protected Areas list that hasn't been approved yet for protection.

52,Logan Perley,2020-01-23T11:54:54.693Z,"Wolastoqi woman releases first children's book, plans for Indigenous-language versions","It took Gail Francis of Negotkuk (Tobique First Nation) years to turn an idea into her first children's book. But all that work comes to fruition when she releases Moonbeam on Monday. Moonbeam is a culturally based children's book about how a pre-contact Indigenous family names their child. The character Moonbeam is told the story of her naming while the family waits for another newborn baby in the village to be named. Francis is a former educator and now an autism resource consultant. She wrote the story of Moonbeam more than 15 years ago.  But bringing the book to life wasn't without its hurdles. Francis teamed up with her niece, Tara Audibert, an animator and filmmaker, who provided the illustrations. But the publishers they approached had a different idea.  ""One of the barriers for my aunt publishing this with a formal publishing house was that they all were like 'We're going to provide you with an illustrator, you can't bring your illustrator,'"" Audibert said.  ""Tara had captured the essence of Moonbeam, I really didn't want another illustrator,"" Francis added. Audibert didn't understand why so many publishers would walk away from a story by an Indigenous woman — illustrated by an Indigenous woman. She said there are probably only a handful in the field in the country. The aunt-niece duo decided to move in another direction with Moonbeam. ""She put it into publishers and then got some rejections,"" Audibert said. ""Then I said that I've self-published my own works and we could just do this."" And that's what they did.  Audibert created a logo and helped her aunt start her own publishing company. Francis Books was born with the intent to release Moonbeam.  Francis found one of the benefits of self-publishing is that she has the power to have the book translated into the two Indigenous languages of New Brunswick: Wolastoqey and Mi'kmaq. ""When I started school I didn't know in English, I had to learn English,"" Francis said. ""When I see the kids coming into school now it's the opposite. They're speaking English and trying to learn their language in school, so it's been a flip in terms of when I started my education."" Francis thinks it is important to recognize the Indigenous languages of each region. New Brunswick being the only officially bilingual province, she thinks that Mi'kmaq and Wolastoqey should be added to the official languages as well. Moonbeam already has Wolastoqey words sprinkled throughout the book, including terms of endearment such as ""t'us"" (daughter). But Francis said a full translation could be used as a teaching tool for a language at risk. ""If we could have the language out there available to them, so that there's resources out there that they could utilize"" Francis added. Francis said she has already had a few organizations and schools purchase several copies of Moonbeam to be used in their literacy programs or classrooms. Francis has plans to release a sequel to Moonbeam and wants the character to become the Wabanaki version of Franklin, the popular children's book series about a turtle. She hopes that she and Audibert can animate the story in the future, as well. Francis and Audibert will be having a book launch event for Moonbeam on Jan. 27 at the ARM Book Nook in Miramichi from 1:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/aunt-and-niece-release-first-self-published-childrens-book-1.5436650,[],N/A

Greg adamantly denies any involvement with her disappearance despite incriminating statements he made during a controversial undercover police operation. Now investigative duo Alicia Bridges and Victoria Dinh journey to Western Canada to explore the credibility of the Mr. Big sting operation that put Greg behind bars. You'll also hear how the absence of a body could affect the upcoming trial and how Sheree's family is grappling with the fourth anniversary of her disappearance. On the fourth anniversary of Sheree Fertuck's disappearance The Pit has released two new episodes. You can stream those here or download where ever you get your podcasts. Get episode 6 Get episode 7 It's winter in Saskatchewan and Sheree Fertuck is hard at work hauling gravel in her semi-truck. She has lunch with her mom but doesn't come back for supper. The next day, her semi is found abandoned in a gravel pit. Sheree is nowhere to be seen. The search for Sheree Fertuck is underway. Police are digging, questioning, and looking for suspects. Suspicions about what might have happened to Sheree begin to emerge. A neighbour says he remembers hearing a loud noise. Sheree gets married. Soon, cracks in their relationship begin to form. Court documents reveal troubles in Sheree's private life. There's a death threat, weapons, and the police get involved. Police announce a major breakthrough in Sheree's case. They've put someone behind bars. A former roommate of the suspect remembers a troubling conversation about Sheree, and the family of the accused protest his innocence. A letter to the Saskatoon jail nets our reporters a meeting with the suspect. We hear from him for the first time. Police have Sheree's alleged killer behind bars, but the suspect says he was scared into a confession. Our reporters investigate the controversial police technique that led to his arrest. Meanwhile, people close to Sheree break their silence. A close relative thinks Sheree was dumped somewhere near the gravel pit. Police and volunteers searched the area when she disappeared, and again after the arrest. Could the searchers have overlooked her remains? And how does that affect the police case when there's no body? Take a look around this gravel pit — the last known whereabouts of Sheree Fertuck — in this 360° video experience. In 2015, Saskatchewan police found Sheree Fertuck's abandoned truck at a small-town gravel pit. She's never been found but police have established a theory of murder. CBC Saskatoon has been working to uncover the story of Sheree Fertuck. Fertuck was last seen driving away from her family farm in a gravel truck near Kenaston, Sask., 80 kilometres south of Saskatoon, on Dec. 7, 2015. While the truck was found near the pit, Sheree was nowhere to be found. Police search the area tirelessly but ultimately believe 51-year-old Sheree Fertuck is dead. Recently her estranged husband, Greg Fertuck was charged with 1st-degree murder, causing indignity to a body. The investigative duo, Victoria Dinh and Alicia Bridges have spent the last year searching for new information about Sheree Fertuck's disappearance. They've travelled around rural Saskatchewan to interview people who might have clues about what happened to her in December 2015.

54,Michelle Ghoussoub,2020-01-23T16:22:49.113Z,"Masks are flying off shelves in B.C., but using them has 'no proven benefit' against coronavirus ","Shortly after news broke that a case of coronavirus had been confirmed in Washington state, John Elzinga, who manages an industrial supply store in Langley, B.C., noticed that boxes of his N95 face masks were suddenly flying off the shelves. ""Just [Wednesday] morning there was a big rush, out of nowhere. They were all in looking for the same thing,"" he said. ""It was unusual. You get the feeling right away that there was something else going on."" The standard-issue industrial dust masks, normally used for construction and industrial manufacturing, weren't being purchased by workers in steel-toed boots and hard hats — his usual clientele — but by ""regular off-the-street families,"" he said. One person came in and bought 30 boxes all at once. They were soon sold out. ""The good news is they're on sale. This isn't a price-gouging scenario,"" he said with a laugh, adding that some customers specifically asked if the masks would protect from coronavirus. But Danuta Skowronski, with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said the agency is not recommending that people use the masks to protect themselves — and would be unlikely to ever issue such a directive. ""That is a huge cost with no proven benefit. It could run the risk of draining our supply of masks for the real indications that we have in the health-care system, and even from an environmental perspective, it's ill-advised,"" she said. Skowronski said the one time she would advise the use of a face mask would be for someone who has symptoms and who is entering a health-care facility for treatment. Elzinga said he's previously noticed a run on face masks at his store, back in 2003 during the SARS outbreak. At the time, the Public Health Agency of Canada asked a panel of medical experts for guidance on how flu is transmitted and how best to protect against infection, including the efficiency of face masks. The report found that masks can offer protection, but there's no evidence inexpensive masks can protect against flu virus particles small enough to be inhaled into the lower respiratory tract or the lungs.  It did find that the N95 masks — like those sold at Elzinga's store — are the most likely to be efficient because they filter particles smaller than one micron in size and provide a tight facial seal. On Wednesday, British Columbia's health minister and provincial health officer said officials are closely monitoring the international outbreak, which can cause pneumonia, fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. It has killed 17 people. China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has said the outbreak likely resulted from human exposure to wild animals being sold illegally at a food market in Wuhan and that the virus is mutating.  The BCCDC has developed a diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, and public health teams have implemented screening for early detection of infections for travellers arriving in airports. Skowronski said the risk to people in B.C. remains low — and for people travelling in China, the best protection is to avoid contact with animal markets and wash your hands regularly. ""I don't want people to misinterpret the intense interest in this virus by public health as an indication that this is a serious threat to British Columbians today,"" she said. ""Rather, the reason that public health is so interested is that we are in an all-out effort to try to contain this virus and stamp it out, and that requires huge effort by public health at all levels of our health-care system,"" she said. Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coronavirus-masks-1.5437209,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-coronavirus-screening-test-airports-1.5436045 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5435286,N/A

As of Wednesday, there have been 544 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 17 deaths. At least one confirmed case has been reported in the U.S. Symptoms of coronaviruses, which are a large family of viruses, cause a range of illnesses from the common cold to more severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). ""We need to watch this carefully, [but] I think Canadians, in general, don't need to be overly concerned about this,"" Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer, said in an interview with CBC Nova Scotia News at 6 on Wednesday.

Forensics and property director Kathryn Moyse Rodgers was tasked with probing homicide cases from January 2016 to the present. Moyse Rodgers is a forensic scientist and DNA expert who joined the RNC last year. The police were asked to review the cases in October. The investigation was sparked after DNA cross-contamination was discovered by the RCMP forensics lab. When DNA from one homicide case was sent for testing, it turned up as a match to a second case. The specifics of those two cases have not been disclosed.  Steve Bragg was supposed to stand trial for first-degree murder in January, but because of cross-contamination in the unrelated cases, it was delayed indefinitely. Bragg is accused of killing Victoria Head, 36, and dumping her body near O'Brien Farm, off Mount Scio Road in St. John's. The Crown prosecutors in the case filed a last-minute application to delay the trial, citing the police investigation into the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.. The prosecutors received a report on Dec. 31, 2019, that ""indicates an issue with cross-contamination of DNA samples at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in two unrelated cases."" The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner's role is to report, investigate and record deaths. The chief medical examiner is responsible for determining the cause and manner of death in homicide cases, and is often called on to testify as an expert witness. Dr. Nash Denic is Newfoundland and Labrador's chief medical examiner, but Dr. Simon Avis was in charge for the majority of the cases that were under review.  Bragg's case has no direct link to the cross-contamination. Const. James Cadigan, RNC media relations officer, said the force is ""not concerned"" that its cases will fall apart because of DNA issues.  In an interview last week, Justice Minister Andrew Parsons also said the blunder would not affect ongoing prosecutions.  Cadigan said the RNC does not expect the Bragg case to be delayed much longer.  However, Crown prosecutor Lisa Stead said no timeline has been determined yet. ""While the incident of cross-contamination involved a completely separate case, the Crown and defence are still assessing any ramifications in the the Bragg matter,"" Stead said. ""We intend to schedule the trial as soon as possible, but not before the Crown and defence are prepared to proceed.""

But those who run public transit in the city are less certain about the status of Metrobus. ""We're very hopeful we'll be able to get around and get students back to their desks on Monday,"" said Terry Hall, who is in charge of student transportation with the province's English school district. Some 26,000 students on the northeast Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland and Labrador have been home for a week, their schools closed following a record-breaking blizzard and a state of emergency that has dragged on for days. More than 50 city buses have been parked for a week in the Metrobus depot, with a street assessment planned for Friday to determine whether it's safe to resume even limited public transit service. ""A lot of work needs to be done on some of the secondary streets for us to be able to be able to consider going back on the road,"" Metrobus general manager Judy Powell said Thursday morning. A state of emergency has been in place in St. John's since Jan. 17, with restrictions slowly being lifted on businesses and vehicle use as the situation improves and street-clearing continues. But city and school buses pose a special challenge, because they're some 40 feet long, and eight feet wide, which means they require plenty of room to make turns and take up a full lane when moving. As of Thursday, many secondary roads were barely passable, allowing for single-lane traffic only, raising questions about how school and city buses will be able to navigate residential neighbourhoods.  But Hall is confident Monday's target for school resumption is realistic, and that buses will be able to manoeuvre safely and that students and other pedestrians will be able to walk comfortably. He said provincial and municipal snow-clearing crews are working hard make that a reality. ""They're well aware of our requirements in order to get school zones open and get buses moving around."" Meanwhile, Metrobus's Powell expects there will be some detours early on once Metrobus resumes operation and slowly rebuilds a service that transports between 8,000 and 10,000 passengers every weekday. She said resumption of service will present another concern, because more pedestrians will flood the streets at a time when sidewalks are practically non-existent. ""We will be asking drivers to be patient and respectful of pedestrians once we get back on the road,"" she said.

58,"Virginia Smart, Lisa Ellenwood",2019-11-24T09:00:00.590Z,"Pain, agony and 'years of duress': How hockey wives are fighting back over players' chronic brain injuries","Jennifer Belak Liang remembers her car phone ringing as she was picking up her daughters Alex and Andie from school one day in August 2011. It was the agent for her husband, hockey player Wade Belak. On speaker phone, the agent asked her if she had spoken to her husband that day.  She hadn't. It was the second phone call she received asking that question and it filled her with dread.  ""Wade is really hurt,"" the agent said. ""It was awful. I was called by multiple friends … they knew before I knew. But they didn't know what to say,"" Belak Liang said of the day she lost her husband to suicide. Belak's suicide was the third death in a cluster of tragic and sudden deaths of NHL enforcers, including Derek Boogaard, 28, and Rick Rypien, 27. All had been tasked with fighting on ice and all suffered multiple hits to the head. There have been other deaths of players since, including Steve Montador and Todd Ewen. Now, the wives of some of the retired hockey enforcers are in their own fight, taking on the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman. They want the league to acknowledge there's a link between fights and head injuries on the ice and long-term effects like degenerative brain disease. They also want more support for families struggling with symptoms of traumatic brain injury.  ""My husband had CTE. He was showing signs of CTE. He took his own life,"" said Belak Liang. ""It's going to be many more...  It's [an] injustice to everyone else out there, I think, for them not to admit that this can happen.""  Wade Belak had recently retired from his 14-year career with the National Hockey League and was in Toronto in the summer of 2011 rehearsing for the show Battle of the Blades — the CBC reality show that pairs hockey players with figure skaters. At approximately 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 31, he ended his life. After the loss of her husband, Jennifer Belak Liang struggled with feelings of isolation and guilt.  ""I was drowning, blaming myself,"" she said in an interview with The Fifth Estate. At the time, she knew little of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease. Her husband had asked that in the event of his death, his brain be tested for the disease. She fulfilled his wish, and he was diagnosed with CTE. Since the loss of her husband, Belak Liang, who has since remarried, tries to offer support to others facing tragic loss of loved ones. As an NHL enforcer who played 14 seasons in the NHL, Belak ""knew his role,"" said Belak Liang. ""He didn't love it, but he was fine with it [because] he wanted to stay within the NHL and have his career.  ""He told me: 'I can't stay here unless I fight.' "" Watch Jennifer Belak Liang remember her husband: While many hockey players can make millions during their career, brain trauma and concussions can take a toll, especially for those who played the role of an enforcer — a role now being phased out. It  was during her husband's last years with the Nashville Predators that Belak Liang noticed a shift in his behaviour.   ""It started about five years before he passed. He just got really introverted, really quiet at home. When the kids were screeching or making noises, I could see him not able to handle it, which was not like him."" About eight months before he died, Belak noticed a decline in her husband's memory. He'd use his phone to help remember daily tasks, including taking pictures of groceries he had to buy.   Many experts say concussions can often lead to a cycle of substance abuse, depression, memory loss, even suicide.  Daniel Carcillo, 35, from King City, Ont., has won two Stanley Cups with the Chicago Blackhawks, and was known as Car Bomb for his reckless fighting style on ice. He now battles depression and suicidal thoughts.  Carcillo said his wife, Ela Bulawa, has been burdened. ""But I think that's what marriage and loving somebody is all about, right? Through sickness and in health.""  While he was in his final NHL season with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2015, Carcillo suffered great personal loss: the passing of his grandfather, as well as his best friend and teammate, Steve Montador, who was found to have CTE. Carcillo, who had seven concussions during his NHL career, wonders if he could become another statistic. ""Wade had CTE. Are these reaffirmations that I'm going to have CTE?... ""There's a pretty good chance."" Once retired, players can often feel abandoned and without support. Carcillo said he has felt that way. But he's taken steps to heal: functional neurology therapy, acupuncture, proper nutrition and diet. He speaks publicly, often on social media, about traumatic brain injury and the impact it can have.   ""I'm very, very proud of Daniel, from where he has been, and where he is now,"" Bulawa said. They have started a foundation called Chapter 5, which aims to provide support to retired players and their families, especially players who are suffering post-concussion syndrome, anxiety and depression. ""They put their whole lives into playing hockey and being the best of the best. And once it's over, then what?"" said Bulawa. ""It shouldn't just be,'Oh, that's it, sorry guys. See ya later.' ""   Carcillo and Bulawa have learned to recognize signs of his depression returning, for example sleeping in, impulse control issues, loss of appetite and withdrawal from friends and family. Todd Ewen played hockey in the era when even after getting rocked on the ice, players were sent back out again. Both he and his wife, Kelli, believed he experienced head trauma because he had symptoms: blurry vision, headaches and sleeplessness. After playing 11 seasons in the NHL, Todd Ewen retired in 1997. He became a real estate agent, was a musician, patented several inventions and coached the St. Louis University Billikens. But Ewen was struggling. He became aggressive with Kelli. Depression, memory loss and confusion plagued him. By 2013, he gave up coaching because he couldn't remember plays and was missing practices.   ""We didn't know who we had. One day we had the sad Todd, the mad Todd, the angry Todd. We had no idea what was going on. This man suffered for years like this, our family suffered for years like this,"" his wife said. They wondered if he could have Alzeimher's or Parkinson's disease, but with the loss of Rypien, Boogaard and Belak in 2011, Ewen began to wonder if he could have CTE.  He told Kelli one day that he didn't want to be a burden. At the time, she did not realize the weight of his words. On Sept. 19, 2015, Kelli Ewen found her husband in the basement of their home near St. Louis. He was 49 when he killed himself. The Ewen family was contacted by the Canadian Concussion Centre in Toronto asking to study Todd's brain.   ""I knew something was wrong. And I thought maybe this is the answer. I read the articles about [CTE]. I could just check off the boxes, just one after another. And I thought this has to be it.""  But neuropathologist Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati at the centre told Kelli her husband did not have CTE. She was devastated and desperate for an explanation and said she asked the doctor to retest his brain, but Hazrati declined.  In 2018, a class action lawsuit between more than 300 retired players and the NHL was settled. Players had accused the league of failing to protect them from head injuries or warn them of the risks involved with playing. Ewen's negative CTE results were used as an example in the lawsuit of how media hype could lead a person to kill themselves because of fear of having CTE. Bettman wrote: ""This, sadly, is precisely the type of tragedy that can result when plaintiffs' lawyers and their media consultants jump ahead of the medical community and assert, without reliable scientific support, that there is a causal link between concussions and CTE.""  Kelli Ewen said she was was extremely hurt, and believed they were using her husband for the benefit of the lawsuit.   The NHL announced an $18.9-million US settlement — $22,000 US per player and medical expense coverage up to $75,000 per person. However, there was no acknowledgement of liability for the players' assertions.  Carcillo refused to participate in the settlement.  Kelli Ewen couldn't live with the results from the Canadian Concussion Centre. She arranged to have samples of her husband's brain sent to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist and director of Boston University's CTE Center. Her research, much of which has involved professional athletes, focuses on the long-term effects of all kinds of brain injury, which can include CTE. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed with an autopsy.  While there is no known treatment, the hope is research from Boston University's brain bank will one day allow the detection of the disease in life, ""while there's still a chance to do something about it,"" McKee said. In late 2018, McKee revealed her own conclusions to Kelli Ewen, stating her instincts were correct: her husband did, in fact, have CTE.  ""[Gary Bettman] still stands by the [original] findings, which I find mind-boggling,"" Kelli Ewen said. Kelli Ewen filed a lawsuit against the NHL on April 30, 2019, challenging the league's dismissal of  a link between hits to the head during hockey games and CTE . She wants to bring awareness to concussions and CTE and the suffering families go through when they don't understand the symptoms they're seeing with their husbands.   ""It's not about money, you know? It's about the pain, the agony, the years of duress,"" she said.   ""I feel like it's the NHL's responsibility to stand up and take care of these players that this great game of hockey was built on; these fighters that gave, essentially, their lives for the NHL. And it's time for them to step up and admit and help them get the help they need."" Watch Kelli Ewen talk about her lawsuit: The day after Kelli Ewen's lawsuit was filed, Bettman appeared before a Commons subcommittee in Ottawa regarding sports-related concussions and safety.   Bettman questioned any direct link between multiple hockey concussions and CTE, saying ""in short, I don't believe based on everything I've been told — and if anybody has information to the contrary, we'd be happy to hear it — other than some anecdotal evidence, there has not been that conclusive link."" ""Our players like the way the NHL game is played and understand the implications of playing a physical contact sport at the highest professional level in the world,"" he said.  ""At the end of the day we view ourselves as a family, and our resources are available to the members of our family."" Jennifer Belak Liang, Kelli Ewen and the Carcillo family would disagree.  ""It's crazy to me that they won't admit anything. It's sad,"" Belak Liang said.   ""At least admit it's real,"" said Ewen. ""That would go a long way with a lot of the families."" The Fifth Estate requested an interview with Bettman to address the wives' concerns, but the only response was: ""Thank you for your inquiry. We will not be participating.""   At a sports conference in Toronto last week, The Fifth Estate's Bob McKeown approached Bettman. All he would say was: ""How are you? Nice to see you. I gotta go.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hockey-players-enforcers-brain-injuries-1.5370444,[],N/A
59,Anonymous,2020-01-24T14:59:38.224Z,Microgrids: An idea whose time has come?,"Hello, people! This is our weekly newsletter on all things environmental, where we highlight trends and solutions that are moving us to a more sustainable world. (Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Thursday.) This week: As the global population grows, so does the demand for electricity. But there are challenges, even now. More than a billion people around the world don't have access to power grids. According to the Canada Energy Regulator, 200,000 people in Canada are not connected to the North American electrical grid and natural gas distribution pipeline systems.  We're also seeing natural disasters and major weather events disrupt power supply, causing mass blackouts for days at a time. And when one part of the transmission system breaks down, it can paralyze the whole grid. Enter the microgrid. A concept that's been growing in popularity, it's a power system that can operate independently or work in connection with bigger grids.  A microgrid ""contains everything that it needs to provide power to a community,"" said Lynn Côté, cleantech lead at Export Development Canada. ""You're not building a system for a million people. You're building a system for maybe a thousand people, 500, maybe 250."" Big electrical grids connect buildings to central power sources, such as coal, nuclear and gas plants. When main components stop working, everything can be affected.  A microgrid operates as an island, which can be beneficial during times of crises like storms or outages (or for other reasons). Many are powered by a mix of renewable energy and batteries, with natural gas for backup. Microgrid power isn't necessarily more reliable, but in communities far from a larger power source, microgrids can alleviate complications because the electricity is stored, owned and controlled locally. One of the older examples is a microgrid built more than a decade ago in Sendai, Japan, which is powered by a mix of solar, gas and battery. According to Berkeley Lab, which does research on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy, during blackouts caused by the 2011 tsunami and earthquake, the microgrid in Sendai provided power and heat to the teaching hospital of Tohoku Fukushi University.  ""Widespread power outages cause a lot of social and economic damage and destruction. And the climate crisis is making all of this worse,"" said Jana Ganion, energy director for Blue Lake Rancheria, an Indigenous reserve in California that launched a solar microgrid in 2015. Millions of people in California had their power shut off last fall because of wildfire risk. Meanwhile, the Blue Lake Rancheria microgrid provided electricity to thousands nearby. Setting up a microgrid can be an expensive undertaking, especially in dense urban or suburban areas with existing infrastructure. Consumers typically stick with what works, said Côté, and for the majority of Canadians, that means hydroelectric power (nuclear and coal are the next-biggest power sources). ""It's really hard for certain countries to raise the kind of capital you need [to build a power plant],"" said Côté, who has researched microgrids in remote Canadian communities. She said the ""autonomy"" a microgrid provides ""is really important.""  There are nearly 300 remote communities across Canada, many of which rely on diesel-powered microgrids for electricity generation. Over the last decade, the federal government has worked with regional entities to create greener options.  In August, Gull Bay First Nation, north of Thunder Bay, Ont., co-developed a community microgrid that uses solar, battery storage and automated control technology to help reduce diesel use, according to Ontario Power Generation. It's the first of its kind in Canada. Côté said that in addition to making remote areas more self-sufficient, microgrids could help communities access clean drinking water by providing the power to treat it.  — Isabel Terrell Our story on e-bikes from a couple of weeks back continues to fuel discussion. Some readers doubted the possibility of biking year-round in a country as seasonally variable as Canada. Other readers weren't having it. Colin Lee wrote, ""The fact is that many people bike year-round and have done so for decades in Canadian cities. I have lived in Waterloo, Toronto and Halifax and biked in winter in all three cities. The only way we're going to get more people doing so is by building more and safer infrastructure."" Deborah Baxter: ""Don't tell me that we cannot bike year-round in Canada! It is done in Iceland, and it sure as hell can be done in Canada!"" Baxter describes herself as ""a 62-year-old retired professional woman who chooses to work full-time."" She works within a two-kilometre radius of her home. ""I work late afternoon until almost midnight. And my sole means of transportation has been bicycle, apart from a very occasional cab ride."" She concluded by saying, ""I hope my two years of riding a bike year-round, largely at late night in Maritime Canada, entices many more to do so."" Kelvin Sams: ""I live in Halifax and ... I have been commuting to work on an electric fat bike. An excellent choice for icy snowy conditions. Wearing some ski goggles, a winter helmet and other suitable clothing I have been quite comfortable riding to work and more often find myself over-dressing. I have never before commuted to work by bicycle. For the first time I believe a significant portion of Canadians can commute by e-bike 12 months of the year."" Karla Braun: ""I live in Winnipeg and I'm a year-round cycle commuter."" Finally, this from Judi Varga-Toth: ""It is time to reject the myth that Canada cannot be and never will be a cycling nation. Not only can we be, but we must be. Cycling is a simple solution to many of the world's most complex problems, ranging from chronic disease and obesity prevention to mental health and productivity gains, from lowering GHGs to improving air quality, to reducing congestion and boosting the local economy."" In the face of a growing consensus about the causes and effects of climate change, many of the world's biggest fossil fuel companies (such as Shell and Exxon) have touted their investments in green energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that those promises are not backed up by action. The IEA found that on aggregate, these companies spent less than one per cent on ""low-carbon businesses."" As climate change evolves, it will affect different parts of the world in different ways. (As we've seen from recent events, for example, Australia and Indonesia have been hit by wildfires and floods, respectively.) Extreme weather will lead some people to move elsewhere. This week, the UN's human rights committee ruled it is illegal for governments to send people back to countries that face climate risks. Last week, I examined ways to reduce your home heating use. This week, I'm turning my attention to alternatives to fossil fuel heating. Nearly 70 per cent of the energy used in the residential sector comes from fossil fuels, a 2014 study estimated. Forced air furnaces and hot water or steam boilers with radiators, which most often burn fossil fuels such as natural gas, make up a majority of the primary heating systems in Canada, Statistics Canada reports. Buildings heated with fossil fuels can cut some of their emissions by reducing the need for heating through things like better insulation and reusing ""waste"" heat. If your home is hooked up to a district heating system, where a utility supplies heat directly, you may be able to tap into a variety of greener energy sources.  But if your home relies on its own individual heating system, as most do, what are the alternatives to fossil fuels — and will they work in the colder parts of this country? ""The only fuel that we can truly make 100 per cent carbon neutral is electricity,"" said Fin MacDonald, program manager of the Zero Carbon Building program at the Canada Green Building Council. In provinces with an electrical grid based mostly on hydro, nuclear or other zero-emission energy sources, such as Ontario, Quebec and B.C., replacing a gas-burning furnace with an electrical heating system can nearly eliminate a home's emissions. Baseboard heaters are the most common option in use across Canada. They're powered by electrical resistance heating, just like your toaster and oven. Electric forced air furnaces, electric convection heaters and electric radiant floors also use electrical resistance heating. Baseboard heaters are popular because they're cheap and easy to install, but  electrical resistance heating is generally inefficient, said Brady Faught, green buildings engineer with the City of Vancouver. ""They're just like having a toaster running in your house all day … resulting in high electric bills."" Heat pumps are far more efficient because they simply move heat into your home, rather than generating heat. There are two kinds: Air source heat pumps, which draw heat from the air. (Yes, it can work even when it is very cold outside, just as your freezer can use its heat pump to cool itself to -18 C in a 20 C kitchen.) Ground source heat pumps, which draw heat from the ground and are sometimes referred to as geo-exchange or geothermal heat pumps. (MacDonald said the industry is trying to move away from calling it geothermal, as it gets confused with geothermal power generation.) Both MacDonald and Faught said it's possible to get 300 per cent efficiency from a heat pump — that is, you can get three kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity you put in. They're especially efficient in spring and fall.   But MacDonald said heat pumps tend to produce a lower temperature heat than burning fossil fuels, and therefore don't heat a building as quickly.  Faught said air source heat pumps can warm an airtight, well-insulated home to a comfortable temperature until it gets to about -10 C outside. In places with colder winters than that, supplementing with baseboard heaters may be necessary with conventional air source heat pumps. (Some manufacturers have brought cold climate heat pumps on the market that they say can deal with outside temperatures down to -25 C or -30 C.) In provinces like Alberta and Saskatchewan, where power right now is largely generated by burning fossil fuels, homeowners who want to cut heating emissions need to go beyond electrification and also install green power generation, such as solar panels. David Turnbull, a manager at Enerspec, which does energy consulting and home inspections, warns that before investing in a heat pump, homeowners should make sure their place is as airtight and well-insulated as possible. ""The investment in these things doesn't necessarily pay off unless you've low-enough heat loss in your home to make one of these things worth it."" — Emily Chung Are there issues you'd like us to cover?

60,Samantha Craggs,2020-01-24T18:39:09.727Z,'Am I going to die?': 7-year-old Hamilton boy wounded in shooting,"Police say a seven-year-old boy shot in his own home Thursday night was wounded when a gunman fired multiple times into the house from the rear yard. The gunman came from the street, pulled the trigger and fled from the yard in Hamilton's Crown Point neighbourhood into a vehicle waiting on Gordon Street that sped away east. The seven-year-old, described as ""unintended victim"" of a targeted shooting, is in hospital recovering, Det.-Sgt. Jim Callender said Friday. ""These are the investigations that really strike home with you. These are the ones that you really, you know, they're truly innocent victims,"" he said.  ""The child had nothing to do with this and [was] brought into the situation that they had no control over."" Callender said bullets entered the home through a window and the frame of the window on the main floor. ""There was no warning, or anything that we could say that precipitated the events as they unfolded."" He said that at the time of the shooting, there were people present in the home who are known to police. ""I have to say that it's ongoing as to why this particular [house] was targeted. Just the nature of what occurred dictates that it is a targeted location."" Police said the car has been described as a ""light-coloured four-door sedan"" and they believe at least two people were involved. As of Friday morning, police do not have any suspects. Watch: Neighbour describes how he helped the young shooting victim. There were 47 shootings in Hamilton last year, of which eight were homicides. There have been three shootings this year, although this was the first involving a victim.  Danny, a neighbour who wouldn't give his last name, said he applied pressure to the boy's wounds. The little boy was shot in the hand and the abdomen, he said. Police said the boy was shot at least once and suffered two injuries, but can't confirm if those injuries came from more than one bullet. Danny said he heard two gunshots and walked down the street to see where they were coming from, then heard a woman screaming from the house. He went in and found the little boy shot. ""He said, 'It hurts and it's hard to breathe,'"" Danny said. He said he suggested the boy sit up a bit and that seemed to make him a bit more comfortable. ""Then he kept asking me: 'Am I going to die?'"" The little boy plays in the neighbourhood, Danny said, and plays with his dogs. ""He's a good kid. He's a good kid."" Callender said a mother and her two kids live in the home. The other child was inside during the shooting, but is in ""great condition"" with their family. Detectives are looking for as much evidence as possible and said neighbours have been helpful. ""There's plenty of video surveillance in this area that we have collected and we're continuing to collect today,"" Callender said. ""There's always that piece of information that will put that puzzle together for us and we're always looking for that one little piece."" Police are also trying to determine what kind of firearm was used. Justin Bailey, who lives down the street, said it's the fourth shooting he's seen in the neighbourhood in two years.  ""I could throw a baseball to hit where the last shooting was,"" he said early Friday morning. The little boy who was shot Thursday often played in the neighbourhood, he said, and went to the same school as Bailey's kids. ""It's a tragedy that it hit a child. I hope to God that it wasn't a child that was targeted.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/shooting-1.5438863,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-child-shot-1.5438659,N/A

The group had started a sit-in in the lobby at 11 a.m. PT at the provincial government building in the 1800-block of Blanshard Avenue on Tuesday.  The youth are supporting Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who oppose the 670-kilometre LNG pipeline project from B.C.'s northeast to Kitimat on the coast. Coastal GasLink has signed benefit agreements with all 20 elected band councils along the route. But the hereditary chiefs argue band councils only have jurisdiction over reserve lands, not unceded territories.  The B.C. Supreme Court has granted an injunction against the pipeline's opponents who have set up camps close to a work site near Smithers. It authorizes RCMP to arrest and remove anyone contravening the order. Nigel Henri Robinson, who was at the occupation, says police showed up overnight. ""At one or two in the morning all the media was gone and that's when all the police started to come in,"" Robinson said.  Victoria police say officers worked with representatives from the protest group and the province to find a peaceful solution in the early hours of the occupation, as plainclothes community liaison officers attended and remained on scene.  When negotiations failed around 2 a.m., It says officers were requested to remove the protesters by the building owner.  The arrests took place over a four-hour period, police say, and ""the minimum amount of force was utilized to effect the arrests."" In all, 12 people were taken into custody. No charges have been laid. Sii-am Hamilton of the Nuu Chal Nulth Nation says more than half of the people participating were arrested, including the mother of one of the young protesters.

The trial resumed Friday morning in Moncton Court of Queen's Bench with testimony of the lead investigator. Prosecutor Pierre Gionet told the court the police report wasn't a necessary part of the Crown's evidence in the case. Johnson, 57, of Saint-Charles has pleaded not guilty to failing to stop at the scene of an accident that caused a person's death. The 22-year-old Francis was found dead in Saint-Charles, north of his community of Elsipogtog, on Feb. 24, 2018. Court had been adjourned Wednesday to give the prosecution time to prepare an answer after the defence argued the report prepared by the police investigator should not be entered into evidence. Speaking in French, Gionet said Friday that the evidence was initially going to be used as ""an aid"" to RCMP Const. Mathiew Richard's testimony but wouldn't be needed. Earlier, Richard testified that he analyzed security video from two buildings along Saint-Charles Road South, where Francis was found dead. On the road between the Saint-Charles gas station and the home of Louis Daigle, Richard said that in the gas station video, he saw a light-coloured pickup truck travelling east. It was similar to the 2003 GMC Sierra seized from Johnson. The video time code read 9:40 p.m, but Richard said the security camera ran about 7.5 minutes fast and he adjusted the time — 9:33 p.m — based on his cellphone. Defence lawyer Gilles Lemieux asked if Richard took any steps to verify that the time displayed by his cellphone was correct and whether there had been any issue with the camera, such as tampering or a power outage.  Richard said he had not checked. Gionet requested time to prepare his response, and Justice Denise LeBlanc agreed.  The trial, which began on Jan. 13, is scheduled to continue until Jan. 31.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-9-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5438633,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/day-8-brady-francis-trial-maurice-johnson-1.5435631,N/A

Ottawa Family Cinema has been serving up popcorn and first-run Hollywood productions at affordable prices in the auditorium of Notre Dame High School on Broadview Avenue. The weekend events are run by trained volunteers, with proceeds donated to local charities.  In November, the Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) informed the non-profit organization its lease will run out this May. The board said it needs the auditorium for its international language program. ""We wanted to provide them with ample time to secure a different location,"" said OCSB spokesperson Sharlene Hunter.  That hasn't lessened the blow, however. ""We're very puzzled, very upset,"" said Ottawa Family Cinema co-founder Jim McNeil.  McNeil said the potential cost of moving and recalibrating its projection and sound equipment has cast the organization's future in doubt. ""We're a shoestring operation of volunteers,"" McNeil said. News of the cinema group's possible demise has prompted an online petition, and a fair amount of outrage from community members. ""There are many people in our community who cannot afford to go to movies,"" said parent Jill Skinner. ""This is a great opportunity for people to get together that's affordable, and that is really important."" McNeil said he helped launch Ottawa Family Cinema so low-income families could enjoy the magic of watching a movie on the big screen like everyone else. The former theatre manager, who grew up among plenty of siblings in Belfast, remembers going to the movies as one of the few outings his family could afford to do together. He arrived in Canada as the cost of going to the movies began sky-rocketing, and said he was determined to create an affordable alternative where admission and concession prices were kept to a minimum. A ticket to an Ottawa Family Cinema movie such as this weekend's Little Women currently costs $4, and a kiddies' combo of popcorn, candy and drink is $5. ""Even those who can't afford it can have the escape and entertainment,"" said McNeil, who said he also hands out ""hundreds of free tickets to community centres, schools and women's shelters."" The school board arrived at the decision ""after carefully considering our student needs and our commitment to equity of access to our buildings,"" Hunter said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/movie-theatre-closing-family-cinema-ottawa-catholic-school-board-1.5436083,[],N/A

The growth of the celebration has been huge since the 2016 New Year, known as Tet in Vietnam, in Elaine Nguyen's basement. Then a few friends had a potluck and sang karaoke. Nguyen, now secretary of the Vietnamese Association of P.E.I., said the community is both growing and coming together. ""We found each other,"" she said. There were about 100 people in a church basement for the second celebration. ""Then the third year we have about 120 people. And the fourth year we had 400 people attending. Well, our celebration this year we hope would be around 500 people."" Preparations for the coming event include the making of sticky rice cakes that can take 12 to 15 hours to cook, a deep cleaning of the house, and throwing away any worn out items. Nguyen will also share stories and traditions of Tet with her children. For example, the Vietnamese share a tradition with northern British people that the nature of the first visitor of the New Year can bring bad or good luck. The Vietnamese, however, have devised a way of cheating fate. ""Just to be safe the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before 12:00 a.m.,"" Nguyen said. ""Then when the clock strikes midnight he will step into the house to prevent the first person entering the house."" Nguyen said it is important to share these traditions with her children. ""What kind of food you should eat or drinks, what you should not do during Tet, what you shouldn't say during Tet. Otherwise they will start forgetting,"" she said. ""My understanding of Tet is already fading a lot. So I try to keep whatever I can remember for my children.""

66,James Devine,2020-01-21T09:00:00.675Z,Why Iran has little interest in a 'Trump Deal' with the White House,"This column is an opinion by James Devine, an associate professor at Mount Allison University in Sackville, N.B., whose research focuses on the politics and foreign policy of Iran. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Iran's growing tension with the U.S. might seem irrational from a Western perspective, but from Tehran's point of view it makes perfect sense. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on Iran last week to accept a new ""Trump Deal"" to replace the old, now defunct, Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement. Given the extreme events of recent days, which saw Tehran narrowly avert war with the United States, shoot down a civilian airliner and face renewed domestic unrest, one might think that the regime would be ready to talk. However, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, often described as a moderate, rejected Johnson's appeal outright. There are a number of reasons why Tehran is not interested in negotiating with the Trump administration. First and foremost, Iran thought it already had a deal. Western critics of the JCPOA are quick to point out the many compromises Barack Obama made when the U.S. signed the 2015 agreement, but Tehran also felt it had made painful concessions. The JCPOA did not put an end to all sanctions against the Islamic Republic, only those related to its nuclear program. Moreover, when the deal was in effect, the Iranian government complained that the U.S. used loopholes to keep as many sanctions in place as possible. Even if we are not sympathetic to Tehran's complaints, it would be unrealistic to expect them to reopen talks. If they were to negotiate a ""Trump Deal,"" what would there be to stop future U.S. administrations from demanding more concessions later on? Tehran is also reticent because Trump would surely insist that Iran give up its regional influence, forcing it to withdraw from Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. While Tehran may have extended its reach during the Arab Spring, Iran's leadership likely sees its latest regional moves as defensive rather than ambitious. The instability in Syria and Iraq threatened to sever their alliance networks and create dangerous power vacuums that could be occupied by hostile Sunni extremist groups or the U.S. Trump would also undoubtedly call for Iran to decommission its extensive missile system. From the West's perspective, these weapons are part of Iran's strategy for regional hegemony. From Tehran's perspective, they are essential parts of its deterrence strategy. Without nuclear weapons, Iran's missiles are the main thing standing in the way of potential American and/or Israeli military strikes. Complying with Trump's demands would therefore leave the state defenceless, and invite the U.S. to keep pressuring the regime until it is finally toppled. Given the weight of U.S. power, one might think that Iran has no choice but to renegotiate, particularly if Washington is truly committed to forcing the issue. The Islamic Republic, however, has been remarkably resilient, and probably feels like it still has some cards to play. When Trump scrapped the JCPOA, Iran looked to the Europeans as a means of escaping economic and diplomatic isolation. Once it became clear that the EU could not play that role, Tehran turned to brinksmanship, provoking crises with the U.S. by shooting down an American drone, reportedly having allied militia forces in Iraq fire rockets into American installations, and possibly bombing Saudi Arabian oil facilities. Tehran is essentially playing a game of ""chicken,"" predicated on the belief that the U.S. is at least as averse to war as they are. Therefore, with each escalating crisis, Iran is presenting Trump with a choice; ease-off his strategy of ""Maximum Pressure"" or allow America to get dragged into an all-out conflict. By killing Qassem Soleimani, the U.S. signaled that they could play the brinksmanship game, too. However, earlier last year when Trump called back airstrikes after Iran downed a U.S. drone, he tipped his hand. He may want a new deal with Iran, but not at the cost of war. So, despite U.S. claims to have ""re-established deterrence,"" Iran is unlikely to embrace a ""Trump Deal"" with the White House. And in Tehran's perfect world, the Democrats will win the next election and the new president will walk U.S. policy back from the brink. In the meantime, Tehran will likely continue its strategy with cyberattacks and lesser provocations until it builds to another crisis.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-iran-united-states-strategy-1.5433090,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-uranium-enrichmant-nuclear-deal-1.5428896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-supreme-leader-trump-1.5430458,N/A

Genevieve Braun of Moncton's Victoria Park area, is fed up with men prowling her neighbourhood and bothering women. ""There's a lot of harassment toward women and girls and it's happening daily,"" said Braun. ""They're not here for the Victorian houses."" Braun refuses to leave her house at night. She was approached three times this summer alone. One of those times happened at the corner of Weldon and Park streets, a few feet from Edith Cavell School, a kindergarten to Grade 8 school. ""He just stopped and waved at me. His window was already down and he said, 'Hey, are you busy right now? Want to go on a date?' And I knew right away what he meant,"" she said.   ""I totally flipped out, called him a whole bunch of names and he sped up and drove away."" Braun has lived in the area for 12 years. She only started noticing that men were loitering and cruising around the neighbourhood after she moved her office into her sun room.  ""I started noticing the same cars over and over everyday."" Around 1 p.m. on a Sunday, Braun witnessed a man picking up a prostitute near her house. Braun called police, but she said it took an hour for them to get back to her. By that time the man had already left the area. She said the police officer told her there's nothing he could do anyway. ""To me, that doesn't make sense.""  Braun has taken matters into her own hands and set up a database to collect images and the licence plate numbers of men in their vehicles, who she believes are looking to pay for sex. She has more than 140 men registered in her database. She's also brought the issue forward to the city and asked for a police task force to be put in place. She also wants surveillance cameras to be installed. Charles Léger is a Moncton city councillor for the area. He's also chair of the Codiac REgional Policing Authority, a group responsible for overseeing planning, police coverage and fiscal management of the Codiac RCMP. Léger said federal changes to prostitution laws in 2014, which shifted to target people who buy and exploit sexual services, have made solving the issues in the Victoria Park neighbourhood ""much more complicated for the RCMP."" But he said the city is rolling out a plan in April to address Braun's concerns. The plan isn't finalized yet, but it could include changes to the design of the neighbourhood, installation of surveillance cameras and better lighting. ""Right now, all of the options are on the table with respect to what other communities have done and the successes they've had,"" he said.  ""The sex workers need to also feel safe in the environment. What they're doing is not illegal.""

68,Anonymous,2019-12-20T17:00:00.792Z,"I worked hard to raise a feminist daughter, but her racy online selfies make me feel I failed","This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage. For more information, please read our FAQ.   To some, ""feminist"" is a label that every empowered woman and progressive man should wear proudly. It is not controversial — it stands for the idea that every woman is a complete human being. Women are not less than men. Women deserve equal pay, equal say and equal rights in any society.  To others, ""feminist"" is a problematic term because of the biases and expectations that accompany it. Within the world of women, a feminist can be rejected as such for not following certain rules or can find herself scrutinized for failing the movement — because a feminist is expected to look a certain way, speak a certain way and live a certain way. Here are two conflicting views of what feminism means today, as told in this point-counterpoint by one Montreal mother and her teenage daughter.  I don't think expecting my daughter not to post sexed-up selfies amounts to 'slut-shaming': Jennifer Morrow Last summer, I stumbled onto my teenage daughter's social media account. What I found confirmed my worst fear: I had failed to raise a feminist.  There, among the pouty-faced selfies, was a photo of her posing, Sports Illustrated-style, on a jet ski in her bikini, brandishing her middle finger at the camera with a smirk on her face. My heart sank.  ""Who is this person?"" I asked myself. All her life, I've tried to model feminism: taking her on marches for women's rights, reading to her from books like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's We Should all be Feminists and surrounding her with a community of strong, independent female friends.  I realize now that the wisdom of my mother's ""Women's Lib"" generation doesn't cover the challenges of raising a feminist daughter in the 21st century.  Indeed, most young women seem so put off by the identity politics that come with calling themselves feminists that they're rejecting the label altogether.  ""What's the big deal?"" Clara asked me when I confronted her about the offending photo. ""It's just a picture."" Where do I start?  As I write this, 14 beacons of light are shining in the night sky over Montreal, in memory of the women killed in the Polytechnique shooting.  They are stark reminders that our daughters are still vulnerable to violent men who will do whatever it takes to keep women silent and subservient.  Feminism seeks to create a new world where that isn't the reality they face.  My daughter believes a photo of herself sitting on a jet ski in her bikini represents girl power. But it actually just looks like the media has poisoned that message entirely and used it to perpetuate the status quo.  We want our girls to grow up brave, confident and assertive.  But they are drip-fed gender-conforming, sexualized images to the point where they think it's perfectly normal to strive to meet male-defined expectations of them — the more performative and sexy the better.  What is the point of these images? The question answers itself, and I find the porny subtext deeply disturbing.  Girls like my daughter can afford to be ambivalent about feminism. They live in a society that is relatively safe for girls, especially if they are privileged and white. As far as she is concerned, my pontificating about the need to fight gender stereotypes is just an old-fashioned demand to cover up her body — also known as slut-shaming. What is a mother to do? Ever since I first held her in my arms, all I wanted was for her to be happy and safe. This thing called feminism is a complicated gift.  One day, when she's out of the house and I can't hold her daily, I hope she will unwrap this complicated gift and find what she needs inside — the tools to navigate an even more complicated world while staying true to herself. 'Would a boy be punished for looking too sexy?' asks Clara Morrow-Coffrant When my mother confronted me with the pictures on my Instagram, I thought ""What's the issue? It's not that big a deal.""  I told her that everyone posts photos like this. Also, it's not like this is anything new to our society. For example, Barbie is a hypersexualized children's toy that is given to girls as a sort of role model. Yes, she now comes in more shapes and colours, but we still think of her as having a perfect body and perfect blond hair. My mother thinks I'm too young to be putting this sort of image online, but I am not ashamed of it. What I, as a young woman of 15, post on social media doesn't define me. It is not the whole of who I am.  Am I a feminist? I don't know. The fact is that feminism today is much too difficult to define because everybody has a different perspective on what it means.  Of course, I believe in equality, but you are putting all the burden on me to police my self-expression in the interest of feminism — something I don't completely understand and can't get a real definition of.  Would a boy sitting on a jet ski be punished for looking too sexy?  Anyway, statistics show that my personal safety doesn't depend on what I wear. I also think that people are much too quick to judge a girl based on how she looks. You can judge me if you want to, I really don't care. My posts are for me and my friends. They are meant to be funny and ironic. It's not that deep. It's not political.  Instagram is just for fun. I'm still young, and I am allowed to make a few mistakes as I figure out who I want to be. This point-counterpoint is part of CBC's Opinion coverage.

69,Laura Sciarpelletti,2020-01-23T20:38:47.777Z,'It can be very taxing on families': New study reflects unmet needs of Canadian caregivers,"Melissa Lawrence of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan has two full-time jobs. She is a massage therapist and she is caregiver to her husband David Lawrence, who has Type 1 diabetes.  Melissa has been David's caregiver since she was 21 years old. Now 39, Lawrence has to feed, clothe and bath David. and change his diapers.  ""You're either working or you're taking care of him. There's not much room for anything else,"" Melissa said.  She is not alone. In 2018, approximately one in four Canadians aged 15 and older provided care to a family member or friend, according to a recent Statistics Canada report.  That is about 7.8 million people. Those needing care struggle with a long-term health condition, physical or mental disability, or problems related to aging. Listen to the story on CBC's The Morning Edition: Shortly after David and Melissa married nearly 20 years ago, he lost his vision. Then his kidney failed.  David got a kidney transplant in 2006. Since then he has suffered two strokes, the most recent in summer 2019.  Of those surveyed by Statistics Canada, nearly 70 per cent who had received some type of support said they would have liked to have more government financial support or tax credits. The next most common unmet need is home care, with 40 per cent. Melissa said her biggest challenge is surviving off of her sole income and David's small pension, left over from before he was too sick to work. ""You're on a super tight budget. If any little things happens, that can throw that out the door,"" Melissa said.  Melissa said the couple gets both a disability tax credit and a caregiver tax credit from the federal government, but that it isn't enough when living off of one income.  She said the couple could use extra government funding once a month to go toward better equipment to lift David out of bed, diapers and bed protectors.  ""I think that would make a big difference,"" she said. ""All the little things ... they're on us [as caregivers] to take care of.""  Melissa said that even though she is lucky enough to have David's parents and her brother around to sometimes help care for David when she is at work, she has very little time to focus on herself. Even if she did have time, she said there is no mental health support for unpaid caregivers like herself in Moose Jaw.  Rebecca Rackow, a consultant at the Canadian Mental Health Association Saskatchewan division, heads up a program in Regina called Caregiver Affected Recovery Education (C.A.R.E.). The program provides caregivers with tools to help them stay mentally healthy while carrying out their responsibilities. She says mental health is difficult to maintain for many caregivers.  Rackow said a lack of self-care can cause some caregivers to develop post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction or compassion fatigue.  ""Imagine you have a container full of compassion or empathy. You can only give until that container is empty. And then after that people tend to struggle with compassion fatigue and that can lead to terrible things. It can lead to situations of abuse."" Nora Spinks, CEO of the Vanier Institute of the Family — a Canadian research and education organization geared toward increasing public understanding of the complexities and family life — said that caregiving strains are a common part of family life.  ""It can be very taxing on families,"" Spinks said. She said there is a need for local and federal governments to help provide support for caregivers.  ""The reality is families are the most adaptable institution that we have. So families will adapt and adjust and evolve very quickly. And oftentimes [with] public policy and community programs ... there's a bit of a lag time. It takes a while to catch up,"" Spinks said.  ""Every caregiving situation is so unique that there has to be full collaboration and co-operation between levels of government, between government and community organizations and formal and informal resources.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/new-study-reflects-unmet-needs-of-canadian-caregivers-1.5436281,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/young-caregivers-impact-education-career-support-research-1.5302766,N/A
70,Amina Zafar,2020-01-23T02:08:58.060Z,How Canadian hospitals and airports are preparing for new coronavirus,"Health-care workers on the front lines of Canada's preparations for the new coronavirus are gearing up to treat potential infections and prevent spread. Those preparations will continue regardless of whether or not the World Health Organization declares the outbreak spreading in and beyond China a global health emergency on Thursday. The agency was expected to  make a decision on Wednesday but delayed, citing lack of information. China remains the epicentre of the outbreak, with more than 500 cases. Thailand, the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have also confirmed cases. The head of the WHO's health emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said the priority now is to find out how the virus is passing between people and to limit it. ""We are in agreement with Chinese authorities who have been clear and transparent that there is evidence of human-to-human transmission,"" he said. Given the speed of global travel, Canadian officials have said they would not be surprised if the virus lands here. If so, airport screening would offer one measure in efforts to control the spread. But passengers arriving here may not show any symptoms for days, which is why hospitals and health-care officials are getting ready. ""We are certainly preparing for the potential of a first case in Canada,"" says <a href=""https://twitter.com/CPHO_Canada?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CPHO_Canada</a> Dr. Tam, as the deadly coronovirus outbreak in China continues to spread. She says it's ""not surprising"" the U.S. has detected a case, given the heightened alerts to local health systems. <a href=""https://t.co/TCIuQApWD3"">pic.twitter.com/TCIuQApWD3</a> Standard infection control practices like isolating potentially sick patients are key, experts say. At Toronto General Hospital's emergency department, staff have already had some practice in the form of three patients who tested negative. ""We've had three patients come in with a travel history who presented with these symptoms,"" said nurse Debra Davies, the manager of the emergency department. ""They've done a phenomenal job in getting those patients into the isolation."" ""As long as we keep an eye on it, we should be well prepared,"" she said. Davies is a veteran of the SARS outbreak in 2002-03 that infected more than 400 people in Canada and killed 44. Dr. Michael Gardam, chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in northwest Toronto, says there were lessons learned from SARS. ""I can't stress enough how incredibly unprepared we were for SARS,"" he said. ""We're in such a better position now."" During that outbreak, Gardam recalls running around trying to buy respirators and setting up negative pressure rooms to isolate patients. When Humber River opened in 2015, it was designed with outbreaks and infection control in mind, and such equipment and design principles are built into the new hospital. Horacio Arruda, head of Quebec's public health authority, said Wednesday five people in that province were under surveillance for possible exposure.  Hospitals in Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia have also announced preparations for cases.  The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) acts as the lead agency for dealing with the coronavirus, through the Quarantine Act. Under PHAC's direction, Canada Border Services Agency officials will now ask travellers: ""Have you been in Wuhan, China, in the past 14 days?"" There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. Additional signs at airports in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will remind passengers to speak to border officials if they have flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough.  ""We are in the process of putting up signs on the electronic screens warning travellers that if they've been to an affected area to essentially determine if they've been in contact with live animals, sick people,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Tuesday on CBC's Power & Politics. If so, CBSA agents can alert a federal quarantine officer to do an assessment, which could include a temperature check. Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory as well as provincial government labs in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have a battery of tests to detect respiratory pathogens, including one that's in the works for the new coronavirus, Allen said.   So far, Canada is not planning to use thermal imaging to monitor travellers en masse, as was tested during the SARS outbreak. Tam said the current assessment of the risk to Canada is ""low."" Steven Hoffman, a law professor and director of the Global Strategy Lab at Toronto's York University, and an expert on global health, supports Canada's screening approach so far. ""Not everyone who has a high temperature is going to have this novel coronavirus. In fact, only a very small percentage would,"" said Hoffman. The first U.S. patient illustrates one of the weaknesses of airport screening — the man in his 30s did not have symptoms when he arrived and was in good condition, so he wouldn't be picked up in a check for fever. Rather, when the man started feeling ill, he went to a doctor, with a fever and cough. Lab tests confirmed the infection and he was put into isolation for monitoring. Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician in Toronto, said there's a delay between when people are infected and when they develop symptoms — the incubation period. For coronaviruses in general, such as those that can cause the common cold, the incubation period is typically five or six days. With coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, the incubation period can extend to 14 days. ""You can imagine if an individual is infected and they get on a plane and it could be up to two weeks before they manifest symptoms. In today's world you could literally go around the Earth before you start to develop illness,"" said Khan, founder and CEO of BlueDot, a digital health company that helps predict the spread of infectious diseases globally.

71,Brittany Wentzell,2020-01-23T19:46:37.879Z,Garbage fees jump at N.S. SPCA thrift stores as more donations left outside,"The Nova Scotia SPCA's thrifts stores are paying more in garbage disposal fees because some donations are being left at the establishments after hours. To help fund their shelters and other programs, the SPCA operates several thrift stores across the province, which are run by volunteers and rely on donations. The largest stores are in Sydney, Dartmouth and New Minas. Taylor Burke, the SPCA's provincial development officer, said the Sydney location has seen an influx in donors leaving items outside their shop after hours. The shops only accept donations during hours where they are open. That's in part to prevent items from becoming spoiled while sitting outside. It's also because there are some items they can't accept and sometimes thrift shops just don't have space for more items. Most months, the thrift stores spend about $400 on garbage disposal, but with recent after-hours dropoffs and donations of unusable items, some of them have seen their garbage disposal fees double. Burke worries they may reach as high as $1,200 a month if things don't improve. Burke said while this is a concern for all stores, the Sydney store has been hardest hit, despite signs that are posted. The most recent incident happened Saturday when a donor visited and the volunteers were shorthanded and capacity was reached. ""The staff communicated that they weren't to accept the load and that individual returned after hours and left the load anyway,"" she said. A Cape Breton Regional Municipality bylaw officer is now looking into the incident. Burke said volunteers don't like to turn away donations, but they can't have an unsafe working environment. ""When we're at capacity, that means our garbage is at capacity, our clothing donations are at capacity, there's likely a pile that goes halfway to the ceiling with bags,"" she said. Burke said more education is needed about donation policies. She said the SPCA thrift stores don't accept used safety equipment, bedding or child-care items like strollers and car seats. Burke said anyone wishing to donate a large number of items should call ahead of time to make sure there are volunteers present and able to accept the donations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/spca-thrift-store-garbage-nova-scotia-1.5437851,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/northern-pulp-mill-boat-harbour-government-environment-1.5437969 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-changing-municipal-training-after-cbrm-in-camera-pay-discussions-1.5436718,N/A

73,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:31:40.422Z,N.S. advocate of medically assisted death calls for amendments to federal law,"The head of a Nova Scotia charity that advocates for access to medically assisted death is calling for nationwide amendments to the Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) law. Sheilia Sperry, the head of the Nova Scotia chapter of Dying with Dignity, said late-stage consent and the criterion that a death be reasonably foreseeable must be removed from the law. ""How do you tell what's reasonably foreseeable? As someone said yesterday to me, once we're born, our death is reasonably foreseeable,"" Sperry told CBC's Information Morning in an interview Wednesday. In June 2016, Bill C-14 made it legal for terminally ill patients to access medically assisted death. Since then, more than 6,700 Canadians have used MAID to control when and how they died. But last September, the Superior Court of Quebec found it unconstitutional to limit MAID to only people who are already dying or have a ""reasonable foreseeability of natural death,"" according to the federal Criminal Code. The ruling will come into effect in Quebec on March 11, but Sperry said if the federal government doesn't adjust Bill C-14, then the rest of Canada will be ""out of step."" Since the court ruling, Justice Minister David Lametti has said the government is updating legislation across the country. On Jan. 13, the Department of Justice launched a two-week online survey asking Canadians to weigh in on how far to extend access to medically assisted dying. Sperry said the survey is a step in the right direction. She hopes the removal of the late-stage consent rule will be an outcome, which she's calling ""Audrey's Amendment."" Audrey Parker of Halifax chose to die on Nov. 1, 2018, after suffering from terminal cancer. She was approved for MAID and made a video that was released posthumously, which called for the removal of the late-stage consent requirement. In the video, Parker said she wanted to make it to Christmas, but was worried she'd become incompetent and would no longer be able to consent. Sperry said Audrey's Amendment would allow people to live until their chosen death date, even if they lose mental capacity or aren't conscious to consent. She said once a person is approved for MAID, that should be enough. ""It's highly, highly unlikely, after all the discussion, all the review, that anybody would change their mind,"" Sperry said. ""And certainly if somebody did, the doctor is not going to go through with the procedure."" Sperry is hoping the changes are addressed after the survey is completed and by the time the law in Quebec is established on March 11.

75,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-28T19:29:08.530Z,"Senior evicted from mental health facility, left to live in tent with rats","Judy Trask can barely sleep at night — curled up in a tent hidden in the bushes of a Victoria, B.C., park, worried that rats will attack, or worse, that she'll be raped. The 65-year-old ended up homeless, she says, after she was given two hours to pack what she could carry and get out of an apartment operated by a government-run mental health program. In March, according to Trask, staff sent her onto the street to fend for herself, handing her only a ""street survival guide"" to get by: a brochure that lists the locations of soup kitchens, 24-hour washrooms and homeless shelters. According to the eviction letter, Trask was kicked out of the mental health treatment facility after staff decided the program wasn't working for her, saying the senior was verbally aggressive and threatening toward staff. ""I mean my God, they think you're just human cattle,"" said Trask, who says she suffers from suicidal depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and a severe anxiety disorder. Trask had been in the live-in treatment program for a year. She was sent there from another facility in the Comox Valley, more than 200 kilometres northwest of Victoria, after that program underwent cutbacks, she said. The senior has no ID — it was stolen —and no family that can help. She often doesn't take the mood-stabilizing medications she needs.  She's been sleeping in homeless shelters and tents hidden in Victoria public parks since being evicted from the live-in treatment program last spring. While Vancouver Island Health's motto is, ""Excellent health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time,"" spokesperson Cheryl Bloxham told Go Public the health authority does discharge mentally ill people into emergency shelters ""as a last resort."" She said involuntary discharges are rare but that there is no database tracking exact numbers. Bloxham wouldn't comment on Trask's case, citing confidentiality rules, but said Island Health ensures those who are discharged and willing to participate in treatment programs continue to have access to mental health and substance-use services. Trask says she was willing to participate, even begged to stay. Trask is part of a broken system lacking housing and treatment facilities that can result in people with mental illness being put out onto the street, where their condition deteriorates, according to Jino Distasio, a researcher who has studied how to house people with mental health challenges. ""Dumping people onto the streets or into the shelter networks [is] everything we've been trying to undo over the last decade,"" he said. That adds pressure on overburdened emergency services across the country. Trask found an advocate in Carolina Tudela — a volunteer for a homeless drop-in centre — after she called in, asking for help dealing with rats that had entered her tent. ""It was overrun for sure. They were running all over her body when I found her,"" said Tudela.   Tudela picked Trask up and drove her around that June night, offering to pay for a hotel, but she couldn't get her a room because Trask had no identification. Trask ended up going back to her tent that night. ""What outrages me is the indifference and callousness,"" Tudela told Go Public. ""That somebody can just be kicked out of a program like that … with nowhere to go. Just 'Good luck.'"" In September,  police confiscated Trask's tent after finding it in a public park, leaving her to sleep on mats on the floors of homeless shelters or outdoors on church steps.  She says she was surrounded by violence. Now, she's back at a park in another tent belonging to another homeless person, hoping this one is hidden far enough from public view that it won't be confiscated. Tudela wrote to the provincial health authority and the B.C. government in August, asking them to help Trask. She says no one responded. Although the eviction letter said Trask had been verbally aggressive and threatening, her advocate says Trask is ""a very frail woman."" ""She's all about 110 pounds,"" Tudela said. ""She lives in constant fear she'll be kicked out of the tent she's got or that she's going to be raped at night. She lives in constant fear of harm."" Mental health experts estimate that 35,000 people are homeless in Canada on any given night — and of those, approximately 15 per cent suffer from mental illness. ""There's just no way in a country like Canada that we should have this many people on any given night struggling with shelter,"" said Distasio, director of the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg. He says the reasons given for Trask's eviction are common challenges when treating people with certain mental health issues. He worked on one of the largest mental health services trials ever conducted in Canada, called At Home/Chez Soi (AHCS), and says leaving patients with no place to live and no access to treatment goes against the study's findings. The AHCS study he co-authored followed more than 2,000 participants for two years with test sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, N.B. It found that the most important requirement for improving the lives of people with mental health issues is stable housing. The study, published Oct. 7, is considered the longest-running of its kind using the Housing First model, which is believed to significantly reduce homelessness over the long term. WATCH | Judy Trask shows housing advocate  Carolina Tudela her tent in a Victoria park: Without stable housing, Distasio says, patients' mental health deteriorates, putting more pressure on the emergency services everyone uses and pays for. ""Overuse of ERs, emergency services, police, fire, ambulance. It's a cascade of services and supports to address these individuals,"" Distasio told Go Public. Go Public put Trask's situation to Canada's first provincial minister of mental health and addictions, British Columbia's Judy Darcy, who admits the system is broken. ""For years, many people in B.C. have been struggling to navigate a fragmented and unco-ordinated mental health and addictions system of care,"" Darcy said in an email to Go Public. ""Our government is working to change this."" Darcy says the B.C. government plans to build 2,200 affordable housing units and expand access to mental health and addictions programs. Advocates say other provinces need to follow suit. As for Trask, she remains homeless. Tudela regularly checks on her friend and says she's worried about what might happen to her living on the street. ""You know the program is not working when you throw people out on the street. I mean, this is a senior citizen. Judy has mental health problems,"" says Tudela. ""The system is broken … I don't understand the coldness of it all.""

76,Susan Bonner,2020-01-24T09:00:00.272Z,Holocaust survivor in famous Auschwitz liberation photo says rising anti-Semitism 'scares me',"Miriam Ziegler sees it as a call of duty: She's going back to a place of horror to honour those who did not make it out — and to remind the world what unchecked hate can do. On Jan. 27, the 84-year-old Canadian will stand alongside dozens of other Holocaust survivors from around the world as they gather in Poland to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. ""All the six million… I feel I have to honour them,"" said Ziegler. She was nine when the Russians liberated the camp, making Ziegler one of the youngest people to have survived Auschwitz. The number of survivors dwindles every year, which means this year's ceremony is likely to be the last major international gathering of its kind. More than 1.1 million people were murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The Nazi regime made it the key killing ground for its plan to exterminate the Jewish people. It was surreal to meet Ziegler in her lovely condo in north Toronto. An elegant and proud mother and grandmother, she surrounds herself with family photos and mementos of a life well-lived in Canada. She recounted the trauma and terror she endured as a child during the Second World War in Poland. It's painful to relive. For years, she didn't even tell her own children. And for years, Ziegler herself didn't know that she had appeared in one of the most famous and haunting photos from the end of the war. The image shows Ziegler standing among a group of children behind the wire at Auschwitz. Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on Jan. 27, 1945. The photo appeared in newspapers worldwide. The image is deceiving — the children don't look emaciated, like other concentration camp prisoners. That's because they are wearing several layers of clothing under their striped prison garb. The Germans had fled Auschwitz a few days earlier, and the kids had scavenged leftover clothing from the abandoned barracks in order to stay warm.  Ziegler, second from left, is wearing an old, oversized coat and holds out her arm.  At the time, the Russian soldiers were asking the children their names. In response, Ziegler showed them her tattoo: prisoner number A16891. ""In the camp, they didn't call you by name. They only knew you by number,"" said Ziegler. ""So I wanted to show the Russians."" Before they abandoned the camp, German soldiers led tens of thousands of prisoners on a march out, telling them they would be taken to safety. Ziegler and a cousin joined the line, but a great aunt intervened and told the children to stay behind. She told Ziegler, ""'No! You are not going. If you have to live, you can live here. You are not well enough to march.' And she dragged us [back] and she saved our lives, because [the soldiers] killed everybody ... On the march, they killed every single person."" That's how a group of hungry, sick, freezing children found themselves at the gates of Auschwitz to greet the Russians. Ziegler remembers the moment clearly. ""Of course — I remember everything since I was four years [old]."" Ziegler wants to put the memories that have tormented her to good use while she can. The Holocaust can be hard to comprehend, especially for a generation that has never known war. But she's been amazed at how young people respond. After speaking to a class of high school students, Ziegler was overwhelmed with thank-you notes explaining how her story had helped make the horror real for them. The students told her that reading a book about it was one thing, ""'but to meet a person that went through it and the way you told it... We never believed it before. Now we believe it.'"" Ziegler was four when she saw her first murder: Nazis shot and killed a buggy driver that her mother had hired to try to take Miriam to safety in the countryside, outside their hometown of Radom, Poland. Before that, she'd been a happy child in a large, wealthy extended family that owned several large clothing and general goods stores. But beginning in the late 1930s, Ziegler lived in hiding, sometimes with her parents, sometimes with strangers. She was hidden in farms, work camps or compounds. She was taking refuge in an attic with several people during one particularly gruesome Nazi raid. ""I heard them coming up the stairs. I hid myself under a pile of rubbish and clothes. I pushed myself underneath and covered myself. And they shot everybody in that attic... I was lucky. This was my first real escape from being killed."" In 1944, her family was taken to Auschwitz. She remembers the train trip, the crowded cattle cars filled with terrified people. When they arrived, she was separated from her parents. Tattooed. Shaved. And then sent to the showers.  She was eight years old. ""By that time, we knew already about the gas chambers. From the ghettos in the camps, we knew that this is what they were doing. They were killing everybody and we didn't think we would come out from the showers."" Ziegler lived a year in daily fear, but she survived. She would later learn her mother, grandmother and an aunt had also survived. But not her father. ""He was taken away. I never saw him again. He was put through the gas chamber."" In the final months of the war, the infamous gas chambers at Birkenau were shut down. But Ziegler says the medical experiments continued, and she did not escape that. She doesn't remember much beyond that she was taken to a room one day with instruments and people in white lab coats. And she remembers the pain. She knows it won't be easy to return to the scene of this trauma in the coming days. When she attended the 70th anniversary in 2015, she caught a glimpse of herself in a film clip taken on the day the camp was liberated. ""A ghost,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it. I didn't believe it was me."" What happened to Ziegler as a child was unfathomable to the woman watching. The 2015 trip took a physical toll on her that lasted months. She fell ill when she returned to Toronto. At the time, Ziegler was caring for her husband, Roman, another Holocaust survivor, who suffers from Alzheimer's.  The Auschwitz anniversary experience left her weaker, but Ziegler said she has no choice but to do it again. She sees hatred on the rise again in the world and wants to speak out. ""It scares me. And that's why I want as many people as I can to tell my story to. I wouldn't want anybody to go through what we went through, it doesn't matter what nation. And that's why I'm scared.""

77,Roshini Nair,2020-01-21T23:00:41.932Z,"As paparazzi descend on Harry and Meghan, B.C. privacy laws could face first celebrity test","Ever since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their exit from the royal family, the hot glare of the media they tried to escape in the U.K. has continued to burn brightly, even on Canada's west coast.  Monday evening, SkyNews published video of Harry, decked in a puffer jacket and tuque, deplaning from a West Jet plane on the Victoria airport tarmac. Photographs of Meghan's life on the island — taking a seaplane to Vancouver, going to a yoga class, picking up a friend from the airport — have all been published. On Tuesday, media outlets like the Guardian said the couple had issued ""a stern warning"" against photographers in Canada after ""unauthorized"" pictures of Meghan walking with eight-month-old Archie in a park with the family's two dogs were published in a number of British tabloids.  The couple, who have long had a difficult relationship with the tabloid press, are involved in a number of lawsuits with U.K. tabloids over invasion of privacy — but their latest Canadian warning could mean a test for this country's privacy laws.  Privacy is governed by both federal and provincial statutes in Canada, explains privacy lawyer David Fraser, who works for the firm McInnes Cooper, and runs the Canadian Privacy Law Blog.  Most Canadian privacy law is similar to U.K. law, he says, but what is different in British Columbia is the implementation of the provincial Privacy Act.  In  B.C., the Privacy Act is what allows individuals to sue other people for invasions of privacy where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The act also says privacy may be violated by eavesdropping or surveillance, whether or not accomplished by physical trespass. ""So, the act of the paparazzi of continually following around a person — in this case the duchess — probably could be surveillance for the purposes of this act, which could lead to a lawsuit,"" Fraser explained.  A successful lawsuit wouldn't bring substantial monetary damages, he says, but could grant the privacy-seeking couple something more important — an injunction against that kind of repeat surveillance from photographers. The major caveat, however, is that the law hasn't really been tested with these types of ""celebrity"" cases.  ""It's all relatively untested when it comes to these sorts of circumstances [because] we don't have in Canada the same sort of paparazzi culture,"" Fraser said. ""Most of the cases that we've seen under this statute ... principally relate to voyeurism, to a landlord putting a hidden camera in an apartment [or] harassment and things like that."" As Vancouver Island continues to bear the gaze of the international tabloid press, Fraser says pure economics rather than the law might be the blunt instrument of choice that eventually wins the young family their peace.  ""If you're a freelance paparazzi photographer in Los Angeles or Monaco or London, that's a pretty target rich environment,"" Fraser said. ""On Vancouver Island, there will be one or two celebrities and one baby that you'll be looking to try to earn your living from.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-privacy-laws-harry-meghan-1.5434741,https://www.cbc.ca/news/prince-harry-victoria-meghan-archie-1.5434247 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-her-majesty-prince-harry-meghan-security-costs-canada-1.5434579,N/A
78,Sophia Harris,2020-01-23T09:00:00.107Z,"U.S. border officers were told to target Iranian-born travellers, officer alleges in email","U.S. border officers working at multiple Canada-U.S. border crossings were instructed to target and interrogate Iranian-born travellers in early January, said a U.S. border officer in an email obtained by CBC News.  The allegation follows reports that up to 200 people of Iranian descent travelling from B.C. — many of them Canadian or U.S. citizens — were detained and questioned for hours at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine, Wash., during the weekend of Jan. 4.  On Friday, Jan. 3, the U.S. assassinated Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, intensifying tensions between the two countries.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told CBC News that the ""current threat environment"" prompted it to implement an ""enhanced posture"" at the border. However, it denied detaining Iranian-born travellers and said the delays at the Peace Arch crossing were related to staffing issues during a busy holiday weekend.  The U.S. border officer challenges CBP's claims in an email he sent to Blaine-based immigration lawyer, Len Saunders. Social media posts that CBP is detaining Iranian-Americans and refusing their entry into the U.S. because of their country of origin are false. Reports that DHS/CBP has issued a related directive are also false. Saunders believes the officer reached out to him because the lawyer has been openly critical of how CBP allegedly treated Iranian-born travellers.  Saunders confirmed the U.S. officer's identity and said that he works on the front lines. He asked that CBC News keep the officer's name confidential, because the person fears repercussions from his employer.  To further protect the officer's identity, CBC isn't directly quoting from the page-long email.  In it, the officer told Saunders that CBP's Seattle Field Office — which covers the Canada-U.S. border from Washington State to Minnesota — directed border officers to ask Iranian-born travellers counterterrorism questions.  The officer claimed that the sole reason Iranian travellers were detained and questioned that weekend was due to their ethnicity. He alleged that the operation was unethical and possibly unconstitutional. In his email, the officer also told Saunders that after the detainment of Iranian-born travellers made national news on Jan. 5, the operation was suspended. CBP declined to comment on the content of the email without reviewing it first. To protect the officer's identity, CBC declined to send it. Saunders said he also recently spoke with another U.S. border officer who worked the weekend of Jan. 4 at a Washington State border crossing different from the Peace Arch. Saunders said the officer confirmed the Seattle Field Office had directed frontline staff to target Iranian-born travellers.  ""It confirms my suspicion that this was not just happening at Peach Arch,"" said Saunders. He also said that the officers' claims confirm his beliefs about how Iranian-born travellers were treated at the border.  ""They violated American constitutional rights by interrogating them and detaining them,"" alleges Saunders. ""What's next? Where does it stop?""  Although there are allegations that travellers with ties to Iran were targeted at multiple U.S. border crossings, Saunders believes the focus has been on the Peace Arch because a big group of Iranian-Americans travelled through that crossing Jan. 4, on their way home from a concert in Vancouver.  ""It was because there was a large group that it got attention. That was just by chance,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's a lot more cases we don't know about."" Not all Iranian-born travellers held at the Peace Arch in Blaine were returning home from a concert.  Iranian-born Canadian citizen, Sam Sadr of North Vancouver said he and three relatives were heading to Seattle when they were detained at the crossing for more than eight hours on Jan. 4.  ""Why us?"" said Sadr who was visiting the U.S. for the first time. He said he counted more than 120 people of Iranian heritage being held for questioning that day. ""As soon as they released me, I told the officer, 'This is called discrimination.'""  Negah Hekmati, an Iranian-born U.S. Citizen, was returning home with her husband and two children after a ski weekend in Canada. She said her family was held for questioning at the Peace Arch crossing for five hours during the early hours of Sunday.  ""They had our car keys, they had our passports,"" she said during a news conference on Jan. 6. ""I am here today because of my kids. They shouldn't experience such things. They are U.S. citizens and this is not OK."" To get to the bottom of what happened, 70 U.S. congress members sent a letter to CBP on Jan. 6, demanding answers. ""We are deeply concerned about the experiences of those impacted this past weekend and the potential that this may be the start of a new policy at our borders and airports illegally targeting those of Iranian descent,"" stated the letter.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is now investigating the matter.  CBP declined to comment on the investigation. ""As a matter of policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not comment on pending litigation,"" spokesperson Mike Niezgoda said in an email. Homeland Security didn't respond to CBC's request for comment. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-border-peach-arch-crossing-iranian-travellers-cbp-1.5436384,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/iranian-canadians-detained-interrogated-at-us-border-1.5415782 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/iranian-canadians-detained-interrogated-at-us-border-jayapal-congress-1.5416404 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/preclearance-act-federal-government-u-s-border-1.5429662,N/A
79,Jordan Gill,2020-01-24T12:25:12.666Z,Tiny Kincardine keeps a 'colony' of Scots alive,"New Brunswick has a lot of people claiming Scottish heritage, but a hamlet in the Upper St. John River Valley is probably the most committed to celebrating its connection to Scotland.  Kincardine, along with neighbouring Upper and Lower Kintore and Bon Accord, make up what's known as the ""Scotch Colony."" Kincardine is the cultural hub, with the church, old one-room schoolhouse and the Burns Hall acting as the local stomping grounds for concerts, plays and the annual Burns Night, held in honour of Robert Burns, Scotland's national bard. Kincardine's dinner is tonight, but many dinners elsewhere will be held Saturday, on the 18th-century poet's birthday. Darlene Morton said that even though Kincardine has changed demographically, its Scottish heart beats strong. ""There are only a few of us left now that are descended from the original settlers,"" she said.  ""But the people who have moved in are amazing, because a lot of them become part of it. Even though they might not have a drop of Scottish blood in them."" The community had an inauspicious beginning. It was founded by settlers largely from the Scottish county Kincardineshire. Many of them soon came to regret the trip. ""There were two boatloads of settlers that came in 1873 and in 1874, and when they got here they found it wasn't what was promised,"" said Morton. The settlement was the brainchild of Capt. William Brown, a Scot who wanted to develop a colony in New Brunswick. He and his business partners travelled to New Brunswick, which, like all of the Dominion of Canada, was desperate for immigrants. The province showed the group a number of locations, and Brown chose a tract of land on the St. John River between the Carleton-Victoria County line and the Tobique River. The province promised to clear lots for the newcomers and to build log cabins for them as well. On April 25, 1873, a ship set sail for New Brunswick with 530 Scots aboard. When they arrived in Victoria County in May they quickly realized what they were promised hadn't materialized. ""They were supposed to have houses prepared for them,"" said Garth Farquhar, the area's ""unofficial"" historian. ""I think there were only three ready, ""And one of those was underwater because it was in the early spring and Muniac [Stream] was high. So it was quite disappointing for them.""  The next year even more Scottish immigrants arrived in the area, exceeding 600 at one point. Some, not getting what they were promised, moved to other parts of Canada and the United States. But those who stayed behind stuck hard to their Scottish roots, building Presbyterian churches and starting Burns Day Celebrations. Burns Day, or Burns Night, celebrations are a staple of communities both in Scotland, and among the Scottish diaspora. A supper often includes the eating of haggis, a dish made of sheep organs, among other things, stuffed in a sheep's stomach and piped into the dining hall, where Burns's Address to a Haggis is recited. Kincardine forgoes this culinary tradition. The heart of the Burns Day Celebrations is Kincardine's Burns Hall, a small structure on what locals call the ""lower road,"" built in 1911 and funded through the sale of shares. Except for a few years when work had to be done on the building's foundation, the hall has held Burns Night ever since, along with a variety of other Scottish cultural events. Mavis Smith, who has lived in ""the colony"" all her 92 years, said Scottish culture and Robbie Burns were always present in her life. While she remembers the songs and dancing, she personally participated in ""dialogues"" or roasting of other townsfolk. ""Get up there and try to make it funny,"" said Smith.  ""Sometimes you talked about your neighbours and things you know and told stories, made up lies about them and see how they did enjoy it."" Like all of rural New Brunswick, Kincardine has changed over the years. The community is smaller, there are no open schools, and the churches are only open in the summer. The makeup of the community has also changed, boasting people with English, Danish, Swedish and even Japanese ancestry. But they, too, help keep the Scottish traditions alive.  Morton, whose grandfather built the Burns Hall, said the reason for that is simple: they're a fun group of people. ""We have a good time practising for Burns,"" said Morton.  ""We have a great choir and it's not a very well-behaved choir. The director, she has a hard time keeping us in line, but we have a lot of fun.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/kincardine-scottish-robbie-burns-1.5436500,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/robert-burns-day-statue-1.4503130 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/burns-night-2017-1.3949610,N/A
80,Santiago Guzmán,2020-01-12T11:30:00.858Z,"I'm new to Canada, and here's why I'm terrified of falling on ice ","Picture this: you just finished grocery shopping for the week. Standing in front of the glass door that leads to a crowded parking lot in St. John's, you see a not-so-scary snowstorm coming before you.  Luckily, you're just a couple of metres away from the bus stop, so it shouldn't be that bad. You don't take the bus regularly because of its lack of efficiency — sometimes it's easier and faster to walk, instead of waiting for an extra half-hour. This time, the bus is your best bet. Plus, the bus will leave you almost in front of your door. Sounds like a well-thought-out plan. You're trying to be positive. Although this is not your first winter in Newfoundland and you know how to deal with it, sometimes it's hard to keep yourself positive. Kudos to you. Now that you've made a plan, you put your groceries on the floor to prepare yourself to face this winter crusade: you pull out your mittens, put your warm hat on, cover your mouth and nose with your bulky scarf. You walk through the glass door.  You can feel the immediate change in temperature, and the wind. You start walking slowly, aware of the slippery street, balancing the grocery bags you're carrying. It seems like there is enough salt on the floor to protect you from sliding, and the bus stop is barely 60 metres away. Slip. Your right boot swiftly slides on an icy spot that the salt didn't cover. Miraculously, you juggle the grocery bags, as though you were on a tightrope above a hungry shark waiting for its prey to fall. You find your balance and stand still for a second. That was close! You let a laugh out, take a deep breath and try all over again. Slip. Crack.  Now you're sitting on the barely cleared sidewalk with all your groceries around you. No laughs this time. Instead, slow tears that freeze as they fall down your face. Your ankle. Despite the cold numbing your body, you can feel pain. Deep, sharp, acute pain. It's broken, you know it. In the distance, you see the bus arrive. Its passengers get out while some others hop on, and you're still on the ground in pain. No bus, no groceries, no laughs, but a broken ankle and the fear of having to go to the doctor. No, you're not afraid of needles, and prescriptions — you're afraid to have to pay fully for the medical service in the ER. You don't have health coverage. You really don't know why you're crying now, if it's the pain of your broken ankle or of depleting your minimum wage savings to pay the medical bills.  Unfortunately, the previous scenario is the fear of multiple immigrants in Newfoundland and Labrador. In order to be eligible for the provincial Medical Care Plan, you have to be a current resident of the province, and fall under one of these groups: Canadian citizen, permanent resident, international post-secondary student or international worker (with a valid work visa). It seems simple, but it's not. I put myself forward as a case study. I live in Newfoundland and Labrador. According to the Medical Care and Hospital Insurance Act, a resident is a person ""who is lawfully entitled to be or to remain in Canada, makes his or her home in the province, and is ordinarily present in the province but does not include a tourist, transient or visitor to the province."" Since I was pursuing my studies here, I envisioned making Newfoundland and Labrador home.  So, emotionally speaking, I would argue that I was a resident even back then. Of course, my feelings could be debatable compared with the actual number of international students who decide to remain in the province. Therefore, as students, we're only given the credit of a temporary resident, because what will happen after we graduate? Nonetheless, after graduating, I decided to stay here. I moved from Corner Brook to St. John's and signed a lease in the house I'm currently renting. I think that's enough for me to become a resident.  I am not a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident (I have all the intention to become one when I can actually afford it), and I am no longer a post-secondary student — so these are three other categories I don't qualify for. OK, but I do have a valid work permit, so I take it that I'm considered as an international worker. Well, yes but no.  I have to be employed by a Newfoundland and Labrador-based company for 12 months or longer to be eligible for MCP. I'm a self-employed artist trying to make a living from what I came to study in Newfoundland and Labrador to begin with. Securing a full-time position in my field can be quite challenging, but that hasn't stopped me from finding continuous work in my field almost since I graduated last May. However, my contract work won't be considered as full-time employment. Immigration and career consultants have worked hard with me to find a solution. They've helped me look for and connected me with available resources in order for me to get an affordable health care plan. Have I been lucky? No. The answer I've always encountered is ""you're not eligible."" Like the character in the scenario above, I'm afraid to get injured because I wouldn't be able to pay the medical bills. I blamed myself in the beginning for not looking into this situation earlier. I truly thought that this was only happening to me. However, as I became more vocal about it, I found that fellow former international students who decided to reside in N.L. have struggled with this issue as well. Why haven't we found a solution? Why is there nothing in place to support the transition of these international graduates from students-to-workers in matters of health care? Here's a tip: if you're currently an international student, want to stay in this province, and find yourself reading this article, make sure to purchase insurance with your current insurance provider within 30 days of graduating.  I wish someone had told me, because I walk my days afraid of falling.

81,Taylor C. Noakes,2020-01-15T23:26:45.604Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan: Welcome to Canada, but pay your own bills","This column is an opinion by Taylor C. Noakes, an independent journalist and public historian from Montreal. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. It's remarkably easy to become financially independent, as Prince Harry and Meghan say they want to do, when other people pay your bills. Doubtless this will be a crucial lesson in Ontario's new high school financial literacy course; there's no better way to keep your money than by not having to spend it. Just ask any Canadian billionaire, whose tax rates have decreased over the past 20 years while their share of total income skyrocketed over the same time period. It's remarkable, too, that news of Meghan, Harry and Archie's planned Brexit to Canada has really only led to a single central question: will Canada pay their security costs? Not ""why are we maintaining this antiquated, obsolete and fundamentally undemocratic institution,"" but rather how much more are we willing to fork over for Monarchy Lite? If the Sussexes are coming to Canada at least in part because they're looking to be more financially independent, they should pay their own security costs. Even without the estimated £82.4 million ($140 million Cdn) the royal family will receive this year from British taxpayers through the sovereign grant, the couple has an estimated net worth of £18 million and receives another £2.3 million annually from Prince Charles. What's particularly curious here is that the Sussexes are in fact doubling down on the monarchy even though they appear to be moving away from it. They're quite literally in the process of attempting to trademark ""Sussex Royal"" in an application covering Canada and Australia, as well as noted bulwarks of British monarchism the European Union and United States. So while they're ostensibly stepping away from their public functions as senior members of the royal family, there are no plans to move away from the fortune to be made from branding and marketing their royal likeness on everything from coffee cups to beach towels. In other words, they're not taking a step back from the monarchy, they're bringing the monarchy to Canada on a semi-permanent basis, seemingly as part of a major product launch. (This ain't your grandma's royal family, it's new and improved!) As much as we might be tempted to feel bad for the embarrassing elements of Harry's family, or the nauseating racism of contemporary British society directed towards Meghan, we mustn't forget the Sussexes are fundamentally a business for whom the taxpaying public pays most if not all of the bills. And though it may appear the couple are fleeing the salivating hounds of Fleet Street, they are in fact imposing themselves on a people they have little in common with. According to some poll numbers, about half of Canadians think our relationship with the royal family should end once Queen Elizabeth dies, and more than 60 per cent believe the royals should have no role in Canadian society and culture. The monarchy in Canada is a lot more than just the occasional visit and some ceremonial relationships between princes and military units. It's also the governor general, the lieutenant governors and several properties that serve as official royal residences, such as Quebec City's Citadel and Ottawa's Rideau Hall. The rough estimate is that maintaining the monarchy in Canada exceeds $50 million annually, a considerable sum to spend on ceremonial frivolities in a country that still has trouble providing safe drinking water to rural communities. Complicated as disentangling Canada from the monarchy would be, that's also quite a lot of money to spend on unelected officials with the power to disrupt the normal functioning of Canadian democracy. Cuddly newborns and photogenic princesses aside, the monarchy is a symbol of the genocidal imperialism that all but annihilated the rightful heirs and stewards of this land. Canadians pumping money into the monarchy in 2020 makes about as much sense as Americans who defend the Confederacy: just because it's historic doesn't mean it's worth celebrating or spending money on. Moreover, far from encouraging a greater appreciation of our national history, our fascination with the celebrity circus that is the British monarchy occludes the reality that anti-monarchists, like William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau, were trying to sever our ties with the Crown a full 30 years before Confederation. That an unfortunate number of Canadians can more easily identify latter-day, second-tier foreign royalty than explain what the Rebellions of 1837/1838 were about is demonstrative that the monarchy is a bit of a historical black hole.  It's time to move on and for precedents to be set. Meghan, Harry and Archie are welcome to immigrate to Canada. They just have to get in line like everyone else, and prove they won't be a financial liability.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-canada-us-royals-security-costs-1.5399933,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-morneau-security-costs-harry-meghan-1.5424988 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5425611 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/meghan-markle-hideout-this-b-c-property-believed-to-be-where-royals-are-1.5427722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/premier-and-prime-minister-giddy-about-harry-and-meghan-s-possible-move-to-b-c-1.5425727 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-family-jobs-europe-harry-meghan-1.5427405 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,N/A
82,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:33:23.958Z,Democrats use words of Trump's staunchest allies to make their case in his impeachment trial,"Democrats on Thursday pressed their case for removing U.S. President Donald Trump from office by using the words of his own allies against him to make the point that his actions were impeachable.  And they worked methodically to dismantle his long-standing allegation that Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden acted improperly toward Ukraine while vice-president. However, Trump's fellow Republicans, serving as the jury in his Senate impeachment trial, showed no signs of turning against him.  On the second day of their arguments for Trump's removal from office, Democratic House of Representatives members acting as prosecutors argued that Biden was carrying out official U.S. policy when he pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Victor Shokin, because of corruption concerns. Trump and his allies maintain that Biden wanted Shokin out in order to head off an investigation into a natural gas company, Burisma, where his son Hunter served as a director. Democrats said no evidence supported that allegation. Democrats argued, instead, that Trump pushed the Ukrainian government to probe Biden and his son because he was worried about facing the former vice-president in November's election. Biden is a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. ""If we allow this gross abuse of power to continue, this president would have free rein — free rein — to abuse his control of U.S. foreign policy for personal interest, and so would any other future president,"" Rep. Sylvia Garcia said on the Senate floor. ""And then this president, and all presidents, become above the law."" Garcia argued Trump did not pressure Ukraine to investigate corruption and had supported sending military aid to the country until Biden announced his presidential bid in early 2019. She pointed out that in the months before Trump asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, polls had been showing that Biden would beat Trump in a presidential match-up. In May, she said a Fox News poll showed Biden beating Trump by 11 points. ""This clearly did not go unnoticed,"" she said. Trump's lawyers quickly argued that by bringing up the Bidens, Democrats had made their conduct a relevant subject for the rest of the trial. ""They opened the door. They opened the door and it's now relevant,"" Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for the president and a member of his defence team, told reporters at the Capitol. ""So we will address the appropriate issues as defence lawyers would."" Added Republican Senator Ted Cruz: ""Hunter Biden is not only relevant, he is now critical."" But Sekulow said Trump's team was not yet focused on whether new witnesses will be called, a matter the Senate will take up after senators have a chance to submit questions to both sides next week. The Democrats are presenting arguments that Trump should be convicted of two articles of impeachment passed by the House last month — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden last year, and impeding a congressional inquiry into the matter. The U.S. Constitution sets out the impeachment process for removing a president who commits ""high crimes and misdemeanours."" Trump's legal team argues the House charges are invalid because impeachable offences must represent a specific violation of criminal law. ""Impeachment is not a punishment for crimes,"" Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler told the assembled senators. ""Impeachment exists to address threats to the political system, applies only to political officials and responds not by imprisonment or fines but only by stripping political power."" Nadler played a video clip of one of Trump's most prominent defenders, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, arguing during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton that presidents can be impeached even if the conduct in question was not a statutory criminal violation. Nadler also played a video clip from 1998 of Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's legal team, in which he recognizes that abuse of power is impeachable. Finally, Nadler cited a memo written by Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, that made the same point. Watch that part of Nadler's presentation:  ""As our recital of the facts indicated, the articles are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence amassed by the House, notwithstanding the president's complete stonewalling, his attempt to block all witnesses and all documents from the United States Congress,"" Nadler said. ""His conduct is not America first. It is Donald Trump first."" Blocked so far in their drive to persuade the Republican-led Senate to let them call new witnesses, Democrats are using their time instead to outline an extensive narrative, complete with video clips, based on the testimony presented during hearings in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, made a fresh appeal on Thursday for Republican senators to join with Democrats in voting to allow witnesses and new evidence to be presented in the trial. Republicans control the 100-seat Senate. Four of the Senate's 53 Republicans would have to join the Democrats in order to win a simple majority vote. ""The issue of relevant evidence, documents and witnesses is going to come back up. And Senate Republicans will have the power to bring that evidence into the trial,"" Schumer told reporters. ""Republican senators — four of them, it's in their hands — can make this trial more fair, if they want to,"" he said. The case focuses on Trump's request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, a top contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election, and Biden's son on unsubstantiated corruption allegations. Trump also asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a discredited theory beneficial to Russia that Ukraine was somehow linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server during the 2016 U.S. election. Last year, Trump temporarily withheld $391 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, which Democrats say was leverage for his demands. Trump's own intelligence agencies repeatedly debunked the theory, but Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, continued to push it and pursue it. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff talked about the fact many people blamed Giuliani for the theory, but suggested it demonstrates how Trump poses a grave danger to the United States.  Watch that moment from today's proceedings: During the evening arguments, Rep. Zoe Lofgren continued to walk the Senate through Trump's holding of the aid, at one point, producing an email that suggested Trump was clearly behind the hold, and that it was being concealed. Watch that part of her argument:  Trump is almost certain to be acquitted by the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office. Even if finding Trump guilty seems to be a long shot for Democrats, the trial presents an opportunity to inflict political damage on Trump ahead of the November election, with millions of Americans watching the televised proceedings. Trump, who arrived back in Washington on Wednesday night from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, condemned the proceedings as ""unfair & corrupt"" in a Twitter post on Thursday. Signs emerged on the second day of arguments that the Democratic case was losing some of the public's attention. There were empty seats in the gallery overlooking the Senate floor. Television ratings were down. About 8.9 million viewers watched the first day of arguments on Wednesday, falling short of the roughly 11 million who watched on Monday, according to Nielsen ratings data. Senators also showed increasing signs of restlessness, with many wandering to the rear of the chamber where they could check their phones and make calls. While it remains a long shot for Democrats to secure Trump's removal through impeachment, the trial gives them a venue to inflict political damage on him ahead of the November election, with millions of Americans watching the televised proceedings. Before Thursday's arguments began, some Republican senators said they had heard nothing new in the presentation made by the Democratic managers and had already decided to vote for acquittal. The Senate's schedule means Trump's defence team, a group of White House lawyers and outside counsel who will be given three days for rebuttal to the Democratic opening arguments, would likely start to present their case on Saturday. Sekulow said it was unclear whether the Trump defence would need all three days. ""We will make a determination on our presentation based on what we are responding to and based on our affirmative case,"" Sekulow said. ""I don't know if it will take 10 hours, 14 hours, 24 hours or six hours.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/impeachment-democrats-trump-1.5437770,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/donald-trump-impeachment-key-figures-1.5433966 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-impeachment-trial-not-like-other-trials-1.5435602 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-says-trump-had-knowledge-of-ukraine-pressure-1.5428900,N/A
83,Ashley Burke,2020-01-24T01:04:23.048Z,TSB chair calls on Iran to take swift action on Flight PS752's black boxes,"Transportation Safety Board Chair Kathy Fox said today Iran needs to take action soon and make arrangements to analyze the black boxes from the crash of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 that killed 176 people. ""I think we're getting close to the end of what would be considered a reasonable period,"" Fox told CBC News regarding the flight recorders. ""There's obviously a lot of interest in what's on them. I think they need to take action sooner rather than later, given that we're already more than just two weeks past the time of the accident."" Iran admitted it ""mistakenly"" shot down the jet on Jan. 8 over the capital Tehran, just hours after Iran's forces fired missiles at Iraqi bases where U.S. troops were stationed. The attack was in retaliation for the U.S. killing a high-ranking Iranian military general. Of those who died in the crash, 57 were Canadian citizens and 29 were permanent residents. It's been more than two weeks since investigators started sifting through the wreckage of the airliner. But Iran still hasn't said where and when the plane's recorders will be downloaded and analyzed — a key piece of the puzzle in the search for answers, said Fox. Iran has asked Canada to help with the analysis of the flight recorders and two experienced TSB specialists are on standby to deploy. ""The issue here is we don't know if the data has been damaged,"" said Fox. ""I think the Iranians still prefer, if they can, to download the recorders in Iran. But if they're not able to, they wanted to assess the capability of the lab in Kyiv."" The plane's aircraft flight data and cockpit voice recorders are still in Iran, said the TSB. Fox said it's understandable that Iran would want to hang on to the recorders, since it's leading the investigation and the crash happened on it's territory. But if Iran doesn't have the capacity to analyze the black boxes, the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) rules say they have to send them to someone who does. ""Under ICAO they're supposed to dispatch those recorders under their custody and control to another state who can do it without delay,"" she said. Iran has granted Canada more access to the investigation than required under international aviation conventions. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the TSB are pushing for a higher level of accreditation to allow Canada to participate in all aspects of the investigation, to ensure the process is thorough and transparent.  Fox said that Iran is not sharing everything with the TSB about the case, but it is sharing ""a lot more information"" than it's technically required to deliver. ""They've been very collaborative and cooperative in sharing the information that they can,"" she said. Two TSB investigators travelled to Tehran after the crash and spent six days on the ground visiting the crash site, inspecting the wreckage and meeting with Iranian officials. This week, the TSB team spent two days in Kyiv for joint meetings with Ukrainian and Iranian investigators that included Iran assessing Ukraine's facility to analyze the plane's recorders. Fox said those two TSB investigators are headed back to Canada soon with details. But the TSB is only allowed to release information that Iran approves. It's not unusual for countries that don't have the facilities to analyze black boxes to send the recorders abroad. After the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014, the Dutch Safety Board conducted the investigation but the black boxes were analyzed in the United Kingdom. After a deadly crash involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019, the recorders were downloaded in France. ""That's very common practice,"" said Fox.  Fox said investigators need a lab with sophisticated computers to analyze the recorders, which are roughly the size of bread boxes. When the aircraft flight data or cockpit voice recorders are damaged, the lab may need additional equipment. The U.S.-based electronics firm Honeywell, in this case, made the parts for the recorders, said Fox. Fox said that, according to the international rules, the crash probe will not lay blame.

No reason was given for Bill Abbott's departure, and no replacement was immediately named. In a statement, Mike Perry, president and CEO of Hallmark Cards, said that with immense competition from TV networks and streaming services, it is important for the company to find ""relevant new ways to grow our business."" Abbott was CEO of Crown Media Family Networks, a company controlled by Hallmark Cards. Crown Media's flagship cable channel is The Hallmark Channel, known for family-friendly programming, particularly made-for-TV Christmas-themed movies. In December, the Hallmark Channel's decision to pull an ad featuring the same-sex couple led to an outcry online. The company later reversed the decision.

85,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-06-03T16:11:59.509Z,'Appalling treatment': Couple in wheelchairs left alone for almost 12 hours at Vancouver airport,"The son of an elderly couple says he wants two major airlines to stop blaming each other and take responsibility for abandoning his parents in their wheelchairs for half a day, with no help to access food, water or a washroom. Mohan Karki's parents, who don't speak English and require assistance to travel, were found almost 12 hours after being dropped off at a service counter at the Vancouver airport — just not by the airlines responsible for assisting them during their trip, WestJet and Cathay Pacific.  ""We were thinking they were somewhere in the corner of the airport ... not knowing where to go,"" said Karki. ""My parents told me, 'We never left this place' … 12 hours they were there. They tried to communicate with some other people, passersby, and nobody responded to them. Maybe they couldn't understand what they were saying."" On Feb. 23, Chhaya and Narayan Karki, aged 66 and 69, were on the final leg of a trip from their home in Kathmandu, Nepal, to visit their son and his family in Edmonton, with a stopover in Vancouver.  Mohan Karki said Cathay Pacific told him it delivered his parents to the WestJet customer service counter at the airport, and WestJet was to transport the pair to the gate for their final flight to Edmonton.  When his parents failed to arrive, a worried Karki spent hours on the phone trying to track them down. They didn't have a cellphone. ""For about six or seven hours, I kept on calling both airlines, but they never found my parents,"" he said.  Karki then called the RCMP. It took officers 20 minutes to find the couple, located just steps from the service counter. The couple had placards with Karki's name and phone number, in case of an emergency. No one responded when they tried to get help by holding them up, he said. According to an Ontario-based advocate for people with disabilities, services for those who need assistance travelling are ""unreliable and inconsistent"" because airlines are allowed to set their own rules — instead of being told to meet specific standards. ""It is appalling treatment … the regulator should make it clear that [airlines] can't pass the buck to each other,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. Thanh Phan shares that frustration; the same thing happened to his 76-year-old mother at the same airport. In August, Niem Thi Le, who has trouble walking and doesn't speak English, was left in a wheelchair for eight hours after being dropped off at the wrong departure gate by WestJet. Le was on her way home to Hanoi, Vietnam, after visiting family in Victoria. WestJet was supposed to connect her with China Southern Airlines for her next flight. ""My mom told me that the wheelchair attendant just left her there without talking to anyone.… I was shocked … this is a human being,"" Phan said. An employee with another airline eventually noticed Le sitting alone, found someone who could speak Vietnamese and brought the woman to the China Southern Airlines counter. That airline contacted Phan and suggested he call WestJet to find out what happened. He did, asking if someone could help his mother until he could get there himself. ""I said, 'Could you please help her give her some food and drinks.'... They said, no, they didn't do anything wrong and that's not their business,"" Phan said. He called China Southern Airlines back and it agreed to help, bringing Le a hamburger and a drink. Phan complained to customer service and WestJet apologized, saying it would review its internal process. But he said the airline never got back to him to explain what happened. WestJet also told him travellers who don't speak English shouldn't be travelling alone, he said, though they offered him a $100 travel voucher. ""It's very frustrating because they blame passengers, and they did not think that is a serious problem."" Both Phan and Karki are still demanding an explanation from the airlines involved in their respective cases.  ""We sincerely apologize for the stress and worry that these guests and their families experienced,"" WestJet's media relations manager Lauren Stewart wrote in an email to Go Public. ""The nature of these incidents is serious, and we are in touch with both airline partners involved to investigate and make enhancements to our processes to prevent this type of incident from happening again. We are also reaching out to the families involved.""  The airline says it provides mobility assistance to more than 900 guests per day. Cathay Pacific told Go Public it was sorry to hear what happened to the Karkis, adding it followed ""standard operating procedure"" when it delivered the couple to WestJet staff and exchanged wheelchairs. ""The proper turnover to WestJet was made by our staff. Additionally, we are in the process of reviewing this situation with WestJet and we will apply learnings from this experience to future transitions between our airlines,"" wrote Julie Jarratt, the airline's communications director. Lepofsky, who is blind, said he's had his own problems travelling. ""I dread entering Canadian airspace if I'm travelling alone … not because the service is always bad, but because it's not reliably and consistently good."" Airlines have a duty to accommodate passengers with disabilities under Canada's human rights laws, he said. But when that doesn't happen, it's tough to figure out where to turn for help. ""There are multiple agencies involved,"" Lepofsky said. ""The Canadian Human Rights Commission, the Canadian Transportation Agency — and you could be kicked from one to the other, trying to figure out where you're supposed to go. ""The Canadian Transportation Agency, where you're often kicked to, does not, from the perspective of people with disabilities, have a good track record in this area."" The CTA says it's aware some of the standards are out of date and a binding set of rules is needed. Until now, accessible transportation has been governed by mostly voluntary codes of practice.  The agency has proposed new accessible transportation regulations for airlines and all travel providers. The new rules would be legally binding and impose penalties up to $25,000 for non-compliance. And if another proposed law passes, the Accessible Canada Act, that fine could jump to a maximum of $250,000. ""They need to make sure that passengers don't fall between the cracks,"" said Scott Streiner, chair and CEO of the Canadian Transportation Agency. Under the CTA's proposed rules, airlines would have to provide people who need assistance a place to wait, near personnel who can assist them and will ""periodically inquire"" about the person's needs. Airports would be responsible for providing assistance from curbside to check-in, while the airlines would be responsible from check-in to boarding.  Streiner said the proposed recommendations would have helped in both cases. The agency plans to have the final regulations published before summer and hopes to have the majority of requirements in place in about a year. ""Persons who require wheelchair assistance, including older Canadians, absolutely are covered by these regulations,"" Streiner said. ""We want to make sure that there's no confusion about who's providing assistance and that people aren't left without assistance."" As for Karki, he said that the next time his parents visit, he won't leave them in the hands of the airlines. Instead, he'll try to match their itinerary with other Nepali-speaking travellers. After hearing from Go Public, WestJet called Karki last week, promising an explanation once it looks into what went wrong. Phan said WestJet has yet to follow up with him, adding that his mother is now afraid to travel and will no longer come visit.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

86,David Morley,2019-12-30T09:00:00.675Z,Millions of children in need of humanitarian assistance heading into new year,"This column is an opinion by David Morley, president and CEO of UNICEF Canada. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. We are entering the final year of what has been one of the worst decades for children. War, disease and extreme weather events are robbing them of their right to simply be a kid – to have a safe, healthy and carefree childhood. In far too many communities around the world, sounds of youngsters laughing and getting into mischief are being replaced by silence. It doesn't have to be that way. This month, UNICEF launched Humanitarian Action for Children 2020, a report on the world's emergencies. It highlights some of the key challenges children are facing around the world: severe malnutrition, conflict, infectious disease, climate change, and access to education. Children displaced by crises are also vulnerable to increased harm, including gender-based violence, recruitment as soldiers, exploitation, and trafficking. The sheer magnitude of the situation is heartbreaking. The report identifies 59 million children in 64 countries who are living in crisis zones and in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 2 million children with disabilities. These are the highest levels since we began keeping records. The projections for the year ahead are just as dire. The main causes are threefold – conflict, climate change and major outbreaks of disease. The number of armed conflicts is at a three-decade high, with many civil wars engulfing entire countries. More than 30 million children are caught in the middle. Yemen has been a battleground for more than four years. Fighting has been going on for six years in both the Central African Republic and South Sudan. Syria's civil war is now in its ninth year. And these conflicts have no end in sight. Some have lasted so long that many kids are growing up only knowing war. Top priorities in these war-torn regions include providing children with protection, safe water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. And the need is great. In the coming year, for example, UNICEF expects it will need to treat 5.1 million children for acute malnutrition, provide 4.5 million children and caregivers with mental health and psychosocial support, and distribute emergency cash assistance to 1.7 million families to meet their most urgent needs. Immediate responses to crises in the year ahead must also be balanced with the longer-term needs of children, most importantly their education, which is also under attack. During disasters, schools are often used as shelters or distribution centres, since they are usually among the strongest structures. In conflict zones, they are increasingly becoming targets. More than 3,000 schools have been closed in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in the past three years because of violence and insecurity. Kids are incredibly adaptable, but in any emergency, getting them back into a classroom as quickly as possible is essential. Education to help them reach their potential is obviously important, but letting them be with their friends in a safe space also gives them a return to normalcy. As if wars and conflict weren't enough, millions of children are also threatened by outbreaks of highly contagious and dangerous diseases. Major outbreaks are now hitting the most vulnerable in conflict zones, greatly complicating the ability of aid agencies to respond. The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the second-largest ever recorded and the first to occur in the middle of a conflict zone. There are 3,000 confirmed cases, including more than 900 children. Measles has also become a threat to children despite safe and affordable vaccines. As with any public health campaign for children, educating the adult decision-makers is the key to eliminating this deadly threat. Climate change is also affecting the most vulnerable. More than 500 million children live in areas that have experienced extreme flooding, while 160 million live in regions that are subject to severe drought. And the number of extreme weather events keeps rising. Mozambique was hit by back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, for example, and rebuilding will take years. Regions like the Sahel in Africa, where livelihoods rely on agriculture, grazing and fishing, are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. Solutions demand a long-term commitment. The positive news is that humanitarian organizations have made tremendous progress working with host governments in areas likely to experience extreme weather and flooding, helping to build more resilient communities and better prepare for disasters. Still, the threats children are facing are overwhelming. The amount of funding for emergencies that UNICEF projects it will need in 2020 is $4.2 billion US, a staggering 3.5 times the amount required in 2010, underscoring how frightening the world has become for young people. But as someone who has worked in the international humanitarian sector for going on four decades, I refuse to be discouraged. We cannot give up. The international community, governments and civil society need to come together to protect and defend children's rights. The government of Canada is playing a global leadership role in prioritizing education for children in conflict zones and other protracted humanitarian crises. But as a nation we must do more to help children around the world. People in this country clearly care about children's welfare. I am confident Canadians will rise to the challenge and defend, for every child everywhere, the right to a safe and healthy childhood.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-child-welfare-1.5367654,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/yemen-war-saudis-houthis-1.5373868 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/unhcr-refugee-forum-1.5398929 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/mali-violence-massacre-children-1.5171664 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/mali-mission-1.5272076 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/violence-against-health-workers-worsening-measles-outbreak-in-congo-1.5377716 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-1.5212584 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-who-cdc-1.5385508 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/un-emissions-report-1.5373154 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/zimbabwe-wfp-food-aid-1.5382107,N/A
87,Chantelle Bellrichard,2020-01-21T20:24:18.942Z,Over-representation of Indigenous people in federal prisons reaches 'disturbing' historic high,"The over-representation of Indigenous people in federal custody has reached a new historic high, according to a statement released Tuesday by the Office of the Correctional Investigator.  In the statement, Correctional Investigator of Canada Ivan Zinger described the continuing trend of the increasing number and proportion of Indigenous people in federal prisons as ""disturbing"" and called for bold and urgent actions from corrections and government.  Indigenous people account for roughly five per cent of the population in Canada, but when it comes to federal custody Zinger said they now account for more than 30 per cent of the federal inmate population, up from 25 per cent four years ago.  Indigenous women now account for 42 per cent of women in federal custody.  Zinger said despite the findings of royal commissions and national inquiries, court interventions and political promises, over the last three decades, ""no government of any stripe has managed to reverse the trend of Indigenous over-representation in Canadian jails and prisons."" ""The Indigenization of Canada's prison population is nothing short of a national travesty,"" he wrote.   There are many layers of historical and contemporary factors at play when it comes to understanding why Indigenous people may be more likely to be criminalized, according to Zinger.  But once an individual comes into the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), he said the service needs to accept its share of responsibility in the overrepresentation instead of recusing itself from responsibility.  Zinger said, for example, that Indigenous people are more likely than others to be placed in maximum security institutions, serve higher proportions of their sentences behind bars before getting out on parole and are also returned to custody at much higher rates that non-Indigenous people.  ""In failing to close the outcomes gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders, the federal correctional system makes its own unique and measureable contribution to the problem of over-representation,"" said Zinger in the release.  Zinger said overall there's been a decline in the number of people in prisons but that since April 2010 the Indigenous population in prisons has increased by 43.4 per cent. In comparison, the non-Indigenous prison population has declined in that same time period by 13.7 per cent.  Zinger is now calling on CSC to make ""dramatic changes"" to help reduce the over-representation and for the federal government to take a leadership role in directing those changes.  CBC reached out to CSC for comment, and was passed on to Public Safety Canada. Jordan Crosby, director of parliamentary affairs for the ministry, said in an emailed statement, ""we know there's much more work to do."" ""The overrepresentation of Indigenous people in correctional institutions is an unacceptable situation that we are working very hard to address."" Crosby said several actions have been taken by government in the past four years to address the situation including legislative changes that are meant to streamline the bail system, investments to support reintegration of previously-incarcerated Indigenous people and the opening of a new healing lodge in Winnipeg.  He also mentioned government commitments to expand diversion programs and the plan to introduce legislation to implement the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Patricia Barkaskas, director of the Indigenous Community Legal Clinic in Vancouver, said the continued trend of increasing over-representation is not surprising.  In her view, Zinger's newly released figures are evidence that ""the Canadian state continues to ignore its role in criminalizing Indigenous Peoples and creating this situation and not addressing it. ""Indigenous people aren't the problem, it's the system. It's Canada's colonial system,"" she said. She said government and institutions often point to the Gladue ruling as a way to remedy over-representation by taking into consideration the influence of things such as residential schools, the Sixties Scoop or child welfare system on Indigenous offenders, but said it's not being implemented properly and in some cases isn't being applied at all.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indigenous-overrepresentation-prison-oci-statement-1.5434712,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-edition-1.5434678/soaring-rates-of-indigenous-people-in-prison-unacceptable-says-federal-watchdog-1.5434693 https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/locked-up-at-12,N/A

The city is looking downtown, at the intersection of Fitzroy and Great George, and where the Confederation Trail crosses Longworth Avenue. Public works manager Scott Adams said there have been public complaints about the intersection, and police have also expressed safety concerns. ""Some of the issues are some speeds with vehicles, vehicles not yielding for pedestrians to cross and drivers maybe not being able to see the pedestrians waiting to cross the road,"" Adams said. The public works department has recommended to council that changes be made, and wants to hire a consultant for the final design. The design could include medians at both locations, which tend to slow drivers down, and create a visual cue for drivers to pay closer attention. ""We also call it a pedestrian refuge,"" Adams said. ""It just gives them a safer spot. If something does end up happening, it just gives them ... a little bit of a safety net that they can stop and wait there."" Extending the curb more out into the street is also being considered at Fitzroy and Great George. The idea is to make waiting pedestrians more visible, said Adams, as they would be out past the parked cars.

The ministry has yet to respond to a follow-up question about what and how old those indicators are.  Algonquin Anishinabeg Grand Chief Verna Polson says the population data the ministry is using is years out of date.  ""My understanding is the last time they did a study was 20 years ago,"" said Polson. ""It's so outdated that we need to be part of the decision making now."" The ministry has announced that it is carrying out an aerial survey of moose in the reserve this winter in collaboration with the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council.  Desmarais also said the reduction of the sport hunt this winter will help facilitate that survey.  ""The MFFP is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the Algonquin chiefs and shares the same objectives with regard to the importance of ensuring the conservation of the resource and it's sustainability for present and future generations,"" said Desmarais. Other measures could be put in place moving forward based on the results of the population survey, she said.  Last week, the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council issued a press release saying chiefs were disappointed by Quebec's refusal to act on a moratorium and said it will continue to push for one.  Verna Polson said her officials are cooperating with government officials for the aerial survey.  ""Our nation is ready and willing to work in collaboration,"" she said.

90,Lien Yeung,2020-01-23T13:00:00.209Z,Everything is a metaphor: Here's what to eat and avoid at Chinese New Year dinner,"Chinese New Year is a celebration filled with metaphors and superstitions aimed at ushering in as much good luck as possible. That begins at the dinner table for many Chinese families. Here is the meaning and significance behind some of those traditions. A conscious effort is made to have an even number of dishes on the table at Chinese New Year, which typically begins on the occasion's eve. The belief is that good things come in pairs and odd numbers signify death. ""Number eight, number 12 — as long as it's a round number it's nice,"" explained Lee Man a food critic and cultural guide. ""Number seven is the one to avoid."" Like 13, it's considered unlucky. And order lots because the goal is to reflect the hope for an overabundance of food and blessings for the upcoming year. Popular Cantonese-style dishes at Chinese New Year are ones that have auspicious names. A variation of braised dried oysters, sea moss, and pig's tongue, or fat choy ho see sun lei, is a common choice. ""It actually means money, enterprise, and everything coming easily to you all year so whatever you try out will be a success,"" says Man.  Oysters are also desirable because they resemble ancient gold nuggets known as sycee. Watch CBC's Lien Yeung and food critic Lee Man look at what makes up a Chinese New Year feast:  At home, many families will steam fish and chicken but they're always served whole, says Man, to represent togetherness. The heads and tails are left on because ""beak-to-tail means good beginning and good endings."" If you've got nautical roots, don't turn the fish over even after you've removed the bones to ward off any suggestion of a boat capsizing. Those who are pious tend to go vegetarian on New Year's Day. But even then, dishes like bamboo pith-wrapped enoki mushrooms and egg white pockets or Buddha's veggie feast are filled with references for prosperity. ""Even though you're vegetarian, you're pure of heart, you still want money,"" says Man. ""Those little packets represent old fashioned coin purses."" On the second day of the New Year, many families feast again. But dinner happens after making an offering of gratitude for the previous year to Buddha, the money god or ancestors. Roasted pork is commonly used for the ritual but hand-roasted suckling pig that's been rubbed in spices and sauces is an extravagant alternative. For dessert, sweet and sticky year cake, is served typically only during this time of year. Made from glutinous rice flour, the name leen goh offers the promise of reaching heights. To ensure an auspicious New Year, there are specific dishes that most families tend to avoid. Man says they never order squash. ""Because squash, or gwa, sounds like death,"" he says. Squid and crab are also foods to stay away from. Stir-fried squid is slang for getting fired. When it comes to crab, the Cantonese pronunciation sounds too much like a depressing sigh of exasperation — hai. None of these are rules though, every family celebrates and honours the tradition in different ways. What is universal, is the hope for good health and wealth for all.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/chinese-new-year-celebrations-eat-avoid-1.5435571,[],N/A

Hajdu said five or six people are being monitored in Canada, including at least one in Vancouver and another Quebec. She said one person was cleared of having the virus, but health officials are monitoring the others. ""At this point, there has not been a positive case in Canada,"" Hajdu told reporters ahead of a meeting of Liberal MPs on Parliament Hill on Thursday. ""The risk is low to Canadians.""

Meanwhile, the head of Quebec's public health authority said in fact five people in that province are currently under surveillance for possible exposure. The five, from the Montreal and Quebec City areas, had travelled to China ""and have a history that could be compatible with the fact they could have been exposed,"" Horacio Arruda said. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Canada's three major airports have updated the messages on flight information displays to remind travellers to inform border officers if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms. People who have been to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, will leave the airports with information in English, French and Chinese on what to do if they do experience symptoms in the next 14 days, Tam said. At least 17 people have died in China. Wuhan is under quarantine as health officials scramble to understand the mysterious disease and keep it from spreading. The World Health Organization is contemplating whether to declare a global health emergency because of the disease, which has infected at least 500 people in China, with cases popping up in other countries as well. Hajdu said the federal government is working with international partners to identify the disease and determine next steps. People flying into Canada from overseas are being encouraged to self-report if they are experiencing any flu-like symptoms.

92,Brian Higgins,2020-01-22T19:04:41.683Z,Retired sheriff and former TV host faces new sex charges,"A former cable TV host and retired court house sheriff now faces 17 criminal charges —  most involving alleged sexual offences against a child under 16. William Acorn, 83, of Charlottetown was originally charged last fall, as a result of an investigation by the major crime unit of Charlottetown police into a historical sexual assault complaint. Those charges included sexual assault, sexual touching and invitation to sexual touching. Four new charges, including sexual assault, were laid Nov. 20 by Charlottetown police. They involve the same alleged victim as the previous charges. All of the alleged incidents involving that victim took place between 2009 and 2014. At a brief court hearing Wednesday in Charlottetown provincial court, defence lawyer Brendan Hubley appeared on Acorn's behalf. It was the first court date for the case, since police filed the additional charges.  Hubley told Judge John Douglas that electronic equipment had been seized and is currently being analyzed by police.  Crown prosecutor Nathan Beck told the judge the prosecutor's office does not know when the analysis will be complete. Acorn is also charged with secretly making a video recording for a sexual purpose. That incident, alleged to have taken place in 2017 according to court documents, involved three victims. In addition, he is charged with making a death threat against the child victim, and with improper storage of a firearm. That firearm was a Smith and Wesson revolver, according to court documents. Acorn was known for hosting Bill's Country Jamboree, a P.E.I. cable television show that ran for 25 years. He worked as a deputy sheriff in the provincial courts until his retirement. Acorn has not entered pleas on any of the charges, and the charges have not been proven in court. He did not attend court Wednesday. The case was adjourned to Jan. 30.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-bill-acorn-sexual-assault-charges-1.5344636 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-sewer-clog-charlottetown-1.5435153,N/A

There would still be 125 MNAs in the legislature. Of them, 80 would represent ridings, elected by majority vote. The remaining 40 MNAs would be chosen from regional lists. Voters would have to cast two ballots. Hearings into the CAQ's proposed legislation, Bill 39, began Wednesday in Quebec City. Sonia LeBel, the CAQ minister responsible for electoral reform, said the proposal attempts to strike a balance. ""It's to make sure that everybody is well represented,"" she said. ""Ultimately, this is not Montreal against the rest of Quebec. It's to make sure that we have more accurate representations of all the thoughts and philosophies at the [National Assembly]."" Bill 39 also requires voters to approve the plan in a referendum likely to coincide with the next provincial election, set for 2022. Both Québec Solidaire and the Parti Québécois have hinted they will support the bill, but they want to see some changes first. On Wednesday, QS unveiled two proposed amendments that would dramatically strengthen the gender parity provisions in the bill. The party wants the names on regional party lists to alternate between those of male and female candidates, to ensure gender parity. QS also wants parties to lose 10 per cent of their public funding if they fail to meet gender parity quotas and receive a 20 per cent boost if they exceed them. The party's house leader, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, said the electoral reform bill represents a unique opportunity for the province to address the longstanding issue of under-representation of women in politics.  ""We can't let this opportunity slip through our fingers,"" he said.  The CAQ promised in the last election campaign to reform the electoral system and introduce proportional representation. If the proposal goes through, Quebec would become the first province to adopt a system of mixed proportional representation. Other provinces, including British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, have tried to introduce electoral reform. In both cases, voters opted against the proposal in referendums. The federal Liberals under Justin Trudeau also promised before their first term to make changes but walked away from the commitment.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-electoral-reform-1.5436121,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/caq-electoral-reform-1.4850951,N/A
94,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:39:39.620Z,Boeing CEO says company won't scrap 737 Max,"Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun told reporters Wednesday the U.S. planemaker expects to resume 737 Max production months before its forecasted mid-year return to service, adding that it did not plan to suspend or cut its dividend. The company announced a production halt in December, when the global grounding of the fast-selling 737 Max following two deadly crashes in five months looked set to last into mid-2020. Calhoun said the company isn't considering scrapping the Max and expects it will continue to fly for a generation. He also said it won't launch a marketing campaign to get customers to get back on 737 Max planes. He disclosed that Boeing is starting with a ""clean sheet of paper"" on a new midsize airplane but it is not clear if the company is scrapping the existing design. The company said on Tuesday it now expects regulators to approve the plane's return to service in the middle of the year. Calhoun said he did not see recent issues raised about wiring or software as ""serious problems."" Boeing shares fell about 1.4 per cent on Wednesday, rebounding from earlier lows during the day. Calhoun said Boeing isn't planning to cut or suspend its dividend, because the company has the ""financial capacity and capability to do the things we need to do."" The CEO said he ""will stay on that path unless something dramatic changes."" Calhoun declined to provide a specific date for resumption of production, but said it ""will be reinvigorated months before that moment in June, because we have to get that line started up again."" He also said the company would make some changes to the 737 Max production line to make it more efficient. Calhoun said the company ""will slowly, steadily bring our production rate up a few months before that date in the middle of the year."" He said the company was not planning to lay off any employees because of the latest delay in the Max. The latest push back in the forecasted return to service is due to the company's decision to endorse simulator training for pilots before they resume flights, he said. ""We can get this thing back on its horse and we will,"" he added. Calhoun was a director at Boeing for a decade before taking over as chief executive earlier this month. The board ousted Dennis Muilenburg in December amid rising anger among regulators, politicians and customers. He said the company should have not have repeatedly revised the plane's forecasted return. ""It was hard for anybody to trust us,"" Calhoun said. Calhoun said before certification there will be ""a few more things somewhere along the way that the FAA and us will determine need a little extra work and we'll do it. They won't be big emergencies things, they won't be things that take the airplane down.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-will-not-scrap-737-max-1.5436552,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/boeing-737-max-grounded-until-summer-1.5435040,N/A

Over 200 people were on the lift when the outage began just after 7 p.m.  Eric Gervais, a ski patroller and teacher from Sutton, Que., said he only managed to do one run on the hill before he got stuck on the lift. Four-and-a-half hours passed before he was able to get off. ""It's frustrating because there was no communication before they started evacuation,"" he told CBC Montreal's Daybreak.  ""It took too long."" Gervais said he was in a protected gondola, but people in chairs ""completely froze in the wind."" ""Just think about a mother with kids on a chairlift in the wind. To me, this isn't a regular operation."" After a couple of hours, once they realized only eight staffers were trying to evacuate hundreds of people, Gervais and his friends called the Bromont fire department from a cell phone to see if they could assist. ""They said that all the staff of the fire department was ready to go to help at Bromont,"" he said. ""But nobody called them."" Watch one of the evacuations in the video below: Because the ski hill is on private property, the fire department said it couldn't go unless called by management. ""What, if we start a fire in the gondola, you'll come?"" Gervais asked them. ""[They said] 'yes, but until that happens, I need the ski hill [to grant permission].'"" Eventually, staff from the ski hill came and evacuated the gondola, using cables and a harness to get Gervais and his group to the ground. Gervais said the staff was efficient and professional, but it took too long for the ski hill to decide to evacuate. Marc-André Meunier, the director of marketing and communications at Ski Bromont, said the proper procedure was followed. ""When we make the decision to go to manual evacuations, there's no turning back,"" he said. Meunier said that because they knew evacuations would take hours, ""before taking that call, you want to be sure that you've tried everything to start the engine."" He said that they were comfortable waiting an hour-and-a-half before starting the evacuations since the weather was relatively warm. Meunier said that if it had been colder, they would have evacuated the hill sooner. The evacuation itself took time because people had to be taken down one by one, he said.

96, KRISTA BRODA,2020-01-20T12:48:49.717Z,"After 10 years in Regina, I've realized there's nowhere else I'd rather be","I recently marked a decade since I became an honourary Saskatchewanian. My younger self would never have believed it. I was lucky enough to be raised on Vancouver Island. I had never owned a winter jacket or heard of a block heater and I could go an entire summer without a mosquito bite. There was no greater thrill than waking up to hear school was cancelled because there was snow in the forecast. It was paradise.  Having family from coast to coast allowed me to travel throughout Canada. I was always proud that I had been to ""every province in Canada, except Saskatchewan."" People understood. I had seen all of the provinces that needed to be seen. As anybody not from Saskatchewan would tell you, I wasn't missing much.  In August 2009, I happened to be in Calgary for a football game when the Riders came to town. At this point, I only knew of one person from Saskatchewan I had met in my entire life. They were like mythical creatures to me. Every once in a while there was a wholesome story in the news, or some obscure town was named the Coldest Place on Earth for a day, but Saskatchewanians were rarely seen out of their natural habitat.  That August long weekend, Rider fans descended on McMahon Stadium by the thousands. They were loud, they were green, and they made sure that everybody knew exactly where they came from. I had never seen anything like it.  Sitting next to me in Section X was a charming guy that had just driven in from Regina. Between his chirps at Henry Burris, he proudly told me he grew up in the village of Grayson, population 167. His dad was a farmer and his hometown was having a fundraiser soon to raise money for a new curling rink. He was every cliché I had ever known about the province. I was in love with him by half time.  My first trip to Saskatchewan came a month later for the Labour Day Classic. My expectations were very low.  My new love had made a bold claim that Regina's Italian Star Deli has the best sandwiches in the world. If nothing else, I'd at least get a half-decent meal.  He also told me that Taylor Field was fun and the pink lemonades were second to none, but it was really old, very cramped and the bathrooms didn't have hot water. He severely downplayed the magic that happened inside those crumbling walls.  My first time at the old stadium would easily make the top five best days of my life. I had never experienced an atmosphere so electric and so fun. I met dozens of people that day, each one more friendly and welcoming than the last.  I remember thinking to myself several times throughout the game that people are really lucky to live here but, oddly enough, everybody seemed to already know that. They truly believed that they lived in one of the best places in Canada. After that weekend, I was starting to believe it too.  After a few more trips to Regina — and more Italian Star Deli sandwiches than I'd like to admit — I started to pick up on the quirks that maybe only an outsider could see.  The language they spoke was different than other provinces. I had a lot of questions about grid roads and sloughs and RMs (rural municipalities), and why everyone gave me a two-finger wave over their steering wheel as soon as I left a paved road.  When winter arrived, I remember asking why perfectly good extension cords were littering the parking lots. I soon learned those were just Saskatchewan snow snakes.  The people of Saskatchewan are as unique as the sunsets. I couldn't get enough. I had fallen in love with the province and the province loved me back. It felt like home.  On Nov. 30, 2009 – the day after the heartbreaking Grey Cup loss – I made the biggest and greatest decision of my life. I moved to Regina.  I went on to marry that charming small town boy from Section X of McMahon Stadium. We raise our boys here, and they love where they live as much as we do. Those over-the-top-friendly people that I met that day at Taylor Field went on to become some of my best friends.  I feel lucky to have had a front row seat to watch Regina blossom into a vibrant city full of creative entrepreneurs, world-class local shops and restaurants, and a craft beer scene that could rival anywhere in North America.  So, Saskatchewan, please consider this my thank you for welcoming me with open arms and showing me – quite literally –  how to speak your language.  There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

Amin Yussuf, 29, remains wanted on Canada-wide warrants in connection to the shooting death of 26-year-old Abubeker Gemechu Abduraman on March 24, 2019. Police believe Yussuf returned to Xhale Lounge after he was kicked out and started firing a gun into the bar. Abduraman was killed and two others were injured. Yussuf is wanted for first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder using a firearm and unauthorized possession of a firearm. Yussuf, who was first identified as a suspect in June 2019, is also known by the following aliases: Abdirizak Yussuf, Craig Yussuf, Mohemed Yussuf, Mohemed Mohamed and Mohammed Farrah. He has connections to the Northwest Territories, as well as Edmonton, Toronto and Prince Albert, Sask., said police. The investigation has given police reason to believe Yussuf may be in the N.W.T.'s Yellowknife or Hay River areas, said Edmonton Police Service spokesperson Cheryl Sheppard. ""Our investigation to date has sort of led us to that area, due to some associations that he does have there,"" Sheppard said Tuesday. She said police will post wanted flyers in the communities in a campaign that will last about six months. Sheppard reminded residents not to approach Yussuf if he's spotted, but to call 911. ""We don't expect or want anyone to engage in any confrontation with him,"" she said.  The reward is offered by the Stephan Crétier Foundation, a private charitable foundation, through a program called Bolo (standing for Be On The Lookout), which helps police seeking public assistance in serious criminal offences. Crétier is founder, chairman, president and CEO of GardaWorld Security Corporation. According to its website, Bolo uses social and mainstream media to increase exposure for most-wanted notices.

98,Anonymous,2020-01-24T05:23:46.985Z,'It was sad. Really sad': Punky the dog destroyed after years-long legal battle,"Punky, a dog whose lengthy legal battle to escape death row went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, was euthanized at a Vancouver animal shelter on Thursday.  The Australian cattle dog was ordered destroyed two years ago after a judge deemed him dangerous. Punky has been in city custody every since biting a stranger at a park in 2017. Punky had a history of aggressive behaviour and a ""willingness to bite"" that was noted by veterinarians and others who treated him as far back as 2016, according to court documents. But Punky's owner, Susan Santics, describes Punky as ""shy and reactive."" Santics tried every legal avenue to spare the dog's life. Those efforts were exhausted last week, when the Supreme Court of Canada rejected a bid to hear an appeal of the case. Santics went to the shelter Thursday morning in a last-ditch effort to save her dog, but Punky was destroyed sometime in the afternoon, Santics' lawyer Victoria Shroff said.  ""I realize they had a job to do. But it was sad. Really sad,"" she said. ""Susan is very distraught. ""We asked about whether or not she could be there to give him a hug, give him some final treats and things like that and that was not possible."" Shroff said she will now be pursuing legal reform in animal law. In the eyes of the law, pets are considered property. Shroff believes Punky's ""unprecedented"" case could be the catalyst for considering animals as sentient beings in law. ""Animals in this country deserve better and I think that there's a really good way where we can have a balancing of public safety with the regard for dog owners,"" she said. ""Even if we don't necessarily elevate the status of animals right away above property, at least we can think of them as sentient property. And we don't have to seek such measures as having them killed.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/punky-dog-destroyed-1.5438365,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/punky-dog-death-row-vancouver-supreme-court-of-canada-1.5429082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dangerous-dogs-punky-court-1.5096502,N/A

""It's about Black fathers being present, being involved with their children and doing their daughters' hair, and because [the videos] were going viral, he was like, 'I think the people want to see more representation.'"" Watch the short film Hair Love here: Cherry launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the film and was overwhelmed with donations, raising more than $300,000. The film was later picked up and distributed by Sony Pictures Animation.  Low, who is Afro-Chinese, got involved in the film because of a self-published comic she created called Tension about her own struggles with curly hair.  ""I grew up with a single mother, my Chinese mother, and she also had no idea how to handle my hair,"" Low said.  A friend who had read the comic and worked at Netflix passed it on to one of Hair Love's co-directors, Everett Downing.  ""He read my comic and he was like, 'You know what? This is something that she needs to work on. We need to bring her on the team. The themes in this comic are so much like the themes in the the short film we need to bring her on,' and so that's how I came on,"" Low said.  Although Monday's Oscar nominations created a stir for only nominating one actor of colour and no female directors —snubbing anticipated nominees like Greta Gerwig, Jennifer Lopez, Eddie Murphy, and films like The Farewell — Low says a nomination for Hair Love is a win.  ""People really crave this kind of storytelling and it benefits everybody,"" she said.  ""I really feel like a lot of people might not have considered, you know, a story about a black family relatable to the masses, but you watch it and you could find yourself in it.""

101,Isaac Olson,2020-01-24T16:23:48.986Z,TMR at odds over controversial plan to build sports complex in public park,"The Town of Mount Royal's administration has dug in its heels, refusing to pull the plug on a $48.7-million sports and community complex despite a wave of community opposition. ""They say two years to build this. Based on the size of this facility, I give it three and a half years and $75 million,"" said Peter Malouf, one of hundreds of TMR residents against the project. ""There's always going to be cost overruns and then what happens when they get the shovel in the ground? It's too late for residents to oppose it."" He's calling on the administration to rethink the project that, as presented, will take over a public park's soccer field and cost taxpayers millions to staff and maintain. Touted as TMR's first municipal building to be constructed in a half century, the plan currently calls for three pools, a water slide, a double gymnasium, dance and art studios, an indoor track and even a weight room. Malouf said he wants a smaller, less costly project that's better suited for the community's population of 21,000. And he's not alone. Back in November, 938 residents of the upscale Montreal suburb forced a referendum on the complex by signing a registry that required 931 signatures.  The town held a public meeting Thursday to present an overview of the plan ahead of the vote on Feb. 16. Mayor Philippe Roy said it's not a deluxe centre when compared to other Quebec communities, but vowed to carry out the referendum, letting the population make the final call. ""We feel it's a very good project for the community,"" said Roy. ""My hope is to convince everybody that it's a good project."" The current recreation centre and pool are in poor condition,not adapted to people with reduced mobility and require regular repairs, the town said. Residents will soon vote on the borrowing bylaw which, in September 2019, was set at $27.8 million. But with surpluses allocated and a $3 million grant secured, the requested financing has come down to $20.3 million, the town said. If residents nix the loan, the grant money will be lost and there's no alternative plan, Roy said. But some residents are concerned that if the facility is built, property taxes will rise in a community where the average single-family house in TMR is valued at roughly $1.4 million. Much of the construction cost is covered, but the loan and maintenance expenses are expected to add an average of $289 per year to property taxes. That will bring the average tax rate up to $8,508 per year. ""It's going to be about $2 a week of tax increase for the average home,"" Roy said. ""It's not too expensive."" Some residents like Louise Yoshinaka aren't worried about the tax increase. She said the mayor's administration is on the right track. TMR is an affluent area and the project is long overdue, she said, and a first-class sports centre would be an effective selling point for those looking to get top pricing for their million-dollar homes. ""It goes well with the value of our houses,"" she said.  Lyette Soucy, a volunteer member of the Association municipale de Mont-Royal which strives to improve town life, said she and the association are in favour of the complex as well. ""It's an amazing project,"" she said. ""We have a beautiful community here, but we don't have a proper sports complex."" The town predicts the building's annual operating cost will be about $1.7 million. But that's way too low, said Sophie Turpin, a TMR resident who has been involved in Quebec's aquatic sports community.  Running three pools — including a heated wading pool and water games — will create extra maintenance costs, she said. The three pools will also require extra lifeguards on duty in a time when pools are closing across the province due to a lifeguard shortage, she said. Even if the town manages to hire enough lifeguards to keep the facility open seven days a week as promised, she said salaries could run about $1.5 million a year.  A single, multi-use pool would be more affordable and require less staffing, Turpin said. Beyond the cost, residents are also frustrated with the plan to take over a heavily used green space while building a large facility that has very little parking.  After so many people voiced their opposition, longtime resident Joe Amiouny said town officials should have responded with alternative plans. He said he would have liked TMR to proposed a second, smaller option. ""This project is too big for our city,"" he said. ""Why do we need three swimming pools?""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/sports-complex-tmr-1.5438583,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/royalmount-tmr-stands-ground-1.4982054,N/A

The union also asked that a new, separate independent mediator be assigned to the case, as negotiations have been unsuccessful so far with the currently appointed mediator.  ""We continue to encourage both parties to return to the bargaining table where the provincially appointed mediator can assist parties in negotiating an agreement,"" Don Morgan, Minister of Labour Relations and Workplace Safety, said in an emailed statement. The government also re-emphasized that a provincial mediator has been in place. Morgan's statement remains unchanged, even after the union clarified it wants someone new, a government spokesperson added.  The union says it's willing to bargain, as does the Co-op Refinery Complex, but the sides have provided two seemingly opposing conditions. Co-op is adamant the union must remove fencing and what it calls ""illegal blockades"" before it returns to the bargaining table, according to Brad DeLorey, director of communications at the refinery. ""We'll take down our fencing as a sign of good faith when they get rid of all the scabs out of the camp that are doing our members' jobs,"" Scott Doherty, national representative for Unifor, said. DeLorey replied that, just as unions have a right to picket in a legal and fair manner, the refinery also has the right to continue operations with the work of replacement workers. Unifor National President Jerry Dias met with Regina's police chief Evan Bray Thursday to discuss tensions that have formed between the Co-op Refinery Complex and Unifor since about 800 refinery employees were locked out on Dec. 5, 2019. ""Chief Bray will not be holding a media scrum, but he described the meeting as productive,"" read a statement from Elizabeth Popowich, RPS spokesperson.  ""[Bray] said the two had a frank conversation focused on public safety and exchanged contact information for future communication.""  Dias said at a news conference Thursday morning that Regina Police Service officers had been violent while arresting 14 Unifor members Monday. ""Though the chief will describe Monday as an act of responsibility by the police that were there, those that were on the picket line witnesses something much differently. We witnessed violence,"" he said. ""People were pushed around. Women were pushed around. Women were told to get out of the way or they'll push them out of the way."" Dias also claimed that one Unifor members was sent to hospital and that seniors on the picket line were pushed around by police. In a Facebook video on Wednesday, Regina police chief Evan Bray denied the allegations, saying officers acted with ""respect and professionalism and patience."" Dias quoted Martin Luther King Thursday, saying the union would be doubling down on its efforts and would not surrender to rules he said systematically put working class people at a disadvantage.  ""[King] had a saying that always stuck with us. His saying was: 'One has not only a legal, but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.'""  Co-op says the arrests were the result of illegal blockades that were put up around the refinery to stop the flow of traffic. ""Unifor continues to use illegal blockades as a bullying tactic and has brought in extra people to help them to it,"" a statement released Wednesday said. ""Today's actions by Unifor represent yet another violation of the court injunction."" The dispute between the two parties mainly comes down to pensions. A previous contract included a defined benefit pension for workers. Now the refinery is moving toward a defined contribution plan. The union says this amounts to taking away workers' pensions. The refinery says it is trying to remain competitive. In the Facebook video, Bray said he's reached out to Unifor to organize a meeting with Dias. ""It is my hope that we'll be able to have a face-to-face meeting with their president and representatives in the next couple of days and ultimately get an understanding of what our role is, and obviously, what their role is and what it is they're hoping to accomplish,"" Bray said. He said the Regina Police Service's main focus is community safety and to investigate allegations of criminal complaints, of which he said there are several. Dias stressed Thursday that the only way the dispute will be resolved if if the two parties return to the bargaining table. He said that on Tuesday night, Unifor told Co-op they would be willing to ""remove and dramatically alter"" preconditions the union had. He said this was a condition that Co-op had put in place in order for the company to get back to the bargaining table. In a statement issued on Thursday, Co-op confirmed it has been in discussions with the union about returning to the bargaining table. Co-op said it has always been willing to return to the table, but won't if the blockades remain. ""The CRC has stated consistently that meaningful negotiations require Unifor to drop their pre-conditions regarding no changes to the pension plan,"" the statement said. ""In light of Unifor's escalation in the past week, and the Court of Queen's Bench orders and the recent contempt of court ruling, the CRC believes Unifor should respect the court and comply with the court order regarding access to the refinery. The Company will not return to the bargaining table while Unifor maintains an illegal blockade.""  Unifor was fined $100,000 for actions on the picket line in December of 2019. Co-op says it's pleased the union has been fined. Dias said the union will fight the ruling in court.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-police-meeting-1.5437608,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-president-jerry-dias-custody-1.5433520 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/windsor-unifor-leader-charged-regina-protests-1.5435184 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/unifor-fences-barricades-tuesday-1.5434389 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/lockout-co-op-refinery-regina-unifor-sfl-1.5436131 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/timeline-of-co-op-refinery-lockout-1.5436080 https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-189-blue-sky/clip/15756884-breaking-down-the-labour-dispute-at-reginas-co-op-refinery-amidst-increasing-tension,N/A
103,Justin McElroy,2020-01-24T18:35:18.453Z,"In Fraser Valley, transit improvements trump ride-hailing for most politicians","Ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft being approved for business throughout the Lower Mainland made plenty of news in Vancouver — but in areas where it won't be available at first, the reaction was a bit more muted. ""They'll likely move eastward depending on how successful they are.... We're so geographically spread out here,"" said Jason Lum, a Chilliwack councillor and chair of the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD), echoing the comments of a number of Lower Mainland politicians east of Surrey.  Around 11 per cent of the Lower Mainland's population is in the FVRD, mostly in Abbotsford and Chilliwack. But the transportation infrastructure and challenges can be significantly different compared to more densely populated parts of the region. ""Ride-hailing very well may become a part of the puzzle in terms of being a viable last-mile alternative,"" said Lum. ""[But] our focus here ... is building a viable public transit system that is accessible and available for as many people as we can."" To the mayor of the largest community in the Fraser Valley, that transit system should include a rail line connecting it to Metro Vancouver.  ""There will be another 800,000 people coming in the next 20 years. This isn't rocket science,"" said Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun. ""Prices are going to keep rising, so we need some radical action. I think commuter rail from Vancouver to Chilliwack, maybe even out to Hope at some point, is something that all three levels of government need to get serious about."" Braun is scheduling a meeting with Geoff Meggs, Premier John Horgan's chief of staff, to discuss the issue. He admits the idea is very preliminary, but thinks the government will be receptive because of its commitment to transit. He believes the Fraser Valley has gotten short shrift.  ""They have been talking about spending more money on infrastructure, which I always say is a code word for transit,"" said Braun. ""But it generally [goes to] just the big cities ... and midsize cities like Abbotsford and and others get left out. But we can solve so many problems if we could just get people off the highway."" Nathan Pachal, a Langley City councillor who writes extensively on transportation issues, agrees that Fraser Valley municipalities should focus less on getting ride-hailing and more on getting people out of individual-use vehicles. ""We can't build our way out of congestion on highways,"" he said, adding that Braun's initial price estimate of $8 billion for a ride line was reasonable considering other infrastructure projects the province has committed to.  ""The Massey Tunnel, the Port Mann Bridge, the Pattullo, all of those total is close to $8 billion,"" he said. ""So if we can build three bridges, I'm sure we could build a commuter rail system from Squamish to Chilliwack."" Lum welcomes the conversation around a rail line to the Valley, but said the district is focused on shorter-term projects, such as a planned expansion of the express bus so that it travels from Chilliwack to Lougheed Station, instead of terminating at Carvolth Exchange in Langley Township.  Urban planning conversations in the Fraser Valley shouldn't be fixated on building bigger links to the big city, Lum said. ""We aspire to be much more than just bedroom communities to Metro Vancouver. ""It's very important to have those regional transportation links, but just as important to focus on building complete communities out here, where people can work, live and play without having to get on a highway."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-transit-fraser-valley-metro-vancouver-1.5438376,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lyft-uber-vancouver-1.5439182 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/transit-advocates-call-for-hydrogen-trains-on-century-old-fraser-valley-rail-corridor-1.5065117,N/A
104,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-05-06T11:36:21.452Z,Brothers have the same deadly disease but only 1 gets what their parents hope is life-saving treatment,"Two young brothers, both with a deadly genetic disease, could face two very different futures because only one has access to cutting-edge medication. Andre Larocque, 8, and his younger brother, Joshua, 6, have cystic fibrosis.   The relatively rare disease leads to the destruction of the lungs and an early death for most people who have it. There is no cure. Once lung function is lost, there is no way to get it back. ""When I put them to bed at night, I hear Andre go to sleep peacefully and then I hear Josh laying awake in his bed coughing himself to sleep,"" mother Sasha Haughian said during an interview from the family's home in the small Ontario town of New Tecumseth. ""I don't know how to describe the feeling of listening to that and knowing it's just gonna get worse."" Andre is on a medication called Symdeko through a drug trial, but Joshua wasn't selected for the trial and has no access to two similar Health Canada-approved medications. That's because the Ontario government doesn't fund the drugs for the vast majority of cystic fibrosis patients and his parents can't afford to pay out of pocket. ""It's a progressive, fatal disease ... we have medication right now that more than half the population [with cystic fibrosis] could benefit from, and we're not getting access to it,"" Haughian said. About 4,200 Canadians have cystic fibrosis. There are three gene-modifying drugs available — Symdeko, Kalydeco and Orkambi — that are believed to slow down lung damage caused by the disease. Other treatments only ease symptoms. Access to all three medications is severely limited.  Unlike many other countries, Canada does not have a special process for evaluating drugs for rare diseases. Clinical trials for such drugs are limited by their small pool of potential participants. This makes proving a drug's effectiveness more difficult — which makes convincing provincial governments and private insurers to cover the cost for patients more unlikely, health advocates say. ""It's a heartbreaking situation ... These are symptoms of a larger issue, which is essentially our system was not built to evaluate and fairly assess drugs for rare diseases,"" said Kim Steele, director of government and community relations for Cystic Fibrosis Canada.  Haughian and her husband, Jamie Larocque, say Symdeko has been a life-changer for Andre since he started taking it in January 2018. While he can run around and play hockey with his friends, his younger brother's condition is deteriorating.  ""When we first found out Andre was accepted for the trial, we were so excited,"" Larocque said. ""And then after a couple days, I realized, 'Oh wait, Josh has nothing.' Now that it's been over a year, we're really starting to see Andre just shoot ahead and Josh falling behind, and that's tough."" The family and their doctor believe Orkambi would change that. But the family can't afford the annual cost of $250,000. Their private health-care plan won't pay for it either. They are desperate for Ontario to cover the medication for their younger son. They say the criteria for who qualifies for coverage are too strict.  The medication is only funded for children between the ages of six and 17 who are really sick for a long time — it's called the ""exceptional cases"" criteria. To qualify, a patient must show that they lost 20 per cent of their lung function for a six-week period over the course of six months. That's the standard in three provinces — Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. The other provinces and territories don't cover the drug at all and no province funds the drug for adults. Under the rules, less than two per cent of children with cystic fibrosis qualify for Orkambi coverage in Ontario, according to Cystic Fibrosis Canada. And Joshua isn't one of them.  The Ontario Health Ministry says it has not received any requests for coverage since the introduction of the exceptional cases criteria on Feb. 20. The board that recommends whether medications should be publicly funded is the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). It's made up of representatives from the health-care system, academia and the public. It decided there wasn't enough evidence of therapeutic value to recommend governments cover Orkambi, but provinces aren't bound by CADTH's decisions.  Steele says a lot of good medications are rejected for coverage because the testing criteria are designed for drugs that treat more common diseases and can be evaluated in large clinical trials. ""We can't do that in small populations. And so, often when our evidence goes to the table for government to look at, they say there's not enough evidence. And our problem is there's not enough people to give you the evidence that you want."" Then there is the cost.  ""It's expensive,"" Steele said. ""I'm not going to shy away from saying price is definitely a concern. However, it's very hard to put a price on life."" The three cystic fibrosis drugs are priced at about $250,000 a year in Canada. But Chris MacLeod, chair of the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Treatment Society, which advocates that patients with the disease should have access to any medication their doctor prescribes, says that doesn't reflect what the real cost would be if Canada did a better job negotiating with drug companies. He points to other countries where the drugs are available for less than half that price.  The problem, he says, is Canada does not negotiate prices with drug companies until the end of the CADTH review, so many drugs end up being rejected for coverage because of cost. In some cases, provinces won't negotiate at all, or they go it alone instead of negotiating on a national scale and buying in bulk to lower the cost. ""Canada is an outlier. We're the only developed country that either doesn't have a deal, or isn't negotiating a deal,"" MacLeod said of Orkambi. ""Quite frankly, I think it's bureaucrats that have become so baked in the system that they've lost perspective."" Meanwhile, Canadians like Joshua Larocque go without the medications they need, he said. ""It's shameful. Absolutely shameful."" MacLeod is also a lawyer and is heading up a class action lawsuit against the B.C. government, federal government, CADTH and others over the lack of funding for Orkambi. The suit claims governments are ""denying access to lifesaving drugs in a very non-transparent, non-evidence-based manner."" None of the allegations has been proven in court. In an email to Go Public, B.C.'s Ministry of Health said CADTH recommended Orkambi not be funded due to a lack of evidence on two separate occasions.  ""These recommendations are based on clinical and cost factors,"" a spokesperson said. ""And with Vertex setting the cost of Orkambi at $250,000 a year per patient, its cost is unsustainable for public and private drug plans."" In an email to Go Public, a CADTH spokesperson said that over the past five years, the agency has taken steps to clarify and enhance processes to address the unique challenges of evaluating drugs for rare diseases.  Andre and Joshua's parents have repeatedly reached out to Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott.  In October, the family asked for a meeting with Elliott. They said they were told by her office it would happen. They're still waiting to hear when, and their followup messages have gone unanswered.  As opposition health critic, Elliott criticized the government at the time for not funding Kalydeco, one of the three gene-modifying cystic fibrosis medications. The drug was later added to the coverage list in Ontario, but few patients qualify. It's a similar story with Orkambi. In February, Ontario agreed to fund the drug on a case-by-case basis under what's called the Exceptional Access Program. So far, not one cystic fibrosis patient has qualified for provincial coverage under the program's criteria, said MacLeod.   Watch: Elliott challenged the Liberal government to cover Kalydeco several years ago when she was Opposition health critic. The minister turned down a request for an interview with Go Public and didn't respond to specific questions we sent about Joshua and Andre's situation and about access to the cystic fibrosis medications, providing instead a general statement from a spokesperson.  ""Young Ontarians with rare diseases deserve every opportunity to enjoy healthy and happy childhoods,"" spokesperson Hayley Chazan wrote in an email to Go Public.  ""Orkambi, which helps treat pediatric cystic fibrosis, is currently considered for funding in Ontario in exceptional cases … consistent with clinical evidence."" Joshua and Andre's parents are still hopeful the federal government will deliver on a 2019 federal budget promise to implement a rare disease strategy that could help people like Joshua. The family believes Andre will continue to get access to Symdeko indefinitely. The trial is to test the medication on younger children and track it as they grow. It's already approved by Health Canada for children ages 12 and older. Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes both Orkambi and Symdeko. It tells Go Public it has no plans to ask CADTH to review Symdeko for provincial funding, saying the present system for assessing drug coverage in Canada ""has challenges.""  When asked why the cost of Orkambi is so high, Vertex didn't answer, but Cystic Fibrosis Canada says developing medications for rare disease is expensive because the market for them is so small. ""That leaves Symdeko and the other drugs coming down the pipeline completely inaccessible,"" Haughian said. ""Without a proper rare disease strategy for evaluating drugs in place, there is not much incentive for drug companies to even try to develop drugs for rare diseases."" She and her husband worry their younger son will never get the medication he needs. ""I fear Joshua will spend his childhood getting sicker, living in and out of the hospital, needing more and more treatments, and ultimately dying young,"" Haughian told Go Public in an email after the interview, because she didn't want her sons to hear about her fears. ""While Andre is out playing hockey and hanging with friends … and as he gets older and understands more and more, the 'survivor's guilt' he could potentially feel is a dangerous thing.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

105,Sarah Rieger,2020-01-20T12:30:00.000Z,Supervised consumption site advocates anxiously await results of provincial review,"A government appointed panel has turned in its review of Alberta's supervised consumption sites to the province, and advocates are anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of the program. That review is now being assessed by the government and funding will remain in place until a decision is made but there is no deadline set for that decision, a spokesperson for Associate Minister of Addiction and Mental Health Jason Luan confirmed. Stacey Carmichael is with Red Deer's Turning Point, a temporary harm reduction site run out of a trailer. She said the organization has been running at capacity — and a larger, permanent facility sits empty while they wait for a decision. ""For us it's particularly tricky because we're being, I guess, measured on a temporary solution and we've never had the opportunity to implement the full complement of services that we know that we need and the capacity is not meeting the demand in the community,"" she said. ""So we're leaving a lot of people underserved and that's unfortunate."" Funding for Alberta's supervised consumption sites will end March 31, and Carmichael says long-term planning and staff retention are challenges given the site's uncertain future. Red Deer's site is currently seeing upward of 165 visits each day and December was the busiest month yet, with 5,076 visits. Two other planned sites, one in Medicine Hat and a mobile unit in Calgary, are also on hold. Celeste Hayward, with the Alberta Community Council on HIV (ACCH), said the uncertainty could see some sites shut down and she fears disrupting stability for clients could impede their recovery. ""There's a lot of unknowns which make it likely that the safest way forward is to actually close their doors … while they wait for budgets to be confirmed which means no services, which means risk of life."" Hayward said it's important to remember that consumption sites don't just offer a supervised, clean location to consume illegal substances, but also wraparound services like emergency medical care, education on the harms of drug use, and referrals to other social services. Luan has been criticized for some of his comments about addiction, from saying distributing naloxone kits may enable drug use to deleting a tweet pondering if research supporting supervised consumption sites is funded by big pharma. Carmichael said she remains optimistic in Turning Point's future. ""I'm hopeful that the evidence and the research will maybe trump ideology and we can just proceed.""  The review looked at social and economic impacts of the sites but did not consider health benefits or social issues around drug use, or its efficacy in curbing addiction. The associate minister said at the time the review was announced that the scope was chosen because the evidence is already well established the facilities play a role in harm reduction but the Opposition argued that scope left out a crucial aspect of the review. A report published by ACCH last year found Alberta's supervised consumption sites have a 100 per cent success rate at reversing overdoses, and that there's been a decline in opioid-related deaths, overdoses in emergency rooms and EMS responses, all attributable to the harm-reduction strategies. The report also found savings of $5 for every dollar spent on the sites.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/supervised-consumption-site-review-alberta-1.5432665,[],N/A
106,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-03-25T19:22:58.757Z,'We would have been dead': Father outraged after engine fire puts family at risk,"Chris Dietrich, his wife and three young children were asleep when they woke up to a neighbour pounding on the door to tell them flames were shooting out of their garage and closing in on the house. The engine in the family's 2015 Hyundai Tucson had spontaneously burst into flames while parked in the garage. ""If it weren't for our neighbours, we would have likely been dead,"" Dietrich, from Ayr, Ont., told Go Public. ""If it were 10 to 15 minutes later it would have hit our gas line to our gas barbecue."" The fire broke out in the early morning hours of Feb. 4, after the vehicle had been parked for hours.  The company Dietrich hired to investigate found the fire started in the engine, but couldn't definitively determine why it started.  Dietrich is not the only one with an engine fire horror story. Since Go Public first broke the story about delayed recalls on Hyundai and Kia vehicles for possible engine problems, CBC News has been bombarded with stories of spontaneous vehicle fires and catastrophic engine failures.     George Iny from the Automobile Protection Association credits that CBC News investigation with pressuring the South Korean carmakers into action. Transport Canada has been investigating engine issues in Hyundai and Kia vehicles since September.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating to determine if the carmakers were too slow to fix faulty vehicles. ""We dragged some of [our belongings] out and then we watched it burn until the fire trucks got there,"" Michielsen told Go Public from his home in Coaldale, Alta. ""I got away lucky because we weren't injured.""  Michielsen's vehicle has been subject to two engine recalls for different reasons. The first was in January 2018. He says his local Kia dealer inspected his engine and told him it was fine.  A few months later, the engine stalled and had to be replaced — only to catch fire earlier this month.  When he got home, he found a second recall notice in the mail. The latest recall brings the total number of recalled Hyundai and Kia vehicles to almost three million in North America since 2015.  The recalls have been for different defects that could lead to engine failures and fires, which is a problem, according to Gretchen Freeman Cappio, a U.S. lawyer who is leading one of several lawsuits south of the border over engine fires.  ""There are numerous problems with these vehicles [in which] the companies admit they have a recall but they don't have a fix … which is astounding when you say it out loud,"" Freeman Cappio said from her office in Seattle. Hyundai has the second highest number of engine fire reports among carmakers in the country — 21 over the past three years, according to Transport Canada. The company was seventh in car sales last year, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants. Hyundai says it only has five confirmed cases of engine fires resulting from engine failures — saying that is a tiny fraction of the estimated number of its vehicles on the road.  Transport Canada has had three fire reports related to Kia engines, but the automaker wouldn't say how many it has recorded. Following Go Public's investigation into the 2.0L and 2.4L Theta II engines, Hyundai and Kia Canada did more in a couple of weeks than they have done since the recalls started four years ago. Kia added 79,301 vehicles to its recall list and Hyundai added 255,370 — more than double since the recalls started. Hyundai is also extending warranties for those vehicles. Hyundai says it's doing that ""out of an abundance of caution."" The Automobile Protection Association's Iny calls the warranty extensions ""a very big offer"" and says he's pleased with how Hyundai is stepping up action after Go Public's investigation.   ""That's a big development for consumers,"" he said. In a written response to Go Public's investigation, Hyundai Auto Canada says ""nothing is more important to Hyundai than the safety and security of our customers.""  ""Hyundai takes engine fires with the utmost urgency and seriousness. It is Hyundai's policy to investigate each and every engine fire that is brought to its attention,"" the statement reads.  Kia says ""when the result of any engine failure or fire is due to a vehicle manufacturing issue, Kia will conduct a voluntary recall,"" adding it ""continuously evaluates all Kia models … [and] if a safety defect is detected … Kia promptly reports a safety related defect to Transport Canada."" Transport Canada is asking car owners who believe they have experienced a potential safety-related condition with their vehicle to contact its Defect Investigations and Recalls Division at 1-800-333-0510, or submit a defect complaint form online. Owners wanting to check if their vehicles are under a recall can do that on the Hyundai and Kia websites.

Next year's operating budget for the facilities was presented Wednesday, but did not include the $230,000 needed to provide the products and install dispensing equipment. ""Staff have missed the boat on this, these are essential,"" said Coun. Tony Mancini. ""It's 2020 right? Let's remind everybody what year it is."" Councillors were particularly upset that money for the menstrual products wasn't included in the proposed budget, but the increase for three new employees in corporate communications was covered. ""This has ended up as an item that we have to struggle and plead and mount a case for,"" said Coun. Lisa Blackburn. ""I just don't think it sends a good message."" Blackburn pointed out that menstrual products are being provided at all 14 branches of the municipality's library service without a significant impact on its finances. ""It should have been baked into the budget,"" said Blackburn. Finance officials said a staff report on where the funding will come from has not made it to the audit and finance committee, so the item could not be included. The annual ongoing costs for menstrual products would be $220,000. Coun. Shawn Cleary had another solution. He asked for a report on cutting $267,000 — the cost of the staff increases. Cleary pointed out Halifax already has 22 people in corporate communications. ""That's a lot for a city our size,"" said Cleary. The municipality's director of corporate and customer services, Jerry Blackwood, said communication officers do not just deal with the media, but help with special projects and emergency situations.

109,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-22T20:24:56.680Z,Former Supreme Court justice says discrimination and grief forged his legal career,"Michel Bastarache says he never aspired to the life he ended up living: a career of achievement that included reaching the pinnacle of the Canadian legal system, the Supreme Court of Canada. What he wanted most, he writes in a memoir launched in Moncton this week, was a rich family life with his wife and a lot of kids — a noisy home full of activity and learning.  But that life eluded him. His two children, Jean-François and Émilie, both died young of a rare congenital disease, ""a pain as deep as an abyss, a pain that is always there, that casts a shadow on everything else,"" he writes. ""Nothing marked me more than the death of my two children. I had the career I had. But there will always be an emptiness that can't be filled.""   Bastarache says he coped with his children's illnesses by throwing himself into his work as a constitutional lawyer, which culminated in his appointment to the nation's top court in 1997. Published in French in December, the book is called: Ce que je voudrais dire à mes enfants — what I would like to say to my children. Co-authored by Radio-Canada journalist Antoine Trépanier, the memoir offers a rare firsthand account of key moments in the history of constitutional and language rights in New Brunswick and Canada. It's a history in which Bastarache was a central and sometimes contentious figure. The retired justice said in an interview he was urged to write his memoirs by minority-francophone communities he'd represented in court, who wanted his work on their behalf recorded for history. But he didn't have time to properly go through archives until his publisher, the University of Ottawa Press, suggested he work with Trépanier as a researcher.  The narrative spans his childhood in Moncton and his work translating New Brunswick statutes into French after the advent of official bilingualism, to his positions as dean of law at the University of Moncton and CEO of Moncton-based insurance company Assumption Life. It also includes two high-profile language episodes from the government of former premier Richard Hatfield: the adoption of Bill 88 and the Poirier-Bastarache commission on official languages. Bill 88 enshrined education duality in provincial law, declaring that both anglophone and francophone communities had the right to their own school systems. Bastarache reveals that he wanted to go much further in the original version of the bill with provisions that would commit governments to spend money to protect rights and to guarantee equitable economic development among regions and language groups. A draft version also would have required a vote by three-quarters of MLAs to change or repeal the law.  But Hatfield's advisers worried the original version would give too much power to the courts to overrule elected politicians. ""Oh my God, Michel, I could never convince my cabinet to adopt that,"" Hatfield told Bastarache, according to the book.  Still, Bastarache says the version adopted was ""an accomplishment, no doubt. … I told myself that there'll be no going backwards and eliminating our school boards."" The provisions were eventually added to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Not long after Bill 88, Bastarache co-chaired a contentious provincial commission on official languages that prompted a fierce backlash among some anglophones. He attributes that reaction to a chapter in his report that described anglophone attitudes hostile toward bilingualism—a chapter he now regrets including. ""Anglophones perceived this section as an attack by francophones who wanted, it seemed, to take away the powers of the majority,"" he writes. The commission pushed for dual English and French services via what he calls ""a major administrative reorganization"" of the provincial government involving decentralized regional work units. It would have ensured the delivery of all services in both languages without doubling all government functions, Bastarache says.  But the nuances were lost in the angry response to the chapter on attitudes, he writes.  ""I think if I had to do it over, knowing the negative reactions from the public, the rejection of the document, the threats and the bad press, I would change my approach,"" he writes. ""Had we done things differently, we might have a had a better Official Language Act and the province might have made some progress."" Bastarche says his drive for linguistic equality was shaped by his childhood in Moncton, during a time when he says there was still overt discrimination against Acadians.  It led him to the law, including constitutional work representing minority-French communities from Alberta to Prince Edward Island to win access to education in their language.  Bastarache was named to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in 1995 and two years later was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, just as the court was preparing for a reference case on whether Quebec had the right to unilaterally separate from Canada.  The court ruled that it did not but also that Canada would be obligated to negotiate if there were a clear referendum vote to separate. The ruling, which Bastarache helped write, was widely seen as a nuanced compromise that clarified a legally ambiguous scenario. ""That's what we created and that did not exist at the beginning of the debate,"" he writes. ""When a country is confronted with a major problem, there are still institutions that can arrive at an imaginative solution."" The book also tells the story of the landmark Beaulac decision from 1999, a ruling written by Bastarache that broadened official language rights. In that decision, the court ruled 7-2 that the Constitution requires governments to do more than merely accommodate the minority language group by offering truly equal access to services in both English and French. ""I wanted to send a clear message to Canada as a whole that minority rights are not secondary rights,"" Bastarache writes. ""I could say mission almost accomplished.""  The Beaulac decision was cited last year when a judge ruled that Ambulance New Brunswick must provide bilingual services in all its ambulances. Bastarache retired from the Supreme Court in 2008 and since then has taken on a number of roles, including as an independent arbitrator on compensation for victims of sexual abuse by priests in the diocese of Bathurst and archdiocese of Moncton. Bastarache met with people claiming to be victims, evaluated the credibility and the seriousness of their accounts, and set an amount for their compensation based on previous court rulings.  In the book he rebuts criticisms that the amounts were not sufficient, saying he consulted more than 200 damage awards to come to his decisions. ""Personally, I didn't think that $250,000 can ever make up for the abuse,"" he says. ""But I didn't have a choice. I had to award an amount equivalent to what a New Brunswick court would accept. The amounts were drawn from cases.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/memoir-michel-bastarache-language-1.5436064,[],N/A
110,Jorge Barrera,2020-01-21T02:55:09.680Z,Woman denied settlement for sexual assault on way to residential school because she wasn't yet a student,"Therese Keenatch died at 60, two weeks after her residential school compensation claim was first rejected on grounds she wasn't technically a student when she was sexually assaulted by a federal employee on the way to a Saskatchewan residential school. Her daughter, June Keenatch, took up the case after her mother's 2015 death and continued the fight all the way to the B.C. Supreme Court where she faced Justice Canada's lawyers.    Federal lawyers argued that her mother did not qualify for compensation because she hadn't been officially admitted at the school at the time of the assault and the federal employee was also not technically connected to a residential school — though he claimed to take children to the institutions. Justice Brenda Brown sided with Ottawa and dismissed the case in a ruling delivered on Jan. 9. ""I don't think that it was fair; there is no justice,"" said June Keenatch. Keenatch said her mother had six children and used a wheelchair for much of her life.   ""I feel like the government is pretty racist toward First Nations people, like our lives don't really matter,"" said Keenatch, who lives in Saskatoon. NDP MP Charlie Angus said Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, whose department directs Justice Canada on residential school cases, should settle with the family.  Angus said the case was one of the most glaring examples of the legal tactics federal lawyers used to defeat residential school claims.  ""No one in this government has contested in any way the facts of this terrible case. Yet they denied her justice on the grounds she was raped on the way to a residential school and not on the property itself,"" said Angus, in a news conference Monday.  ""What we have seen, time and time again, is a government willing to use the endless resources of the justice department to wage a toxic legal war against the legal rights of survivors."" Therese Keenatch was 15 when she was picked up by a guidance counsellor employed by the department of Indian Affairs while she walked in her home community of Witchekan Lake First Nation in September 1970, according to Brown's ruling. Therese Keenatch ""knew nothing about residential schools . . . and she did not know whose idea it was for her to attend one,"" according to evidence from Keenatch's original testimony described in Brown's ruling. The guidance counsellor then stopped his car near the town of Kilwinning, Sask., and sexually assaulted her before moving on to drop her off at St. Michael's residential school at Duck Lake, about 85 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, according to Keenatch's evidence described in the ruling.  Doug Racine, a Saskatoon lawyer with the Aboriginal Law Group, represented June Keenatch. He said the case was lost on highly technical grounds based on competing interpretations of the wording of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA). ""It is very, very frustrating,"" said Racine, who fought the case for free. ""The courts sometimes are ill-equipped to deal with the trauma and justice in the sense of doing what is right. This was a technical decision."" Therese Keenatch's claim was rejected repeatedly by the Independent Assessment Process (IAP) created by the IRSSA to provide compensation for abuse suffered at the institutions.  The B.C. Supreme Court case hinged on whether the IAP adjudicators erred in their decisions.  Brown said in her ruling that compensation could still be sought from the government through another legal channel. ""This is indeed a troubling case, and a troubling outcome,"" wrote Brown, who is a supervising judge for the IRSSA. ""But as the initial adjudicator noted, the finding that no compensation could be granted under the IAP for this very serious sexual assault in no way precluded pursuing the claim through other means.""  June Keenatch said she is done fighting. ""I just pretty much gave up,"" she said. ""This has been going on for a long time now."" Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett's office said in a statement that what happened to Therese Keenatch was ""horrific and inexcusable."" The statement said the government is committed to resolving all claims, even if they fall outside the negotiated terms of the residential schools settlement agreement. ""Minister Bennett has directed departmental officials to identify other possible means for appropriate resolution as the Government of Canada does not dispute these allegations,"" said the statement. ""Minister Bennett has also directed the department to investigate to ensure appropriate resolution of similar claims."" Angus said the Crown-Indigenous Relations minister should never have fought this case.  ""She needs to come clean with Canadian people. What does reconciliation mean in her government when they take positions like this?"" he said. Angus said the case is just another example of how federal lawyers used technical arguments to defeat residential school cases throughout the settlement process. He said a parliamentary committee needs to review how Ottawa handled the IRSSA. ""We may never know how much of these cases were falsely adjudicated. I think a fair thing, now that this process is coming to an end, would be to learn lessons from it,"" he said. According to the latest statistics available on the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat's website, as of Dec. 31, 2019 a total of 99 per cent of the over 38,000 claims filed have been resolved and close to 90 per cent of IAP claimants have received compensation under the IAP.

The dpa news agency reported Monday that prosecutors have asked Berlin's region court to sentence two of the men to seven years in prison and the two others to six and five years each. A verdict is expected next month. Prosecutors claim the men, aged 21 to 25, stole the ""Big Maple Leaf"" coin worth about €3.75 million euros (about $5.44 million) from Berlin's Bode Museum in March 2017. German media have reported that three of the accused, 24-year-old Wayci Remmo, 20-year-old Ahmed Remmo and 22-year-old Wissam Remmo, have links to organized crime. The fourth suspect, identified only as 20-year-old Dennis W., worked as a security guard at the museum, which is located in the heart of the German capital. The defendants have remained silent throughout the trial. Their lawyers have denied the accusations against their clients.

Joi Scientific claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen, which would be a significant scientific breakthrough, but two former employees have told CBC News that it doesn't work as advertised. ""NB Power has indicated that they're dispatching with the final logistics of the lease arrangement that they have,"" Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland said in an interview on Tuesday. ""At that point, that will be the last of the financial obligations."" The utility, along with the Regional Development Corporation, spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. Earlier this year, Holland said he'd instructed NB Power to continue running its Florida lab while final tests were being performed in December. On Tuesday, Holland said those tests have been delayed. ""At this particular moment, I have not been presented with any proof of viability,"" Holland said. CBC News has contacted Joi Scientific for its response to the government's decision. A November statement from Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, said the company was committed to working on its technology ""in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" The statement said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. It didn't elaborate on those delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. At an appearance in front of a legislative committee in November, NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas doubled down on the utility's decision to license the technology, saying it still had ""potential."" But he said the company would decide whether to pull the plug on the project by the end of the calendar year or by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. ""Especially where we are now, we don't want to create expectation,"" Thomas said in November. ""But, obviously, if it doesn't prove out, we'll have to walk away and we'll be the first to come and tell that."" NB Power didn't immediately respond to an interview request for Thomas on Tuesday afternoon. In total, the lab has cost NB Power more than $178,000 US this year.  The utility has also spent money on travel to Florida and contracted several companies to do testing and other work on Joi's technology. That work cost the utility at least $51,000, according to documents obtained by CBC News through access to information. Two companies, Stantec and another company whose name was redacted from the documents, received between $25,000 and $100,000 to do work on the Joi project. Holland confirmed on Tuesday that NB Power will no longer spend money on that work either. Holland said that he assumes the utility and Joi Scientific will continue to communicate and that Thomas will remain on the company's board, a position he doesn't receive compensation to hold. ""I have no issue with allowing a continued peek over the shoulder as things move forward,"" the minister said. ""In the event that there is something that comes out of it then, so be it.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/joi-scientific-funding-1.5411851,[],N/A

Ptesanwin — or White Buffalo Calf Woman —  is one of the sacred creation stories told by the Lakota people. Stories in Time: PTE' SA WIN, a play based on the story, is being performed on stage Saturday night as part of Saskatoon's Winterruption festival. Choreographer Chante Speidel said she hopes the crowd will learn about Lakota history, but her main goal is to inspire by reviving the story of a strong, heroic Indigenous woman. ""For those small Indigenous girls in the crowd, this is their way of saying,  'Let's do this. Let's be powerful. Let's be exactly what Ptesanwin represents and all that she is,'"" Speidel said. She said the public is learning about the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women and their over-representation in Canada's prisons, but that Indigenous women are also rising up and overcoming barriers. ""Indigenous women are reclaiming their rightful spots, taking places of power again in their communities and elsewhere,"" she said. Before and during production, the cast and crew consulted extensively with elders and spiritual leaders. This included a 19th-generation pipe carrier from the U.S., said artistic director Don Speidel. Speidel said it was important to tell this story, particularly with all the divisions in modern society. ""It relates to climate change. It refers to creating peace and harmony among all nations, not to live in bloodshed and war but to actually live in common unity,"" he said. The play was last performed 20 years ago in Saskatoon during the opening of the Saskatoon Tribal Council's White Buffalo Youth Lodge. Speidel said they were encouraged to bring it back.

""We've been doing this for too long to say that it's wrong."" The community's locally-developed caribou conservation plan was presented as the first act of business at a three-day ""public listening session"" on the caribou harvest, organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board. The sessions have brought more than 60 visitors to the small community of about 130 people, and have been well-attended. According to the plan, one goal is to ""avoid intervention"" by the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources to regulate harvest through tags or quota systems, which it calls an ""unprecedented colonial system of control."" In their place, the plan proposes a bottom-up management system based on mutual respect for and ""inter-dependence with ʔədə,"" the traditional name for caribou. It also says conservation efforts must be guided by the wisdom of elders and the community's traditional law, or ʔeʔa. Among the ʔeʔa principles, the plan outlines are respect for the land, sharing and a belief ""that all things have a spirit and are interconnected."" Colville Lake's caribou conservation plan proposes the revitalization of the community's traditional law through the documentation of harvesting customs, the development of new research standards, and educating youth.  The plan would significantly empower Colville Lake's local renewable resource council, which it asserts is better placed to assess the conservation needs of the herd. Government departments are too ""siloed"" to take the holistic approach to conservation possible on a local level, according to the plan. It commits Colville Lake's authorities to establish and enforce local guidelines. It would also collect and share harvest numbers with partners in the territorial government. ""Although reporting harvest numbers may be alien to the customs of the Dene, it … may serve to prevent the imposition of unacceptable harvest restrictions,"" the plan reads. If fully accepted, the plan would also obligate the government to consult with the local renewable resource council before permitting any proposed mineral and petroleum exploration on the caribou range. That range extends well outside the territory, into Yukon and Nunavut. The plan also asks that the government and exploration companies to consider reporting annually ""what they are doing on the land."" The plan must be approved by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board in its list of decisions produced from the session, due to be released Mar. 31. Then it will head to the territorial government, which will need to decide if and how to implement it under the territory's Wildlife Act.

Speaking at an event today in Toronto, Omar Alghabra, the parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, said fifteen families want their loved ones' remains to be repatriated. One body was returned yesterday, a second will arrive Wednesday and the government is in the process of repatriating another 13 victims, said the Liberal MP. Alghabra said about 61 citizens and permanent residents have been buried in Iran according to their families' wishes.  Canada has been demanding that Iran turn over the ""black box"" flight recorders from the aircraft, which contain information critical to the crash investigation. ""There's some progress but we remain vigilant,"" said Alghabra. ""We know families deserve an open, transparent and thorough investigation."" Alghabra also announced that the federal government will match donations made to the Canada Strong Campaign to support victims' families.

Alghabra said the government will match funds up to $1.5 million and the federal Department of Public Safety will work with the campaign to decide how best to spend the money. Fifty-seven of those who died were Canadian citizens, 29 were permanent residents and dozens of others were travelling to Canada. The government is giving the families of the Canadians and permanent residents $25,000 per victim to help cover the cost of immediate needs, such as funeral arrangements and travel.

116,Jonathon Gatehouse,2019-12-05T09:00:15.727Z,"Canadian stats on impaired driving deaths incomplete, years out of date","Canada's statistics on impaired and distracted driving fatalities, as well as drowning deaths, are incomplete and years out of date because the BC Coroners Service has repeatedly failed to share its data with the agencies that compile the national numbers. A CBC News investigation has determined that the information gap, which in some cases stretches back almost a decade, has held up the publication of annual reports and caused safety organizations to guess at countrywide trends and put asterisks next to their findings. And it's creating headaches for advocates and policy-makers who want to know if laws and enforcement measures are working as they should. ""It's appalling,"" said Andrew Murie, CEO of Mothers Against Drunk Driving Canada. ""We're almost [in] 2020 and we're still working off 2014 [numbers]. We've had historical events in this country, like the legalization of recreational cannabis, with the big issue and debate around driving and what effect it's going to have, and we've got nothing. Nothing."" The Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA), an interprovincial body that deals with highway safety, traditionally releases its annual Alcohol and Drug Crash Problem report each January. Drawing on police, insurance, coroner and medical examiner data from across the country, it's the definitive source on what has gone wrong on the country's roads. But the last CCMTA report came out almost three years ago in January 2017. And it was based on 2014 data — or in the case of British Columbia, extrapolated 2010 numbers.  The Ottawa-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation (TIRF), an independent non-profit that gathers and analyzes the data for the CCMTA report, says it has been having difficulty prying numbers out of the BC Coroners Service for years. ""We've been trying to get that data because it represents anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of the population,"" said Steve Brown, who oversees TIRF's national fatality database and co-authors the Alcohol and Drug Crash report. ""We're doing everything at our end. We've filled out all the research agreements and that type of thing."" Earlier this year, the BC Coroners Service finally provided its 2011 and 2012 figures. But the holdup continues for the province's more recent years; that's in contrast to other Canadian jurisdictions, which have all provided their road death numbers through at least 2016. ""You think, in the information age, that it would be easier to get data, but that's not always the case,"" said Brown. ""We're … just trying to be as patient as we can with this."" B.C.'s death disclosure problems have also affected an annual report on water fatalities across the country. This past summer, the Drowning Prevention Research Centre released its 2019 findings — based on 2016 data — noting that absence of definitive numbers from Canada's third most populous province. ""They weren't ready and we just made the call that says, better to have three territories and nine provinces with their data, and let B.C. catch up by next year,"" said Doug Ferguson, CEO of Drowning Prevention Research Centre. Ferguson said his centre was still able to glean partial B.C. drowning death information from police and media reports, but it's likely that they missed some cases. He worries that the incomplete report might hamper municipalities or other water safety agencies as they try to fine-tune and target their public awareness campaigns.  ""You're not flying blind, but you're using old data,"" said Ferguson. ""There is no other source as valid as a coroner's office."" Andy Watson, a spokesperson for the BC Coroners Service, attributes the delays to the surge in deaths caused by the opioid crisis and the declaration of a provincial public health emergency in April 2016. ""One of the challenges that we were faced with a couple of years ago, really, it was the illicit drug crisis was expanding, and hitting British Columbia, I think, disproportionately harder than other provinces,"" said Watson. ""It was a reprioritization of resources at the time."" But given that the timely sharing of B.C. data was a problem well before the spike in fentanyl and carfentanil overdose deaths, other issues appear to be at play. In a followup response, Watson allowed that the BC Coroners Service has been slowed by ""a myriad of factors,"" including privacy concerns, revamped research agreements, the creation of a new electronic data management system and turnover in staff. Regardless, the agency is promising to do better and says it will hand over its 2013 through 2017 road death information to the Traffic Injury Research Foundation at some point next year. ""The best I can tell you at this stage is that we are working on that and catching up on that now,"" said Watson. ""We recognize the importance of that data and that's why we're making it a priority at this stage."" For safety groups like MADD Canada, however, the promise rings hollow. Murie says his organization has been looking for alternative data sources so it can analyze trends and critique government policy without having to wait for the various federal and provincial agencies to get their act together. ""To be honest with you, in the last year or so, I have just kind of given up,"" he said. ""Because even if they were to put out data for tomorrow and it's [for] 2015, what does it tell us?"" It's all in sharp contrast to the coroner-based process in the United States, which produces updated national numbers each spring via the federally funded Fatality Analysis Reporting System. ""That's great that B.C. is going to get caught up,"" said Murie. ""But, you know, the Americans have already produced their 2018 data, and next year, in April, they'll do 2019. ""They can do trend data. We can't.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/death-data-information-gap-1.5384278,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/fire-truck-stolen-winnipeg-arrest-1.5379840 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/drunk-driving-twice-quebec-breathalyzer-for-life-1.5369145 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/great-lakes-drownings-2019-1.5231362 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-crisis-vancouver-election-1.5284444,N/A

""My heart pretty much dropped to my stomach,"" Lidhar told Go Public from his home in Surrey, B.C. ""We just assume our money's safe."" Soon after, the cybercriminals stole another $2,000. But worst of all, Scotiabank refused to reimburse him. ""It is not acceptable to have your money stolen from your account and the bank — which you trust so much with your life savings — tells you they can't do much to help."" Lidhar is the victim of a ""systemic problem"" of criminals breaking into people's online accounts and stealing money, according to Christopher Parsons, a senior public policy researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. Parsons argues that the country's banks, not their customers, should be financially liable when thieves raid customer accounts. ""The banks are responsible — solely responsible — for building and maintaining the infrastructure,"" he said. ""We need to reverse the liability the banks currently impose upon individuals who are using the very services and tools that banks are providing.""  The trouble started for Lidhar on Feb. 11, when hackers broke into his account and e-transferred $3,000 in two transactions — one for $2,000 and one for $1,000 — to an email address he says he doesn't recognize. As soon as he learned about it, Lidhar says he changed his password, got a new debit card, asked Scotiabank to freeze his accounts and stopped banking online. Scotiabank said it would investigate, but when Lidhar didn't hear back after two weeks, he visited his local branch. While speaking to someone in the fraud department, they told him money was again being transferred out of his account. ""I was totally shocked and blown away that this was happening while I was in the branch,"" he said.  Been wronged and you're not the only one? Contact our Go Public team His bank was able to stop one e-transfer for $1,000 but not another for $2,000. Lidhar says Scotiabank took a few weeks to investigate, and then said it wouldn't cover his losses.  In an email, Scotiabank said his claim was denied because the transaction was authorized from an internet address where he has ""extensive history."" Security experts tell Go Public that hackers can access a bank account from a victim's IP address by taking over an infected computer and logging in as if they were that person. Lidhar says Scotiabank wouldn't explain how the fraud happened, adding that only he has access to his account.  ""They're trying to blame me,"" he said. ""And they haven't told me anything about who it went to."" In a statement to Go Public, a Scotiabank spokesperson said the bank ""took immediate action and conducted a thorough investigation,"" into Lidhar's case.  ""We take the concerns of our customers very seriously,"" wrote Douglas Johnson. After Go Public contacted Scotiabank, it offered to compensate Lidhar — six months after his money was stolen.  Go Public has heard similar stories from others — all saying their accounts were hacked, and that the banks often won't reimburse them. In May, Martin Chapman of Peterborough, Ont., lost almost $12,000 when criminals broke into his accounts at TD Bank and Royal Bank. Initially, he says, TD refused to fully compensate him, offering just $1,805. ""They have admitted to me they don't know how the scammer broke through their security system,"" said Chapman. Only after he appealed did TD agree to reimburse all $6,000. RBC refunded the remaining money after a two-week investigation. TD would not respond to questions from Go Public about this case.  Curtis Hamilton of Esquimalt, B.C., says he was targeted by hackers last November who installed a key logger on his computer and sent just over $2,000 to themselves. TD's fraud department said Hamilton didn't protect his password and it was his fault. Hamilton had anti-malware software on his computer. He's hired a lawyer but has yet to get his money back. ""It's been quite frustrating,"" he said. ""The bank is basically saying … 'We're not responsible for anything.'"" TD would not comment on this case, when asked by Go Public. Patricia Widdis of Breslau, Ont., told Go Public that hackers accessed her RBC account and redirected her Visa payments, stealing $12,000 in May 2018. The bank was able to get $7,000 returned, but she is still out $5,000 and feels betrayed. ""They said, 'You made the payments yourself,'"" said Widdis. An RBC spokesperson wrote that potentially unauthorized transactions are analyzed ""on a case-by-case"" basis. Most Canadians are unaware that more criminals are hacking into financial institutions in Canada and around the world, says security expert Limor Kessem.  ""These threats are very real and very problematic,"" said Kessem, an adviser based in Tel Aviv with IBM X-Force, an international team of investigators who track global security threats to the financial sector. ""In the beginning,"" she said, ""we would see that a banking trojan [a type of virus] would be targeting banks through their customers,"" such as GozNym, a malware attack she helped uncover and that was shut down in May, as part of an international law enforcement operation. GozNym targeted two financial institutions based in Canada — which Kessem won't name — and 22 U.S. banks, credit unions and popular e-commerce platforms, stealing sensitive personal and financial information, including online banking login credentials such as usernames and passwords. It's estimated GozNym stole over $100 million from some 40,000 victims. It's an example of the sort of malware that might be responsible for the hacks against Lidhar, Hamilton and Chapman.  ""And then we have a different type of attack,"" said Kessem. ""Cybercrime groups that will invade the banks' actual infrastructure and get into their payment systems and start compromising them internally."" It all points to the need for financial institutions to take responsibility when hackers steal customers' money, says Parsons, the public policy researcher.  ""They can't just provide us tools or push liability upon us and then walk away,"" he said. ""One of the ways of correcting this would be to shift the liability structure. So rather than punishing customers … the banks themselves should be liable, so that they're encouraged to build way better security and protect their customers from this sort of fraud."" In the U.K., says Parsons, banking fraud was such a big problem, the government made banks responsible for financial losses to customers.  ""And as soon as the banks had to take those losses, all of a sudden … fraud plummeted because the banks invested massively in security,"" said Parsons. He says Canada's next government needs to follow the U.K.'s example.  ""If banks themselves won't do it, then it's an area where legislation needs to be seriously considered. We can't rely on customers to know about every kind of security vulnerability, to track every website that has breached passwords,"" he said. ""That's just absolutely absurd and not a feasible solution to the problem."" Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association — which represents Canada's largest banks — whether its members would consider assuming liability when hackers break into the online banking systems they have created. A spokesperson did not address that question, but wrote, banks ""have no higher priority than the security of their customers' money and conduct comprehensive investigations of all fraud cases, some of which are complex and take time to investigate the specifics of the case."" All the banks involved in these cases have told Go Public that customers are responsible for taking precautions to ensure their devices, accounts and information are protected. Sunjit Lidhar says he's stopped doing online banking and now heads to his bank branch instead — a hassle he says is worth it, for peace of mind. He says he wrote to Go Public to let people know that banks could hold them responsible when hackers strike. ""I just want people to know that this is something that's very real,"" says Lidhar. ""It's not safe. And that's something they [the banks] need to work on."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

119,Anonymous,2020-01-23T16:32:39.354Z,"Spanish government holds emergency meeting on Gloria, storm that has killed 11","Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced an emergency meeting to deal with the impact of storm Gloria after flying over areas of eastern Spain where heavy rains, powerful winds and huge waves have killed at least 11 people. Residents were left grappling with the wreckage of days of battering, including collapsed bridges, damaged railway lines and entire beaches wiped away by waves. Five people are still missing. ""I think what's important right now is that we're all united, that we work shoulder-to-shoulder and co-operate, as we are doing,"" Sánchez told reporters on Thursday. The national weather authority said the storm had begun to recede but more than 100 roads remained closed and tens of thousands of students were kept out of school. Sánchez, noting the winter storm had hit just as the area readied itself for the tourist season, said his government had called the emergency meeting on Friday in a bid to help re-establish normality, guarantee security and address short- and medium-term needs. The storm tightened its grip on parts of the peninsula on Sunday, unleashing winds of up to 144 kilometres per hour and waves up to 13.5 metres high that slammed into seafront shops, wiping out beaches and boardwalks. Near Barcelona, frothy sea foam carpeted several streets in the small town of Tossa de Mar. Hundreds of thousands were left without power as the storm covered roads in snow, flooded farmlands and poured saltwater into the Ebro Delta, swallowing thousands of hectares of rice paddies. Rescue services said they continued to search for several people missing in the storm; among two in Ibiza was a Briton, while in Mallorca, a local free diving champion who had gone out canyoning on Monday was still being sought, according to local newspaper Diario de Mallorca. Those killed by the storm ranged from a 69-year-old man pulled into the sea by a wave in Catalonia to another who died as hail pounded the greenhouse in the province of Almeria where he had been working. The prime minister said that while every meteorological phenomenon could not be attributed to climate change, it was evident it was having an impact. ""Public administrations have to reflect on how to shift gears and focus our economic resources and public policies ... on a new element — and that is climate change,"" said Sánchez.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/spain-storm-gloria-recovery-1.5437534,[],N/A
120,Mark Ting,2020-01-12T17:00:00.634Z,High returns or recession: What does 2020 have in store for your money?,"It's that time of year when investment analysts break out their crystal balls and issue predictions for what the upcoming year will bring for financial markets. This year I've decided to throw my hat in the ring by answering the top financial questions about 2020 from my clients and CBC listeners. I don't think we will see a recession as long as the central banks around the world keep interest rates low and continue expanding their balance sheets. They are kicking the can down the road by printing more money and throwing it at the economy — conditions that are positive for stocks and stave off recessions.  Forecast: No recession in 2020. Stock market investors were treated very well in 2019 with both North American and international markets experiencing double digit gains. U.S. stocks were up by almost 30 per cent while Canadian, Chinese and European stock indices returned approximately 20 per cent.   Forecast: Stock markets will be higher than they are today, but returns will be less then they were in 2019. Mid to high single digit returns for the North American markets. During a U.S. election year, markets typically trend higher and finish the year with high single digit gains. They also tend to be quite volatile so I'm expecting a couple of inter-year market corrections of at least 10 per cent. These corrections often occur when the political mud-slinging intensifies during the summer months leading up to the election. However, once a winner is declared — markets typically stabilize before finishing the year strong.  Forecast: Increased market volatility with several inter-year corrections, which I would treat as buying opportunities. Entering 2020, investors were feeling comfortable but that all changed when a U.S. drone killed a senior Iranian military figure and Iran vowed to retaliate. Following the attack, oil prices, the Canadian dollar and gold rose while stocks sold off. Since the attack, markets have recovered most of their losses and some (i.e. the Toronto Stock Exchange) are at new all-time highs. Forecast: While the Middle East conflict is upsetting and worth monitoring, I believe that other international factors such as U.S.-China trade negotiations, Brexit and the U.S. and China's central banks' willingness to stimulate their economies will have more of an impact on global stock markets and economies. Since 2019 was a great year for global stock markets, now is a good time to trim some profits and re-allocate them to investments that are more defensive. As 2020 is expected to be quite volatile, speak to your advisor about your portfolio's downside protection strategy as well as how it is positioned to benefit from an increase in market gyrations.  Consider tweaking the geographic asset allocation of your portfolio. Do not be afraid to add to U.S. and international positions. Forecast: Canada will under-perform compared to the U.S. and international stock markets. Overall, I'm expecting slow growth to continue for most of the world economies and I believe that stocks will outperform bonds. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

121,Hannah Thibedeau,2020-01-23T21:10:56.615Z,Ex-Harper aide Ian Brodie joins Andrew Scheer's office,"Former prime minister Stephen Harper's former right-hand man is coming back to help Andrew Scheer for the next six months. Ian Brodie, Harper's ex-chief of staff, will take on the role of adviser to the outgoing Conservative Party leader. Many in the party say they hope Brodie can rein in what's being described by some as a ""Wild West"" atmosphere in both the Official Opposition leader's office and the wider party as Conservatives get ready for a leadership contest. A source close to Scheer told CBC News Brodie's job will be to keep the caucus united and working in concert while Conservatives wait to choose a new leader. Conservative strategist Tim Powers said that kind of internal discipline is critical in a minority Parliament — where an errant vote or strategic miscalculation on either side of the aisle can lead to the sudden defeat of the government and an unexpected election call. ""He is a key adult to have in the room when a minority accident is the last thing the CPC needs now,"" Powers said. ""This is a good move. Many people will be breathing a sigh of relief to know Ian is on board."" One prominent Conservative called on Brodie to immediately release the internal party report on its election performance, drafted by former Harper cabinet minister John Baird. ""Ian is a person of experience and integrity. I hope he will be able to bring additional transparency and accountability to the party's operations, starting with a full release of the Baird report,"" said Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for Harper. Teneycke was one of the first prominent Conservatives to call on Scheer to resign after the election. CBC News has spoken to multiple people in the Conservative Party who say they've discussed the report's contents with Baird. While the party has said the report will not be made public, those sources said it blames the party's performance in the 2019 election on inexperienced staffers and centralized control of the campaign. Internal party discipline became an issue for Scheer's office almost immediately after the fall election, as a movement to push him out of the leadership started mobilizing in public. Former Harper cabinet minister Peter MacKay — who is expected to officially launch his own leadership bid over the weekend — told a Washington, D.C. audience in late October that the Conservatives' election loss was like a hockey player failing to score on ""an open net."" He also said Scheer's reluctance to discuss his past positions on abortion and LGBTQ rights ""hung around [his] neck like a stinking albatross."" In late November, Teneycke and other former Harper aides co-founded the group Conservative Victory to organize a pressure campaign to convince Scheer to resign. That same month, senior Conservative strategists Melissa Lantsman and Jamie Ellerton published an article in the Globe and Mail arguing Scheer's ""visible discomfort"" during the campaign with questions about LGBTQ rights undermined the campaign. Then, on Dec. 12 — as reports were emerging about his use of money from the party's Conservative Fund to pay for private school tuition for his kids — Scheer announced his resignation as leader. The party's executive director, Dustin van Vugt, said that Scheer and his family were presented with ""a standard offer to cover costs associated with moving his family from Regina to Ottawa."" Those funds included schooling, he said. A source close to the board told CBC News in December that board members were blindsided by the news of the tuition payments — and the fund was in the process of looking into the matter when Scheer abruptly quit his post as permanent leader. The fund's decision to probe the spending and Scheer's resignation were ""not viewed as coincidental,"" the source said. Conservative Fund directors dismissed van Vugt from his post in mid-December. A month later, Stephen Harper quit the his position on the fund's board. Right now, Scheer's chief of staff and communications director are working on an interim basis. Scheer fired chief of staff Marc-André Leclerc and communications director Brock Harrison in late November in response to the party's failure to defeat the Liberals the previous month.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ian-brodie-andrew-scheer-conservative-1.5437966,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-decarie-reaction-1.5437302 https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237,N/A

The Ottawa monument will honour public servants who lost their jobs from the 1950s into the 1990s, a period known as the LGBT Purge. ""It's something I don't think anyone can really understand unless they go through a discrimination at work that has nothing to do with their skills,"" Martine Roy told Ottawa Morning Tuesday.   In 1981, when Roy was 19 and in training to be a medical assistant with the Canadian Armed Forces at CFB Borden, she was arrested and interrogated for hours about her sexual orientation. In December 1984, she was dishonourably discharged from the military. ""There was a law, black and white, all federal but mostly in the army, where I was, that was saying that if you were homosexual [it] is the same as incest or rape,"" said Roy, chair of the LGBT Purge Fund, which has raised $8 million for the monument.  The fund was created following a class-action lawsuit launched by members of the military, RCMP and civil service. How the Cold War 'fruit machine' tried to determine gay from straight While the federal government apologized to LGBT public servants in 2017 and has given more than $100 million in compensation to victims, Roy said it took a decade of therapy for her to regain her confidence and overcome her fear. ""We were not proud. We were hiding,"" Roy said. ""Many of us never came out ... of the closet. Some killed themselves."" On Thursday, the NCC's board of directors will consider a proposal for land allocation for the monument. Three sites in downtown Ottawa are in the running.  Once a site is chosen, the Department of Canadian Heritage will launch a design competition and seek public input on proposals. The board of directors meeting begins at 11 a.m. at NCC headquarters on Elgin Street. It is open to the public.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/monument-lgbt-annoucement-1.5435689,[],N/A
124,Anonymous,2020-01-22T20:46:49.552Z,"Risk of new coronavirus spreading to the North low, say territories' top doctors","Health officials in the Northwest Territories and Yukon say the risk of the new coronavirus spreading to the territories is probably low. Dr. Kami Kandola, the N.W.T.'s chief public health officer, said her office is monitoring the situation and that right now, the majority of reported cases globally are related to exposure in Wuhan, the city in mainland China where the virus was first reported. There are no direct flights to Canada from Wuhan, said Kandola, and Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver airports are screening travellers who are at risk.     ""It's just important that the initial ports of entry won't be through Yellowknife, Northwest Territories — it will be through these larger cities,"" she said.  The coronavirus belongs to a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging in severity; from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), says the Public Health Agency of Canada. Coronavirus is not currently as serious as SARS, said Kandola, but it's likely the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases. As of Jan. 20, 282 cases of the virus were confirmed, and six people had died, according to the World Health Organization. Outside of China, cases have been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the United States, and all are linked to people who had travelled from mainland China.   ""The situation right now, from the Public Health Agency of Canada is that the risk is extremely low,"" said Kandola. However, she added, that can change with the Lunar New Year on Jan. 25, when millions of people travel around China and abroad.  ""We don't know what the situation is going to be after that,"" she said.  Kandola urges people travelling between Canada and China to look at travel advice issued by the Canadian government. In Yukon, chief medical officer Brendan Hanley said the risk of seeing the virus in Yukon is ""probably fairly low,"" but said it's worth being vigilant. ""I mean, look how kind of random it was that it showed up in Seattle. It's something we need to be vigilant for, prepared for ... We don't want to miss that case, should it arrive,"" he said. At the Nova Hotel in Yellowknife on Tuesday, tourists expressed mixed feelings about the coronavirus outbreak.  Sandy Lee, a traveller from San Francisco with roots in Hong Kong, said she's ""getting nervous.""  ""Hopefully we can prepare,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, I don't know, because now Chinese New Year is coming up [and] people will be going back to their own region to visit their relatives."" Bing Yem is a visitor from Toronto whose family is originally from mainland China.  ""We can manage the situation ... no worries,"" he said, adding he believes China's government will be able to control the situation. ""Our friends in China, they still travel,"" he said. The symptoms of coronavirus mimic other common viruses, such as a fever, coughing and shortness of breath, said Kandola.  She said people can protect themselves and others by washing their hands regularly and for at least 20 seconds, and by coughing and sneezing into a tissue or their elbow. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.  While the risk of catching the new virus is low, other viruses, such as influenza and pertussis (whooping cough) are circulating around the territory. Kandola said people with cold- and flu-like symptoms should stay home, and if their symptoms are severe, they should go to the emergency room. Front-line health practitioners are being told to ask patients about their recent travel history to Wuhan, said Kandola. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/coronavirus-nwt-risk-1.5435448,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/yvr-coronavirus-screening-1.5433477 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-tlicho-region-whooping-cough-1.5428641,N/A

The amount of stuff that shouldn't be there — mostly disposable wipes and cloth rags  — will likely increase, according to the plant superintendent. ""We fill one dumpster a week,"" said Steven Stewart. ""That could go to three when it all gets going."" The city will have a new screening facility up and running in a couple of weeks to help deal with the gunk. It's part of $12 million in upgrades undertaken to handle increased waste at the Charlottetown plant. The new screening facility will be housed in a separate building on the plant's waterfront property on Riverside Drive. The new, finer screen will replace a decades-old machine that currently sifts all manner of items out of the sewage that flows from the homes of Charlottetown residents. ""This looks like somebody's Calvin Kleins,"" said Stewart, as he used a pitch fork and gloved hands to pick through a knotted wad of cloth and elastic that turned up in the pipes in recent days. The name of the designer-label undergarment was clearly visible. Over the years, staff have removed many curious items: an animal horn, bones, children's toys, cash. A pair of crinkled $5 bills are kept in the plant as examples of what can turn up. One worker told CBC he once found a $50 bill.  And a set of dentures.  Staff estimate they remove a ""five gallon bucket"" of untreatable items from pumping equipment every day. It takes valuable time, and puts staff at risk, according to Stewart. ""You get syringes. Sometimes we have razor blades,"" said Stewart. ""It's a hazard to employees because on a daily basis we have to go in and unplug these things from our pumps. ""Don't put anything in the toilet that isn't toilet paper or number one or number two."" Despite the ongoing problems, city residents are ""quite conscientous,"" according to Charlottetown's sewer and water manager. ""People have educated themselves,"" said Richard MacEwen. ""Island Waste Management does a great job of explaining how the waste-handling system works and people have embraced it."" The advent of disposable wipes has created a new challenge in recent years, according to MacEwen. ""They're not flushable,"" said MacEwen. Cooking oil and grease also clog pipes and should not be poured down kitchen drains. The city of Summerside says it's having trouble with people flushing mop heads.

126,Courtney Dickson,2020-01-24T13:00:00.965Z,'It was pretty real': B.C. band's latest song reflects on overdose death of childhood friend,"Cayne McKenzie, lead vocalist with Vancouver-based rock group We Are the City, had already started writing a song about losing a loved one when his childhood friend, Kyle Tubbs, died suddenly from a fentanyl overdose three years ago.  That song ultimately became the title track on the band's latest album, R.I.P, released Thursday night.  The group started writing the song about friends growing apart, becoming interested in different things and following different paths. When Tubbs died, it took the existing vocals out of the song and improvised new lyrics, which is what is now featured in the song.  ""I was just lying on the couch by myself and I just listened to the song, and I was listening to some of Kyle's music as well,"" McKenzie told Radio West host Sarah Penton.   ""That was it. There is a lot of time and a lot of emotion put into it but actually not a lot of thought put into it. It was pretty real."" This is Kyle Tubbs. A deep soul and an artistic genius. We have released a song today — it's called RIP. The song was written, mostly, before Kyle died. A sad song about feeling like he was fading as a childhood best friend, I was mourning our friendship. <a href=""https://t.co/HG5Pk9HYzF"">pic.twitter.com/HG5Pk9HYzF</a>   The song looks back at the last time McKenzie saw Tubbs, drinking beer and smoking cigarettes, while sharing music with each other. Shortly after, the lyrics reference memories of his friend that may fade over time and thank him for their friendship. From there, the song becomes increasingly emotional, as McKenzie's voice seems to become uneasy.  Drummer Andrew Huculiak said that while he's anticipating the song will be special, he's also dreading it.  Releasing a song that personal and emotional comes with challenges, including playing it live over and over again. The band has just started rehearsing it and working on how to perform it.   ""It's one of those songs that I don't think it's possible to disconnect from the emotion of it,"" he said. ""It's a good thing that it isn't.

128,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:44:56.516Z,Anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad falls short of million-strong turnout called for by Shia cleric,"Thousands rallied in Baghdad on Friday to demand that American troops leave the country, though their numbers fell short of the million-person turnout called for by an influential Shia cleric. The rally came amid heightened anti-U.S. sentiment after a U.S. drone strike earlier this month killed a top Iranian general in the Iraqi capital. Since mid-morning, large crowds gathered on the Muslim day of prayers as loudspeakers blasted ""No, no America!"" at a central square in Baghdad. A child held up a poster reading, ""Death to America. Death to Israel."" But by the afternoon the rally had failed to reach the critical numbers called for by radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Apparently seeking to show control, al-Sadr's supporters did not engage in altercations with security forces or target the separate, anti-government protests in neighbouring Tahrir Square, a possibility feared by activists in the lead-up to Friday's march. Officials and experts said the rally was the cleric's attempt to capitalize on brewing anti-American feeling and show he had the upper-hand on the Iraqi street as negotiations among political elites over who should be the next prime minister stumble on. In his weekly Friday sermon, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most revered Shia cleric, called on political parties to stop stalling and move the talks forward. ""The formation of the new government is constitutionally long overdue, it is necessary for the various parties concerned to co-operate,"" al-Sistani said in a sermon delivered via a representative,""it is an important step toward resolving the current crisis."" The march did not head as initially feared toward the U.S. Embassy, the scene of violent clashes last month when militia supporters tried to storm the compound. Roads and bridges leading to the heavily fortified Green Zone, the seat of Iraq's government and home to several foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy, were blocked off by concrete barriers. Iraqi security forces stood guard, blocking access to the gates to the zone. There was a heavy security presence as the protesters, mostly Shia hailing from the capital but also Iraq's southern provinces, walked on foot to an assembly point in Baghdad's Jadriya neighbourhood, waving Iraqi flags and wearing symbolic white shrouds. Al-Sadr, whose party won the most seats in the May 2018 parliamentary elections, had called for a ""million-man"" demonstration to demand the withdrawal of American troops following the U.S. drone strike near Baghdad's airport that killed top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The killing sparked the ire of Iraqi officials from across the political spectrum. According to U.S. military officials, rather than draw down, Americans have poured 20,000 additional troops in the Middle East to counter what Washington describes as an escalating threat from Iran. There are around 5,200 U.S. troops in Iraq, where they help train and assist Iraqi forces in the fight against the Islamic State group (ISIS). Iran has long sought the withdrawal of American forces from neighbouring Iraq, but the U.S. strike that killed Soleimani in Baghdad has added new impetus to the effort.  In retaliation for the U.S. drone attack in Iraq, Iran struck bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops. In the aftermath, Iran's military shot down Ukraine Airlines Flight PS752 shortly after it took off from Tehran, killing everyone on board, including 57 Canadians. It took several days for the Iranian government to admit it had accidentally shot the plane down while on high alert anticipating U.S. retaliation.   In a statement Friday, al-Sadr — the Iraqi cleric whose followers fought U.S. troops after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to oust dictator Saddam Hussein — issued a list of conditions for American military presence in Iraq. The list includes cancelling existing security agreements, closing U.S. military bases, ending the work of American security companies and closing off access to Iraqi airspace. If the conditions were met, the statement said, ""the resistance will temporarily stop until the last soldier leaves Iraq,"" al-Sadr said, referring to American troops. Al-Sadr, once a huge thorn in the side of the American occupation after the 2003 invasion, derives political capital from his ability to call on supporters to clog streets and paralyze all movement in Baghdad. Friday's rally came at a critical time as rival political blocs are jockeying over the selection of a premier to replace outgoing Adel Abdul-Mahdi. It was supported by mainstream Shia parties, including that of al-Sadr's political rival Hadi al-Ameri, who heads the Fatah bloc in parliament, as well as the Popular Mobilization Units, an umbrella group comprised of an array of militias, including Iran-backed groups. Al-Sadr ""proved once again he can amass the crowds to take them to the street, cleverly prevented any targeting of protesters in Tahrir Square,"" tweeted Farhad Alaadin, head of the Iraqi Advisory Council and a former presidential adviser. In response to a public outcry over the U.S. airstrike that killed Soleimani and al-Muhandis, Iraq's parliament passed a non-binding resolution this month, calling on the government to expel foreign troops from the country. Kurdish and most Sunni lawmakers boycotted the vote. ""The American forces should leave,"" said an 18-year-old protester, Amer Saad. ""I am ready to fight against the Americans if Muqtada al-Sadr asks us."" Police and militiamen of the Popular Mobilization Units also closed off roads leading to the protest site, in both Karada and Jadriya neighbourhoods of Baghdad. In Tahrir Square, anti-government protesters carefully eyed al-Sadr's anti-U.S. rally but no confrontation took place. As the anti-U.S. demonstration dwindled away by the early afternoon, the anti-government protesters remained in their sit-in. ""I am not against the Sadrist movement's demonstrations today, but if Muqtada asks for the exit of the Americans and non-intervention, he should raise the same slogan against Iranian interference, to be honest,"" said one of the anti-government protesters, Yahya Mohammed. In neighbouring Iran, Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the Baghdad march on Friday was a ""countdown"" to expelling U.S. forces. ""It indicated that Iraqi people are the flagship on the path of expelling the U.S. from the region,"" he said. Cleric Mohammad Hassan Abutorabifard who led Friday prayers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, told worshipers that Iraqis at the rally ""stood by Iranians"" following Soleimani's killing.

In May 2019, after racist graffiti was scrawled on a black Ottawa family's home, the force somewhat confusingly said it never had a dedicated unit to fighting hate crimes. It was a perplexing statement, given that there were multiple reports billing the hate crime unit as the first of its kind in Canada when it was created in 1993. On its 15th anniversary, former mayor Larry O'Brien heaped praise upon it — even declaring Jan.15 ""hate crime awareness day"" in the capital. That confusion led former interim chief Steve Bell to tell CBC News the unit was ""renamed or moved over to the security and intelligence"" section in January 2017. The force is now rebranding that section as its new dedicated hate crime section, with two new investigators eventually joining what will be a five-person unit, said deputy Chief Uday Jaswal. The officers in the new section will ""focus on the prevention of hate-motivated incidents through public education, outreach, and the development of intelligence to address extremism,"" the force said in a statement. Jaswal said the restructuring will offer a more ""centralized"" approach to tackling reports of hate crimes, which have been on the rise in recent years.  The previous approach involved investigators spread out among the force's west, central, and east detachments, Jaswal said — and that occasionally led to crime trends being missed. ""We're still going to have access to investigators across the city, but they'll be coordinated through the hate crimes section. [And the new section] will have its own investigative capacity to follow up."" There were 110 reports of hate crimes in Ottawa last year, the police service said, up from 104 in 2018 and 95 in 2017.

133,Erica Johnson,2019-09-23T00:00:51.953Z,Banks tell dozens of customers they're to blame for thousands of dollars lost to e-transfer fraudsters,"A Manitoba man says marketing that claims people are protected when they e-transfer money is misleading, after fraudsters stole $3,000 and TD Bank said he was to blame. Rene Trudeau e-transferred the maximum his bank allowed — $3,000 — to a contractor who installed a new front door on his home in February. He then e-transferred the remaining $300 owed and texted the contractor to let him know he'd been paid in full.  The contractor texted back, saying he didn't get the e-transfers and hadn't seen a dime. ""I kind of panic,"" Trudeau told Go Public from his home in Île-des-Chênes, just outside Winnipeg. ""Because at this point, all $3,300 is gone from my account."" Trudeau is one of dozens of people who contacted Go Public after a recent story about e-transfer fraud — all describing frustrating battles with their banks and questioning why exemptions that leave them on the hook when fraudsters strike are buried in the fine print of electronic banking agreements. Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact the Go Public team A police detective with Toronto's cybercrime unit says because e-transfer fraud is on the rise, financial institutions need to do a better job of informing customers about risks and how they can better protect themselves. ""They [banks] want to be good corporate citizens,"" said Det. Const. Kenrick Bagnall. ""They should … be more proactive."" As soon as Trudeau realized something was wrong, he contacted TD Bank and an employee was able to stop the $300 e-transfer from leaving his account. But the earlier $3,000 was gone. That was the beginning of a seven-month battle with TD, to try to track his money and get it back. ""When I asked where the money went, or how did this happen, they seemed more interested in absolving themselves of the responsibility for this fraud,"" said Trudeau. ""Customer service was atrocious."" He says it took three weeks before someone in TD's Customer Care department told him his money had been redirected to another chartered bank — which TD wouldn't name — and more than 10 weeks for TD to provide the RCMP with the financial information necessary to investigate. TD said the fraud occurred after a someone hacked into the contractor's email and correctly answered Trudeau's security question, which was ""What is your wife's name?""  Because it wasn't hard for the fraudster to figure out the answer — the contractor named his wife on his Facebook page — TD said Trudeau was to blame, pointing to a clause on page four of the bank's electronic financial terms and conditions. The agreement is similar to those in place at all the big banks and says customers must use tough security questions with answers only the sender and recipient can guess.  Trudeau admits his security question was weak, but says TD's marketing claims that customers who use e-transfer are ""protected"" and their money is ""secure,"" so it hadn't occurred to him that fraudsters could hack emails and redirect an e-transfer. ""They [banks] should be acknowledging that the system is not as secure as they say it is,"" Trudeau said.  Dozens of other people have recently contacted Go Public, describing how they, too, felt misled by their financial institutions after fraudsters diverted their e-transfer funds.  They point to how financial institutions market the convenience of e-transfers and make claims in bold print that the system is safe.  In smaller print — or, buried in online agreements — banks and credit unions outline a list of requirements a customer must meet in order to actually be protected, should something happen to their money.  ""They don't want to scare people away from using the service — which has a significant payoff for them,"" said Trudeau. ""It's quite frustrating."" All told, Go Public has learned about fraudsters using e-transfer to steal almost $64,000 from 56 people with accounts at TD, CIBC, Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Tangerine, Simplii, HSBC, Assiniboine Credit Union and Kawartha Credit Union.  Customers did not get their money back in almost three-quarters of the cases: Watch: Are e-transfers a safe way to send money?  After Go Public contacted TD Bank earlier this month about Trudeau, the bank reached out to him again.  Trudeau says they have now come to a ""satisfactory agreement,"" but he's not allowed to share details, because TD required him to sign a confidentiality agreement. TD declined to address Go Public's questions about where Trudeau's $3,000 e-transfer went, or why it took seven months to resolve the problem.  In an emailed statement to Go Public, TD's manager of corporate and public affairs Carla Hindman wrote: ""We have co-operated with the police investigation and have resolved this concern with our customer.""  In another e-transfer dispute, CIBC required a gag order before offering customer Charlotte Mustard $1,000 as a ""gesture of goodwill"" after $3,000 she transferred to pay for a new furnace in her Peterborough, Ont., home was stolen. ""That is the part that really got me,"" says Mustard. ""It was like they [CIBC] were saying, 'Here, take this money and go away and be quiet and don't bother us anymore.' Where's the goodwill in that? And where is the justice?"" She refused to sign the confidentiality agreement and contacted Go Public. ""It's very important for me to be heard — as a woman, as a senior. And I was not heard by the CIBC at all. As a matter of fact, I felt very, very discounted."" CIBC's senior consultant for public affairs, Crystal Jongeward, told Go Public in an email, ""We're continuing to work with the bank that received the funds to resolve the matter for our client."" The theft occurred last January. Go Public requested an interview with the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) to discuss why banks don't do more to educate customers about the importance of strong email security to protect against e-transfer fraud.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labrèche declined to be interviewed but said in a statement that banks widely publish information and tips about scams and provide electronic access agreements ""wherein customers commit to using passwords and security questions that are unique and cannot be easily guessed or obtained by others."" Bagnall, the Toronto detective, says Canada's banks need to do much more to warn customers about potential risks when using e-transfers, because the frauds being reported are ""the tip of the iceberg."" He said financial institutions may not be reporting fraud because it can cause ""reputational harm."" ""If customers start leaving … that could very much affect their business,"" said Bagnall. ""Damage to the brand is a huge reason why organizations are not reporting cybercrime to the police."" Bagnall says there's also no requirement for the banks to report e-transfer crime to the police. ""They're so large that there's not really a reason that they need to be transparent, because they can do their own internal investigations,"" he said. ""They really only need to report to the privacy commissioner."" Trudeau says the battle with his bank was exhausting, frustrating and has changed his online banking habits. He says he'll never again e-transfer a large amount of money — $20 is now his limit. Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

134,Kenneth Miller,2020-01-18T11:00:00.741Z,A husband pleads for the rights of wife with disabilities,"When I married my wife, Cheryl Miller, I promised to be loyal to her through sickness and in health.  She is my love and soulmate, whom I love dearly.  Unfortunately Cheryl has multiple sclerosis, and has lived with this disease for 45 years.  During this time, I have therefore become an advocate for my precious love — and for all disabled individuals.  Why?  Because they have to spend all their energy trying to live a rewarding life, with many challenges and worries ahead of them.  Many, including Cheryl, meet these challenges with great fortitude and bravery. Therefore it is incumbent on me that I continue to fight for changes that will make their lives better.  What are some of the challenges I see and changes that I would like to see?  Nothing is more frustrating than when I can't find a handicapped parking space — especially when a spot is taken by a vehicle without a handicapped permit.  A painted handicapped parking sign on concrete is useless, because after the first snowfall, it's usually covered up.  What is needed are handicapped signs that are on buildings or above ground.  We also need more of them. A lot more. There are too many places that have a limited number of handicapped parking spots, including close to hospitals!  What's more, these spots are rarely supervised, and offenders are rarely ticketed.  And on the off chance they are ticketed, the fines vary too much. Once we've found a parking spot, things don't get much better.   Many places have no ramps to get to the entrance, and often have two sets of doors to go through at a time, or lack automatic doors.  Access to these buildings is therefore extremely difficult.  Some of the doors also have a lip, where a wheelchair might tip over. (It doesn't take much.) Entrances and sidewalks are often uneven and dangerous.  Many beaches are inaccessible, in my opinion, because of little or no regard for the disabled. At least the beach at Birds Hill Provincial Park has beach access mats, but their handicapped trail cannot be safely travelled in a wheelchair!  Oh well, another battle for me to engage in.  Now let's compare Canada to the United States and their Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991. In it, there are clear federal requirements for accessible parking. What's more, states can also create further requirements and enforcement measures. These requirements also are enforced by local law officials instead of private parking authorities. Cheryl and I have been fortunate to vacation in Maui for several years and we don't think we've seen an individual illegally park in a handicapped zone. We also always find a handicapped parking spot, even when tourism is at its highest. Possible reasons? The signs in Maui state the fines associated with the offence. For example, my wife and I noticed handicapped signs that say ""HANDICAPPED PERMIT REQUIRED MAXIMUM FINE $500."" Furthermore, Cheryl and I witnessed handicapped parking spaces regularly being supervised in Maui.  And unlike here, these parking requirements are enforced by local law officials — the Maui police — instead of private parking authorities. Also, all of their signs are above ground where they are easy to see.  Does the United States ensure better care for the disabled than Canada?  When it comes to accessibility, in my opinion, the answer is a resounding ""YES.""  I have talked to different government agencies and officials about implementing changes to make the lives of disabled individuals easier. It has been a never-ending battle with many obstacles, but one that I will gladly continue.  My God, Canadians with disabilities have enough challenges to contend with every day! On a final note, we have an aging population, which, realistically, could mean an increase of disabled individuals.  What we need are far-sighted and compassionate women and men, who can empathise with the disabled community.  In fact, I invite them to live a day … no, a month … no, a year, with the challenges my wife and I have to contend with.  Until the people in power make the necessary changes to make the lives of individuals with disabilities better, the quest will continue for their human (God-given) rights!  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

135,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:45:54.777Z,"World needs to prepare for millions of climate displaced, UN says","The world needs to prepare for millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Tuesday. Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a UN ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments. The UN Human Rights Committee made the landmark ruling on Monday in relation to Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand after authorities denied his claim of asylum. ""The ruling says if you have an immediate threat to your life due to climate change, due to the climate emergency, and if you cross the border and go to another country, you should not be sent back, because you would be at risk of your life, just like in a war or in a situation of persecution,"" Grandi said. ""We must be prepared for a large surge of people moving against their will,"" he said. ""I wouldn't venture to talk about specific numbers, it's too speculative, but certainly we're talking about millions here."" Potential drivers include wildfires like those seen in Australia, rising sea levels affecting low-lying islands, the destruction of crops and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa and floods worldwide, not least in parts of the developed world. Whereas for most of its 70 years UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, has worked to assist those fleeing poorer countries as a result of conflict, climate change is more indiscriminate. ""It is further proof that refugee movements and the broader issue of migration of populations ... is a global challenge that cannot be confined to a few countries,"" said Grandi. Yet the convention relating to the status of refugees, signed in 1951, made no provision for climate change as a reason for people to flee their country and seek asylum elsewhere. As climate impacts grow, legal questions become more complicated. UNHCR, whose budget has risen from $1.3 billion Cdn a year in the early 1990s to $11 billion in 2019 as conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria have forced civilians to flee, now assists more than 70 million forcibly displaced people. Turkey is the largest recipient, with more than 4 million refugees and asylum seekers, the vast majority from Syria. That has strained Turkey's public finances and led President Tayyip Erdogan to demand more assistance from Europe. Last November, Erdogan threatened to open the door for Syrian refugees to head to Europe unless the European Union stepped up, and he is now calling for the ""resettlement"" of up to 1 million Syrians in the north of their homeland. Grandi said European governments needed to think hard about solutions to the migrant crisis, which has affected them since 2015, but also show more understanding of Turkey's situation. ""We must recognize that, for the past several years (Turkey)has been hosting the largest refugee population in the world,"" he said. ""There's a lot of political talk. I concentrate on the substance of this, which is 'let's strengthen Turkey's ability to host refugees until they can go back safely, voluntarily to their countries'.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-refugees-un-1.5435843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/canada-climate-refugees-1.5165029,N/A
136,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-23T20:00:43.698Z,'Is that even legal?': Companies may be sharing new credit or debit card information without you knowing,"A Vancouver woman is sounding the alarm for millions of Canadians who have credit and debit cards, after information about her debit card was shared when it shouldn't have been. Vanessa Acuña blames an ""updating service"" that some credit and debit card companies have that allows new account numbers and expiry dates to be shared with merchants customers have dealt with in the past.  Information about the sharing of this kind of information with third party companies is often buried in the fine print of bank and credit card agreements. She thought the details of her Visa debit card — a debit card that can be used for online purchases — were secure. ""[I thought], 'How is this legal?'"" Acuña said after discovering PayPal was given the new expiry date on her Visa debit card without her knowledge. Visa — and other major credit cards — have ""updater"" programs, that automatically provide updated customer credit card information to subscribing merchants, including account numbers and expiry dates. Companies automatically opt-in their customers to the service, whether they realize it or not.  The program is meant to be a convenience for customers and help merchants avoid missed payments on recurring bills. ""I have huge privacy concerns … I would really prefer that they tell you and give you an option to opt out of it. But that's not what they did."" The merchants who get the automatic updates pay for the service.   Thomas Keenan, author of TechnoCreep — a book about how technology is eroding privacy — says financial institutions need to ask themselves if they should be making money by sharing customers' information.  ""Banks make a business out of information sharing. They actually have services — Visa, MasterCard — and they are paid to share that information,"" said Keenan.  Acuña believes that updater service is the reason the online payment system got her card information when it shouldn't have — but when she tried to find out why it happened, she couldn't. Acuña thought what happened to her private information was her decision, when PayPal sent an email in March asking her to update her debit card's expiry date.  She says she ignored the request, since she opened the account five years ago and rarely shops online and didn't want PayPal to have her new card information.  ""Two days afterwards, I got another email saying, 'Oh we updated for you, so you don't have to.' And I just thought 'what?'"" Acuña said. She spent hours on the phone with TD Canada Trust, PayPal and Visa Canada, but instead of getting an explanation, she got three different answers. PayPal told Acuña it got her new expiry date from her ""financial institution or her credit card company.""  Visa and TD both denied giving PayPal that information. ""[They said] they don't know who gave PayPal my information, which I don't think is a very good answer,"" Acuña said. It turns out Acuña's information shouldn't have been shared at all, since only Visa credit — not debit — cards are part of the updating agreement with TD. Yet, none of the three companies involved will explain how her new debit card data ended up with PayPal.  After initially telling Go Public it got Acuña's information from the ""account update services,"" PayPal  backtracked a few days later, saying the account updater service ""doesn't apply"" in Acuña's case. So, how did PayPal get her new expiry date? It won't say, citing customer confidentiality — even though Acuña agreed to waive confidentiality to allow the company to answer Go Public's questions. Visa Canada and TD also won't say who gave her card's new expiry date to PayPal.  ""Visa does not automatically update expiry date information on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders,"" a Visa spokesperson said in an email. ""Please refer your questions to PayPal."" ""TD has no ability to automatically update expiry date information with merchants on behalf of TD Visa debit cardholders. For more information about the service, we recommend reaching out to Visa,"" wrote Geraldine Anderson from the bank's public relations department. The lack of answers is why banks and credit card companies shouldn't be sharing any credit or debit card information without clear consent from customers, says Ann Cavoukian, who heads up the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence at Ryerson University in Toronto.  ""It's totally unacceptable,"" said Cavoukian, who worked as Ontario's information and privacy commissioner from 1997-2014. ""PayPal is one thing. But your own personal bank where your financial info is stored and kept? As I keep telling businesses, this is not your information. The information belongs to the individual."" She wants to see banks get what she calls ""positive informed consent"" before providing a third party with a customer's information.  ""The banks have to step up and do this. They can't just assume you're OK with them sharing your new credit information.""  Cavoukian wants to see Canada's privacy legislation, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, upgraded to match the one the European Union introduced in May. The General Data Protection Regulation is considered to have some of the world's strictest online privacy rules. For now, if customers want to stop merchants from getting updated credit card information, they have to opt out through their banks — although it's unclear if that would have helped Acuña.

138,"Katie Pedersen, Melissa Mancini, David Common",2019-11-23T16:17:02.731Z,Seniors' homes using 'trespass orders' to ban family members from visiting,"Mary Sardelis wasn't allowed to visit her 97-year-old mother's Ottawa retirement home for almost a year. Sardelis lives less than five minutes away from her mother Voula, but the home prevented Sardelis from seeing her, using sections of Ontario's trespass law. ""For 316 days … I was banned from entering the home,"" she said. ""You have no idea of the toll it's taken."" She could call, but her mother's hearing is poor and she often couldn't understand what her daughter was saying.  ""All I could hear was her fears or concerns. And I couldn't even soothe her."" Sardelis was banned from City View Retirement Community under Ontario's Trespass to Property Act. So-called trespass orders allow private property owners to limit who can come onto the premises and, some experts say, are being increasingly used to keep out family members who complain about conditions in retirement and long-term care homes. It's difficult to know how often homes ban or restrict family members, since families have to breach the trespass order for there to be any record of it. WATCH: Daughter banned from visiting 97-year-old mother at retirement home. Jane Meadus, a lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for the Elderly in Toronto, estimates she gets calls about trespass orders in long-term care homes and retirement homes at least once a week.  ""Generally, what happens is that it's a family member who is in visiting their family member and they get upset,"" she said. Marketplace reviewed over a dozen cases of family members from provinces across Canada who say they believe the homes were trying to silence them for advocating on behalf of their loved ones. ""The person maybe raises their voices and the home says, 'Well, that's it. You're not coming anymore, because we see you as a danger,'"" said Meadus. WATCH: Voula Sardelis waves to her daughter on the sidewalk outside her retirement home. ""If [the complainants] were really a danger, they should be calling the police. So if they were actually threatening someone, that's what they should be doing, ""But instead, what they're doing is to try to control their premises, trying to stifle people from complaining and trying to stifle people from speaking out on behalf of these very vulnerable seniors."" The home told Marketplace they prohibited Sardelis from visiting her mother because she was ""aggressive"" towards staff. But she believes she was banned for speaking out and filing complaints about the living conditions at the home which she felt were intolerable. Meadus said in Ontario, homes do not have the right to ban residents' visitors. When it comes to retirement homes, residents who pay to live on the property have a right to receive visitors they choose ""without interference,"" she said, citing case law established in Cunningham vs. Whitby Christian Non-Profit Housing Corp. That case found that banning guests of a tenant would contravene Section 23 (1) of the Ontario Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, which entitles a tenant to ""quiet enjoyment"" of their space. Meadus says in the case of long-term care, they have the same rights under Section 3 (14) of the Long-Term Care Homes Act, which states that every resident has the right ""to receive visitors of his or her choice … without interference."" The home says it ""disagrees"" with that analysis and that it has the right to ban anyone deemed to have breached its ""zero-tolerance abuse"" policy. Meadus has been invited to train Toronto's police officers on how to deal with calls from retirement and long-term care homes that try to use Trespass to Property Act against family members. ""When we talk to police officers, they're surprised and they're usually very grateful that we've provided that information to them. That's not something that they're trained for generally,"" she said. Meadus says often the families she has heard from have negotiated for restricted visits, agreeing to only come into the home during certain hours or under certain conditions.  That was the case for Susan Macaulay, who says her mother's Quebec long-term care home threatened to ban her, and ultimately issued restrictions on her visits. ""I was a thorn in the side of the managers,"" she said. ""They threatened on several occasions to not allow me to see my mother."" Macaulay said the home sent her a letter stating that she would only be allowed to visit between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. — the two hours of the afternoon when her mom was normally asleep. She said she tried to explain to her mother, who had dementia, why she wasn't going to be visiting as much. ""If I don't come to visit, it's not because I don't want to,"" she recalls telling her mother.  ""I thought that if they stopped me from coming to see her, she would never know why I didn't come."" Macaulay faced restrictions on her visits to her mother for 18 months, until her mother died. In Ontario, the Trespass to Property Act doesn't allow people who have been issued a ban to fight it. Once a notice or verbal warning is given to someone on the property, the only way to fight the ban is to go back to the property and wait for the owner to call the police. Meadus says most of the time, families don't challenge the order, because they would have to get arrested to do so.  But for Mary Sardelis, her fear of being arrested wasn't enough to stop her. In March 2019, she went into the retirement home even though she was banned and waited for the home to call the police and arrest her. She hoped that this way, she would be able to bring the matter before a judge. The police were called, and Sardelis was charged under the Trespass to Property Act. ""Someone had to do something,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it will just keep going on and on and on."" But in October, Sardelis found out she wouldn't have to go to court after all. Her lawyer met with the home's lawyers, after which the prosecutors dropped the charges. The home told Marketplace it will let her visit as long as she follows their rules. Although her battle is seemingly over, Sardelis said on behalf of her mother, she'll continue to advocate for other family members in her community who have been banned from visiting their loved ones. ""I'll do whatever it takes to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else,"" she said. ""I will not stop.""

139,Saša Petricic,2020-01-24T04:40:59.676Z,Beijing struggles to keep up with a virus  — and a nation on the move,"At Beijing's central railway station, the crowds stream in, ticket in hand, suitcase in tow, surgical mask in place. This last item has become an integral part of this year's Lunar New Year celebrations. ""I'm very worried about the virus,"" said Zhang Luyao, a twenty-something on her way home to China's north. ""It's spreading really fast, and there are so many people around me."" Indeed, tens of millions of people are on the move this week, travelling across China and abroad.  It's the largest annual human migration on earth. And this year, it may exacerbate a very human vulnerability: infection from the new strain of coronavirus, now potentially being spread by all the travellers.  On Wednesday, the Chinese National Health Commission underlined the ""risk of further spread of the epidemic"" by all the movement of people. The virus would have opportunities to infect many more people, through coughing, sneezing or breathing, said the Deputy Director of the Commission, Li Bin — and would alter and mutate. The new coronavirus likely came from wild animals, almost certainly transferring to humans at a wholesale seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December. Many of those initially infected had been at the market, and the vast majority of confirmed cases now are still in Wuhan and the province around it, Hubei. In a dramatic move on Thursday, China effectively quarantined Wuhan, cutting air and rail service to the city of 11 million people and closing down public transit within it. A government edict said citizens should not leave Wuhan unless they had ""special conditions.""  The World Health Organization commended China for ""minimizing risks locally and abroad"" with the move. But is it too late? Infections have already been showing up in many parts of the country, from Beijing to Macau, Shanghai to Shenzhen. And abroad in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. The first North American case is in Washington State, a man who recently travelled to China. The number of these cases has grown by hundreds this week, and some days, the deaths attributed to the virus has doubled. Unusually for China, the number of cases have all been announced in daily briefings and hourly updates, and carried in state media over the past days. Some people have been left reeling, feeling numb from the speed and scale of the outbreak — and helpless. Pang Zifen sat on a suitcase Wednesday in front of the Beijing railway station with her young son. Both wore masks.  ""We don't normally wear these,"" she said with a sigh, ""and I'm not sure how useful they are. But I want to protect my son and I just don't know what else to do.""  As the easiest form of protection, masks have been selling out at stores across China.  Still, there are those who don't believe they are being told the whole story. ""I don't that trust what I see,"" said He Wen, a 27 year-old traveller at the Shanghai railway station. ""I think the number of the infected could be far more than that reported."" Online, there's been anger as well, though censors have been removing many negative comments on China's controlled internet. One post under the name 'Phoenix' said ""hiding the virulence of the virus or the number of people infected is a cover-up! We must hold them accountable, no matter how high the responsibility goes."" There is reason for suspicion.  In 2002, when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) appeared in China's southern Guangdong province, it took three months for state media to report on it. And even then, the message was to reassure people that it wasn't a serious problem.  Meanwhile, the country was dealing with more than 1,800 confirmed cases and close to 80 deaths. SARS went on to kill almost 800 people worldwide, with experts blaming China's slow response for making the problem worse. SARS is also a coronavirus, closely related to the new strain.  Beijing eventually admitted it was a mistake to try to hide the SARS outbreak, and China's Health Minister and the mayor of Beijing were removed from their positions. There was little news about the current coronavirus in its early days as well, until this week when Chinese state media reported that President Xi Jinping told his officials that ""people's lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed."" Information began to flow. But so has China's mass migration. The crowds at the Beijing railway station are as big as ever. So is the demand for masks… and the sense of worry on the faces of those who wear them. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/beijing-struggles-keep-up-with-virus-1.5437234,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-travel-china-lunar-new-year-coronavirus-1.5437038 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/china-chinese-new-year-winnipeg-coronavirus-1.5437059 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cornavirus-screening-1.5435523,N/A

141,Thomas Daigle,2020-01-24T09:00:00.324Z,"After Jeff Bezos hack, calls for greater controls on hacking tools","The recent revelation that Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos fell victim to smartphone hacking — allegedly involving Saudi Arabia's crown prince — has cast a light on the shadowy world of cyber weapons sales. Organizations as prominent as the United Nations and Amnesty International have demanded better controls be implemented over the way digital arms and private surveillance tools are sold. But those calls have come before, and experts say the attack on Bezos, one of the wealthiest people in the world, highlights how journalists and free speech activists, among other groups, remain at risk. ""These allegations demonstrate that nobody is safe from the use of this kind of technology,"" the UN's point person on free speech, David Kaye, told CBC News in an interview. He warned that people ""should understand the reach of the private surveillance industry."" Kaye and Agnès Callamard, both UN special rapporteurs, on Wednesday published details of the Bezos hack, stemming from a private consulting firm's forensic analysis of the billionaire's iPhone.  The company, hired by Bezos, assessed with ""medium to high confidence"" that his device had been infected with spyware when he received a video file from the account of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the Facebook-owned instant messaging service WhatsApp. The analysis found ""unprecedented"" data transmission from the iPhone began within hours of Bezos receiving the suspect video — apparently allowing hackers to steal gigabytes of files from his device over ""some months."" The incident, on May 1, 2018, came months ahead of the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime — and columnist for Bezos's newspaper — at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The hack also came before the National Enquirer tabloid obtained private texts and photos revealing Bezos's extramarital affair. His longtime wife later filed for divorce. Norway-based human rights activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, a friend of Khashoggi's, told CBC hacking tools are being handed ""to governments that are simply irresponsible."" ""Given the current state of affairs, I think we need a moratorium on the sale and transfer of this technology,"" he said. Saudi officials called claims of the Kingdom's involvement in the hack ""absurd."" The UN report calls for national and international authorities to institute export control regimes on private surveillance technology. Conventional weapons, by contrast, are subject to worldwide agreements such as the UN-brokered Arms Trade Treaty. Involving more than 100 countries, the treaty sets norms for cross-border arms sales and seeks to prevent human rights abuses. Although analysts found no malware in Bezos's smartphone, experts said it's possible the malicious code could have hidden its own tracks after the infection. The UN report pointed to two types of spyware ""that can hook into legitimate applications to bypass detection and obfuscate activity."" The first, known as ""Pegasus,"" created by the Israeli-based NSO Group, was suspected of being used by Saudis before, to spy on critics abroad. The second ""less likely"" option, according to the report, is that hackers employed Galileo, otherwise known as ""Remote Control Service,"" developed by the Hacking Team. The Milan-based group was reported to have sold cyber tools to the FBI in the past. Hacking Team did not reply to a request for comment. NSO, however, vigorously defended its work in an emailed statement, saying ""our technology was not used in this instance … our products are only used to investigate terror and serious crime."" Saudi Arabia was previously reported to have spent $55 million US on Pegasus. The Israeli firm, though, claimed this week its tools cannot be used on U.S. phone numbers. It did not explain whether the apparent measure was included in its code, or whether it could be modified by a client after its sale. It's not the first time NSO distanced itself from similar allegations. In October, WhatsApp sued the firm in U.S. federal court, claiming NSO had helped governments spy on 1,400 users around the world. NSO said at the time it denied the allegations and vowed to ""vigorously fight them."" Separately, WhatsApp's developers recently said they had fixed a bug that allowed for malicious code to be inserted into an MP4, the same type of video file believed to have been sent to Bezos. The alleged targets were not named in court. Quebec resident Omar Abdulaziz, however, is among Saudi Arabia's critics believed to have been hit with spyware — likely NSO's Pegasus, according to research carried out by the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard, who wrote a book on the Saudi crown prince, also said on Twitter this week that ""operators linked to Saudi Arabia"" tried to hack his phone a month after the attack on Bezos. He thanked Citizen Lab for having ""checked it out."" This week's UN report said Saudi Arabia targeted Bezos principally in his role as owner of the Post, which published Khashoggi's criticism of the regime. Ronald Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab, said the Bezos case serves as ""a reminder that the proliferation of commercial spyware is a global security problem for all sectors, from government and businesses to civil society."" He said his group had identified ""hundreds of journalists, human rights defenders, politicians, and others who have been targeted with these technologies."" Citizen Lab stressed it was not part of the private analysis of Bezos's iPhone, but published recommendations for how the consulting firm could further investigate the source of the hack. Amnesty International is also involved in court action in Israel, where activists are attempting to get the country's defence ministry to block NSO from exporting its products. ""NSO continues to profit from its spyware being used to commit abuses against activists across the world and the Israeli government has stood by and watched it happen,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy director of Amnesty's tech division. Kaye, the UN special rapporteur, said Citizen Lab's work has shown spyware is all too often used by rogue regimes to silence or intimidate activists, dissenters and reporters. He said it's been illustrated so many times it's ""no longer surprising, but still shocking.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bezos-hack-controls-on-hacking-tools-1.5438388,https://www.cbc.ca/news/theweekly/the-canadian-researcher-who-helped-expose-a-new-cyber-weapon-the-weekly-with-wendy-mesley-1.5368893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/un-experts-call-for-investigation-after-saudis-linked-to-jeff-bezos-phone-hack-1.5435739,N/A
142,Mike Crawley,2020-01-23T19:05:54.599Z,"Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals are filled beyond capacity nearly every day, new data reveals","Overcrowding has become so common in Ontario hospitals that patient beds are now placed in hallways and conference rooms not only at times of peak demand, but routinely day after day, research by CBC News reveals.  New data obtained through a freedom of information request show the widespread extent of the province's ""hallway medicine"" problem, something that Premier Doug Ford has promised to end. An exclusive analysis of the data by CBC News shows that hospital gridlock — a phenomenon that used to be restricted to surges in patients during flu season — is the new normal.  Some of Ontario's biggest hospitals were filled beyond 100 per cent occupancy nearly every day in the first half of last year.  Five hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as the main hospital in Hamilton, Sudbury, Peterborough and Niagara Falls all spent more than 160 days over their funded capacity during the 181-day period from January through June 2019. CBC News analyzed data for all 169 acute care hospital sites in the province during this six-month time frame. Some of the key findings:  An expert on hospital administration calls the figures ""astonishing"" and says they demonstrate that overcrowding is now a widespread phenomenon around Ontario. ""These are really big numbers,"" said Donald Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at University of Toronto. He said the data show the hallway medicine problem is neither occasional nor restricted to a few hospitals. Redelmeier said such chronic overcapacity makes the hospital experience extremely dissatisfying for patients, it means non-emergency surgeries get postponed, and it means when there's a surge of new patients, there's nowhere to relieve the congestion.  ""You ought not to be striving for 100 per cent capacity because it doesn't leave you any reserve for when things get tough,"" said Redelmeier, who is also an internal medicine specialist at Sunnybrook Hospital.   ""We've got warning signs going off all over the province and the situation just isn't viable,"" said Anthony Dale, chief executive of the Ontario Hospital Association.  WATCH: Overcrowding affects patients from the moment they enter ER ""All across the province you have hospitals at extremely high levels of occupancy,"" said Dale in an interview with CBC News. ""What we're seeing is that it's no longer just during the flu season but it's all year round."" The chronic nature of the overcrowding ""is simply not sustainable, not for patients, not for people who work in hospitals,"" Dale said  The acute care hospital site that was the most frequently filled beyond capacity was Mackenzie Health's 333-bed Richmond Hill Hospital. Its acute care wards were overcapacity on all but two days in this six-month period.    A tour of its emergency room in the early afternoon of a recent weekday — typically a time of lower ER volumes as compared to evenings and weekends — revealed around a dozen patients on stretchers in the corridors or placed alongside the nursing station desk. The situation has become so entrenched that signs are posted assigning hallway spots an official bed number. ""For our staff who work in this environment, they would describe it as constantly working under crisis,"" said Mary-Agnes Wilson, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Mackenzie Health, which runs Richmond Hill Hospital.  Richmond Hill provides an example of how the ripple effect of overcapacity in acute care wards is felt in the emergency department. Even after being admitted, a patient typically spends hours stuck in the ER waiting for a ward bed to open up. Over the past year, the average patient admitted to an Ontario hospital spent more than 16 hours in the ER before getting a ward bed, according to provincial data.   At the Greater Niagara General Hospital in Niagara Falls, the average admitted patient waited 46 hours in the ER before getting a bed on a ward in November, the most recent month for which statistics are available. Although the occupancy data analyzed by CBC News comes from the first half of 2019, there's little if any indication the situation has improved since then. Niagara Health says the overcapacity problem across its three acute care hospital sites did not improve in the second half of 2019, averaging 104 per cent during both six-month periods last year.  At Southlake Regional Health Centre, a 500-bed facility in Newmarket, occupancy averaged 110 per cent in the first six months of 2019, according to the data. In the second half of the year, occupancy averaged 113 per cent, says the hospital's CEO, Arden Krystal.  Hospitals' chief method of coping with the demand is to place beds in makeshift locations, now officially enshrined as ""unconventional spaces"" in the Ontario health care bureaucracy. At Richmond Hill, a former meeting room now houses 10 patients separated by cubicle dividers. At Southlake Regional Health Centre, overflow spaces include former exercise rooms and a kitchenette.  ""We try to fill every nook and cranny because the risk of having 40 or 50 admitted patients standing in our emergency department is even greater than filling those spaces,"" said Krystal. ""When emergency gets backed up, they start to get worried that they can't assess people quickly enough to make sure that they can stay safe.""  Figures provided by the Ministry of Health suggest a five to six per cent drop in the use of unconventional spaces province-wide over the past year.   ""It was increasing steadily year over year but we have managed to halt that,"" said Health Minister Christine Elliott.  That still means nearly 1,000 Ontario patients are being housed in hallways, lunch rooms and auditoriums every day. Elliott admitted it will take ""several years"" to achieve Ford's promise of ending hallway health care.   ""This isn't a problem that grew up overnight, it has been building up over a number of years,"" Elliott said in an interview Tuesday. ""There's no simple solution to change it, there's a lot of action that needs to be taken and we are doing that.""  The number of acute care hospital beds in Ontario has stayed effectively the same for 20 years, at around 20,000 while the province's population has grown by three million people. Ontario now has fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than any other province: 1.4 beds for every 1,000 people. That's on par with Mexico, and half the number in the U.S. WATCH | Anthony Dale of the Ontario Hospital Association says hospital overcrowding is putting a strain on health-care providers But shortages of care available outside the hospital system are also crucial factors in the overcrowding. On any day, one out of six hospital beds is occupied by a patient who doesn't need to be in hospital, but cannot be safely discharged home. This is a long-running phenomenon in health systems across Canada known as ""alternate level of care"" (ALC). Lengthy waits for long-term care spaces are the chief cause, but a lack of available home care and other forms of continuing care also contributes.  While the number of ALC patients in Ontario hospitals hovered between 3,500 and 4,000 for the first half of the 2010s, it grew over the past five years, exceeding 5,300 in September 2019, according to figures from the Ontario Hospital Association.  This means creating new hospital beds is not necessarily a better solution than freeing up the beds occupied by patients who ought to be elsewhere.  Ford became premier in June 2018, and his Progressive Conservative government by no means created the hallway medicine trend. The previous Liberal government froze hospitals' annual base funding for four years running.  Nor is hospital overcrowding restricted to Ontario. Recent reports of overflowing patients come from Montreal, Saskatoon,  Moncton, N.B. and Kentville, N.S. Some of the most obvious solutions to the problem won't happen quickly or without a major outlay of public money. One  top priority is expanding the number of long-term care facilities to meet the demands of a senior population that is growing in number and in the complexity of its needs. The Ford government is embarking on a long-term reform of the health system that includes reorganizing how funding is provided. The aim is to shift those hospital patients who don't need to be there into care elsewhere.  The reform is centred on teams that bring together hospitals, home-care agencies and long-term care facilities in geographic areas. Each team will receive a combined pot of funding to provide the range of health services its population needs.   Hospitals are taking their own steps to try to reduce patient demand. For people with chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, Niagara Health has focused on developing programs to support the patients at home after discharge. ""This has already shown great reductions in emergency department visits, hospital readmissions and days spent in hospital,"" said Derek McNally, Niagara Health's executive vice-president of clinical services and chief nursing executive. ""We know that there's a lot more work that we need to do,"" said Elliott. ""It's like taking an ocean liner and turning it around. it doesn't happen on a dime.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/hospitals-ottawa-cheo-children-overcapacity-1.5435005 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-hallway-medicine-healthcare-over-capacity-1.5434572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/hallway-medicine-unfortunate-reality-for-guelph-general-hospital-1.5435015 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/across-sw-ontario-small-hospitals-struggle-with-overcapacity-1.5434670 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-civic-etobicoke-general-hallway-health-care-1.5339511 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/hospital-health-sciences-north-overcrowding-1.5139909 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/ontario-health-care-1.4912674 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-premier-doug-ford-health-care-rueben-devlin-1.4997601,N/A
143,Paige Parsons,2020-01-24T13:00:00.900Z,'Heartbroken': Mother says daughter still waiting for reading with 'Mom's a Medium' star,"Candice Lemay was at a loss for how to help her young daughter. The teenager, whose father had died unexpectedly when she was a toddler, was struggling. Finally, the mother from Tofield, Alta., struck upon the idea to give her daughter a chance to speak to her dad, through the aid of a psychic medium. Lemay did research and discovered local psychic medium Carmel Joy Baird — something of a celebrity in the medium world, having starred in a two-season run of the reality show Mom's a Medium.  Lemay paid $525 for a 30-minute appointment with Baird on May 2, 2017, booking her daughter, now 15, in for a session on Nov. 23, 2018. But, like other clients of Baird who shared stories of frustration with CBC in 2018, Lemay said the reading was cancelled and has yet to be rescheduled.  In an interview, Baird defended her business practices despite the long delays for clients, maintaining that she is following the terms and conditions they had agreed to. Lemay said she has exchanged a number of emails with Baird's staff asking about rescheduling, and has also asked for a refund. She said it has been hard to watch her daughter's hopes dashed. ""She actually still asks if she'll ever get it, and I pretty much tell her no. She is heartbroken by it, because she really wanted to talk to her dad."" Over a year after the original appointment date, Lemay said she's at a loss about what to do. ""I just don't want anybody else to make this mistake,"" she said. ""I'm not asking for my money back. I gave up on that. I just don't want anyone else heartbroken like my daughter is."" In an interview in June 2018, Baird blamed medical and family issues for the delays. She claimed she was making changes and planned to introduce a new refund system. She stopped accepting new bookings for readings, so she would be able to catch up. But in an interview with CBC last month, Baird said she decided not to give refunds after all, citing advice from lawyers, and argued that the policies outlined in her terms and conditions protect and offer flexibility for clients who have scheduling issues arise due to their own health or other concerns. ""It's a different type of business,"" Baird said. ""There isn't anything like this. It's not like your stores, or your products. You only have one person."" Baird said she is working through her waitlist, and stands by a number system she implemented to manage the bookings, as well as her offer that clients who are waiting for a reading can instead use the ""credit"" for the amount they've paid to purchase something from her online store. ""I feel like I've done everything I can to be very black and white, and very fair,"" Baird said. In an email on Dec. 3, 2018, Lemay was told she was No. 1,539 on Baird's reading waitlist. In May 2019, when she asked for an update, a staff member told Lemay in an email that there were still about 1,400 people waiting for readings. Baird said she is continuing to experience health challenges but expects she will be through the list by the end of 2020.  She said she finds it frustrating that people don't reciprocate the empathy and understanding she extended to them as she deals with a loss in her family and ongoing health issues.  ""Sure, I think I'm guilty of trying to help too many people at once,"" she said. ""But I think I'm innocent of saying that 'I'm a fraud, or that I have bad intentions, or that  I'm a bad person, or that I'm wrong.' I think I've asked for patience and time, and understanding and empathy for my own grief and journey."" Lemay said she wasn't aware of the terms and conditions when she paid — including that Baird could opt to do the reading by phone rather than in person. But a copy of an email interest form Lemay filled out in October 2016 shows that the terms and conditions were available to her.  In a chain of emails shared with CBC, Lemay repeatedly asked Baird's staff for updates on her daughter's appointment, and asked for a refund multiple times. ""A refund is not possible. Our lawyers have instructed us to stand by our policies,"" an employee wrote in response on Nov. 8, 2019. The employee offered to help Lemay use her $525 credit for a different purchase, and told her that otherwise she would be in touch when the number for Lemay's daughter's reading comes up.  In other messages, Baird's employees advised Lemay by email that people waiting for readings would have the option to use the money they paid in advance  as credit toward anything Baird sells in her online store. In an email Tuesday, one of Baird's employees claimed that offering credit to Lemay amounts to giving her a refund. A number of courses and products are advertised on Baird's website, such as the $800 ""Personal Psychic Pen Pal Service,"" which allows buyers to ask Baird two questions per month and receive responses for a year. Another option is a $99 ""Manifesting Magic"" online course. Baird also hosts events: a general admission ticket to a two-day event scheduled for June at Baird's ranch is $200, though customers can also upgrade to a ""platinum"" $600 ticket.  Baird and her staff claim that most of her clients are happy with the service they've received, despite the long waits. Baird's Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile is not accredited, but reports 119 complaints over the past three years. In the past 12 months, 25 new complaints were closed, most about having appointments cancelled and not rescheduled, or stating that the company fails to respond to communications asking for refunds.The BBB has maintained a ""pattern of complaint"" alert on Baird's profile outlining the persistent issues consumers have had in receiving requested services. ""...while the company has responded to the pattern outlining its corporate policy terms and conditions, the underlying causes of the pattern remain unresolved to BBB's satisfaction,"" a spokesperson said in an email. In an email to CBC, one of Baird's employees claimed that a Better Business Bureau employee told them the agency is ""supporting"" Baird's policies, and also claimed to have been told that Baird is operating within provincial guidelines and legislation for businesses by Service Alberta — the provincial ministry that oversees consumer protection issues. BBB president and CEO Seanna Lawrence said by email that she reviewed the BBB's communications with Baird's business and found nothing to suggest her staff indicated they support Baird's policies. ""BBB did one more than one occasion, encourage the business to update its policies, indicating that it would be better for the conciliation process between the business and consumers,"" Lawrence said. In an email, Tricia Velthuizen, press secretary to the minister of Service Alberta, said the department could not comment on Baird's claim that the policies follow provincial rules. In an earlier statement Velthuzien confirmed the department is ""aware of this ongoing issue."" In response to CBC queries in 2018, Service Alberta confirmed that it has investigated several complaints against Baird in recent years. However, no enforcement action has been taken against Baird, according to a search of Service Alberta's enforcement database.  An Edmonton police spokesperson confirmed that its economic crimes investigators received one complaint about Baird in 2019, but referred all inquiries to Service Alberta. A search of court records found Baird has never faced charges. Service Alberta did offer the following tips to consumers looking to purchase what they described as ""these types of services"": Lemay said she approached CBC because she doesn't see how authorities can do anything about her issue with Baird. Despite everything she has been through, she still believes a reading from a different service provider will help her child.  ""I believe in it,"" she said. ""One hundred per cent believe in it. I think a word from my daughter's father would change her mind in life, which I think she needs.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/mother-says-daughter-still-waiting-for-reading-with-mom-s-a-medium-star-1.5436347,[],N/A
144,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:08:14.631Z,Indigenous pipeline supporters slam human-rights advocates over Coastal GasLink stance,"A collective of First Nations who support the liquefied natural gas industry in British Columbia say human rights advocates failed to do their research when they called for the Coastal GasLink pipeline project to be halted. The First Nations LNG Alliance has issued open letters to the B.C. human rights commissioner and the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination over statements they made about the pipeline. The commissioner and committee both called for the project to be stopped in the face of opposition from Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, who say the project has no authority without their consent. Both said the free, prior and informed consent of all affected Indigenous groups should be granted before any project is allowed to proceed. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with 20 elected First Nation councils along the pipeline's 670-kilometre path but the Wet'suwet'en chiefs say within their territory, those councils only administer small reserves and it's the hereditary chiefs who hold jurisdiction over a broader area covering 22,000 square kilometres. Karen Ogen-Toews, CEO of the First Nations LNG Alliance, says in the letter to human rights commissioner Kasari Govender that the pipeline was approved through a democratic process that Indigenous people participated in freely, and neither the committee nor commissioner consulted supportive Indigenous groups before taking a position. No one could be reached for comment at the UN committee and Govender was not available for an interview Tuesday. ""It is disheartening to see that the input from 20 First Nations, who participated extensively during five years of consultation on the pipeline, and have successfully negotiated agreements with Coastal GasLink, is so easily dismissed by the B.C. Human Rights Commission,"" Ogen-Toews says in one of the open letters. Ogen-Toews was elected chief of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation, representing 255 members on and off reserve lands, for six years. The Wet'suwet'en First Nation covers a smaller area than the Wet'suwet'en Nation, over which the hereditary clan chiefs claim authority. The letter accuses Govender of ignoring the social and economic benefits already realized by workers and communities from the project. More than one-third of work on the project has been completed by Indigenous people and Coastal GasLink has earmarked $620 million in contracting opportunities for First Nations in the province, it says. The letter also accuses both the provincial commission and the UN committee of issuing public statements without talking to supportive First Nations. ""Both groups know nothing about the importance we place on finding a way out of endlessly trying to manage poverty, and finding the kind of opportunities for our First Nations people that non-Indigenous people have enjoyed for centuries,"" the letter says. The UN committee also called on the federal government to stop two other major resource projects, the Site C dam and Trans Mountain pipeline expansions. Na'moks, a spokesman for the Wet'suwet'en hereditary clan chiefs, has said they will never consent to the project. The chiefs issued an eviction notice to Coastal GasLink after the B.C. Supreme Court extended an injunction on Dec. 31 to the company. The RCMP has established a checkpoint along a logging road that leads to a pipeline work site, as well as two camps and a small settlement established by supporters of the hereditary chiefs. Last year, 14 people were arrested when the RCMP enforced a previous injunction granted to the company.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-indigenous-human-rights-1.5435854,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-human-rights-commissioner-calls-on-canada-to-stop-eviction-of-wet-suwet-en-people-in-pipeline-standoff-1.5423639 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/horgan-wet-suwet-en-hereditary-chief-meeting-1.5434188 https://www.cbc.ca/news/topic/Tag/Coastal%20GasLink,N/A
145,Morgan Modjeski,2020-01-23T12:00:00.328Z,Some Onion Lake residents say info about diphtheria not coming fast enough after 2 cases confirmed,"People in the community of Onion Lake are feeling uneasy after two cases of a rare infection were found in the area, but health officials say there's little to no risk of the infection spreading further. Last week, Indigenous Services Canada wrote to band leaders of the Onion Lake Cree Nation near the Alberta-Saskatchewan border indicating that two cases of diphtheria had been diagnosed — one on the reserve itself and the other in a nearby community. For one mother, the diagnoses have been troubling. ""I am terrified,"" said Roxanne Littlewolfe, a mother of six and educational assistant in Onion Lake. She said she's been hearing a lot of the same from other people in the community, especially mothers who have just had children. Littlewolfe said many people have questions and she doesn't think enough information about the infection is circulating in the community. ""There's not enough information for us to go on it,"" she said. ""It's just going ear-to-ear and mouth-to-mouth."" The Onion Lake Health Centre has posted some information about the illness on it's Facebook page, but Littlewolfe said she'd like to see a community-education event organized because some in the area aren't connected to the Internet or social media. ""If they had somebody come in to actually speak about the 'do's and the don'ts' and the 'what ifs' I think our community would have a better understanding."" According to the Centre for Disease Control in the U.S., diphtheria is an infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. The infection occurs in the respiratory system or on skin. With treatment, 1 in 10 diphtheria patients die and that number jumps up to 5 in 10 if left untreated. Officials say the Onion Lake diphtheria cases were not linked to one another. Albert Jimmy, the health director of the Onion Lake Health Board Inc. said band leadership is working to distribute information about the infections. Fact sheets have been distributed to schools, teachers, healthcare professionals and in the community at large.  Jimmy said he had plans to go on local radio Wednesday to relay information about the infection, but the broadcast was delayed. Instead, the broadcast will take place Thursday. He said leadership is working with Indigenous Services Canada to make sure information is flowing. ""I understand people are scared, they were texting me and some parents weren't going to be sending their children to school, so we have to reassure them,"" he said.  Jimmy said medical staff in the area treated the infection quickly and were able to contain its spread.  ""All we need to do is keep people informed more and we're trying to do that,"" he said.  When asked about the idea of hosting a public event to inform members of the community about the infection he said ""we're open to all suggestions"" and it's something he'll be approaching leadership about this week.  Dr. Ibrahim Khan, Regional Medical Health Officer with Indigenous Services Canada, said the community did an excellent job identifying and containing the infection. At this time, no additional resources have been requested. ""So far, I have offered all sorts of support to the community, but they say they are O.K. and if they need anything they will let us know,"" said Khan.  He said he's also had an opportunity to speak with the affected patients and their families directly and has been in frequent contact with health officials and nurses on the frontline in the community.    Khan said if the community decides to host an event to inform community members, representatives from Indigenous Services Canada will be present.  ""I'll be there. Our nurses will be there. Our team will be there,"" he said. In the letter sent to Onion Lake leaders last week, it explained that people may be at risk of infection because the vaccination rate for diphtheria in the Onion Lake area is below the desired target. However, Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the medical health officer responsible for overseeing communicable diseases within the Saskatchewan Health Authority said the provincial vaccination rate for the province is solid.  ""My understanding is even on First Nations communities their coverage for this vaccine is very high ... more than 90 percent of the population have been immunized with vaccine that protects against diphtheria,"" he said.  He said there hasn't been a case of diphtheria in the province for ""many years"" and stressed that professionals in Onion Lake took the correct steps to contain the infection.  Anyone with concerns about their own or their child's immunization record should get in touch with their local health officials to ensure all vaccines are up to date.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/diphtheria-onion-lake-1.5436957,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-sask-vaccines-1.5117395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/african-swine-flu-university-saskatchewan-1.5422544 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/u-of-s-coronavirus-1.5434143 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/two-cases-diptheria-onion-lake-cree-nation-sask-1.5434377 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-warned-about-coronavirus-2020-1.5436690,N/A
146,Laurie Fagan,2020-01-23T21:35:51.325Z,"Snow removal company's abrupt closure leaves 1,500 customers out in the cold","Some 1,500 residential customers of an Ottawa snow removal company have been left holding the shovel after two of its branches abruptly announced they're shutting down, effective immediately.  In an email to customers Thursday, Ken Dale, president of Metro Snow & Ice Management said it's with ""profound regret"" that he's announcing the closure of his company's ""independent franchises"" serving the Barrhaven and Merivale areas. A third branch, Metro Westend, isn't affected, Dale wrote. ""I suspect customers will be upset and it is certainly disappointing. I'm trying my best to give options to customers especially my older more senior clients,"" Dale said in a separate email to CBC. Dale blames ""a substantial decrease in customers"" and what he claims is a ""300% increase in insurance costs, fuel costs and overall operating and equipment carrying costs."" He also cites his own ""declining health."" Among Dale's customers left scrambling to find a new snow removal company are Susan Olszynko's parents. The couple, in their 90s, live on their own in a Barrhaven townhouse. ""I'm really upset because my father has had numerous times when we've had to ambulance him to the hospital,"" Olszynko said. ""My concern is to keep that driveway clear so ... in the middle of the night an ambulance can get him out."" Olszynko said she's been trying to find another company to take over, but with 10 centimetres of snow expected Saturday, she'll probably be the one doing the shovelling. Metro Barrhaven and its predecessor, Appleseed Snow Blowing Services, have been clearing James Careless's driveway near Woodroofe Avenue and Fallowfield Road for more than a decade.  Unlike past years, when he's paid in two instalments, Careless said Metro encouraged him to pay one lump sum of $446 back in October. ""The company has all my money and, well, I'm out of luck,"" he said. Careless said he's contacted two other snow removal companies, but was told they're not taking on more customers. ""This is a problem because Metro really dominates our community,"" Careless said. In the email to clients, Dale said he expects ""a trustee will be assigned to liquidate Barrhaven and Merivale Metro assets, resolve debt and address any 'pro rated' customer refunds from the remaining proceeds during the winding down process. Refunds if available should take place over the summer of 2020."" Dale said he's made efforts to reach out to competitors to take over his contracts, and is offering customers a $10 discount for an on-demand snow clearing service called Touchplow — a company Dale confirmed to CBC he owns. That's not going over well with customers. ""I'm shocked that he is referring me to a company that he owns, and how can he do that and claim insolvency?"" Olszynko asked. ""Doesn't this mean I'm paying him twice to clear my driveway?"" Careless demanded.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/snow-removal-barrhaven-merivale-1.5437603,[],N/A
147,"Karissa Donkin, Jacques Poitras",2019-11-25T10:00:00.602Z,Former Joi Scientific employee says he debunked technology NB Power spent millions on,"A former employee of Joi Scientific said he debunked claims the company made about its hydrogen technology but quit after being unsatisfied with the company's response to his findings. NB Power is facing an end-of-year deadline to prove the Florida startup's hydrogen technology works, or the provincial government will pull the plug on the utility's Florida lab, which costs about $20,000 a month to run. The company has claimed it has found an efficient way to generate hydrogen from seawater on demand, something that would be a major innovation. NB Power and the Regional Development Corporation spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology. NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas has maintained the technology has ""potential."" ""We had independent validation and measurements, but there were parts that could not be measured,"" Thomas said at a legislature committee on Nov. 1. ""Some assumptions had been made. We're now back into an area where it's still promising but not to the same levels as we initially thought."" But according to Austin Walker, who worked at Joi Scientific as a lab technician between 2018 and 2019, the technology, or mechanism, as it was often called, is nothing new. ""They always said, 'the mechanism is doing this or that,' but there was never actually a defined mechanism,"" Walker said. ""There was always just vague theories."" The company was always keen to differentiate its technology from electrolysis, an established process that uses electricity to generate hydrogen gas and oxygen, Walker said. Electrolysis is considered wholly inefficient for power generation. But Walker said he proved to company executives that its technology is essentially just electrolysis by another name. That would make the company's claim of 200 per cent efficiency impossible, Walker said, because it would violate a law of thermodynamics that says ""you cannot create energy just kind of out of nowhere."" Walker was only 21 years old when he started at the company, fresh out of school, in the fall of 2018. Yet, he said that he was able to determine over the course of just a few months that the company's technology was nothing new. He had just finished a bachelor's degree in biology, with a minor in chemistry, at East Central University in Oklahoma when he was hired at Joi Scientific in October 2018. His job ranged from doing ""basic chemistry experiments to just learning more about the technology"" under the direction of the vice-president of science. Before his job interview, Walker reviewed Joi Scientific's website and its promotional materials. One marketing video, which claims that ""Joi Scientific has solved the problems that have kept hydrogen from being widely used for energy,"" caught Walker's eye because the video's claims sounded like ""perpetual motion,"" he said. ""Our patented extraction process takes a tiny amount of energy to start a chemical process, making enough hydrogen to power the process itself and generate plenty more for use in fuel cells and engines and boilers,"" the video says. Walker assumed he was the one who didn't know enough about the subject, especially since the company is based in the Space Life Sciences Center at the NASA Kennedy Space Center. ""I kind of had a healthy dose of skepticism right from the start, but it wasn't until about one or two weeks in that I really kind of was like, 'OK, yeah … something's not right here,'"" Walker said. Walker said the company came up with a slideshow for investors that includes a bullet-point list of reasons why its technology was not electrolysis. CBC News has not seen that list. ""I would look at that list of things and be like, 'None of that really makes sense, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the exact opposite in my own experimentation,'"" Walker said. A few months into his job at Joi Scientific, Walker began testing the bullet points from the list during his lunch breaks and said he was able to disprove one point in ""20 minutes at most."" In May, about two months after he began doing experiments to test the company's claims, Walker said, the company allowed him 15 minutes to present his findings at a staff meeting.  He said he was able to prove all but one point wrong. He also used part of his presentation to explain how electrolysis works. ""A lot of people didn't grasp the full weight of what I had said, so what I did after that is I went to people individually and kind of explained things,"" Walker said. He said these people included Robert Koeneman, the company's president and senior vice-president of technology. ""I went with Rob out to get drinks and kind of explain to him all of my thoughts in detail, to the point where I knew I had done my best to explain to him why everything was wrong,"" Walker said. On a call in midsummer, Joi Scientific told its shareholders that its technology didn't work as previously described, according to a record of the call obtained by CBC News. On that call, Joi Scientific CEO Traver Kennedy admitted the company had been calculating power incorrectly. But Kennedy didn't mention Walker's findings in May that Joi Scientific was performing electrolysis and didn't have groundbreaking technology. Walker is the second former Joi Scientific employee to raise concerns about the company's technology. He is also one of at least eight Joi Scientific employees who are no longer with the company. At its height this year, the company had about 20 employees, according to interviews with former employees and a review of LinkedIn profiles.  In addition to Walker, the departures included two executives who were in charge of science and engineering. NB Power declined an interview request for this story. Joi Scientific also declined an interview request. In an emailed statement, vice-president of marketing Vicky Harris said the company ""remains as committed as ever to continuing our work on our seawater-based hydrogen technology in co-operation with our licensees, including NB Power."" She said the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them with partners. Her statement didn't elaborate on the delays and technical challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement said. Even though there were reportedly third-party verifications of Joi Scientific's technology, Walker believes people often ""take it for granted that you know what you're talking about."" ""Those third-party companies couldn't spend a month of testing like I did to check every little thing,"" Walker said. ""They had to take some of the stuff on faith and, yeah, I think that's probably how that happened."" In addition to operating a lab in Florida in the same building as Joi Scientific, NB Power has been sending its own employees, plus some engineers from Stantec, to work with Joi's technology. A spokesperson for Stantec declined an interview request to talk about its work on the Joi Scientific project. ""We are not authorized to speak to this matter, as per our agreement with our client,""  Stantec spokesperson Ashley Warnock wrote in an email. Expense reports show at least nine NB Power employees, including Thomas, have travelled to Joi's headquarters since 2016.  But it's not clear whether NB Power's own testing ever flagged any of the same issues Walker found during his lunch breaks. According to an Oct. 26, 2016, briefing note from NB Power, Joi Scientific's hydrogen production system is ""consistently repeatable"" and Joi's ""methodology used to evaluate the system's production ratio is reasonable and justifiable."" ""NB Power observed input to output ratio results which exceeded 100%,"" the briefing note says. It goes on to say the test results and data were consistent with claims made by Joi Scientific and ""with previous observations made at Joi Scientific at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida [in August 2016]."" It said NB Power's technical representative, an unnamed senior nuclear physicist, ""has spent approximately 24 hours of lab time with the system"" and ""has gained sufficient knowledge to understand the system's operation at a basic level and has confidence that the technology could be readily transferred to NB Power.""  Speaking to CBC News in May 2019, Thomas was a believer. ""We have seen results indicating, clearly indicating, independently witnessed, that it does produce more energy than in,"" Thomas said. Earlier this month, Thomas acknowledged the technology hasn't reached 70 per cent efficiency but maintained it still has ""potential.""  Walker became frustrated after attending a meeting with shareholders in May, where he said the company didn't mention any of the problems he said he raised earlier that month. ""It just seemed like they weren't even trying to portray the actuality of the company's situation, and I just felt that was kind of unethical,"" Walker said in an interview. ""Especially when some people were talking about continuing to invest more money into their company.""  Thomas, who sits on Joi Scientific's board, also attended that meeting, according to Walker. Walker described the tone as positive and said shareholders heard ""vague empty promises"" that he felt the company should have known wouldn't pan out.  ""I thought that there was just a line that crossed for me,"" he said. Walker said he quit his job later that day. He believes NB Power needs to audit things better before putting money in and suggested the utility should have sent electrochemists to assess the Joi Scientific technology. NB Power didn't respond to a question about how many, if any, electrochemists were sent to evaluate Joi's technology before it was licensed. ""I thought that the investors and people have a right to know how much their money is being wasted, especially if it's a government-run power company like it is in New Brunswick,"" Walker said.

Appearing in Moncton provincial court, Douthwright told the judge he was pleading not guilty, but the case was adjourned for a month. Melinda Ponting-Moore, acting as Douthwright's defence lawyer, was discussing a date for trial when the Crown spoke to her quietly. Ponting-Moore then asked for an adjournment, telling provincial court Judge Luc J. Labonté, ""we might have an opportunity to sit down with the Crown."" The judge granted the request, setting aside the matter until Feb. 21. ""If it can be resolved, great,"" Labonté told the lawyers Otherwise, he said, the case would proceed to trial. Outside court, Ponting-Moore said she was acting on behalf of lawyer Kelly Lamrock, who would deal with a trial, should there be one. She said the adjournment would be used to gather more information. McLaughlan could not be reached for comment. But through his union, McLaughlan has alleged that Douthwright drove up to a Department of Transportation work site on Route 112 last July 4. McLaughlan was among the workers gathered at the site when Douthwright and Wetmore, the minister of agriculture, aquaculture and fisheries, stopped. Wetmore ""shouted at us, insulted us, using derogatory words and saying road workers were incompetent,"" McLaughlan is quoted as saying in a union release. He accused Douthwright of shaking him. Douthwright refused to comment as he left the courthouse Friday. Last week, when reached by the CBC, he replied in an email: ""I look forward to telling my story in the proper venue."" The issue of the alleged assault was raised in November in the legislature. Two Liberal MLAs asked for more information about it and suggested Wetmore step down from cabinet while it was being resolved. Wetmore would only say the matter had been dealt with. At the time, Premier Blaine Higgs said he couldn't delve into details because of privacy issues but he was aware of an incident.  ""We feel that the disciplinary action was suitable for the situation and that it was done promptly,"" Higgs said.

About 13 per cent of the clientele at the food bank are now newcomers. Mike MacDonald, executive director of the Upper Room Hospitality Ministry, says the majority of the newcomers who he sees coming through the doors are refugees, primarily the Syrian refugees who moved to the Island a couple of years ago.   MacDonald made his comments during a legislative standing committee looking at the issue of poverty on the Island.  ""It certainly presents some challenges to us, the first one being communications,"" said MacDonald, who has worked with the food bank for nearly 20 years. ""The other is ensuring [we give] them the food that they need, giving them a can of vegetables or a box of Kraft dinner or something is not what they are looking for. They are looking for whole foods, fresh foods. They are looking for bags of flour and fresh vegetables."" The committee has been tasked with developing a costed plan for a basic income pilot project in P.E.I., as well as coming up with clear definitions and measures of poverty and a living wage. The committee was told to have its report back to the legislature by July.  MacDonald said a basic income may not benefit everybody.  ""There are many people that we see that this would be life-changing. There are other people who may struggle because of it,"" he said. ""We do see many people with addictions issues that as soon as they have money and funds in their pockets, unfortunately they are not talking about food, they are not thinking about shelter. Their addiction is taking over and they are servicing their addiction.""  The food bank serves 525 families a month, or about 1,600 people. More than 40 per cent of the clientele are under the age of 18. The Upper Room Soup Kitchen serves 3,500 meals per month. It is open seven days a week. MacDonald said housing, employment and medical issues, both physical and mental health, are the main reasons people seek help from the food bank and soup kitchen. He said the faces may change, but the stories behind them are consistent. ""We're always seeing single parent families and two parent families and we see seniors,"" he said. ""I guess the biggest increase would be people new to our country.

The Ontario Federation of Snowmobile Clubs (OFSC), whose members operate and maintain thousands of kilometres of trails across the province, issues liability insurance certificates to private landowners whose property the trails cross. But this year, some landowners in this region are refusing to renew that arrangement. The United Counties of Prescott & Russell is one of those landowners. In a French-language interview, the municipality's director of planning, Louis Prevost, said its lawyers have recommended against renewing the annual certificate. According to Prevost, they're concerned the coverage would limit civil liability in the event of an accident. The imbroglio has forced the Snowmobile Club of Eastern Ontario (SCEO), an OFSC member, to close 100 kilometres of its trails, about one-quarter of its network. ""Why was it acceptable last year and not this year?"" asked SCEO president Kim Melbourne. ""It's frustrating."" The closures punch holes in the network of interconnected routes that take sledders from one end of the Prescott & Russell to the other, Melbourne said. ""Maybe the [snowmobile club] members will be happy just going around in circles, and when they get bored they'll just turn around and go the other way,"" she scoffed. The insurance impasse means popular trails through the Larose forest, a huge wooded area in the western part of the region, is off limits, as is a former rail corridor still owned by CN, which crosses the region from the Ontario-Quebec border Ottawa's city limits. ""Right now, it's dangerous,"" said snowmobiler Sébastien Saumure, who worries the sudden trail closures will catch some by surprise. Saumure, who lives in L'Orignal, Ont., said he's more likely to go sledding in western Quebec where the trails remain uninterrupted. That worries Charles Lamarche, who estimates half the wintertime customers at his bar-motel in Plantagenet, Ont., are snowmobilers. ""If there's no snowmobile season, I really don't know what we're going to do,"" he said in French. Instead of enjoying their sport, Melbourne and other volunteers with the club will have to spend their time posting ""Trail Closed"" signs along the network. She's imploring members to obey them.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/insurance-impasse-snowmobile-season-eastern-ontairo-1.5437724,[],N/A
151,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:51:09.229Z,Trump administration OKs building Keystone XL pipeline on federal land,"The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump approved a right-of-way allowing the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline to be built across U.S. land, federal officials told The Associated Press on Wednesday, pushing the controversial $8 billion US project closer to construction though — court challenges still loom. The approval signed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt covers 74 kilometres of the line's route across land in Montana controlled by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said Casey Hammond, assistant secretary of the Interior Department. The 1,905-kilometre pipeline would transport more than 132 million litres (830,000 barrels) of crude oil daily from Western Canada to terminals on the Gulf Coast. Calgary-based project sponsor TC Energy said in a court filing that it wants to begin construction in the next several months, but that's sure to face more legal challenges. First proposed in 2008, the pipeline has become emblematic of the struggle between economic development and curbing the fossil fuel emissions that are causing climate change. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama rejected it, but Trump revived it and has been a strong supporter. The stretch approved Wednesday includes all federal land crossed by the line, Hammond said. Much of the rest of the route is across private land, for which TC Energy has been trying to get permissions to build on. Opponents worry burning the tar sands oil will make climate change worse, and that the pipeline could break and spill oil into waterways like Montana's Missouri River. They have filed numerous lawsuits. Hammond said Interior officials and other agencies have done a thorough review of the line's potential effects on the environment. He said TC Energy had provided detailed plans to respond to any spill from the line. ""We're comfortable with the analysis that's been done,"" Hammond said. Another oil pipeline in TC Energy's Keystone network in October spilled an estimated 1.4 million litres of oil in eastern North Dakota. The company's critics say a damaging spill from Keystone XL is inevitable given the the length of the line and the many rivers and other bodies of water it would cross beneath. An attorney for environmental groups that have sued to overturn Trump's permit for the line said they will ask the judge in the case to issue an order blocking the new approval. ""We know President Trump's permit was unconstitutional, and we have every confidence that the federal courts will set aside these approvals,"" said Steve Volker, who represents the Indigenous Environmental Network. U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte of Montana praised the administration's move. ""Trump and his administration are delivering on their promise to get this critical infrastructure project moving after years of unnecessary delays,"" the Republican lawmaker said in a statement. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana initially denied a request from environmentalists to block construction in December, because no work was immediately planned. But he also has ruled against the project, including a 2018 decision that stalled the line and prompted Trump to issue a new presidential permit for Keystone XL to cross the U.S.-Canada border. In Nebraska, the state Supreme Court removed the last major obstacle for the project in August when it ruled in favour of state regulators who had approved a route for the pipeline in 2017. Opponents had argued that regulators didn't follow all the procedures required by state law. TC Energy intends next month to begin mobilizing construction machinery to areas designated for worker camps and pipeline storage yards in Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, according to its court filings. It also plans to start toppling trees along the route in areas of South Dakota. In April, the company plans to start building a two-kilometre segment of the pipeline across the U.S.-Canada border. Construction of pumping stations for the line would begin in June.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-administration-keystone-xl-pipeline-federal-land-1.5436701,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-pipeline-tc-energy-south-dakota-water-1.5435455 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/keystone-xl-ruling-1.5406064 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tc-energy-corp-organic-expansions-1.5364803 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-north-dakota-keystone-spill-oil-tc-energy-1.5363633,N/A
152,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-24T18:51:25.357Z,"Texas murder suspect arrested in Halifax remains detained, refuses to leave cell","An American murder suspect nabbed in Halifax will remain detained until February, when he'll have another hearing to determine whether he's admissible to Canada, a member of the Immigration and Review Board ruled Friday. Derek Cameron Whisenand was scheduled to appear before the board Friday morning for both a detention review and an admissibility hearing, but refused to leave his cell in Halifax. A board member maintained Whisenand's detention on the basis he was a flight risk and a danger to the Canadian public. Dianne Tordoff also agreed to proceed with a hearing on admissibility on Feb. 11, regardless of whether Whisenand has secured counsel by then. The admissibility hearing scheduled for Friday was adjourned because Whisenand had the right to be present. ""But if a person refuses to attend, the board must proceed with celerity — we can't just keep postponing the hearing,"" Tordoff said. Whisenand, 28, is a suspect in the June 2019 death of a 78-year-old man in Eastland County, Texas, about 170 kilometres southwest of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He has been detained since his Dec. 30 arrest, which came after police responded to a call about the shoplifting of work boots at a Walmart in the city's Bayers Lake area. A police report filed as an exhibit in connection with his detention said Whisenand had been living in a tent in the woods with his dog near the busy shopping district. According to the report by Halifax regional police, he was arrested after leading officers on a foot chase and only stopped after a constable threatened to use her Taser on him. The police report alleged the fugitive was wearing brand-new beige work boots that still had the price tags on them. He was evasive with Halifax officers and gave a false name — Christian Bates — before the officer found a tattered U.S. social security card with his real name on it, without a birth date, the report states. After giving police his date of birth, he allegedly pleaded with them to let him go on a promise to appear so he could fetch his dog at the campsite. Police confirmed they found a tent, clothing, dishes and dog food in a wooded area not far from where the alleged theft took place. The dog was seized by animal control officers. Whisenand was subsequently turned over to the Canada Border Services Agency and has refused to answer questions from immigration officials. In July, RCMP warned that he had illegally crossed into Canada near Haskett, Man., sometime during the week of June 24. Authorities in North Dakota said Whisenand's vehicle was found about three kilometres from the Canadian border. Whisenand hasn't explained how he got to Nova Scotia, but he was believed to have gotten a ride from the border to Winnipeg, then headed towards Atlantic Canada. He has no family or friends in Canada and has been detained at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility. Whisenand didn't participate in his initial hearing on Jan. 2 and told the board at the second one on Jan. 8 that he wished to consult with a lawyer before proceeding on the issue of admissibility. Michel Gallant, a CBSA hearing officer, said Friday that officers have tried to interview Whisenand, but he's rebuffed their attempts. Gallant also said the U.S. consulate in Halifax will provide an emergency travel document if Whisenand is ultimately ordered removed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/texas-murder-derek-whisenand-remains-detained-1.5439016,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/new-stamp-commemorates-black-hockey-league-1.5437722 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/basketball-coach-uses-comedy-to-help-families-heal-1.5427997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/northern-pulp-mill-boat-harbour-government-environment-1.5437969 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,N/A

The Tignish, P.E.I., fisherman is being inducted into the Atlantic Canada Marine Industries Hall of Fame. Gaudet called the induction an honour beyond his ""wildest dreams,"" and said he loves fishing just as much now as he did when he started back in 1966. ""It's just being in the outdoors, out on the water,"" Gaudet said from his home in Tignish. ""I worked in Ontario for six months and it wasn't my cup of tea. I had to come home to fish. I was just like a lost puppy in Ontario.""  The ceremony gets underway Friday in Moncton. It's part of the Fish Canada trade show, the largest marine show in the region.  Ruby Arsenault is a founding member of the Tignish Fishers' Awards Banquet committee. Her committee nominated Gaudet. Arsenault said Gaudet is known throughout the community as somebody who is willing to lend a helping hand, especially to new fishermen.  ""One quote comes to mind when you think of Dennis, most people will say he is a gentleman both on land and sea,"" said Arsenault. ""He's a seasoned fisher. He is a leader, which means you know he's not afraid to speak out or ask questions about anything that concerns the industry."" This is the second time in his career that Gaudet has been recognized for his craft. Last year, Gaudet's peers at Tignish harbour nominated him as captain of the year.  Gaudet said he knows all too well that his love of the sea comes with a risk. His own boat capsized after being struck by another in 1974. The weather was calm at the time and he and his fellow fishermen were able to swim to shore. His brother Laurie wasn't so lucky. He died after his boat swamped in rough seas in 1996. It's an event that is still fresh in Gaudet's mind.  ""It was hard on the family, hard on the community."" In September 2018, Gaudet suffered the loss of two of his close friends. Glen DesRoches and Moe Getson died when their boat capsized in rough seas. ""That just brought back old memories,"" he said. ""I knew them pretty good, I knew Glen pretty good."" In addition to Gaudet, Rudy LeBreton of Neguac, N.B., is being inducted as processor of the year.

155,Adam Miller,2020-01-22T10:50:27.511Z,Key things to watch for in the coronavirus outbreak,"As the China coronavirus outbreak continues, key questions remain about the nature of the virus and how quickly and easily it can spread between people.  Here's a look at some of the potentially serious turns the outbreak could take. Human-to-human transmission is the spread of an illness from an infected patient to a non-infected person. There are two types of this transmission: limited and sustained. Limited human-to-human transmission infection occurs when there is close contact between those who have the virus and those who don't, particularly with family members, but is usually contained to a small number of people before running its course.   Sustained transmission is characterized by the World Health Organization as an illness that can transmit easily from one person to others in the population. ""It is now clear from the latest information that there is at least some human-to-human transmission. Infections among health-care workers strengthen the evidence for this,"" the WHO in China said in a statement Monday.  ""In addition, information about newly reported infections suggests there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission. However, we still need more analysis of the epidemiological data to understand the full extent of human-to-human transmission."" WHO officials will convene an emergency committee on Wednesday in Geneva to determine whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern and to discuss what recommendations should be made to manage it. ""The key issues here are what is the extent of human-to-human transmission and how easy is human-to-human transmission?"" said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.  ""That's going to be a factor into how widespread this ultimately gets.""   Health officials will also be watching closely to see if the virus changes as the outbreak continues, said Dr. Kamran Khan, an infectious disease physician and scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.  ""Viruses evolve and mutate, and they may start to take on new attributes and characteristics that either make them more easily transmissible or make them more deadly,"" he said.  ""The reality is that the longer that it's out there, the more it will evolve.""  Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, said if the coronavirus mutates into something more contagious, that would be a ""significant concern"" similar to the way in which SARS evolved. McGeer said the initial clusters of patients infected with SARS in early 2003 were associated with open-air markets in China, much like in the current coronavirus outbreak, with limited transmission from person to person.  ""Then over the next couple of months, the virus evolved into a virus that was more transmissible person to person, but more transmissible person to person when people were seriously ill,"" she said.  ""If that process is repeating itself, and the virus is changing, then we may be moving from one problem to a completely different problem. So far that's not what it's looked like, but I don't think you can be sure about it."" McGeer added there haven't been many reports of transmission to health-care workers, aside from the reported 15 cases of medical staff in Wuhan, which she said concerns her about the potential for the virus to change.  ""They must have followed up with health-care workers after the initial cases in December, they didn't see transmission and now they've found transmission,"" she said.  ""It does raise the concern that this is a virus that is changing and if it's a virus that's changing then that's a whole new set of issues. There's nothing we can do except wait to know what's going to happen."" Another concern is the possibility of a ""super-spreader,"" a highly infectious patient who can spread the illness to many people at a disproportionate rate to other carriers.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said super-spreader events were ""pivotal"" in the spread of SARS worldwide in 2003.They defined super-spreading as transmission to at least eight people.  One super-spreading event was identified early in the epidemic in Beijing, where a patient with an onset of SARS two months after hospital admission was the source of transmission to 76 patients, including 12 health-care workers and several hospital visitors.  Prof. Gabriel M. Leung, dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, said Tuesday the ""critical issue"" in controlling a coronavirus epidemic is to make sure that super-spreading events are controlled quickly.  ""It is absolutely critical that public health authorities recognize a super-spreading event in the very earliest stages,"" he said during a media availability. ""Before it goes absolutely explosive.""  Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit, said the possibility of a super-spreader is top of mind for health officials worldwide.  ""There is also the possibility of super-spreading events. The global community is very familiar [with] what has happened with SARS in the past and this is something that is on our radar,"" she said during a press conference Tuesday. ""That is possible, and what we need to prepare ourselves for."" Khan, who is also the founder and CEO of the company BlueDot that uses data to study how infectious diseases spread around the world, said outbreaks are like fires, and infected individuals are like embers.  ""They may land in one location where they happen to just trigger a big outbreak, and it may have to do with a super-spreading event,"" he said.  ""A super-spreading event does not mean that it is limited to the epicentre in Wuhan; it could catalyze multiple new epicentres.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-china-canada-questions-1.5433986,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-china-wuhan-1.5434256 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-human-to-human-1.5433187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/stock-markets-down-coronavirus-1.5434494 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-pneumonia-japan-1.5429035 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/china-virus-canada-sars-risk-1.5422619,N/A

Most cancer diagnoses are ""still being treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery — what I call the slash, poison, and burn approach,"" said Azra Raza. She told The Current's Matt Galloway that she is prescribing the same drugs today as when she treated her first North American patient in 1977. ""Why are we not looking at the entire overall picture and trying to do something different instead of repeating the same old, same old? This is why it's an embarrassment."" Raza is a professor of medicine at Columbia University and the author of The First Cell: And The Human Cost of Pursuing Cancer to the Last. The book tells the stories of some of the thousands of patients she has treated during her career, as well as her own husband's diagnosis and death from the disease. After five decades as an oncologist, Raza argues that efforts to fight cancer should be refocused on early detection. ""The only thing that seems to work is identifying cancer early,"" she said. ""Why aren't we using the latest technology to try and identify cancer at its inception?"" She explained that currently, a lot of research is aimed at prolonging life, but can come with side effects. Often those treatments make ""things even more grisly,"" she said, and can feel like ""taking a baseball bat and hitting a dog with it to get rid of its fleas"" for the patient. ""I am asking for redirection of funds being wasted in doing useless clinical trials, or trials that are yielding a five-per-cent success rate,"" she said.  That money could go towards developing tests to find ""the presence of cancer in any secretion through a liquid biopsy: blood, sweat, saliva, tears, urine."" In November, technology company Toshiba said it had developed a device that could detect 13 types of cancer from a single drop of blood, with 99 per cent accuracy. The company said trials would start this year, with a view to having the device on the market in a few years' time. A study published in 2018 suggested that early testing could have negative consequences, such as leading to false diagnoses, or unnecessary treatment.  Raza said that overdiagnoses are already happening in regular testing. She is confident that in the near future, we will have the technology ""to find the earlier footprints of cancers, and that along with that revolution will come better treatment options."" Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said it's ""a little presumptuous to say that all we're doing is poisoning people, or burning people, or cutting people."" He told The Current that millions of premature deaths have been prevented by cancer research, but acknowledged that treatments for some cancers haven't made much progress ""For every successful drug, there are eight or nine drugs that have not been successful in clinical trials — but that doesn't mean the research has failed,"" he said. ""A tremendous amount of effort has gone to finding the first cell, to finding the first signals of cancer, and then deciding how best to treat it."" Raza said she agreed the research to date has made for valuable progress, but said more could be done.  ""Yes, a lot of money is being spent in finding the first cell, but not enough,"" she said. She wants a re-energized fight against cancer to have the competition witnessed when the U.S. and Russia raced to put man on the Moon, and the cooperation ""seen between scientists around the world doing the Human Genome Project.""

""I think it's very important and we try to connect with the community,"" said Carol Anne Matheson, recreation manager at the nursing home.  ""Make the community a big part of our residents' lives here because coming from the community to a nursing home, we don't want to isolate anybody from past things that they did.""

""It has been observed last year in Gaspé, and two years ago there [was] one observed in Maine, which was twice as big as this one, almost 100 metres in diameter."" ""These ice discs have mesmerized people for years and there have been a lot of claims, especially about alien stuff,"" he said. They've also been compared to crop circles.  ""But scientists have been studying the phenomena for years and you know what? They came up with a very simple explanation."" The simple explanation involves ""a magnificent chemical called H2O: water,"" Voyer said. Water is one of the few chemicals with a lower density in its crystallized form, he said. Meanwhile warm water is less dense than cold water, so it rises to the surface. Watch the ice disc slowly revolve in the South Thompson River: Nature's recipe for a rotating ice disc is ""a little open water, a little water current and an ice patch,"" Voyer said. When the temperature warms a bit, water molecules begin to warm up and migrate to the top. If the water surface is covered with an ice patch, those warm water molecules begin to move laterally with the current, creating a vortex like water down a bathtub drain. ""So the warm water vortex will push up the ice cover,"" Voyer said. ""Eventually the ice cover will crack along the edge of the vortex. And the reason for that is because the forces are stronger along the edge and the water is warmer."" The result is a very rough ice disc, which then grinds itself into a perfect circle as it rotates, he said. Ice discs rarely form, because conditions must be perfect: warming temperatures, not too much current and not too much wind.  The phenomenon is often fleeting, lasting a couple of days or a couple of weeks before wind or strong current causes the fragile disc to break apart. ""Also, there is the possibility that during the night there's aliens that will come and throw rocks at it or something like that,"" Voyer joked.  With files from Daybreak Kamloops",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ice-disc-thompson-river-rare-phenomenon-temporary-maine-aliens-1.5436887,[],N/A

The report titled Market Research: Private Housing in Eeyou Istchee suggests interest in private home ownership is very high, but readiness is low, according to Irene Neeposh. She brought together the findings and recommendations of a survey of more than 300 Cree currently living in social housing and from focus groups with housing committees and co-ordinators. ""Close to 90 per cent of people say they have thought of building,"" said Neeposh, but added that slightly more than 6 per cent of those people have actually made an application with their local band office.  The report makes 18 recommendations to close that gap — like developing programs in financial literacy, project planning and home maintenance. Other recommendations include diversifying the types of housing available and providing financing options for home buyers, with a goal of better supporting Cree who want to buy a home.  Some of the obstacles to home ownership are inability to save, a lack of financial readiness, low income levels and long waiting lists to build, according to the findings of the research. ""The report is really useful to plan how to solve problems we have right now for both social housing and private home ownership,"" said Cree Grand Chief Abel Bosum. He also said while financial readiness is an issue, a more fundamental obstacle to home ownership has been band offices with limited ability to guarantee mortgages. In 2019, the Cree government moved to remove a 75-year limit on land leases and Bosum said that will allow Cree homeowners to build up equity in their homes and not need a band guarantee. The Cree government is also setting up a $100-million fund to help more people access private home ownership. It hopes to have the fund in place beginning in April of 2020.  The report also points to a need for more financial accountability in the social housing system in Cree communities. Slightly more than half of the survey respondents currently living in social housing said they were up-to-date with their rent and 62 per cent said they had paid their rent in the last month.  Neeposh said the housing committees all identified non-payment of rent as a serious problem that has negative impacts. ""The results from non-payment end up deteriorating the existing units,"" said Neeposh. ""It doesn't also allow for the housing departments to provide services or proper management.""  Neeposh said most housing co-ordinators recommended more education and accountability in the social housing system to help people understand the importance of paying rent. They also want the Cree Nation to explore the idea of setting up a Cree collection agency to help build financial capacity. Chief Bosum said non-payment of rent is a difficult issue for local housing departments to manage.  ""Arrears have been an issue for a very long time. That is one of the problems with the program itself, because even if you were to evict someone, where do they go?"" said Bosum.  He said all levels of Cree government have to work together to look for solutions, adding that it is less of an issue with younger Cree families. The report also pointed to another problem — that of high-income earners living in social housing.  Neeposh noted that housing department staff said having options in Cree communities like transitional housing, starter homes, rent-to-own and co-rent options could help encourage more high-income earners to move on to private home ownership.  The Cree Nation Government will table a housing strategy next week.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/housing-cree-strategy-private-home-ownership-1.5438379,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/housing-private-home-ownership-cree-nation-viens-commission-1.4953096,N/A

George Daley, deputy minister for anglophone schools, took Cardy's place, leading groups through a series of four questions aimed at getting people thinking and talking. Participants were asked to come up with strengths and challenges within the education system and within the governance structure (district education councils, school districts and departments), as well as roles parents and communities should play within the system. Attendees ranged from senior citizens to high school students, with parents, grandparents, university students and teachers rounding out the crowd. They voiced concerns about issues such as the delivery of bilingualism, class sizes and a lack of student engagement. Eleanor Reiffenstein, a Grade 10 student at Tantramar Regional High School, said, ""I was not prepared enough to come to the high school and get started in the French immersion program."" She said there was a gap between what was expected in middle school compared to high school. Reiffenstein said she spent her evening at Sackville's town hall because she cares about her education and hopes to make it better for others.  Daley did his best to address issues, saying that violence in the classroom is, ""on my front burner."" Some said they were concerned about a lack of educational assistants and the low pay that EAs get. Daley said some EAs were acting as personal care workers because that's what was demanded of them.  They don't necessarily know how to deal with all the student demands, he said. The meeting lasted for more than two hours as the groups brainstormed answers to the questions, and a microphone was passed from table to table. Kate Crawford, a mother of two young children, said she attended because she wants to know what's happening in the school system. ""After hearing the back and forth, I am hopeful there would be systems change,"" said Crawford. Daley admitted there is already a 10-year plan in place for the coming changes to the school system, but he said, ""we're filling in the spaces on how we want to achieve particular parts of it and the information that is here tonight, it will contribute."" ""Whenever citizens get a chance to share and give us feedback, it always makes an impact, right?"" There are 11 other stops planned for the green paper tour. The next meeting will take place in Edmundston at Cité des Jeunes A.-M.-Sormany on Jan. 29. Cardy's green paper on education reform was published last fall. The 25-page document discusses eliminating grade levels, more use of artificial intelligence in the classroom, more partnerships with the private sector to boost education in the trades and the introduction of second-language programming in daycares.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/dominic-cardy-green-paper-sackville-1.5438748,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cardy-green-paper-tour-begins-1.5432936,N/A
161,Ben Mussett,2020-01-23T21:15:18.449Z,'It puts a bad taste in my mouth': Councillor aims to make racist covenants history,"A few generations ago, the only way Marcus Wong could have lived in the posh West Vancouver neighbourhood where he grew up was as a servant.  And while that's no longer the case, land title documents for an unknown number of homes in the British Properties — a tony, hillside neighbourhood with panoramic views of Vancouver — still have covenants that say people of colour can't live there.  Now Wong is trying to change that.  Next week, the West Vancouver councillor will introduce a motion that will begin the process of identifying and removing any remaining covenants in the district that discriminate based on race, ethnicity, gender, ancestry or religion. The proposal also prohibits the creation of such clauses in the future.  Coun. Craig Cameron will second Wong's motion. Students help remove racist covenant from Vancouver Island home On CBC's On the Coast on Wednesday, Wong read from one of the racist covenants he had tracked down. ""The first part says that the grantee shall not assign or transfer the set lands to anybody of African or Asiatic race or descent,"" Wong told host Gloria Macarenko. ""And, as well, no person of either African or Asiatic race or descent shall reside on the premises except as servants. ""It puts a very bad taste in my mouth."" Wong views his work to remove discriminatory clauses from land titles as part of a greater project toward inclusiveness.  ""I think of, for example, the Order of Canada's motto: '[They] desire a better country,'"" Wong said. ""This isn't just my country, it's not just your country, it's our country. So, if we truly want this country, Canada, to be better then we need to take all the measures possible to make sure that it is a better country."" In a statement provided to CBC News, British Pacific Properties — the developer behind the original British Properties neighbourhood — said it supported Wong's motion, along with any further steps the municipality might take.  ""These offensive, restrictive covenants are found on properties throughout the province, and although they are void and unenforceable, they have no place in our society,"" it said. The family-owned business declined to be interviewed.  This type of discriminatory practice was not unique to West Vancouver, with such clauses found across Canada.  Vancouver real estate titles reveal city's racist history Section 222 of British Columbia's Land Titles Act makes such covenants void. Since 1978, the Land Title and Survey Authority (LTSA) has also allowed landowners to remove discriminatory clauses from their titles free of cost.  Rather than trying to locate the covenants one by one, Wong hopes the district will work with the LTSA to streamline the process and remove racist clauses in large batches.  Now is an appropriate time to get started, he said. ""The Asian Lunar New Year is coming up. It's a time for renewal, a time for turning a new leaf.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/west-van-marcus-wong-racist-land-titles-1.5437218,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-board-rename-school-1.5401386,N/A

163,Laura Osman ,2020-01-23T09:00:00.474Z,"Homeowners, advocates call for end to Tarion monopoly ","Homeowners who've fought for years for restitution after discovering defects in their newly built homes are demanding the provincial government reconsider its efforts to reform the Tarion home warranty program and instead open it up to private insurers. They were joined by consumer advocates — and even a former high-ranking Tarion employee — at a provincial standing committee on justice policy Wednesday in Ottawa, where they called for an end to Tarion's monopoly. The Progressive Conservative government has pledged to overhaul Tarion after a damning report by the province's auditor general in October, charging the warranty provider was overly influenced by builders and failed homeowners. ""Tarion is broken and beyond repair,"" said Julie Bellefeuille, who's been struggling for years to get necessary repairs to her new home in east Ottawa's Cardinal Creek neighbourhood. Cardinal Creek homeowners locked in battle with builder Homeowners forced out over construction flaws call for reform She told the committee that navigating Tarion's ""broken"" system left her struggling with financial and emotional damages. ""Families are left to fight the broken system that failed them,"" she said.  The government's proposed overhaul will not address the core problems, Bellefeuille said, since the corporate culture will endure. She instead called for the government to open the warranty system to private providers.  ""What matters most is giving the people of Ontario a choice,"" Bellefeuille said.  Bellefeuille's message is one that's been heard often over three days of committee hearings, according to NDP MPP Tom Rakocevic, who attended meetings earlier this week in Windsor and Brampton. Rakocevic put forward a private member's bill in opposition to the government's proposed legislation, one that calls for a multi-provider model.  Last month, Consumer Services Minister Lisa Thompson announced the government had decided — after extensive consultation with the public and members of the building industry — to reject opening up home warranties to other providers. In a statement to CBC Wednesday, Thompson said making improvements to Tarion will yield benefits that a private model would not. ""By increasing the accountability of a single provider and making the significant changes to the governance of Tarion, there will be more enforcement mechanisms built into the system – which is what new home buyers in Ontario deserve,"" Thompson wrote. ""In a private insurance model, these protections are not built in, are difficult to enforce, and are not guaranteed."" Carleton MPP Goldie Ghamari shares the minister's reservations about privatizing home warranties. ""If we go to a private model, we lose government oversight and accountability,""  Ghamari told the committee Wednesday. Ghamari said while she believes in a free market economy as a Progressive Conservative, she also struggles with the idea of allowing more providers into the system.  For example, Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk  would not be able to assess a private insurance company, she said.  Lysyk expressed similar concerns in her recent report, though a 2015 review of Tarion by Chief Justice John Douglas Cunningham concluded that Tarion must be dismantled.  Ghamari also pointed out that a multi-provider model actually might not give consumers much choice, as they would be forced to go with whatever insurance company the builder chose. But Karen Somerville with Canadians for Properly Built Homes, a homeowner advocacy group, pointed out that at least people would be able to choose the builder that offered the best insurance. ""Research shows that competition is a critical driver of performance and innovation,"" said Somerville. ""Research also shows that competition encourages lower prices, better products and better service."" Dave Roberts, Tarion's former director of enforcement, told the committee the culture at Tarion before his 2017 retirement favoured builders, and workers were incentivized to avoid making payouts to homeowners.  ""Consumers were secondary, the builders were first,"" he said.  Roberts also called for home warranties to be opened up to third parties, which he said is best for consumers. ""[Tarion] cannot adjust to the market without going through regulation changes. They cannot offer upgrades for better protection or longer protection,"" he said.  The government, which has been in public consultation about Tarion's future since early last year, said any specific changes to Tarion will be decided after this round of consultation. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/tarion-hearing-monopoly-ottawa-1.5436115,[],N/A

Before it closed down in 2006, the now-demolished Canada Training Centre trained an RCMP squad tasked with spy operations.

Sveinung Rotevatn said the country has done it simply by making electric vehicles a good deal. ""The most important incentive would be that the vehicle would be exempt from all taxes,"" said Rotevatn. ""In Norway we tax regular cars quite heavily and have been for many years. So if you want to buy a great vehicle at a cheap price, the electric vehicle would be your option."" The incentives don't stop when you've purchased your car. Norway provides special commuter lanes and free parking, and exemptions from road and ferry tolls. Rotevatn said it was important for Norway to look at vehicles if it was going to reduce its carbon footprint. While other countries have been able to cut back on a carbon-fueled power grid, Norway was already running on abundant hydroelectricity. It is a situation similar to P.E.I.'s, where transportation is the source of 48 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Norway also faced similar climate and geographic challenges. ""Norway with its cold winter climate, vast distances, sparse populations, is probably, in theory, the worst country in the world to try to launch an electric mobility revolution,"" said Rotevatn. ""If you can do it here you can do it anywhere. And that means you can also obviously do it in P.E.I. and then in Canada."" There are two basic options for encouraging electric vehicle purchase, he said. Make the vehicles cheaper, or make gas more expensive. Norway opted for cheaper vehicles, he said, because more expensive gas can have a disproportionate effect on lower-income people, who may not be able to afford to buy a new vehicle. Rotevatn believes one way or another, running an electric vehicle needs to be the cheaper option for people. ""The environmentally-best option also needs to be the cheapest option for people,"" he said. ""I don't think there is enough idealism in the world that people are going to be willingly spending more on a car than they have to to save the environment."" Rotevatn said the only thing keeping electric vehicle sales from being even higher in Norway is a lack of models that are appropriate for large families or work purposes.

166,Payam Akhavan,2020-01-11T09:00:00.411Z,Belonging and grief: What the Iran air disaster reveals about the inextricable ties that bind us together,"This column is an opinion by Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University, a former UN prosecutor at The Hague, and the 2017 CBC Massey Lecturer. He was born in Tehran and left Iran in his childhood, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1980 at the outset of the Islamic revolution and violent persecution of the Baha'i religious minority to which he belonged. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. On the outskirts of Tehran, the fragments of what was once a journey of many dreams lie scattered against a bleak landscape. Amidst the twisted metal and clothing littering the scorched earth, there is a single red shoe of a child. It has a pretty bow, slightly singed by the flames that engulfed Flight PS752 in its last moments before it crashed from the sky in a great ball of fire, bringing to a sudden end so many stories yet to be told, so many joys yet to be discovered. The little shoe made me think of one-year old Kurdia, whose parents Evin and Hiva had taken her halfway across the world, from Canada to Iran, to celebrate a wedding. Persian weddings, we jokingly say, need a football stadium to accommodate the guests. How many adoring grandparents and elders, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends must have smothered little Kurdia with affectionate kisses, seeing her for the first time, not knowing that it would also be the last. It seems to be the fate of people in the Middle East to suffer. Some weeks earlier, hundreds of Iranian youths were shot on the streets of Tehran for protesting corruption, crying for freedom, and their loved ones were arrested for mourning their loss. Mothers and fathers have been killed by barrel bombs in Idlib and Aleppo, standing in a bread line to appease the unbearable pain of hunger. And it is only a matter of time before we witness, yet again, those desperate to flee such horrors, drowning in the depths of the Mediterranean while trying to cross the forbidding sea in rubber dinghies, in search of a better world. And now, the grim sight of a long succession of body bags amidst the wreckage of the aircraft that carried so many on their way home to Canada, the country that opened its doors to them, answering their dream of a better future. One tries to be philosophical at times like this. ""Death is our wedding with eternity,"" the great mystic Rumi wrote. It is difficult to reconcile that wisdom with the horrors the hapless passengers must have experienced in their final moments. Yet, just as weddings are a communal experience that teach us what it means to belong, so too communal grief and mourning shows us, in the hour of darkness, the astonishing light of the human spirit; the inextricable ties that bind us together. In ""Tehranto"" and Montreal, Windsor and Guelph, Edmonton and Vancouver, Halifax and London, across this vast space we call Canada, people have lost family and friends, neighbours and colleagues, teachers and students. This isn't just another horrible thing happening ""out there,"" in that other world of suffering that momentarily intrudes on our lives of privilege, trivialized by a tweet or fleeting Facebook post, soon to be forgotten. Now it is happening to ""us,"" we who call ourselves Canadians, who imagine belonging as something that is beyond the bonds of blood and soil; a transcendent connection built on a shared humanity. The flag flies at half-mast at my university in Montreal, as it does across other campuses through the country. Many on that ill-fated flight were professors, researchers, and students, part of Iran's massive brain drain as accomplished and ambitious youth settle here in our midst to start new lives. On my mobile phone, there are numerous e-mails and text messages from fellow Canadians, expressing sympathy and concern, mourning the loss that has become ours for the simple reason that we have come to live in the same place – a wonderful and precious place where, amidst grief and suffering, compassion reigns supreme. Just as joyous celebrations define who we are, communal bereavement — healing together, whether it is with our Indigenous brothers and sisters who were here before us or with the recent immigrant returning home from a previous home — teaches us what it means to be human. What it means to be Canadian. It unites us at the core, gives us a deeper identity, emancipates us from the superficial divisions and distractions that we confuse with true meaning. ""Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes,"" Rumi wrote, ""because for those who love with their heart and soul, there is no separation.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-air-disaster-iran-canada-1.5421028,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/iran-flight752-crash-timeline-1.5419572 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/black-box-iran-flight-canadians-ukranian-missile-1.5420847 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/iran-ukrainian-plane-crash-canada-reaction-1.5418648 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-iran-relations-airline-crash-investigation-repatriation-1.5419265,N/A
167,Sidhartha Banerjee,2020-01-23T00:14:19.891Z,"Quebec to expand assisted death to mentally ill, but few expected to qualify","Quebec plans to expand medical aid in dying to include people with severe, incurable mental illness, the province's health minister says, with guidelines to be drawn up by the provincial college of physicians. Health Minister Danielle McCann told a news conference Tuesday that people with mental health issues who aren't responding to treatment would be able to ask for the procedure — but she stressed such cases would be exceptional. The college of physicians also said it expects that few people would be affected. ""We don't expect many of these patients will qualify, because one of the other criteria that remains is to suffer from a disease that is not curable, which is not necessarily the case of all mental health situations,'' said Dr. Yves Robert, the college's secretary. ""It will really be an individual, case-by-case decision that will be done.'' On Tuesday, the Quebec government announced it would comply with a court ruling last year striking down part of its medical aid in dying legislation — specifically the requirement that someone seeking medically assisted death be ""at the end of life.'' The same Quebec Superior Court judgment invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the federal Criminal Code. To comply with the provincial law, prospective recipients would still have to be 18 years old or older, have the mental capacity to make their own decisions about medical care, suffer from a serious and incurable illness and be in constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain that can't be relieved. Speaking to reporters, McCann confirmed that severely mentally ill patients could qualify. ""The guide will be modified to include safeguards, elements that allow (for) medical aid in dying for people who have severe mental disorders and who are resistant to any treatment,'' McCann said. She spoke of possible additional criteria for the mentally ill — a psychiatrist would need to be consulted — and said the delay before medical aid in dying is given would be longer. The proposed changes follow Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin's ruling in September in a case brought by two Quebec residents who suffered from incurable degenerative diseases but did not meet the criteria for assisted death. The judge declared unconstitutional the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and the section of the Quebec law stating people must ""be at the end of life.'' The federal government has said it accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly, launching public consultations on how to implement the necessary changes. Those consultations will look at issues including whether those suffering from mental illness and ""mature minors'' should be eligible, as well as whether those who fear losing mental capacity and being unable to provide consent should be allowed to make advance requests for medical assistance in dying. A parliamentary review of the law is to begin this summer. Critics have said that assisted death for those whose only condition is mental illness raises complex moral and ethical issues. Some have argued there's a lack of evidence that mental illness is an incurable condition, and others have said more should be invested into treatment and resources for those suffering from mental illness. Robert said that in jurisdictions such as Belgium and the Netherlands that brought in euthanasia legislation before Canada, mental health cases have been a minority of overall cases. The college is just beginning its reflection on the mental health matter and will take time to consult groups and determine who would qualify. ""We are approaching a no-man's land, where nobody else was before, so to be prudent and to take the time to have a good reflection and to do one step at a time and do it in a spirit of serenity and wisdom is probably the best way to handle and treat these very delicate and complicated issues,'' Robert said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-to-expand-assisted-death-to-mentally-ill-but-few-expected-to-qualify-1.5437030,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,N/A
168,Anonymous,2020-01-22T14:31:24.984Z,Indigenous 'Molly of Denali' is more than a cartoon for some,"Charitie Ropati watched the pilot episode of Molly of Denali in her Columbia University dorm room, huddled around a computer screen with friends. ""We were crying,"" Ropati said. ""We realized we finally had positive representation."" Molly of Denali is the first cartoon series with an Alaska Native character as the lead. It premiered in the U.S. on PBS Kids in July. For many, it is more than a cartoon. ""Watching the show is a way for my Native friends and I to bond,"" said 18-year-old Ropati, who's Yup'ik. She had just moved to New York City from Anchorage and was feeling homesick when the pilot aired. ""PBS did such a good job. It is like my siblings, Native youth and myself can see ourselves in it."" The series, in its first season, has Indigenous input at all levels of production, Indian Country Today reported. It includes 38 episodes, a podcast series and a collection of paperback books. The series, a co-production with CBC Kids, premiered on CBC in September 2019. People can watch Molly of Denali on Saturdays on CBC TV and CBC Gem, and on-demand via Gem.  Dorothea Gillim is the series' executive producer, a position she also held on Curious George. After working in the industry for many years, she says this program is special. ""I've never worked on a show where people tear up on a regular basis,"" Gillim said. Gillim says she recently heard about a non-Native family who wanted to make a trip to Alaska after watching the show. They called the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce to learn more about Alaska Native languages to prepare for their trip. Her job as executive producer is multifaceted; she raises money for the show while leading a close-knit team. And she was also involved at the earliest moments of the show to choose writers, producers, animators, and voice actors. One of the talents she gathered was Princess Johnson who is Neets'aii Gwich'in. Johnson is the creative producer of Molly of Denali. Part of Johnson's job is to advocate for Indigenous representation at every level of the creative process. This means making sure things are done ""right"" in every episode, interstitial (a short-program shown between episodes that features Alaska Native children), online tools, games and podcast. She also ensures Alaska Natives are included as writers, actors and producers. A job like this didn't always exist. There are serious implications to many non-Native people creating media about Native people, a 2018 IllumiNative report says. ""The story they adopt is overwhelmingly one of deficit and disparity,"" the report states. ""This narrative can undermine relationships with other communities of colour."" Many say Molly of Denali challenges that. The series was developed with a group of over 60 established Alaska Native or Indigenous participants, who took on adviser, writer, producer, voice talent and musician roles. The participants are from every region of Alaska where the show takes place. For every character that is Native, their voice actor is Native too. Beyond this, there is also a fellowship program for Alaska Native writers. Atomic Cartoons, the lead animation company of the series, holds internships for Alaska Natives. Vera Starbard, who is Tlingit and Dena'ina, is a writer for Molly. She says she has worked on many artistic projects that involve Alaska Native people. ""I've never experienced this level of dedication to getting it right,"" she said. ""Usually my job comes with emotional labour of having to educate others,"" Starbard said. ""This time ... my job is just to write."" Starbard says something surprising is how much work happens behind the scenes. Here's a little bit of how the process works: Writers think of a potential story they pitch to a producer. If their pitch is accepted, they work through many rounds of edits. Writers must decide who the characters are, where the story takes place and what informational text will go into an episode. They have to write every word that a character speaks, including where they chuckle or show forms of expression. After a script is approved and ""polished,"" it is sent to directors and animators. ""And then I don't see the story again until it airs,"" Starbard said. This entire process takes a while. Starbard's first episode took 18 months before it aired. Because the show is in its first season, animators are tasked with creating entire new towns, characters and worlds. Starbard has written four episodes so far. She says her life experiences inspire her story ideas. When writing ""New Nivagi,"" an 11-minute story that follows Molly while she gathers items to make her grandpa's secret ice cream recipe, she says it reflected an experience she knows. Starbard grew up in Alaska and says she had to be ""pretty creative"" to make recipes because sometimes it is hard to find ingredients. So she wrote an entire episode where Molly does the same. Producers of the show use other liberties to showcase Alaska's diversity. One of Molly's best friends is Tooey Ookami, a 10-year-old boy who is Koyukon, Yup'ik and Japanese. The other is Trini Mumford, a 7-year-old African American girl. ""We wanted to reflect the true diversity of Alaska and the public media,"" said Johnson. Alaska is home to 229 tribes. Johnson says it is especially heartwarming to hear about people's reaction to the show. Johnson remembers being in Anchorage when a young girl's mother approached her to say they recently went to a Molly screening. After it was over, her daughter was looking through her closet to find her kuspuk (a hooded shirt with large front pockets) because Molly wore her kuspuk in the show. Another time Johnson remembers being at a children's museum when a mother said her son was showing interest in his Inupiaq culture because of the show. ""That is the ultimate goal,"" said Johnson. ""It is a joy to see that sort of reaction."" And the reactions are from non-Native people too. Johnson heard a story from a friend's son who watched the show and asked what an ancestor was. ""When I go back to the beginning when I first heard of the show I knew the potential impact that the show could have,"" said Johnson. She says it has been worth it because of that. During Halloween, the show released a graphic informing viewers how to dress like Molly. They were especially cognizant of not telling people to wear her traditional regalia. Instead they encouraged viewers to wear a brown coat and boots, blue jeans and pink mittens. The graphic received traction on social media. It was liked more than a thousand times on Twitter. If you would like to dress up like Molly for Halloween, here is how you can do so respectfully. We do ask that people refrain from wearing Molly's traditional Native dress (Regalia) as a costume.

She says she was established in Alaska before Molly and now she's considered a national writer.

""Oh, yeah, pigs jump. I see them jump over the fence the same way their mothers did. They're pretty athletic,"" farmer Pierre Laframboise said. The nimble porkers have been escaping their enclosures at the small operation, about 60 kilometres up Highway 105 from Gatineau, Que., thanks largely to the recent snowfall. First, the growing snowdrifts are helping make the low-slung wire fencing even less of a hurdle for the animals. Second, the low-voltage electrical current that pulses through the wire packs less of a punch in winter, and is therefore less of a deterrent to would-be escapees. ""There's not as good of a ground connection because the pigs are walking on snow instead of dirt,"" Laframboise explained. And don't they know it. Chief among the slippery sows is a pair of escape artists aptly named Thelma and Louise. The boar, Themistocles, also likes to make a run for it.  It's their offspring that Laframboise sends to market. ""The ones that we bring to slaughter, we don't name,"" he observed.  A bottle-fed runt named Tiny, who has his own growing following on Instagram, is the exception, and has been having a heck of a time in the fresh snow lately.  Laframboise and his partner, Sandra Marsters, aren't too worried about the strays. Their farm is on a little-used road, and their small herd of mainly Tamworths appear to be homebodies, sticking close by despite their new-found freedom. The farthest they've wandered is about 750 metres down the road, Laframboise said. ""Then they'll see the truck. I'll roll down the window and call 'em up, 'C'mon girls, let's get going,' and they'll follow."" The bristled pigs don't seem to mind the cold, either. They'll sometimes huddle together or warm up in their straw-filled shelter, but curiosity keeps them seeking out new territory, Laframboise said. ""They just want to explore. They want to have some fun."" Of course, staying close to home also means a higher likelihood of being fed. The animals will often climb onto the porch, and even nose their way into the house. ""'Where's our dinner? C'mon buddy, let's go. Time for lunch,'"" Laframboise imagines them saying. Watch this space for updates on the Peabody Farm pigs.

170,Anonymous,2020-01-23T20:31:21.006Z,"Hefty repair bill expected for boats, breakwater damaged by blizzard in C.B.S.","A breakwater has been breached and boats have been damaged at the Royal Newfoundland Yacht Club in Conception Bay South, Commodore Larry LeDrew said. The damage comes from large waves caused by Friday's blizzard, the strength of which plunged parts of Newfoundland's Northeast Avalon Peninsula into ongoing states of emergency. ""This is unprecedented,"" said LeDrew. The yacht club, which was incorporated in 1964, has had its breakwater breached only twice before. The breakwater, a barrier built to protect the wharf from powerful waves, is built entirely of natural stone. LeDrew said he expects repairs to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. ""A large section, probably about 300-plus metres long, [was] completely breached and that allowed the waves and the storm surge to come right in and impact our wharf,""  he said.   ""One of our main wharfs is pretty well destroyed."" The town of Conception Bay South released a statement on Thursday saying emergency repairs will begin on Friday. ""This work will involve numerous large excavators and a water craft. Given the risk to public safety, and due to concerns regarding future property and infrastructure damage, emergency repair efforts will be ongoing 24 hours a day, until the emergency repairs are completed,"" the town said. The public is not permitted to access the area due to safety risks while repair is ongoing. Four boats were damaged during the blizzard. ""We have to move the boats that are stored down near the water now. [They] have to be moved so that we don't incur further damage,"" he said. The breakwater is the responsibility of the Town of Conception Bay South, but the wharf belongs to the yacht club and is uninsured.  ""Obviously we'll all be looking at what's available from disaster relief funding, since this is a disaster that's unprecedented here in this area,"" he said.  ""The boats themselves would be insured by the individual boat owners. But as far as our wharfage, there's no storm surge insurance. It's going to be a huge job.""

The New Brunswick branch of the organization opened late last year at 300 Grandview Ave. in Saint John. Karen Walsh, the executive director of Newfoundland's program, received more than $1 million in federal funding from Employment and Social Development Canada to expand the program to New Brunswick, P.E.I., Nova Scotia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  ""I think one of the things we have to do is change the conversation,"" said Joanne Gormley, the project co-ordinator for the New Brunswick branch of the organization.  ""Skilled trades are a viable option for women.""  The organization is working on creating a database of employers and women in trades, so it can match a woman looking for an apprenticeship with a business.  ""We're providing information for those women and helping them in finding those positions.""  When the Office to Advance Women in Apprentices began in Newfoundland 10 years ago, women in skilled trades made up six per cent of the workforce there. That number has more than doubled, to around 13 per cent.  Across most of Canada, and including New Brunswick, women in skilled trades make up around four per cent of the workforce, Gormley said. Women looking to go into a trade have a hard time finding employment, and if a woman does secure a job in her field, she's sometimes given a task unrelated to her job, Gormley said. ""They may be given tasks such as going to sweep the floor or doing things like that as opposed to working in the trade that they've been hired to be in.""  Twenty-seven women have expressed interest in attending an event the non-profit is hosting Thursday night at its Saint John office, called Tradeswomen Tabletalk.  This is the group's second event since it started operating in New Brunswick.

The First Nations University Student Association held a smudge walk around the campus it shares with the U of R this morning. The event was planned after the University of Regina invited George Elliott Clarke to speak at the Woodrow Lloyd Lecture.  In December, there were calls for the lecture to be cancelled because Clarke had edited poetry for Steven Kummerfield, who was convicted of manslaughter in the beating death of Regina woman Pamela George in 1995. Clarke told CBC that he wasn't ruling out reading Kummerfield's work during the lecture. Clarke later apologized to members of George's family, said he would not read any of Kummerfield's poetry at the event and, the following day, cancelled the lecture completely.  Taryn Acoose, president of the FNUniv student association, said some of her peers and supporters from outside of the association and the school are calling for an apology from the U of R.  ""This is all just about having a discussion. We're not trying to slander or be rude to anybody,"" Acoose said. ""It's just...acknowledge that there was a mistake made. And how do we make it better? How do we move forward in a good way?"" Acoose said she's proud that her student association has been in talks with the U of R and has received some informal acknowledgement. The president of URSU and a representative of Vianne Timmons were both at the walk Thursday afternoon.  ""This is just a peaceful gesture just to demonstrate and promote healing,"" said Acoose. ""We just wanted to cleanse all the negativity from the university. ""These are small acts of reconciliation and healing that we can all practice in our own lives."" Acoose said she has classes with a member of Pamela George's family who said they were willing to welcome George Elliott Clarke.  George's daughter Chelsey, and other members of her family, took part in the walk along with students and other people who have lost a missing or murdered loved one. Acoose said it was powerful to see everyone come together. ""I almost cried,"" said Acoose.""I'm on my own healing journey and we all have that trauma, but you know, we need to start opening up that it's OK to acknowledge those traumas."" Chelsey George was brought on as one of the guest speakers at Thursday night's event, Speaking for Ourselves, held at the FNUniv by the group Matriarchs on Duty.   Chasity Delorme said they came up with the idea to give women the opportunity to perform songs, poetry and speak at the open mic. Delorme said she and other women were talking before the cancellation of the lecture and decided to take things into their own hands. ""That's kind of where the seed was planted,"" Delorme said.  The name for the group of organizers was inspired by the traditional role of women in Indigenous society, according to Delorme. ""Historically it was the women who oversaw what happens in the community. Although we had male chiefs to represent us — it was always the women who made decisions,"" she said. ""So we are also reclaiming our space within our communities and taking on the responsibility of protecting our community."" Delorme said the U of R should never have invited Clarke to give the lecture.  ""It's unfortunate that the committee who selected him didn't do their research,"" she said. ""Even when they did find out the connection, their lack of empathy is still actually what the community is hurting from."" She said truth and reconciliation should have superseded academic freedom of speech in this case.

""I have had friends in here with me every night,"" said Doran, while putting some water on to boil. ""I did some awesome bacon pesto grilled cheese sandwiches last night and I am hoping to do maybe a little fried pan pizza later this evening.""  Doran, who says he never once considered whether he's too old to build a snow fort, started the project three days ago and has spent hours in his snow cave every evening. ""It's the best. Everyone is asking to come over and everyone is more than welcome to crawl in and enjoy a couple drinks by the fire … listen to some tunes and hang out."" As the state of emergency in St. John's nears its end, Doran said he won't be sorry to see the fort go, regardless of the joy it brought him. ""It's OK, because I am going to remember this forever. This was one for the books, for sure."" Julie Purchase was running out of snow day activities when she decided to dig a five-room snow fort.  ""I had too much energy and I am no longer allowed to decorate in the house anymore so I had to get outside and create something,"" she said, while lying on her back in the structure she built just outside of her garage. Purchase said she spent hours digging, smoothing over the walls, adding decorations and now enjoying the space, often with a cold beverage. Her family has named it the Yoda hut, after the Star Wars character, and to keep on theme they have stuck figurines from the '70s in one of the fort windows and included a plush Yoda toy.  ""That just kind of happened and it's taken off so we have embraced it as much as we could,"" said Purchase. When asked if she is looking forward to seeing the state of emergency being lifted, she said, ""Work will always be there but these memories that you are making they are unique and you will always have them.

""We started just putting it up as a joke … just having a little bit of a laugh in the afternoon, just trying to stay busy and keep our mind off of everything that is going on,"" she said.   Roper says regardless of the cabin fever she and her friends have experienced, Snowmageddon 2020 could have been much worse.

177,Yvonne Colbert,2020-01-22T10:00:25.075Z,Why that cheap flight price in Canada might actually be in U.S. dollars,"Jane Wasson is still trying to figure out how an Air Canada flight booked last year in Canada, to fly across Canada, was billed in U.S. dollars and included some U.S. taxes. But Air Canada said the answer is simple — she was using the U.S. site, where the charges are clearly shown in American dollars and there's a small U.S. flag at the top of the home page. The airline stressed she paid the same fare as she would have on the Canadian site, once the currency conversion was taken into account. But Wasson thought she was paying in Canadian dollars and got a shock when the exchange rate kicked in. ""When you booked online there, was no indication that you were paying in American dollars,"" she said. ""There was none at all."" In August, Wasson sat down at her home computer in Minto, N.B., and booked a September round-trip flight on Air Canada's website, www.aircanada.com, for her husband to fly from Fredericton to Kelowna, B.C., with stopovers in Toronto on both legs. The cost was $801.14. It wasn't until she received her credit card statement in September that she saw Air Canada charged her $1,063.55 for the ticket — an additional $262.41. She contacted the Air Canada call centre, but said the customer service rep was as mystified by the charge as she was. Wasson was advised to file a complaint, which she did. She also called her credit card company to dispute the charge. It was removed. However, Air Canada maintained she owed the full amount, so the $262.41 charge was placed back on her account. Wasson received an acknowledgement of her complaint from Air Canada, followed by a generic response in November that didn't address the issue, but offered her a 15 per cent discount on another flight within the next year. She said she has subsequently booked other Air Canada flights and was charged in Canadian dollars. ""As soon as I learned through my credit card [that I was charged in American dollars], I went back ... but I haven't been able to duplicate the American charge,"" she said. She also doesn't understand why there was a U.S. flight segment tax and a U.S. transportation tax applied to the ticket for flights that were only in Canada. This isn't the first time an Air Canada passenger has been charged in U.S. dollars. In December 2018, B.C. resident Doreen Hucal said she was billed in U.S. dollars when she booked her flights on the Air Canada app. At the time, Air Canada said Hucal was using its American website, even though Hucal insisted she was using the app. In July 2017, the Competition Bureau issued a news release urging people to double-check the type of currency being used by companies online. It referenced purchases including furniture, clothes, jewelry and travel packages. It said some websites don't clearly identify which currency they are using, and that the dollar symbol could represent either Canadian or American dollars. ""Ensuring that you are shopping on the company's Canadian website (with an address ending in "".ca""), or selecting Canada as your country of origin can help, but it does not guarantee that the price shown is in CAD,"" said the news release. CBC News contacted the Competition Bureau to ask whether it has received complaints about airlines charging Canadians in U.S. dollars, how many complaints it's received and which airlines were involved. But the Competition Bureau said it wouldn't answer those questions because it's required by law to conduct its work confidentially. In an email to CBC News, an Air Canada spokesperson said as an international carrier, the airline sells tickets to people around the world and flights can be purchased in several currencies. ""Aircanada.com has pop-ups asking customers to confirm their country the first time they visit it or if users have not visited the site in a while,"" Pascale Dery wrote, adding customers should always check to ensure they are on their preferred site. Dery said the country is clear because of the flag at the top of the page, and changing countries and currency can be done by simply clicking on a tab. ""Customers are advised several times during the booking process of the currency they are purchasing in, including prior to completing their purchase,"" Dery added. CBC Halifax used the U.S. site to start booking a trip and it did clearly show the charges in U.S. dollars. CBC then cleared the cache of the computer and attempted to book again on the following day, which yielded a pop-up message that said, ""You are about to open the aircanada.com edition for UNITED STATES, but it looks like you're located in or your previous selection was CANADA."" Dery said that message isn't a new feature, but Wasson insisted there was no pop-up on her reservation. Meanwhile, Dery said all tickets are fully refundable within 24 hours of purchase, so customers should check the itinerary receipts sent to them at the time of booking to ensure everything is OK.

178,Nancy Russell,2020-01-23T22:55:34.052Z,"P.E.I. students raise awareness about Alzheimer's and dementia with presentation, commercial ","Students at a school in Georgetown, P.E.I., have turned what they've learned about Alzheimer's disease and dementia into a lesson of their own. The students are guest presenters this week at an Alzheimer's awareness conference in Charlottetown. They're also featured in a new commercial created for this year's Alzheimer's Awareness Month.  Sheryll O'Hanley, Georgetown Elementary School's principal, was asked by the Alzheimer Society of P.E.I. to share a resource they've developed for elementary students. It includes a storybook called What My Grandma Means to Say. ""With my own experience with Alzheimer's in my family, I jumped on the chance and it's just a perfect fit for Georgetown,"" O'Hanley said.  ""They're so rooted in family here and grandparents play a very big part in our students' lives so it was a no-brainer for me, I had to do it."" O'Hanley's grandfather had Alzheimer's and, as a pre-teen, she and her family cared for their grandparents every winter. ""I remember feeling almost resentment as a child because we weren't really told why we were going,"" O'Hanley said. ""We didn't talk about Alzheimer's and I think, at that time, perhaps the adults didn't think that as children we could handle the conversation."" The book is told from the point of view of a young boy, who watches his grandmother being diagnosed with Alzheimer's and moving into a nursing home. The story resonated for many of the students in Georgetown. Grade 5 student Laney King said one of her relatives has Alzheimer's. ""It is kind of hard sometimes when she doesn't remember you,"" she said. ""But we do visit her a lot so she remembers us more now."" Grade 6 student Patrick Collings said he has had similar experiences with one of his family members, who also has trouble remembering his name when he goes for visits. ""It was just kind of weird, but I didn't say anything and then I talked to my mom after we left and we talked about Alzheimer's."" The story also gave the students a better understanding of Alzheimer's and dementia. ""That Alzheimer's is not a contagious disease,"" said Grade 6 student Hannah Rafuse. ""You don't treat them differently just because they don't remember some stuff, because a lot of people don't remember stuff."" After reading the book, the class took on another spin-off project: creating memory books that they shared with their grandparents.  ""It was really touching because so many of them were like, 'Wow! I didn't think you remembered that,'"" O'Hanley said.  Then, the grandparents shared memories of their grandchild. ""It was very touching,"" O'Hanley said.  ""One grandmother came up to me and she said, 'This is my biggest fear, is that I'm going to forget her.'"" The Alzheimer Society asked if they could come to the session with a camera and interview some of the students and grandparents. That footage is now a new commercial created for this year's Alzheimer's Awareness Month.  ""It was very heartfelt,"" said Corrine Hendricken-Eldershaw, CEO of the Alzheimer Society of P.E.I. ""The ultimate goal is to have young people share their understanding when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's,"" she said. ""Some of the messages that the students of Georgetown shared are really very important for us to hear."" ""I'm very proud of our students, I think they're going to be wonderful ambassadors for Alzheimer's,"" O'Hanley said.  ""I think this will be something that they probably remember, that they can take this information into later years and reflect on."" O'Hanley hopes more P.E.I. educators will take advantage of the information kit, which is available in 37 elementary school libraries across the Island. ""I think the resource is a fabulous way to start the conversation with students, and that conversation to happen as a family,"" O'Hanley said.  ""Because grandparents are feeling frustration and that nervousness already and they may not even develop Alzheimer's, but it is something that they're scared of.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-georgetown-students-alzheimer-demention-awareness-1.5436574,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-alzheimer-s-dementia-letstalkmemory-campaign-1.4832844 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-libraries-dementia-books-2019-1.5224812 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-newcomers-food-bank-charlottetown-1.5436580,N/A
179,Ashley Burke,2020-01-24T18:54:36.466Z,'Alone and lost': Family of Canadian killed in Ethiopian air crash says government 'abandoned' them,"A Toronto mother and father whose daughter died in a plane crash in March say they're heartened by what Ottawa is doing to support victims of the more recent downing of a plane in Iran — but they still feel they were abandoned by their government. Clariss and Chris Moore are haunted by the death of their daughter Danielle, 24, in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. They accuse the federal government of not doing enough to help them and other victims' families through the aftermath. They also question why Ottawa didn't immediately ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 in the wake of another deadly crash in October 2018 off the coast of Indonesia. The two disasters killed 346 people. Just days after the crash in Ethiopia, Canada announced it was grounding all of its Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft and banning the jet from entering its airspace until further notice.  ""I feel so alone and so lost,"" said Clariss. ""I feel that we were abandoned. It took 10 months for our Canadian government to even have a meeting with us. ""We ended up scrambling on our own when the accident happened ... Our government didn't do anything for us."" Their daughter was headed to a meeting of the UN Environment Assembly when the aircraft plummeted shortly after takeoff, killing everyone aboard, including 18 Canadians. Chris said he's calling for a public inquiry to learn why Canada didn't ground the 737 Max immediately after the first tragedy.  ""We want to have some answers and we're not getting them now,"" he said.  ""We want to have the same type of transparency for this crash that the prime minister's asking for from the Iranian government. We want to have the same kind of accountability as well."" The federal government told CBC News it has learned from the recent tragedy in Iran and is committing to being more transparent and open with families of plane crash victims. The federal director general for civil aviation met with families of the Ethiopian air crash victims on Jan. 8 for four hours to answer questions. Transport Minister Marc Garneau plans to meet with families of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims and ask them directly what additional support they need. Canada is handling the loss of Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 in Iran earlier this month in a manner quite different from its approach to past international plane crashes involving Canadian victims. One of the major differences is the fact that Iran admitted it shot down the plane. The prime minister is publicly pressing Iran to let Canada help actively investigate the crash to make sure it's a thorough and transparent process. And Canada maintains diplomatic ties with Ethiopia, while it hasn't had a diplomatic mission in Iran since the Tehran embassy closed in 2012. Without an embassy on the ground, the government itself has been providing consular support, mental health services and legal aid, and has offered the families of the victims of Flight PS752 $25,000 for every deceased passenger to help cover their expenses. Liberal MP Omar Alghabra, parliamentary secretary to the prime minister, also announced this week the government will match donations made to the Canada Strong Campaign to support victims' families. The Moores said that, other than consular help, they received none of the support being offered to the families who lost loved ones in Iran. They say they're not looking for money — just transparency and accountability. Chris Bittle, Garneau's parliamentary secretary, told CBC News the government will do better moving forward. ""If we look at these two tragedies, there are differences, but we know the loss and the pain that the families are experiencing are the same,"" he said. ""We need to be better in terms of openness and transparency with the families."" The Moores, meanwhile, describe the government's offer of more face-to-face meetings as ""insulting,"" since they're coming so long after the event. When PS752 went down, Clariss said, it felt like an echo of the day her daughter died.  ""My whole body jerked,"" she said. ""I feel so sick. I feel their pain. I feel their confusion, their denial, their shattered life, their nightmares."" She said she still wonders what was going through her daughter's mind as the plane went down. ""Was she calling us? Was she calling me?"" Chris said dealing with the bureaucracy involved in a loved one's death in a foreign country has been ""very difficult."" ""There's so many different little minor things, but each minor thing is major from our perspective,"" he said. ""Because you have to relive everything again."" It took the family at least four months to get a death certificate from Ethiopia. When the document arrived, parts of it weren't in English — which meant translators were needed to process government paperwork, book a funeral home and settle Danielle's estate. While the Canadian embassy in Ethiopia helped arrange for the families to visit the crash site, Clariss said it ended in disappointment: they only had 30 minutes on the ground. ""They took us from the site,"" she said. ""That was not enough for me, that I fly from so far away and travel so far away."" The task of claiming Danielle's belongings was especially painful. The couple sifted through an online database of photos of items recovered from the crash site; to claim each individual item they had to prove to authorities that it belonged to their daughter. On what would have been Danielle's 25th birthday, an envelope arrived with her shoes inside — black flats she would have worn to the conference she was supposed to attend. The Moores still can't bring themselves to open that package. The Moores also described the process of bringing their daughter's remains home as ""dehumanizing."" Clariss said that as she stood at the airport with her son, next to the tiny coffin containing the few human remains that could be found, she was left with almost no time prior to boarding to absorb the moment and collect herself. ""My heart stopped,"" said Clariss. ""I wanted to open that coffin to see her face. To lift her up. To comfort her. To hug her."" With little government support, the Moores leaned on other 18 victims' families for help and comfort.  The Moores said together families started requesting meetings with Canadian officials this summer to learn what the government knew about the Boeing 737 Max before their daughter's death. The government, preparing for an election at the time, went into caretaker mode until the new cabinet was introduced at the end of November. The day after the crash in Iran, Nicolas Robinson, the director general for civil aviation, met with families of the Ethiopian air crash victims for four hours and answered questions. The meeting had been arranged with families ahead of time. Chris Moore said he wasn't satisfied with the answers they got about what Canada knew after the Indonesian crash. ""They were very secretive,"" he said. There are two ongoing safety investigations into the Ethiopian Airlines crash taking place in Ethiopia. U.S.-based Boeing is also facing a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department and is being sued by the families of some of the people who died in the crashes. Transport Canada is working with other civil aviation authorities around the world to co-ordinate allowing the 737 Max to fly again. Boeing will be required to make changes to the design of the jet and/or training and procedures of flight crew before the planes can return to service, according to Garneau's office.  In a statement to CBC News, Garneau said he ""knows that maintaining open lines of communication with families is essential going forward."" ""That is our priority,"" he added. ""As minister, I will not lift the flight restrictions on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 until we are fully satisfied that all safety concerns have been addressed by the manufacturer and the FAA and that enhanced flight crew procedures and training are in place.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ethiopian-airlines-crash-2019-update-downing-iran-plane-1.5433988,[],N/A
180,Rafferty Baker,2020-01-24T04:17:09.657Z,"Living near traffic corridors linked to risk of MS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease: UBC study","Researchers at the University of British Columbia have found that living near major roads or highways is linked to an increased risk of neurological disorders, while proximity to parks and green spaces is linked to a decreased risk. The findings are included in a study published this week in the journal Environmental Health. ""Neurological disorders are one of the leading causes of death and disability, globally, and we know very little about the risk factors associated with neurological disorders,"" said Weiran Yuchi, the study's lead author and PhD candidate at UBC school of population and public health. Yuchi's study looked at the neurological health effects of green space, air and noise pollution all together, but she said they made no findings regarding noise pollution. The researchers found an increase in the incidence of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementia among those living close to busy roads and highways.  In the case of Parkinson's, the risk increased by seven per cent among those living close to busy roads and highways. For non-Alzheimer's dementia, the risk rose by 14 per cent. But on the flip side, the study showed green spaces are associated with a three to eight per cent lower risk of neurological disorders, said Yuchi, who characterized the link as ""protective effects."" Yuchi said the study doesn't demonstrate that busy roads and green spaces cause the increased and decreased risks, respectively, only that a correlation exists. In terms of how close to a road one needs to live to fall into the affected population, Yuchi's study used as its measure 50 metres from a major road and 150 metres from a highway.  The researchers used a data set including nearly 700,000 adults living in Metro Vancouver for their study. They relied on hospital records, prescription information and doctor visits. They then estimated individuals' exposure to air and noise pollution and proximity to green space using their postal codes. In terms of access to green space, Yuchi said the study used 100 metres as a measure, and beyond the role trees play in creating clean oxygen to breathe, the positive effects could be associated with the likelihood of being more physically active and other benefits of living close to a park.  ""We're not in a position to tell where people should live, but we do suggest that urban planning efforts to increase accessibility to green spaces and to reduce motor vehicle traffic would be beneficial for neurological health at population level,"" she said. Yuchi said the study accounted for socio-economic status — things like income and education — as determinants of health, but the researchers didn't look at the effects of those factors directly. She said she's already working on a similar study with data from across the country, which includes 20 per cent of Canada's population to get an even clearer picture of how environmental conditions relate to the risk of neurological disorders.

The Ontario Seniors Dental Care Program (OSDCP) allows low-income seniors to visit a dentist for free, but the paperwork and few approved dentists mean there's a lengthy wait. The program was announced in June 2019 but only launched the application system at the end of November. For Rogers Villeford, he's already spent six months with bleeding gums — and just last week another filling fell out.  ""I've had this for about six months ... every day I bleed,"" said Villeford. ""I take mouthwash and keep it in there awhile and swish it ... every morning I spit out blood.""  Villeford's income is about $18,000 a year. He was accepted into the OSDCP, but the appointment he was given is nearly two months away.  ""What good are [the dentists] if you have to wait?"" said Villeford. Locally the OSDCP is run by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit. According to the director of health promotion, dentists under the program started seeing patients two weeks ago.  ""Our first senior seen under the program was Jan. 6,"" said Nicole Dupuis.  Dupuis said so far the program has seen about 15 patients, with another 46 appointments already booked. Appointment bookings are as far away as March. According to Dupuis it takes about one month between filling out the application to receiving a card that gives you access to the program. After the card comes in, seniors can book an appointment — but the first appointment is typically just a consultation.  ""We'll have more appointment times going forward,"" said Dupuis. ""We have had a wait list in our clinics ... a month is actually not too bad. We hope it won't get too much longer beyond that time frame."" Villeford decided he can't wait that long, so he made an appointment with a dentist — but he'll have to pay out of pocket for his treatment.  ""I don't want to lose my two front teeth,"" said Villeford, who expects to spend about $500 on the visit. ""It's a sham."" Similar to the Healthy Smiles Ontario program, there is an emergency service that might be available for people who need immediate treatment. To get emergency dental care, seniors would have to fill out a form signed by their medical provider that states they need treatment right away.  Villeford said the WECHU gave him an emergency appointment for Tuesday, but it won't include any work like fillings. Instead it will be to address what the health unit might consider are more serious problems.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/seniors-dental-program-ontario-windsor-teeth-1.5433138,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doug-ford-government-regular-dental-care-seniors-1.5366082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/senior-dental-program-windsor-essex-1.5134955 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/windsor-essex-health-unit-budget-2020-lean-1.5347818 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/dental-problems-out-of-emergency-rooms-more-funding-ontario-dental-association-1.5002474,N/A

183,Anonymous,2020-01-19T15:15:47.984Z,Oprah Winfrey details her decision to withdraw from Russell Simmons doc ,"Oprah Winfrey said Friday that Russell Simmons attempted to pressure her about her involvement with a documentary in which several women detail sexual abuse allegations against the rap mogul, but his efforts were not what prompted her to leave the project. ""He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me,"" Winfrey told The Associated Press through a spokesperson on Friday. It was not anything Simmons said that prompted Winfrey to withdraw from the On the Record film, according to Winfrey, but rather inconsistencies in the story of one of Simmons' accusers, Drew Dixon, that she felt needed to be addressed. Winfrey said Friday that she still believes Dixon and other women in the film, but that more reporting was needed. On the Record directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have said they have ample evidence against Simmons, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings. Winfrey has said she wanted to delay the release of the film, scheduled to premiere Jan. 25 at the Sundance Film Festival, but that that view was not shared by the film's directors. On the Record had been part of her partnership with Apple, which no longer will distribute the documentary. Winfrey, who herself has spoken openly of being sexually abused, announced she was leaving as executive producer on Jan. 10, saying that more work was needed and that the filmmakers were ""not aligned"" in their ""creative vision."" The film's producers, Impact Partners, said in a statement earlier this week that the movie was ready for Sundance. ""We have always championed the voices of those who have been wrongly silenced. The women in this film have made a great sacrifice by coming forward to tell their stories in their own words. We are honoured to support them,"" the Impact statement reads. ""We stand firmly behind the work of the intrepid filmmakers who continue to break new ground by advancing important stories in the public interest."" The AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Dixon has told her story publicly, including on CBS This Morning earlier this week. The communications between Winfrey and Simmons and her concerns about Dixon's story were first reported by The New York Times. Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, a Simmons representative issued a statement, saying ""If defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation, then there would be no justice."" Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Winfrey disputed allegations by the makers of On the Record that she gave them little warning before her Jan. 10 announcement. In a story which ran early Friday, Dick and Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter that they received just 20 minutes notice before Winfrey issued her statement. ""It was very disappointing and upsetting,"" Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them. That was our first thought. 'Oh my God. Let's tell everybody and figure this out.'""  Winfrey told the AP that Dick and Ziering knew well of her intentions. She said she had raised concerns last month about the film needing more work. According to Winfrey, she told Dick and Ziering that ""new information"" had made her see gaps she ""thought needed to be filled"" and that it was better to ""take a rest."" ""They said they would go on with or without me,"" Winfrey told the AP. She said the bottom line for her was that ""The film isn't ready.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/winfrey-decision-simmons-doc-1.5432160,[],N/A

The plan, by developer Charles Bird, would see two, four-storey buildings placed on a former church property on Millidge Avenue. It is being recommended by city planning staff, who say the location is in an ""intensification"" area dedicated to greater density. But opponents crowded the two small rooms being used for the committee hearings Tuesday night. The committee also received 37 letters about the project, the vast majority opposed. Many raise concerns about the density and height of the project, which would be placed on a 1.9-acre lot (about seven-tenths of a hectare).       Neighbour Hazel Kerr described the profile the buildings would create as ""a blot on the horizon,"" when compared to the single family homes surrounding it.  ""It's great that the city needs apartments, but there's a right place and a wrong place,"" said another opponent, Yuriy Klitinskiy. Gary Sullivan, Saint John council's representative on the advisory committee, is also a Millidgeville resident. He made the motion to recommend against the 88-unit development.  ""I've had a really hard time with this,"" said Sullivan. ""I know it will be a quality project, I just don't think it's the right thing for that area."" The amount of opposition caught the developers off guard. ""We didn't expect 37 people to show up against this. … We had knocked on all the doors, we thought we understood how the community felt,"" said engineer Andrew Toole, who was representing the proponent on the application. Toole said he would reach out to some of the neighbours to address their concerns before the proposal goes to a city council vote on Feb. 10. A second apartment project, planned for the Gothic Arches site on the city's Central Peninsula got a unanimous recommendation for approval from the committee. A series of supporters spoke in favour of the proposal, which would see a seven-storey building with 83 high-end units constructed on the Wentworth Street property.   ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/development-opposition-nimby-height-variance-planning-1.5435711,[],N/A

The school now offers 43 courses online, compared to 34 in the summer of 2017. Registrations for those courses have risen from 1,261 to 1,708. ""It has been growing quite a bit over the last few years,"" said Kathy Gottschall-Pass, the interim vice-president academic and research at UPEI. ""It just give students more options to be able to learn at their own pace."" She said during winter when classes are often cancelled due to storms, students taking online courses can continue their work uninterrupted.  More students are also taking longer to complete degrees since they also hold down jobs, she said.  ""They're doing a few courses at a time, and having online options just gives them so much more flexibility — often they can work on them on evenings or weekends,"" she said. ""So it's really quite advantageous.""  Some courses are now offered with both in-person and online components, she said. Gottschall-Pass notes a master of education is the only degree that UPEI students currently can get completely online. ""What that means is we often have students from across Canada or across the world taking our program at the same time!"" she said.  What about the valuable discussion and dissemination that takes place in classrooms? Faculty using online courses often make online discussion groups, Gottschall-Pass said.

The country's Health Minister Julio Mazzoleni said on Wednesday that the 48-year-old president fell unwell during a trip to the east of the country and returned to the capital Asuncion where the diagnosis was confirmed. He has been ordered to rest. ""The result of the blood test effectively confirms that the president has dengue,"" Mazzoleni said at a press conference. ""He will fulfil his agenda in Mburuvicha Roga [the presidential residence] with some restrictions,"" he said, adding the president was in a ""good general condition."" The diagnosis underscores the potential severity of the outbreak of the disease in Paraguay, which has the second highest incidence of dengue in South American after Brazil. A severe outbreak in 2013 led to 250 deaths in the country. The World Health Organization says the incidence of dengue, which causes high fever and joint pain, has been growing rapidly in recent decades. There is no specific treatment, but early detection and care reduces risks associated with the disease. The minister said Abdo Benitez must complete a rest period of at least 48 hours and will be evaluated day by day in order ""to discharge him when appropriate."" He added that the rest time could last three to seven days. Dengue is an endemic disease in Paraguay, with cases peaking in the summer months when the transmitting Aedes Aegypti mosquito proliferates. The government announced days ago that it is preparing for a strong epidemic that would peak in February. The health ministry has also confirmed that so far this year two people have died due to the disease and another 14 deaths are being investigated. In addition 1,800 cases of dengue have been confirmed and about 10,000 suspected cases reported.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/paraguay-abdo-benitez-illness-1.5435829,https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-change-health-children-1.5359024 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/philippines-dengue-declaration-1.5237214 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/benitez-elected-paraguay-president-1.4631041,N/A
188,Erica Johnson,2019-04-29T16:46:41.471Z,'I had to crawl': Amputee seeks damages after United Airlines and airport security seize scooter batteries,"Stearn Hodge says he will never forget the humiliation of having to drag his body across a hotel room floor during what was supposed to be a vacation celebrating his 43rd wedding anniversary — because a security agent at the Calgary International Airport and United Airlines confiscated the batteries he needed to operate a portable scooter. ""Having to crawl across the floor in front of my wife is the most humiliating thing that I can think of,"" said Hodge. ""It unmasks how real my disability is … I haven't been the same since."" The 68-year-old retired contractor from Kelowna, B.C., lost his left arm and right leg in a 1984 workplace accident. He now relies on a portable scooter powered by lithium batteries. But on a trip to Tulsa, Okla., on Feb. 26, 2017, an agent with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) and a United Airlines official told Hodge to remove the $2,000 battery from his scooter and fly without it, as well as his spare battery. In making the demand, both employees cited safety concerns. Stearn Hodge shows how he had to crawl when he didn't have his mobility scooter: Lithium-ion batteries are a potential fire hazard, but global standards issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) allow people with disabilities to travel with compact lithium batteries for medical devices in carry-on luggage. Hodge said no one from CATSA or United Airlines would listen to him or read IATA documents he had printed out, showing his batteries are permitted on board if an airline gives prior approval. Hodge had received that permission. ""They're taking my legs — and not only that, my dignity,"" said Hodge.  He can only wear a prosthetic leg for a short period due to discomfort and risk of infection, he said. A few months earlier, Hodge almost had his batteries seized on a WestJet flight. But ""seconds"" before takeoff — and after he suffered a panic attack — Hodge was granted permission to take them on board. He has now hired a lawyer and is fighting to have his case heard before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. A spokesperson for an Ottawa-based disability rights organization says it's ""frustrating"" that Canada's airline industry seems to ignore hard-won protections for people with disabilities. ""It's been a long fight to make sure that mobility devices — or any device used to accommodate a person with a disability — can be carried on [a plane],"" said Terrance Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. ""When security can — even with regulations in place — seize what otherwise should be able to go onto the aircraft, that leaves people with disabilities very vulnerable."" When the CATSA agent seized his batteries in Calgary, the employee suggested it wasn't a big deal, Hodge said. ""I still remember the CATSA agent saying, 'Well, you could get a wheelchair.' How's a one-armed guy going to run a wheelchair?"" asked Hodge. ""How am I going to go down a ramp and brake with one hand? But that shouldn't even have to come up."" Hodge's wife had recently undergone cancer treatment, which affected her spine, and she couldn't push a wheelchair for her husband. Hodge said he asked for an agent from United Airlines to come to the security checkpoint, as he had called the airline earlier and was assured it was OK to bring his battery and a spare on board. But the United Airlines employee that arrived sided with the security agent. Consequently, a three-week trip that was supposed to be a celebration with his wife resulted in Hodge spending much of his vacation confined to his bed. To perform basic personal hygiene, he was forced to drag himself across the hotel room floor to the bathroom. ""An anniversary is supposed to be all about remembering how you fell in love … and keeping that magic alive,"" said Hodge. ""And those things were denied. I'm crawling across the floor and it is pathetic."" A United Airlines spokesperson told Go Public that it couldn't comment on Hodge's experience, as he wants his case heard by the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In an email sent to Hodge by the airline, complaint resolution official Tatricia Orija wrote that ""it appears we were in violation of federal disability requirements,"" offering both Hodge and his wife an $800 travel certificate. She also apologized for the ""inconvenience."" ""Inconvenience is when it rains on your holiday,"" said Hodge. ""This was a … life-changing moment for me and my wife."" Three months before the United incident, on Nov. 27, 2016, Hodge had also run into battery problems while travelling to Cancun, Mexico. In that case, a WestJet employee initially told him he could take the batteries in a carry-on, but when he got to the security checkpoint, a CATSA agent said the batteries had to be in checked luggage. ""According to federal airline law, that's the worst place you want to put them,"" said Hodge. ""Because if a problem develops with those batteries, they don't know where they are and they're only going to find out about it when it's too late."" Minutes before his departure, a WestJet employee was able to confirm that the batteries could go on the plane. In an email to Hodge, a WestJet customer support agent wrote: ""While I cannot change your past experience, I would like to offer you a $350 future travel credit as a goodwill gesture."" WestJet spokesperson Morgan Bell told Go Public he couldn't comment on the case since it is before the courts but that ""WestJet will always err on the side of caution and supports the due diligence of its people evaluating any items they believe may pose a safety concern.""  CATSA also wouldn't address questions from Go Public, citing Hodge's complaint. The agency did provide Hodge with a transcript of a recorded call with client service agent Justine Drouin, who apologizes to Hodge and says ""all of the screening officers will undergo a briefing."" Hodge and his wife travel at least once or twice a year and say the only place they run into trouble with his scooter batteries is in Canada. ""I have flown through Europe, the United States and Mexico since 2015 with these batteries and have never been detained or harassed because of them. It is only in Canada that I have been relentlessly detained,"" said Hodge.  He estimates it's happened more than a dozen times in the past two years, saying it now triggers severe anxiety. ""When I go through the checkpoint, I'm starting to vibrate now. I don't know what I'm going to get. It's like playing Russian roulette."" Green, of the Council of Canadians with Disabilities, said while he's pleased there are protections in place for people with disabilities who are travelling, those protections need to be enforced. ""This is an assault on a person's dignity,"" said Green, noting his organization has been fighting over transportation issues for four decades. ""In 1979, the government of the day said, 'Yes, we will make our transportation system accessible,'"" he said. ""Here we are … 40 years later and the same barriers are there in transportation for Canadians with disabilities."" Green, who is visually impaired, said he has had security agents question the battery in his laptop, which allows it to ""talk"" when it is turned on. He said he receives ""a lot of emails and telephone calls"" from people with disabilities who have been hassled at the airport. ""It happens very, very frequently,"" said Green. ""You put in complaints, the first thing that happens is the airlines deny."" Go Public asked the Canadian Transportation Agency, which regulates air, rail and marine travel, how often people have filed disability-related complaints over the past three years. A spokesperson said the agency has received 583 accessibility complaints related to air travel during that time — with fewer than one per cent related to batteries. And those numbers have steadily increased since 2016. The majority of complaints related to the transport of mobility aids are from passengers who have had expensive mobility devices — scooters and wheelchairs — damaged.   Last September, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred Hodge's complaint to the Canadian Transportation Agency. However, the agency has no power to award general damages beyond out-of-pocket expenses.  On May 9, Hodge's lawyer, John Burns, will ask a Federal Court judge to compel the commission to hear the case. ""It's a failure of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to grant access to the remedy that the statute provides,"" said Burns. The Canadian Human Rights Act allows for up to $20,000 in damages for each count of pain and suffering, and up to another $20,000 if the discrimination is ""willful or reckless."" ""It sends a very clear message to the airlines and everybody else involved,"" said Burns. ""People with disabilities should be taken seriously. You don't take away somebody's legs and then describe it as an inconvenience. No, this is an injury."" Hodge is optimistic he'll eventually have his day before the Canadian Human Rights Commission. It's a pricey endeavour. In order to cover legal costs, he's had to put up for sale a cherished Corvette he has worked on for years. But it's a fight he says he has to have — not just for himself, but for so many others with disabilities. ""The thing I would love more than the compensation,"" said Hodge, ""is the [legal] decision that someone can go to and say, 'You did it here, you can do it for me.'""

189,Kelly Crowe,2020-01-24T09:03:49.903Z,Bats and sneezing camels: A tale of two viruses,"For a few hours on Thursday, it appeared the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had spread to Saudi Arabia with reports that a nurse in Asir was infected.  But it was a case of mistaken virus identification, quickly corrected. The unfortunate nurse was actually infected with a different but equally frightening coronavirus: MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, or MERS-CoV), which made the leap from animals to humans in 2012, creating a brand new human disease. It was a vivid reminder that for almost a decade there has been a threat from another highly pathogenic never-before-seen virus. MERS was only the second coronavirus ever known to leap from animals to humans and cause a deadly illness. The first of these notorious bugs was SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS-CoV), which swept the world in the spring of 2003, killing nearly 800 people, including 44 Canadians. With scant information about the novel virus that has just emerged in China, experts are reviewing the experience of SARS and MERS for important clues about what to expect. ""The interesting thing about this is that we're really not sure which way it's going,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""We first thought, well, there really wasn't much transmission from human to human."" Now that it's clear the virus can spread between people, Fauci said the next question is how easily it will spread. ""The real question right now is will it get better at going in what we call 'sustained transmission' from human to human. Because if it doesn't, then we have a very good chance of pretty quickly getting our arms around it and, by public health measures, essentially stopping it."" Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, is a veteran of the SARS and MERS outbreaks, and he's blunt about the current situation. ""This is a bad disease. It makes people very sick and it can kill you. And so I think that is an important combination. But  the ultimate case fatality rate is still yet to be determined."" In other words, experts still don't know how dangerous the new virus is or how it compares to SARS, with a case fatality rate around 10 per cent, or MERS, with an estimated fatality rate as high as 30 per cent. ""I know how this picture is starting but I don't know how it ends. And so I think that's the question we're all asking,"" said Osterholm. The SARS and MERS viruses followed different paths. SARS began in China in the fall of 2002 and spread around the world quickly. By spring 2003, it had travelled to 37 countries including Canada, sickening more than 8,000 people. Still, SARS lacked the ability to spread easily between humans. ""It never really developed the capability of having sustained vigorous transmission from person to person,"" said Fauci. ""There was clearly person-to-person transmission but it wasn't like influenza. You had thousands of cases but not millions of cases."" And after nine frightening months, SARS was extinguished, apparently forever. ""SARS was actually a huge public health success in that we were able to control, contain and eliminate that virus,"" said Dr. Catharine Paules, who co-authored a new paper with Fauci about coronavirus infections published this week in JAMA. ""But then in 2012 we had the emergence of a second animal coronavirus in the human population."" MERS first appeared in Jordan in 2012 with cases showing up in 27 countries over eight  years. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control states that all of the MERS cases are linked to travel or residence in countries around the Arabian Peninsula. There was a major outbreak of MERS in a South Korean hospital in 2015 where 186 people were infected and 36 died. So far, public health agencies have been able to limit the human-to-human spread of MERS but they have not been able to eradicate the virus. That's because MERS has become the camel version of the common cold. ""The camels will be sneezing or coughing and they sort of sneeze or cough this virus onto people; that's how we think it's transmitted,"" said Paules. In the case of SARS, animal-to-human transmission was eliminated when live-animal markets stopped selling small mammals, including palm civets, which were found to be carrying the SARS virus. ""Once we realized that palm civets were the primary animal species transmitting it to humans, and the markets were eliminated, we literally shut off the faucet of new infections coming into humans,"" said Osterholm. The animal reservoir for the new virus is so far a mystery. Experts are extremely skeptical about early reports of an association with snakes. ""I know there was a recent publication that came out about snakes, but that's hotly being debated right now as we aren't even sure that reptiles can get infected with coronaviruses,"" said Paules. ""I think many of us thought that that was in error and not likely to be the source,"" said Osterholm. ""But at this point, we have no data otherwise from the Chinese to know what might have been the animal reservoir."" ""If you want to put some money on it, you'd get a bat involved,"" said Fauci. ""SARS went from the bat to the palm civet cat to the human, and MERS went from the bat to the camel to human. I don't have any idea what the animal is for this one but I would not be surprised if a bat was involved somewhere."" There are also major questions about the transmissibility of the new virus. Scientists still don't know how the virus spreads, although Fauci said environmental tests revealed traces of the virus at the market in Wuhan, China. ""They did environmental samples and it was able to be seen on some of these inanimate objects in the fish market,"" he said. ""Though no one has yet done the definitive experiment of seeing whether it stays alive on a doorknob or not; I wouldn't be surprised if it did last for a limited period of time on inanimate objects."" Fauci said it appears to take about six days for someone who has been infected to show symptoms, but it's not clear whether the virus can be spread by someone who does not appear to be sick. ""But there are anecdotes; for example, the individual from Seattle who got infected does not remember coming into contact with anyone that was sick, nor does he remember coming into contact with any animals, nor did he feel that he had any exposures. Yet he got infected."" A grim aspect of all three diseases is the phenomenon of the super-spreader — a person who, for some reason still not well understood, is able to infect a large number of people. ""That's one of the big mysteries,"" said Osterholm.  ""Super-spreaders have been individuals who have been severely ill and even people who've been moderately ill. Why they're putting out so much virus is just not clear."" In the case of MERS, Osterholm said one person in a South Korean emergency room was able to infect 82 people in 2015. In the case of SARS, one super-spreader in Beijing was responsible for a chain of infections in 76 people. It's been reported that one man in Wuhan infected 14 hospital workers, which could be the first evidence of a super-spreader in this outbreak. But because it happened during surgery, the infection could be related to the surgical procedures. ""I think we have to still be a little bit careful, because this individual actually had had surgery, and any time you intubate somebody, you know you may very well have induced a higher rate of spreading the virus,"" said Osterholm. One of the encouraging aspects of the SARS story is that the virus was contained, said Osterholm, pointing to Canada, where most of the more than 400 infections and 44 deaths happened in and around Toronto. ""While Canada suffered miserably because of what was going on in Toronto, there weren't even any cases in Calgary, and Winnipeg,"" he said. ""So what we need to get people to understand is that we can't say this isn't going to come to every country in the world. It's unlikely, but it could. But when it does, it's going to likely be largely an institution-based outbreak like a hospital."" ""So that just helps give people a sense that we're not all going to die from this,"" he said. At her hospital in Hershey, Pa., Paules is part of a team that trains regularly to respond to an emerging viral threat. She said some of the strategies developed during the SARS and MERS outbreaks are already being used, including the closing of animal markets and airport screening. ""Some of those things have been able to get up and running very quickly, probably because of the lessons learned from SARS,"" said Paules. China was able to sequence the new virus and get that critical genetic code to the world quickly. Diagnostic tests have been developed, which means cases can be identified and isolated to contain the spread. ""I think some of the things from SARS and MERS that have really helped us here is how quickly the Chinese authorities were able to globally circulate the sequence of this virus,"" said Paules, who echoes Osterholm's point that most people don't have to worry about this virus. ""I would be concerned if I was in some of these areas in China. I would not myself probably decide to travel to any of those areas right now. But here sitting in my office in Hershey, Pennsylvania, I have a low concern that this virus is going to impact me personally, although I'm concerned for the global community.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/sars-mers-coronavirus-1.5438562,[],N/A

191,Sara Frizzell,2020-01-23T14:36:43.062Z,Nunavut outfitter found guilty of running wildlife tours without a licence,"Arctic Kingdom Inc. has been found guilty of four charges related to running a tour near wildlife without a licence.  The four counts relate to four consecutive days in March 2017, when the Nunavut outfitter ran private tours out of a camp it had set up around 30 kilometres outside of Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut. Arctic Kingdom advertised offering photo tours of polar bears and icebergs.  Section 117(2) of Nunavut's Wildlife Act prohibits running a commercial activity involving wildlife without a licence from the government of Nunavut.  Justice Paul Rouleau delivered his decision by telephone in the Nunavut Court of Justice on Monday — he then distributed his 18-page written decision with his reasons to the parties involved.  The Crown, William Lu, called two witnesses during the trial in Qikiqtarjuaq, both of whom were with Nunavut's Department of Environment.  Joseph Guay was a conservation officer based in the community, who was informed of the camp by local hunters and conducted an investigation.  He testified he found the outfitter had no licence and that the local hunters and trappers organization (HTO) did not approve of the camp's location, which they said interfered with polar bear family groups emerging from a nearby fjord.   Arctic Kingdom had written to the Nattivak HTO that February requesting permission for the camp and enclosed a brochure for a ""Spring Polar Bears & Icebergs of Baffin (Photo Safari)."" In March, the HTO wrote back rejecting the planned activities.  ""Inuit are considered co-managers of wildlife. As such, they are involved and have a say in issues concerning wildlife in their area,"" Rouleau's decision reads.  The Wildlife Act's regulations require the submission of an activity outline — especially in cases where the HTO has reservations — after which the HTO has 40 days to provide comments.  After prompting from the environment department, Arctic Kingdom did file a request for a licence —  three days before the offences. This was not enough time to fulfil the 40-day requirement.  While investigating, Guay visited the camp, which was around 10 tents, including a kitchen tent surrounded by bear fencing. He witnessed Arctic Kingdom's clients taking part in a Parks Canada orientation session and then leaving from the Qikiqtarjuaq airport. Arctic Kingdom has been running private tours in Nunavut for two decades. It was represented by Iqaluit-based lawyer Anne Crawford.  She argued that Lu, when questioning Officer Guay, did not always confirm the information gathered from Arctic Kingdom employees about the activities was given voluntarily by the employees — he only did so some of the time.  Rouleau found the information could be used in court despite the lack of confirmation in every instance, and that voluntarily-given information was enough to convict the outfitter.  Crawford also argued that paper evidence and testimony referred to Arctic Kingdom, Arctic Kingdom Polar Expeditions and Arctic Kingdom Polar Expeditions Inc., so the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Arctic Kingdom Inc. committed the offences.  Justice Rouleau concluded Arctic Kingdom Inc. was responsible because the employees involved responded to correspondence for Arctic Kingdom Inc.  Crawford said Arctic Kingdom had also contracted services from another outfitter, but the judge decided there was no doubt which business was in charge of the operation and therefore responsible.  And finally, Rouleau noted Arctic Kingdom was familiar with the licensing process because it had a licence in 2016 for the months of July to December — and dismissed Crawford's argument the 2016 licence was still valid.  Rouleau found that other instances in which the government waived the requirement for licences before the Act's regulations were in place, or allowed licences to apply retroactively, were not relevant to the offences before him in this case.  Before the trial, Arctic Kingdom had mounted a constitutional challenge to the Wildlife Act. That challenge failed when Rouleau found the act did not infringe on the rights of Inuit to interact with wildlife in non-commercial settings.  This case is scheduled for sentencing on Thursday morning. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-kingdom-wildlife-act-guilty-1.5436272,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/arctic-kingdom-wildlife-act-challenge-1.5185760,N/A

""I don't know how low the numbers have to get for people to give their head a shake,"" Hambrook said. The most recent numbers are the lowest recorded since 2014, when only 12,000 salmon returned to the river. The Miramichi Salmon Association attributes the decline to grey seal predation in the bay, striped bass predation in the river and estuary and habitat degradation. Striped bass are eating a significant portion of Atlantic salmon making their way from the ocean to the river, Hambrook said.  Fifteen years ago, salmon had a 70 per cent survival rate of making it out to Miramichi Bay and into the river. But Hambrook said the survival rate has decreased to 20 per cent. In other places, like Chaleur Bay, the survival rate of salmon making it there was 75 per cent about 15 years ago and remains the same today. ""We'd like to have the regulations so that you can keep striped bass no matter what the size, if you're angling to remove it from the river."" In the 1960s, there were only about 2,000 grey seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Hambrook said. The population of grey seals has since grown to between 70,000 to 100,000. ""Those numbers have to be reduced."" In 2018, Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans approved Eel Ground First Nation for a 25,000-fish commercial pilot license for striped bass.  The Miramichi Salmon Association and the Atlantic Salmon Federation have also been calling for the eradication of the invasive smallmouth bass from the area for years. Global warming is also causing water temperatures to rise, affecting fish habitats. ""We are getting increased warming of our rivers, so we have to do what we can to make sure that those cold water sources are protected.""

In 2015, the city began rolling out a mandatory water-meter program, with the initial target of having meters installed in all homes by the end of 2019.  While the city did not quite meet that goal, Coady said there remain only a ""very small number of non-metered residents,"" and he hopes to see all customers hooked up soon.  He said the metering program has been a success in reducing household and business consumption. ""When you get your bill you can see how much you used and what you're paying."" He also credits customers and businesses ""understanding that it's not an unlimited resource. The due diligence that they have on their part to reduce their water use has gone a long way.""  He believes the city's education campaigns, as well as programs such as rebates for installing low-flow toilets and shower heads have helped to create a conversation around water use in the city, and a focus on water conservation. In 2018, the city completed work on a new well field, in Miltonvale Park, in order to meet demands and ease pressure on the city's other three well fields. For years there have been concerns about water levels in the Winter River, the city's main water source.  With the fourth well field up and running, and the water consumption trending down, Coady is optimistic about the city's water capacity for years to come.   ""The city is in great shape going forward,"" he said.  ""To be honest with you, looking at the trend, if we had kept going where we were going in 2008, we'd probably be sitting here talking about another new water field, and we're not doing that.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-water-use-down-1.5438136,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/charlottetown-mandatory-water-meters-1.3268824 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/water-meters-charlottetown-pei-1.4510564 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/charlottetown-well-field-problems-delays-pei-1.4978804 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dealyed-well-field-running-1.5109169 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-printing-press-transcontinental-job-offer-1.5438063 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-upei-online-courses-education-demand-1.5437958,N/A
194,Rhiannon Johnson,2020-01-24T09:00:00.908Z,Chippewa artist's teaser poster for Blood Quantum gets thumbs up from Jeff Barnaby,"A Toronto-based Chippewa artist says a recent commission to design a teaser poster for Jeff Barnaby's new zombie film Blood Quantum was right up his alley. ""I'm a huge horror movie fan and to see some representation in the horror genre is really cool,"" said Jay Soule.  Soule, also known as Chippewar, is known for politically driven installation pieces that draw attention to issues facing Indigenous people across Canada. He also has a clothing line and paints his own interpretations of classic film posters by indigenizing the titles and images.  He was approached by Elevation Pictures to create a teaser poster for Barnaby's new film, which premiered last year at Toronto International Film Festival.  The film's premise is that an apocalyptic zombie virus is sweeping the nation and the only people who seem to be immune are part of a fictional First Nations reserve. As people flee to the reserve, the main characters have to decide whether to let outsiders in, risking their own safety. The film and its title offer a commentary on colonization and the concept of blood quantum as a measure of one's indigeneity. Soule said he's probably seen the film four or five times and has created three pieces, one for a TIFF zine and another for the cover of NOW magazine. The latest rendition will be used for promotional purposes leading up to the film's theatrical release in April.  For Soule, a horror genre lover, the film was already in his wheelhouse of interest.  ""It was hand in hand with already what I'm doing with indigenizing classic film,"" he said.   Under his pseudonym Chippewar, Soule recreates classic film posters with an Indigenous spin, like turning The Breakfast Club into The No-breakfast Club or Back to the Future into Back to 1491. For Blood Quantum, ""I went for that old grindhouse-style poster from the late '70s when the posters were still hand-drawn,"" he said. Barnaby said he wasn't familiar with Soule's work prior to being introduced by Elevation, which surprised him.  ""What he does with posters, I do with films,"" said Barnaby.  The Mi'kmaw director said he's very happy with Soule's work on the teaser poster.  ""It looks like a kickass action movie,"" he said. ""I would go see the film based solely on that poster."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/blood-quantum-poster-chippewar-1.5438220,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/tiff2019-bloodquantum-1.5273257 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/jay-soule-chippewar-store-toronto-1.4450438,N/A
195,Jim Bronskill,2020-01-23T22:35:51.054Z,Survey finds support among Canadians for broader assisted-dying law,"As the federal government moves to revise the law on assisted dying, new survey results suggest most Canadians support medical help to end suffering even when a natural death is some time away. In a web survey conducted this month for The Canadian Press, polling firm Leger found 86 per cent of respondents agreed that someone with a serious, degenerative and incurable disease should be able to request and obtain medical assistance in dying. Seventy-four per cent of those who took part said medical assistance in dying should be accessible to all people with incurable diseases, even if their death is not fast approaching. Agreement with this notion of a broader assisted-dying regime ranged from 66 per cent in Manitoba and Saskatchewan to 84 per cent in Quebec. There was also little variation among people who identified as supporters of any of the three main national political parties. The results come as the Trudeau government works to comply with a Superior Court of Quebec ruling that concluded it is unconstitutional to allow only Canadians who are already near death to seek medical help to end their lives. ""Based on these numbers, it's all green lights for the federal government to move ahead,"" said Leger executive vice-president Christian Bourque. The survey was conducted Jan. 17 to 21 among 1,552 Canadians eligible to vote who were randomly recruited from an online panel. Since polls created from Internet panels are not random samples, however, the survey can't be assigned a margin of error. The polling firm says that using data from the 2016 census, results were weighted according to age, gender, mother tongue, region and level of education to ensure a representative sample of the population. The Quebec court gave the government until March 11 to amend the current law, which took effect four years ago following a landmark Supreme Court of Canada ruling that struck down the previous prohibition on doctor-assisted death. ""I'd like to have a bill in front of the House of Commons as soon as possible,"" Justice Minister David Lametti said Thursday. Lametti did not rule out requesting an extension should the March 11 deadline prove to be tight, but said he would first like to see what level of consensus exists in the House. The government is seeking views through an online questionnaire, closing Jan. 27, on how the law should be changed. Lametti, Health Minister Patty Hajdu and Carla Qualtrough, the minister for disability inclusion, are also consulting key voices at roundtables and other meetings. The Leger poll yielded some views on questions the government has asked Canadians to ponder. For instance, 74 per cent of respondents said people should be allowed to express an advance wish for medical assistance in dying if one day they should be diagnosed with a serious, degenerative and incurable disease. Seventy-three per cent agreed with the option of making an advance request for help ending their lives, using an official application form, as soon as a person has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and is still lucid. Just under half of respondents said the current 10-day period of reflection between requesting and receiving a medically assisted death should be increased.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/assisted-dying-legislation-broad-support-1.5438387,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medical-assistance-dying-survey-response-1.5434832 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/meidcally-assisted-death-survey-1.5434619 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,N/A

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the crash deaths in the state's Snowy Monaro region, which came as Australia grapples with an unprecedented fire season that has left a large swath of destruction. Coulson Aviation (USA) said in a statement that one of its Lockheed C-130 Hercules air tankers was lost after it left Richmond in New South Wales with retardant for a firebombing mission. It said the accident was ""extensive"" but had few other details. In a statement, the company said it will send a team to the site to assist in emergency operations. Coulson Aviation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Coulson Aircrane of Port Alberni, B.C. ""The only thing I have from the field reports are that the plane came down, it's crashed and there was a large fireball associated with that crash,"" said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she had conveyed Australia's condolences to U.S. Ambassador Arthur Culvahouse Jr. ""Our hearts go out to their loved ones. They were helping Australia, far from their own homes, an embodiment of the deep friendship between our two countries,"" she said in a statement. ""Thank you to these three, and to all the brave firefighters from Australia and around the world. Your service and contribution are extraordinary. We are ever grateful,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, all we've been able to do is locate the wreckage and the crash site and we have not been able to locate any survivors,"" he said. The tragedy brings the death toll from the blazes to at least 31 since September. The fires have also destroyed more than 2,600 homes and razed more than 10.4 million hectares. Coulson grounded other firefighting aircraft as a precaution pending investigation, reducing planes available to firefighters in New South Wales and neighbouring Victoria state. The four-propeller Hercules drops more than 15,000 litres of fire retardant in a single pass. Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the national air crash investigator, and state police will investigate the crash site, which firefighters described as an active fire ground. ""There is no indication at this stage of what's caused the accident,"" Fitzsimmons said. Berejiklian said there were more than 1,700 volunteers and personnel in the field, and five fires were being described at an ""emergency warning level."" Also Thursday, Canberra Airport closed because of nearby wildfires, and residents south of Australia's capital were told to seek shelter. The blaze started Wednesday but strong winds and high temperatures caused conditions in Canberra to deteriorate. A second fire near the airport that started on Thursday morning is at the ""watch and act"" level. ""Arrivals and departures are affected due to aviation firefighting operations,"" the airport authority said in a tweet. Another tweet from traffic police said ""the fire is moving fast and there are multiple road closures in the area. Please avoid the area. Local road blocks in place."" Residents in some Canberra suburbs were advised to seek shelter and others to leave immediately. ""The defence force is both assisting to a degree and looking to whether that needs to be reinforced,"" Defence Minister Angus Campbell told reporters.

198,"Harvey Cashore, Rachel Ward, Mark Kelley",2020-01-15T17:58:55.890Z,'I did not kill her': Justice officials withheld report signalling no homicide while Alberta man sat in prison,"Butch Chiniquay was only months into a lengthy prison sentence in the death of his girlfriend, Charmaine Wesley, when senior officials in Alberta's Justice Ministry obtained a report that might have exonerated him. An initial autopsy had found that Wesley's 2011 death was a homicide, and that her injuries were ""inflicted trauma."" Chiniquay was charged with second-degree murder. But a later medical report written in November 2012 by a panel of expert pathologists concluded that there was no adequate evidence of homicide and that Wesley's injuries in a car accident were a possible cause of her death. An investigation by CBC's The Fifth Estate has found that report, commissioned by Alberta Justice, was never provided to Chiniquay or his lawyer. In a recent interview, The Fifth Estate host Mark Kelley showed Adriano Iovinelli, Chiniquay's lawyer, the previously undisclosed medical finding. ""Why am I seeing this for the first time?"" Iovinelli said. ""You're not going to get [his] period of incarceration back."" Chiniquay, 34, said he feels vindicated by the new revelations. ""I am being honest, and I am telling the truth, and I am innocent,"" he said during an interview at his home on Stoney Nakoda First Nation, 60 kilometres west of Calgary, where he now lives after being released from prison. ""I did not kill her."" These revelations come as part of a six-month The Fifth Estate investigation that found senior officials at Alberta Justice were aware of a report that shook the foundations of several murder charges and cast into doubt numerous findings of a medical examiner in Calgary a decade ago. At issue were some of the autopsies performed by Dr. Evan Matshes, a forensic pathologist working out of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Calgary in 2010 and 2011. After concerns were raised about some of his findings, Alberta Justice launched an inquiry into whether or not there had been miscarriages of justice relating to autopsies. Alberta Justice eventually decided to hire an external review panel of three U.S. forensic pathologists to assess Matshes's work. The panel later stated their opinion that Matshes had made ""unreasonable"" findings in 13 of 14 cases reviewed. Five of those cases were related to criminal charges. Yet The Fifth Estate has learned that in several criminal cases, those findings were not provided to defence lawyers or their clients, and that the report was buried for years by Alberta Justice — even as the incarcerated were serving their sentences. Watch the full Fifth Estate documentary, The Autopsy Part 1: What If Justice Got It Wrong? Iovinelli said that it is up to Alberta Justice to explain why those reports were not released to defence lawyers. ""This is a significant difficulty that has to be addressed by the government, it just has to be,"" Iovinelli said. Alberta Justice declined repeated requests to speak to The Fifth Estate. Eric Tolppanen, the head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, said in a statement that information was provided to defence lawyers ""where required"" and that they are ""confident"" that they met their ""disclosure obligations."" Tolppanen did not elaborate about what, if any, disclosure was provided or to whom. Legal experts consulted by The Fifth Estate say Alberta Justice was required by law to disclose any relevant documents to defence lawyers. ""It's not a question you have to give any thought to at all,"" said James Lockyer, a lawyer with Innocence Canada and an expert in wrongful convictions cases. ""Alberta Justice has a lot to answer for."" Internal email correspondence shows that Alberta Justice acknowledged it must ""disclose to the defence what we know."" Court records also show that Greg Lepp, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service, and now a provincial court judge, acknowledged Alberta Justice had a ""constitutional"" obligation to disclose the results of the expert review to defence lawyers. Alberta Justice also stated the findings of a medical examiner was often ""critical to the outcome of court cases."" ""The deputy (minister) is particularly concerned about whether there is someone in prison,"" Lepp said in a 2012 email to several senior justice officials. Tolppanen said that Chiniquay's lawyer Iovinelli was aware that ""additional disclosure regarding Dr. Matshes was available"" and that Iovinelli told Alberta Justice he did ""not require this further disclosure."" Iovinelli bristled at that suggestion. ""At no time was I ever told that there was a peer review done that indicates that this is not a homicide,"" he said. ""And more importantly, if they had that in their hand, why didn't they do something about it?"" Matshes declined to speak to The Fifth Estate.  ""I stand by my work,"" he wrote in a statement. ""I have devoted my professional life to making sure that the criminal justice system holds those guilty responsible for their crimes and does not prosecute the innocent."" Alberta Justice began looking into Matshes's work in early 2012 after an insurance company raised concerns about one of his accidental death autopsies. Internal records show officials were most concerned about possible wrongful convictions. A panel of three forensic pathologists was selected to review several of Matshes's autopsies, including cases that had already led to second-degree murder charges. One case involved 18-year-old Shelby Herchak, who was described in news headlines as a ""baby killer."" In 2010, she was charged with second-degree murder after her 26-day-old son Daniel died of blunt-force trauma to the head. Herchak later accepted a plea deal for manslaughter and served more than five years in federal prison. The original report by Matshes stated there were multiple injuries to Daniel's head, including one that was seven to 15 days old. To the police, that meant intent. Herchak was charged with second-degree murder. ""That medical examiner deemed me a monster,"" Herchak said in a recent interview at her home in Calgary's south end. No one told Herchak that senior officials in Alberta Justice — including some who are now judges — had initiated that review of Matshes's work. Her son's autopsy was among the cases reviewed. That report could have been critical to Herchak's defence because it questioned two key facts the Crown asserted to the judge ahead of her sentencing. The expert review panel disputed that there was evidence of that earlier injury to Herchak's infant son, Daniel. They also raised concerns that Matshes may have mistaken a natural separation in a newborn's skull, which is not fully fused, with a fracture. The possibility there was a single injury to Daniel's head would have fit Herchak's assertion that she dropped her baby after waking up suddenly. ""I did not kill my son. It was an accident. I dropped him,"" Herchak said. Alberta Justice was provided the new evidence contradicting Matshes's report long before her murder trial was to begin, yet did not disclose it. Lockyer said Alberta Justice has no justification for burying the report, and it was obligated to provide it. ""You have three pathologists who have reviewed the case and reviewed the original autopsy and all three of them are agreed that the original autopsy report was erroneous, wrong,"" Lockyer said. Without that evidence, Herchak told The Fifth Estate she agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in order to avoid a life sentence for second-degree murder. ""To go through trial on a second-degree murder charge knowing that the medical examiner, all the stuff that he said, the judge and the jury would have believed him over anything that I said,"" Herchak said. ""I just gave up, I couldn't do it anymore, I didn't want to go to jail for life."" In January 2012, Chiniquay also agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter to avoid going to trial on his second-degree murder charge. He was sentenced to five years in prison. Lockyer said the accused's decision to agree to a manslaughter plea bargain is not unusual in the circumstances. ""We know from wrongful conviction cases in Canada … that people pleaded guilty to crimes they didn't commit because they were facing a murder charge,"" he said. The Fifth Estate showed Herchak a copy of the expert review panel report for the first time — seven years after it was written. ""Who in their name would bury a piece of paper so far down to make sure that nobody saw it, and send someone to jail for 5½ years? And with the name 'baby killer' for the rest of her life,"" Herchak said. In his statement, Matshes told The Fifth Estate he has been the victim of ""personal vendettas"" and ""local politics."" In a series of letters and emails to Alberta Justice in 2012 and 2013, Matshes and his lawyers asked that the findings of the review panel be set aside. Initially, Alberta Justice vigorously defended its process and the findings of the report. Officials with the ministry said they were concerned about possible miscarriages of justice and the impact on murder cases. Then in November 2013, Alberta Justice conceded in court that Matshes was not properly consulted. Both parties agreed to set aside the expert panel report. A judge formally approved the agreement and issued an ""order to quash."" At the same time, Alberta Justice told the court that it was ""integral"" that they continue their probe of Matshes's work. ""The minister also asserts that the administration of justice demands a new external review panel be conducted,"" said Marta Burns, then senior legal counsel and now a superior court judge with Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench. Alberta Justice did not respond to The Fifth Estate's queries about why that second review has not taken place, six years later. ""Nothing has happened,"" said Butch Chiniquay's lawyer Adriano Iovinelli. ""Who dropped the ball?"" In an email, head Crown prosecutor Eric Tolppanen said that because of the decision to ""quash"" the report, the findings are therefore ""inconsequential."" Matshes is now suing Alberta Justice, his former boss in the medical examiner's office and the expert panel members for $30 million for defamation. The Fifth Estate obtained the expert review reports and other related documents from two court actions initiated by Matshes against Alberta Justice. The Fifth Estate asked forensic pathologist Dr. John Butt for his opinion of review panel findings and related court documents. ""What this suggests to me is that there is a significant problem with the work that was done by Dr. Matshes,"" said Butt, who has helped develop medical examiner legislation across Canada. ""My understanding now is that the justice department swept this whole thing under the rug."" Some of the most senior members of Alberta Justice, including the then-ministers, were involved with and co-ordinated the review of potential miscarriages of justice relating to those autopsies. The review of Matshes's work was directly under the purview of Greg Lepp, now a provincial court judge, then head of the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service. ""We have a constitutional obligation to disclose anything that affects the case[s] to defence counsel,"" Lepp said in sworn court testimony in 2013. ""And we also have an obligation as prosecution service to consider this situation and determine what steps, if any, we're going to take in relation to these cases."" Reached at his office in Edmonton's provincial court, Lepp said he could not discuss whether disclosure had been provided. ""You're just going to have to pursue those enquiries elsewhere since it's just not advisable, it's not a good course of action for a judge to comment on what happened prior to his appointment,"" Lepp said. He added, ""the [justice] department's responsible for the decisions that were taken years ago."" Marta Burns, the former senior counsel for Alberta Justice and now a judge, declined to respond to questions in a statement sent by her spokesperson. ""In her capacity as litigation counsel with the legal services division, Justice Burns was not charged with making disclosure to defence counsel,"" the statement said. ""Decisions in this regard are made by the Crown Prosecution Service."" Tolppanen, the current head of Alberta's Crown Prosecution Service, did not respond to questions about why the second review panel was never convened — after his ministry said justice required it happen. Doug Schweitzer, the current Alberta justice minister, also declined a recent request for an interview with The Fifth Estate. ""This matter predates the minister's time in office,"" his spokesperson said in an email. While the charge goes back almost a decade, Herchak said she is still living with the consequences of a miscarriage of justice. ""Why would you just shuffle the paperwork deep down and, like, destroy someone's life?"" Herchak said. ""That's my life, right there, that could have changed. But instead, I have this to deal with.""

Lonewater Farm, a remote rehabilitation centre about four kilometres north of Grand Bay-Westfield, will relocate its early addiction recovery program to Ridgewood Addiction Services in west Saint John.  ""The property, is quite large and we see this [move] as a very positive augmentation of services for our clients,"" said Susan Neal, the area manager for Horizon's addiction and mental health services for the Saint John region.  Although the building is in need of upgrades, Neal said Horizon also decided to move the Lonewater program to Ridgewood because clients there have easier access to addiction-based services. Those services include a detox unit, a 28-day rehabilitation program and a team of outpatient counsellors. Lonewater's remote location also played a factor in the move, as well access to the current services on site. The facility at Ridgewood will feature private bathrooms for patients. It's also closer to a bus route, which helps  clients nearing discharge and looking for affordable housing. Lonewater Farms opened in the 1960s. It's a place where men struggling with alcoholism would go to address their addiction while working on a farm. Over time, however, the focus of the addiction centre shifted. It now offers early recovery services, which involves setting up a personalized recovery plan with each client. Resident's participate in group activities and daily communal tasks, like cleaning.  People typically stay at Lonewater between one and three months. Horizon is investing more than $300,000 to renovate one of its existing buildings at Ridgewood into a 14-bed residential early recovery centre, where the former Lonewater clients will be housed.  Although the switch means losing 10 beds for people struggling with addiction, Neal said the Lonewater facility struggles to keep a 100 per cent capacity as is. The average occupancy rate for Lonewater Farm has been around 78 per cent for the past year. That's because not all clients require the level of service Lonewater offers. ""Early recovery is for our most vulnerable male clients specifically,"" she said. ""Not every client that is dealing with a substance use disorder requires this level of service."" Those employed at Lonewater Farm will continue to be employed at Horizon's Ridgewood centre.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/lonewater-farm-closing-2020-horizon-1.5435915,[],N/A
200,Anonymous,2020-01-24T05:04:46.361Z,Actress Annabella Sciorra testifies that Harvey Weinstein raped her,"Actress Annabella Sciorra confronted Harvey Weinstein from the witness stand Thursday, telling a jury in a quivering voice that the burly Hollywood studio boss barged into her apartment in the mid-1990s, overpowered her and raped her as she tried to fight him off by kicking and punching him. She said that a month later, she ran into him and confronted him about what happened, and he replied: ""That's what all the nice Catholic girls say."" Then, she told the jury, Weinstein leaned toward her and added menacingly: ""This remains between you and I."" ""I thought he was going to hit me right there,"" Sciorra testified. At other points in the 1990s, she said, Weinstein sent her packages with Valium and a box of chocolate penises and turned up early one morning at her Cannes Film Festival hotel room door ""in his underwear with a bottle of baby oil in one hand and a videotape in the other."" She said he eventually left after she started frantically pushing buttons on the room phone to summon help. The 59-year-old actress became the first of Weinstein's accusers to testify at his trial, where the movie mogul whose downfall gave rise to the #MeToo movement is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his New York apartment in 2006 and raping an aspiring actress in a hotel room in 2013. Weinstein is not charged with attacking Sciorra, whose accusations date too far back to be prosecuted. Instead, she testified as one of four additional accusers prosecutors intend to put on the stand to show that the powerful Hollywood producer had a pattern of preying on women. Weinstein, 67, could get life in prison if convicted. Weinstein, the executive behind such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. Recounting an accusation she said she kept largely secret for decades, Sciorra testified that after raping her, Weinstein went on to try to perform oral sex on her, saying, ""This is for you,"" as her body ""shut down."" ""It was just so disgusting,"" she said. She said she started to shake: ""I didn't even know what was happening. It was like a seizure or something."" WATCH | Actress tells Weinstein trial that he raped her in the early 90s: The defence tried to seed doubts about Sciorra's allegations, and she gave a slightly different version under their questioning, testifying that when the producer initially pushed her onto her bed, ""he was kind of, in a friendly way, trying to cajole me"" into having sex. She refused and soon found herself trying to get him off of her, she said. Weinstein lawyer Donna Rotunno noted that Sciorra never went to police or a doctor about the alleged rape. ""At the time, I didn't understand that that was rape,"" Sciorra said. Rotunno also suggested that Sciorra's judgment and recollection were clouded by drinking. The actress said she remembered having only a glass of wine with dinner and had kicked a Valium habit that developed after Weinstein sent her pills. In opening statements on Wednesday, another Weinstein lawyer, Damon Cheronis, argued the encounter was consensual, not rape, saying Sciorra once told a friend that she ""did a crazy thing and had sex with Harvey Weinstein."" The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. Sciorra drew acclaim for her part in Spike Lee's 1991 movie Jungle Fever and her role as a pregnant woman molested by her doctor in 1992's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle the next year. She later appeared on The Sopranos. Sciorra first made her allegations in a New Yorker article in 2017. She said she met Weinstein at an industry event in Los Angeles in 1990 or 1991.

201,Sara Minogue,2020-01-21T20:23:24.880Z,Giant Mine's remediation team still has a to-do list,"The Giant Mine remediation team opened public hearings in Yellowknife on Monday with some big promises.  ""The project will provide value to residents, and return a site that is greatly improved,"" said project director Chris MacInnis.  MacInnis also laid out the stakes of any delays to the cleanup: anywhere from $15 to $20 million in extra costs to the taxpayer for every year the cleanup is delayed.  The team is presenting its final closure and remediation plan to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board this week in the hope of obtaining a 20-year water licence and a five-year land use permit. It's the last major hurdle before the $1-billion cleanup finally begins.  But MacInnis made it clear that the final closure plan may not be completely final.  ""It is only with the confidence of an approved final closure and reclamation plan that the project can complete the final detailed design,"" MacInnis said. ""We have proposed a phased approach to submissions that will present these detailed designs to the board for approval to allow active remediation work at the Giant Mine site to start in 2021."" In other remarks, Natalie Plato, the remediation team's deputy director, explained that the team had yet to file a quantitative risk assessment, ordered by the Mackenzie Valley Environmental Impact Review Board. She promised that would be done by February, before the water licence is issued.  She also said a planned stress study, part of the team's health effects monitoring, had yet to take place. The study is expected to look at how stress related to the possibility of arsenic exposure may affect human health. Plato said they don't believe this should be a condition of the water licence, as it will not affect project design, but rather, how the project engages with the public. The board will hold four more days of hearings — on top of months of presentations — to determine whether that phased approach can satisfy all parties who want to see the work done right. More than 100 people attended Monday's session. At least one interested person is confident the project is going in the right direction. Ed Sangris, Dettah chief for the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, opened his remarks by saying that Giant Mine ""significantly and fundamentally changed the people of the Yellowknives Dene.""  And while Sangris said it was a little strange to be holding hearings after so much important work at the site had already happened, such as the dismantling of the roasting complex and the removal of the headframe (both deemed safety priorities), he's optimistic about the process.  ""Giant Mine has never benefited the Yellowknives Dene. We were not consulted and we did not receive any compensation from Giant,"" he said.  ""With this process, we have the opportunity … to return to what was taken from us, the opportunity to reconcile with the past, the opportunity to change."" The hearings continue on Tuesday. Members of the public who want to ask questions or make comments can attend one of two evening sessions, Tuesday and Wednesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-remediation-to-do-list-1.5434166,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-cleanup-compensation-claims-1.5367353,N/A
202,Anonymous,2020-01-23T16:58:18.717Z,"World leaders commemorate Auschwitz anniversary, Netanyahu slams Iran","Dozens of world leaders gathered in Jerusalem on Thursday to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, amid a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the United States. Israel has hailed the World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem memorial centre as the biggest international gathering in its history. More than one million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp during the Second World War. Overall, some six million Jews died in the Holocaust. The high-profile guest list for Thursday's commemoration includes Britain's Prince Charles, French President Emmanuel Macron, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence. Canada sent a delegation led by Gov. Gen. Julie Payette. Speeches at Yad Vashem focused on the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust as well as on the recent rise in anti-Semitism rhetoric and attacks worldwide, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu singling out Iran. ""At the core of Israel's establishment is the command — there will not be another Holocaust. As prime minister of Israel, that is my greatest commitment,"" Netanyahu said in his address. Netanyahu then lashed out at Iran, whose nuclear ambitions he says are aimed at building atomic weapons with the aim of destroying Israel. Tehran denies it is seeking nuclear arms. ""I am concerned that we have yet to see a unified and resolute stance against the most anti-Semitic regime on the planet — a regime that openly seeks to develop nuclear weapons and annihilate the one and only Jewish state,"" Netanyahu said, praising the U.S. administration for confronting Iran. Warning of the ""dark shadow of anti-Semitism,"" Macron met French survivors of the Holocaust at a memorial near Jerusalem to some 76,000 Jews arrested in France during the Second World War and transported to death camps such as Auschwitz, where most died. Prince Charles paid homage to his grandmother, Princess Alice of Battenberg and Greece, the mother-in-law of Queen Elizabeth. The Prince of Wales said the Royal Family took great pride in Israel's recognition of Alice's heroism in the Holocaust. ""I have long drawn inspiration from the selfless actions of my dear grandmother, Princess Alice of Greece, who in 1943 in Nazi-occupied Athens, saved a Jewish family by taking them into her home and hiding them,"" the prince said. ""My grandmother, who is buried on the Mount of Olives, has a tree planted in her name here at Yad Vashem and is counted as one of the Righteous Among the Nations … a fact which gives me and my family immense pride."" A devout Christian, Alice died in London in 1969 and had asked to be buried in Jerusalem, next to her aunt, who like Alice had become a nun and founded a convent. Steinmeier, meanwhile, was the first ever German president to deliver a speech at Yad Vashem.   ""I bow in deepest sorrow,"" Steinmeier said. ""The mass murder of six million Jews, the worst crime in the history of humanity, it was committed by my countrymen."" With anti-Semitic attacks increasing in frequency in Germany and across Europe, Steinmeier, 64, voiced regret that his country was still dealing with the bigotry and hatred that led to the Holocaust. ""I wish I could say that we Germans have learnt from history once and for all. But I cannot say that when hatred is spreading,"" Steinmeier said. A global survey by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League in November found that global anti-Semitic attitudes had increased, and significantly so in Eastern and Central Europe. It found that large percentages of people in many European countries think Jews talk too much about the Holocaust. ""We must be prepared to confront and expose the vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fuelling hate and violence all across the world and we must stand together,"" Pence told the audience of world leaders. The president of Poland, where the death camp was built by the Nazi German occupiers during the war, is not attending the ceremony due to rankling disputes with both Russia and Israel. Polish President Andrzej Duda turned down an invitation to the conference, expressing dissatisfaction that representatives of Russia, France, Britain, the United States and Germany would speak, while Poland was told it would not be allowed to. Polish leaders have also been angered by comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin last month suggesting Poland shared responsibility for the war. Poland, which was invaded first by Nazi Germany and then by Soviet forces in September 1939, sees itself as a major victim of the war, in which it lost a fifth of its population. Later on Thursday, Putin criticized those who try to rewrite history, though he made no reference to Poland, while unveiling a monument to the residents and defenders of Nazi-besieged Leningrad, Russia's second city, now renamed St. Petersburg. ""Here, as in Russia, people are concerned, alarmed and outraged by attempts to deny the Holocaust and to revise the results of World War Two, to whitewash murderers and criminals,"" Putin said. Poland will host its own ceremony at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum on Jan. 27, as it does every year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-auschwitz-memorial-1.5437321,https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/holocaust-hologram-survivors-testimonies-new-technology-1.5353028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rainer-hoess-auschwitz-holocaust-1.5348444 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/poland-auschwitz-merkel-germany-1.5386676 http://www.cbc.ca/1.5268354,N/A
203,Elizabeth Chiu,2020-01-24T10:00:00.099Z,'Good for your soul': Basketball coach uses comedy to help families heal,"When Colter Simmonds, 41, walks into Dartmouth High, it's not long before teens come up with smiles of surprise and warm hugs. It's the same reception at other schools around Halifax. For the last 20 years, the North Preston, N.S., native — nicknamed C.C., short for Coach Colter — has been earning respect and receiving affection as a mentor to hundreds of children in both sports and school. His coaching in basketball and life is aimed at keeping them off the streets where beefs are sometimes settled with guns, leaving lives violently cut short, and others locked up. What those teens might not realize is those realities were ""close calls"" Simmonds himself escaped. ""For me to be here, I think I'm an example that you can change and do better,"" he said during an interview last week at the North Preston Community Centre. In recent days he's been visiting with school principals, church pastors and bereaved parents — his special guests at Laugh Out Violence, the fundraiser he's organized Feb. 22 at Casino Nova Scotia, during African Heritage Month. Simmonds's goal is a sold-out evening to raise funds for We Will Win Youth Association, the non-profit organization he started in 1999 to help children pursue their dreams on the court, in the classroom or in the community. Comedy, he said, is ""healing, it takes your mind off things, it's good for your soul."" Leaders in the black community carry an added emotional burden, he said. They may know both sides in a dispute that's turned deadly — a situation he's found himself in after mentoring so many kids.  Karen Hudson, principal at Auburn Drive High School, said that's almost inevitable in a small province with many large, extended African-Nova Scotian families. ""You've got to show compassion and show them that you care. And as a black female, you never take off that skin, so you have to let them know that some of the individuals that are within the community, they may affect you too,"" she said. The night of comedy is no joke for Simmonds. He's spent nearly $8,000 of his own money to book the room and the headliners — Mark Walker, from Truro, N.S., and Cedric Newman and Chris Quigley, both from the Toronto area.  The event has no corporate sponsors, although the casino is offering the showroom at a reduced rate. We Will Win Youth Association has taken kids to tournaments around North America, and helped develop NCAA wing Daneesha Provo and NBA G-League guard Lindell Wigginton. Simmonds spent his teens in Toronto where he was an all-star point guard with enough talent to make it to the NCAA or Canadian university basketball, he said. But some ""influences"" tried to pull him in the other direction, and ultimately his attitude blocked him from reaching college ball. Even when he didn't believe in himself, his supporters never gave up on him, telling him, ""You can do better."" That message eventually sunk in, and stayed with him as he became a father at 21, a baptized Christian, a college graduate and now a youth programming co-ordinator. His belief that ""the more you do for others, the more God is going to bless you"" guides him as he pays it forward with the fundraiser.  Simmonds estimates he's known 40 people who've died violently or gone to prison because of it. It drives him to keep connecting with young people, especially those at risk, to show them that turning away from violence creates another path. ""You do what you're exposed to,"" he said. ""If you're exposed to negativity, then that's what you're going to get. If you're exposed to positivity, then there's the likelihood of living a positive life."" He hopes bereaved parents of children he's mentored will attend the evening of entertainment to know ""their child hasn't been forgotten."" The first Laugh Out Violence fundraiser was held in 2017, after Halifax marked 12 homicides in 2016, including three shooting deaths in seven days. Tyler Richards, 29, was among the young men killed. It was a terrible blow to Simmonds. Richards first reached out to Simmonds in 2003 to play for a team he was coaching in Toronto. Their paths crossed again the following year when Richards was trying out for Canada's basketball team, and also in 2013 when Richards made the NBL's Halifax Rainmen, briefly coached by Simmonds. ""Gone too soon, and to know he was somebody that was really wanting to do better in life,"" Simmonds said. R&B, gospel and hip hop musicians, along with a dancer — all who have been mentored by Simmonds — will take the stage at the fundraiser. He said this opportunity fulfils a promise to them. Spoken-word artist Michael Earle, known as MAJE, will perform his song Smile, which features positive lyrics and a music video that shows black fathers and their daughters. Earle didn't know Simmonds's back story until he shared it last week, but ""I always knew he had a big heart."" ""Like C.C. said, his kid is the reason he changed, so being in your kid's life can do miracles for you as a human."" Simmonds's son, Tyrell, was born when he was barely out of his teens.  ""I want him to have me there with him all the way through his life until he's old enough to have his own kids and understand that when I go, it's because it's time, I'm old.""

204,Kory Teneycke,2020-01-23T21:57:35.880Z,It's Stephen Harper's party — and he'll do what he wants to,"This column is an opinion by Kory Teneycke, a former director of communications for prime minister Stephen Harper, manager of the recent Ontario PC Party campaign, and currently a partner at Rubicon Strategy. Teneycke has declared he will remain neutral in the federal Conservative leadership campaign and has recused himself from work Rubicon is providing for the MacKay campaign. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Even five years after his defeat, the presence of Stephen Harper still defines the Conservative Party of Canada. In any other party it would be a bit odd for a past leader to be so dominant in the race to replace his successor's successor. But not in this one. Only 17 years ago, it was a much younger, more ideologically strident Stephen Harper who forged a new party from the shattered pieces of the PC Party (which had become an Atlantic Canadian regional rump) and the Canadian Alliance (Preston Manning's failed effort to rebrand the Reform Party). As a Reform Party staffer and later as a Member of Parliament, Harper had always been a hardliner. Critical of Manning for his lack of conservatism and dismissive of those advocating the need for the two right-of-centre parties to merge. In running for the Canadian Alliance leadership, he was full of bravado about the ability of the CA to best the PC Party electorally. But in what would become a telling sign of his future approach to governing (best described as pragmatic, conservative incrementalism), in 2003 Harper adjusted course and engineered the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada. On matters of party discipline, Harper would sometimes in half-jest quote Louis XIV: ""l'etat c'est moi"" (I am the state). Harper wasn't just the first leader for the first half of its existence, he was the Party. And everybody knew it. Even in departure he continued to maintain a low-profile but powerful role as a director of the Conservative Fund – the body that holds the purse strings for party operations and campaigns. His recent departure from the Fund generated headlines and speculation. Some ""unnamed sources"" have alleged this was to free him to attack potential leadership candidate Jean Charest. It is unlikely that was ever true, but given Charest's decision to not enter the race, it clearly is no longer a motivation. Even if Charest had entered the leadership he would have had to kiss the ring of Harper's legacy, and adopt positions similar to those of Harper on a range of issues — including conservative cultural issues such as gun control. Harper doesn't need to campaign for or against anyone in the party leadership race. Every candidate will be attempting to claim some degree of ownership or continuance of the Harper record, and quietly intimating that they have his private approval. There is no path to victory running against Harper's legacy. The decision to leave the fund is more likely, as National Post columnist John Ivison suggested, an effort to sidestep Andrew Scheer's expense account scandal – of which private school funding is rumoured to be only the tip of the iceberg. Harper has a near anaphylactic intolerance for expense account abuse. While he did get criticism for charging his personal stylist to the Party, Harper's legacy governing is one of transparency. His reforms brought in pro-active disclosure of expenses for cabinet ministers and their staff. And back in Reform Party days he was the alleged source for blowing the whistle on then Reform Party Leader Preston Manning's use of party funds to fix his teeth and purchase bespoke suits. Regardless the reasons for his departure from the Fund, it makes no difference. It is still Harper's party. It is the electoral coalition that he built that is the foundation of the party – not just nationally, but in provinces like Ontario as well. Fundraising letters sent on behalf of the party bring in the most money when sent under his name. Most telling, numerous polls demonstrate Harper continues to be the most popular potential leader for the Conservative Party – by far. He would easily achieve a first-ballot victory if he chose to enter the race (which I predict he won't). Of course, the Conservative Party will need to evolve. It was a mistake for the Scheer campaign to run on a mildly updated version of the Harper 2015 platform. But at its core, the conservative electoral coalition is quite strong. And that is thanks to Stephen Harper.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-teneycke-stephen-harper-conservative-leadership-1.5435815,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-resigns-conservative-fund-1.5428237 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-1.5424860,N/A

206,Alana India Anderson,2020-01-13T21:39:43.390Z,Why a move to Canada makes sense for Prince Harry and Meghan,"This column is an opinion by Alana India Anderson, a British-Canadian entertainment journalist and editor currently living in London, U.K. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. In recent days, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been branded an ""ego-crazed"" leech, ""incredibly irritating,"" and ""insufferable"" by esteemed members of the British press. And yet they're shocked that she's made the decision, along with her husband Prince Harry, to leave the U.K. for North America.  On Monday, the Queen released a statement saying the Royal Family ""respect"" and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family, while remaining a valued part of the institution. ""It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the U.K.,"" it read.  Since the couple made their decision to ""step back"" from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family last Wednesday, the U.K. media has been thrown into a frenzy. How could they do this to the Queen? What does this new ""progressive role"" mean? Who will be paying for their security costs overseas?  But most importantly, why move to Canada? Having immigrated to Canada from London 20 years ago for a better quality of life, I know the appeal all too well. In fact, although I'm currently working in the media in the U.K., I still regularly visit the country that welcomed me and my family with open arms, so I'm well aware of the social and cultural differences. There's no doubt that Harry and Meghan would enjoy a relatively peaceful life if they relocate to Canada. Toronto is where Harry and Meghan started their relationship four years ago, and where she lived for several years while filming the TV series Suits. Besides familiarity, Canada offers a fresh sense of stress-free simplicity they are not afforded in the U.K. Not only is celebrity culture almost non-existent in Canada, but fascination with the Royal Family tends to take a far more friendly tone. In contrast, there's no escaping the paparazzi in places like London. While the U.K.'s reality TV stars relish the flashing bulbs of photographers, several celebrities will recall ""terrifying"" experiences of erratic driving and little to no privacy as photographers go to extreme lengths to get ""the shot."" This is because there is no governing body for paparazzi — it's a grey area. The paparazzi and tabloid culture prevalent in the U.K. is clearly something Harry is wary of. Last year, the Prince said that every camera flash ""takes him back"" to the tragedy of his mother's death in 1997, grief which he compared to a ""wound that festers."" And the media attention in Europe can be unrelenting. Kate Middleton and Prince William won £91,000 in damages in a French court verdict in 2017, for example, after topless paparazzi photographs of the Duchess were published in a French celebrity magazine. The couple said the incident was a ""serious breach of privacy."" It's telling that only one photograph emerged during Harry and Meghan's recent six-week Christmas holiday on Vancouver Island — an image they released on their own terms, showing Harry with their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in front of a dazzling backdrop of water and mountains. Is it so wrong for Harry, who has not only grown up under the weight of media attention but also faced such tragedy in his life, to want some peace? After all, the couple who have put such a spotlight on mental health surely deserve to look after their own. Escaping the relentless pressure of media attention by itself isn't the only incentive for the family to leave the U.K.  Since their first meeting, Meghan's race has been the talking point of headlines adorning British tabloids. Toned-down prejudice has seen the Duchess described as having ""rich and exotic DNA"" and being ""almost straight out of Compton."" The fact that she makes mixed-race women, such as myself, feel more in-touch with their identity is merely overlooked. Despite 1.2 million people identifying as mixed-race in Britain, Meghan is often reduced to being an outsider. Meghan has openly expressed her struggle to adapt to British tabloid scrutiny, saying she ""tried to adopt"" the ""British sensibility of a stiff upper lip."" It's a struggle that now appears over, resulting in the U.K. losing a progressive and refreshing couple who are not only responsible for bringing in millions of dollars in tourism, retail and fashion, but also newspaper sales and website clicks. They wouldn't be the first members of the Royal Family to see the attraction of Canada. Speaking in Toronto in 2010, the Queen praised the ""vast, rich and varied"" country for ""inspiring its own and attracting many others."" And Queen Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, resided in Canada from 1911 to 1916 and acted as hostess for her father, Prince Arthur, during his term as governor general. The Princess's portrait was even on the $1 banknote issued in 1917.  Of course, there's no guarantee the paparazzi wouldn't follow them, the way they did when Charles, Diana, William and Harry visited in 1991. But a move to Canada would likely mean at least a reduction in the media scrutiny of Harry, Meghan and Archie. And that spotlight is something Harry has tried to escape his entire life, a significant curiosity about his private life which he has admitted he has ""never been comfortable with."" And it could also see the Royal Family spread its wings and become an international brand in a country where, unlike the U.S., Harry and Meghan are less regarded as ""celebrities,"" but are undeniably extremely popular. Viewed from that perspective, Harry and Meghan relocating to Canada could be a win for their family — and the Royal Family.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-prince-harry-meghan-markle-move-canada-royals-1.5425006,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-harry-meghan-canada-1.5423395 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royal-fascinator-harry-meghan-1.5422609 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harry-meghan-doc-media-1.5328618 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/prince-harry-paparazzi-settlement-1.5138130 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5420966/royal-reporter-says-pressure-on-meghan-markle-is-typical-she-s-just-complained-more-1.5420972 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/royals-sue-mail-on-sunday-1.5305025,N/A

The companies need insurance from ICBC, and they need local business licences from individual municipalities.  ""As quickly as they can go through those steps, they'll be operating,"" Trevena said. Uber expects its drivers to be on the road in Vancouver ""in the next few days."" The company said in a statement Thursday it already has a business licence from the City of Vancouver as well as insurance from ICBC. Michael van Hemmen, Uber's head of Western Canada, said the company is waiting on final authorization. An email from Lyft said the company is working quickly on getting licences. For ride-sharing companies, gaining approval to operate in the Lower Mainland means approval to do business in the province's most populated region. The Lower Mainland includes Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, and has around three million residents. The province has said local governments can enact rules and unique fees around drop-off and parking in granting local licences. Communities cannot deny licences to companies. In Vancouver, a business licence costs $155 for ride-hailing, taxi and limousine companies. To address congestion, ride-hailing vehicles operating in the city's core between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. will be required to pay 30 cents for each pick up and drop off. This fee will be reduced by 50 per cent for zero emission vehicles. Wheelchair accessible vehicles are exempt. A regional ride-hailing licence is currently being created for Metro Vancouver in conjunction with TransLink. There are 21 municipalities in Metro Vancouver, but the region-wide agreement would mean companies would only have to deal with one business licence. The TransLink Mayors' Council said it hopes to have an interim set of rules for the licence in place by the end of January, with a full framework by the end of the year. The B.C. Federation of Labour noted Thursday companies will need to abide by B.C.'s employment standards and labour laws to ensure drivers are protected. Other jurisdictions around the world, including California, have struggled with unregulated ride-hailing companies taking advantage of employees in a gig economy. As part of the approval deal, Trevena said, the PTB will be ""very closely"" monitoring drivers' incomes at Uber and Lyft to ensure staff are paid fairly. Much of the taxi sector has pushed back against ride-hailing for years. In giving Uber and Lyft the green light, the board rejected a demand from the taxi industry to cap the number of ride-hailing vehicles allowed on the road. The taxi group also wanted the board to prohibit companies from using variable pricing. It declined. ""The board has determined that, at this point in time, it is not prepared to impose limits on fleet size because of the experiences of other jurisdictions with Uber's operations,"" the PTB decision read. Twenty-nine ride-hailing companies have applied to the B.C. board for approval since September. Only a handful of applications have been decided. Bids from Kater and ReRyde were rejected, the board said Thursday. Green Coast Ventures Inc., recently received the go-ahead to operate in Tofino, Ucluelet, Whistler, Pemberton and Squamish during its first year.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uber-lyft-approved-bc-1.5437997,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-approval-b-c-1.5398376 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ride-hailing-brad-west-mayors-council-1.5393202 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/class-4-ubcm-2019-worries-1.5296657 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-labour-board-agrees-to-hear-local-union-s-challenge-of-uber-and-lyft-1.5399916,N/A
209,Adam Miller,2020-01-18T09:00:00.516Z,Why flu season could make it harder for doctors to diagnose vaping-related illness,"A 20-year-old man shows up in a U.S. emergency room with flu-like symptoms.  He's hospitalized for four days before leaving, against medical advice, only to return to the ER with chest pain, fever and shortness of breath.  By this point he's lost almost 20 pounds. Doctors are stumped. They test him for strep throat, hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases, all of which turn up negative.  It's only when a camera is inserted into his airway and a CT scan is done to examine his lungs that it's confirmed he has vaping-related illness. The case, published in the Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians this week, highlights the challenges in diagnosing vaping-related illness — especially during flu season. Canada is currently facing an early start to flu season, with both influenza A and B strains circulating at the same time.  So far, there have been nearly 12,500 confirmed cases of flu across the country and 10 deaths.  Dr. Tereza Martinu, a lung transplant respirologist with Toronto General Hospital who treated an Ontario teen with vaping-related illness last year, said diagnosing it can be difficult for doctors at this time of year. ""It always looks like something else,"" she said, adding that pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and the flu have similar symptoms. ""I think doctors don't think about it, and therefore often don't diagnose it.""  Martinu said it's important for doctors to be aware of vaping-related illness, particularly during flu season, and to ask patients about their exposure to vaping in order to rule it out. ""I think it's important to increase our awareness of it,"" she said. ""You need to then at least think about it and ask the right questions such as: Does the patient have exposure to vaping?""  Dr. Atul Kapur, an Ottawa-based emergency room doctor and co-chair of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians' public affairs committee, says it adds another layer of difficulty for diagnosis.  ""Having this as another potential cause of lung problems makes things busier and more difficult in the emergency department,"" he said. ""From our point of view, that's a big problem.""  There have been 2,668 reported cases of vaping-related illness in the U.S. and 60 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Canada has had just 16 cases and no deaths in the same time period, a disproportionately low number even with our smaller population. Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s chief medical officer and chair of the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health, said she's surprised by the lower number of cases in Canada.  She says it may have something to do with the differences in the availability of legal and illegal products, or how it's diagnosed.  The CDC reports that 82 per cent of cases in the U.S. reported using any cannabis vapes, while 57 per cent said they used any nicotine e-cigarettes. Of those, 33 per cent reported exclusively using cannabis vapes, while 14 per cent said they had only vaped nicotine.  In Canada, nine of the 16 cases reported vaping nicotine exclusively. Three said they had vaped cannabis and nicotine, and another three reported vaping cannabis only.  An additive called vitamin E acetate has been identified as a ""chemical of concern"" by the CDC in the outbreak of the illness, but has not officially been confirmed as the culprit.   ""I think it's way too early to identify a clear pattern,"" says Dr. Martin Kolb, director of the respirology division at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont. ""I think what that clearly shows us is that these products are not harmless in a way that it was shown and continues to be described by the industry."" ""It absolutely is under-reported,"" said Henry. ""We are going to absolutely miss some and it's a challenge — it's a diagnostic challenge for clinicians that we face all the time."" She said the difficulty is that the diagnosis relies on a doctor asking questions specifically about vaping and patients being upfront about their use.  Kapur, with the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, says it can also take time for a team of experts to identify the illness. ""There is going to be a bit of a delay before people are making the link and ruling out other causes,"" he said. ""The problem with this, of course, is that they get worse fairly quickly.""  Kapur said patients will often quit vaping when symptoms persist, adding another challenge, which is what happened in the U.S. case study.  ""Because the symptoms are of breathing, a lot of patients are probably stopping on their own,"" Kapur said. ""And so there may be some milder cases that aren't connected at all. So that would account for some under-reporting in both countries."" That decision to quit vaping during treatment could also lead to a misdiagnosis, Martinu said.  ""If the patient stops using it and improves, then we may have diagnosed some of those problems as something that is much more common,"" she said.  Henry said there may be people with milder, undiagnosed cases in the community that are unknown to health officials who could be at risk of severe influenza or other viral illnesses circulating this time of year.  ""I have no doubt that there are some people hospitalized and it is likely either exacerbated or related to their vaping that we don't know about,"" said Henry.  ""That's why it's so important to get these messages out, particularly for young people about the issues that can come up with vaping and why it's not a good thing to do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illness-flu-season-canada-us-1.5431774,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/flu-pneumonia-1.5428093 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-illnesses-1.5386125 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-vitamin-e-1.5404858 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaping-liquid-tests-1.5381363 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/vaping-lung-transplant-1.5359105,N/A
210,Vanessa Blanch,2020-01-24T16:03:07.254Z,'We're constantly asked for pictures': Teen researches why sending naked pics is now normal,"Kiona Osowski's Grade 12 research project started with a question, based on her own experiences as a 17-year-old teenager: why are girls so often asked for nude photos? ""I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it, but it's happening,"" she said. ""We're constantly asked for pictures or we're sent things without our consent."" Since September, Kiona has been looking more closely at why boys feel entitled to ask for nude photos, and why girls feel compelled to send them. ""This has become a societal norm and we need to start taking it apart."" Kids sharing nude photos 'before they even hold hands' worries counsellors, police In her research, she has discovered a perfect storm of media messages that she believes are ""toxic"" to teens who are growing up with phones in their hands 24/7. Kiona worked on her project under the supervision of psychology teacher Heather Gunn and sociology teacher Chris Evans. ""We're sort of naive as older people thinking, 'Oh, they've got this device and they're playing Minecraft,'"" Gunn said. ""It was an eye-opener for us. I don't understand their world and how, in many ways, they've been impacted from this new reality.""  As part of her project, Kiona has rewritten New Brunswick's Grade 9 and 10 personal development curriculum and has begun presenting her research to her peers at Moncton High. She said much of the material that's already being covered, such as internet safety and career planning is good, but it needs to be updated.  ""Nude photos, media exploitation of women, toxic male gender representation and violence-inducing media, porn and so many other issues are simply not talked about,"" she writes in her letter to officials at the Anglophone East School District. ""Many of the adults in our lives are unaware of the issues going on with our youth."" 'Why can't I look like that?' Kiona's research started with the way she and most of her friends feel about their bodies and how they look. ""You can sit next to your best friend and you know that she's thinking the same thing — that she doesn't like herself,"" she said. ""We're going through our Instagram and we see this skinny, tanned, blonde — this girl who only eats kale and goes to the gym every day and we think, 'Well why can't I look like that?' and 'Why can't I have that body?'"" In her new curriculum, students would learn about the editing of photographs that happens in some media, and how girls are often left striving for an ideal that doesn't exist. It also addresses the growing number of people with eating disorders. ""I could walk up to my friend and tell her, 'I haven't eaten all day,' and she'd be like, 'Oh my God, me neither.' And that shouldn't be a conversation. The conversation is, 'I haven't eaten all day,' and then someone should say, 'You need to eat something. That's not healthy for your body.'"" Kiona plays on her school soccer team and is part of a boxing club — two activities that make her feel ""strong"" and ""empowered."" She wishes someone had told her in middle school that feeling bad about her body was not normal. ""I just kind of went on with my life and I was like, 'Well, I can hate my body because everyone else does too,' so that's why I want to make it so it's not normal."" Kiona also looked closely at research around young men and the media. ""Guys watch a lot of movies, video games and porn … I've never seen a movie where guys walk up to each other and just hug,"" she said. In media, men rarely express emotion, which Kiona said has left boys with the belief that anger is the only acceptable emotion. ""In the media, men are seen as dominant, they're seen as sexually aggressive, aggressive in general and lacking in emotions."" In her presentation, she challenges the boys in her class to allow one another to express themselves. ""Like if your friend is having a hard day — support him, don't make fun of him. Create a community where it's OK to show emotion and challenge the media stereotype that it's not."" When she brings up porn in her presentation, Kiona said it always raises some eyebrows among her peers, but she believes the way women and men are portrayed needs to be talked about. ""There's this ideal that men have that they deserve certain things … a rich man with a nice house and a beautiful woman and when men don't get that in reality, they can become really frustrated because they don't know how to experience emotion."" Gunn points to her own course material, which includes research that suggests 80 per cent of young men in Canada between the ages of 12 and 18 watch porn daily. ""I've known that, but I didn't really think deeply about the many ways that impacts boys and girls,"" Gunn said. ""The damaging things that are happening that society is instilling in our young kids — we've got to talk about it,"" Evans added. Kiona hopes to present her new curriculum to members of Moncton High's parent school support committee later this month and also hopes to get an audience with officials at the Anglophone East School District. It's the first step as she tries to change the curriculum for the entire province. ""We need to keep evolving our education. We can't just stall out and say, 'Well we're just going to go with the flow — it doesn't work that way.'"" In the new semester that begins in February, Kiona plans to work with other students and make presentations to middle school classes. ""[Students] don't always want to hear from moms and dads and grown-ups. I think that they look to peers that they respect and they see themselves in and they're respect Kiona and those who will be working with her,"" said Gunn. The goal is to get students thinking more critically about the media messages that leave young women feeling insecure, and young men emotionally handicapped. Kiona believes her generation is smart enough to change the script, including those constant requests for nude pictures, that's playing out in middle schools and high schools. ""Once we start challenging the views that we're being brainwashed with and that the media keeps feeding us, then we can fix the relationships with ourselves and we can fix the relationship with each other as well.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/kiona-osowski-moncton-high-school-curriculum-gender-media-social-1.5430704,[],N/A
211,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:13:37.140Z,"Affordable legal cannabis should be priority as illegal pot prices drop, experts say","The gap between what Canadians pay for legal and illicit cannabis is widening — a sign experts say points to the need for the marijuana industry to make prices a priority this year. Statistics Canada said Thursday that the average price of legal cannabis increased to $10.30 per gram in the period between October and December 2019 from $9.69 per gram the year before. The change came as the average price of illegal cannabis fell to $5.73 per gram in that fourth quarter from $6.44 per gram a year earlier and as the overall average price of cannabis rose to $7.50 per gram, an increase from $7.46 per gram a year earlier. The agency based its conclusions on price quotes gathered using its StatsCannabis crowdsourcing application between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31. Out of 291 price submissions, 248 of were deemed plausible, it said. The data comes as the industry is grappling with how to minimize the underground cannabis market — one of the key reasons why the country chose to legalize recreational cannabis in October 2018. Some dispensaries reported being busier than before in the months following legalization, even as police departments and governments conducted raids to force many illegal cannabis stores to shut their doors. The industry's efforts to stamp out the illicit market, however, have been plagued with supply constraints and in some regions, a lack of physical cannabis retailers, hampering access for those unwilling or unlikely to buy the substance online. ""Legal cannabis has been priced much higher than the black market ever since legalization day,"" said Michael Armstrong, an associate professor at the Goodman School of Business at Brock University in Ontario. ""I think for any of the mass market producers, [price] has to be their objective for this year, if it hasn't been already."" In a bid to undercut the illicit market, licensed producer Hexo Corp. rolled out Original Stash, a 28-gram product in Quebec cannabis stores for $125.70 with taxes included, or $4.49 per gram, in October. At the time, Hexo chief executive Sebastien St-Louis said his company was able to offer it at that price for various reasons, such as less plastic packaging required for the larger size, its increased production scale and lower electricity costs in Quebec. When Armstrong recently checked out the Ontario Cannabis Store website, he spotted a few products costing $5 or $6 a gram, but said, ""those are still in the minority."" There is also a patchwork of prices across the country. Statistics Canada's data shows Quebec has the lowest legal cannabis prices in Canada at $7.88 per gram and Ontario has the highest illegal cannabis price with an average of $6.21 per gram. Meanwhile, New Brunswick had the lowest price per gram of illegal cannabis at an average of $4.90 per gram, but the highest price for legal cannabis at $11.36 per gram. Lowering the price of legal cannabis to match illegal rates can be tricky, but is possible, Armstrong said. Greenhouses growing cannabis are labour intensive because they often require plants to be moved, trimmed and harvested, but automation and improved floor plans can help. Provincial wholesalers and retailers have their work cut out for them too. ""The first year, efficiency wasn't really a big issue because there was a shortage of product, so you can sell it priced at $10 and sell out … but going forward price has to be an issue,"" Armstrong said. Omar Khan, the national cannabis sector lead at Hill+Knowlton Strategies, said in an email that a lot of work the industry has to do is being driven by two factors. He said the illicit market faces no costs related to regulatory oversight and is ""intentionally low balling prices in order to retain market share."" ""This combined with their ability to offer greater product variety and the slow rollout of licensed retail stores across Canada gives them a competitive edge with respect to the legal market,"" he said. Khan also said he has noticed that licensed producers are seeing their margins squeezed by excise and sales taxes, pushing producers to set higher wholesale price points to retain profitability. Today's data shows that the stated policy objective of the federal and provincial governments to eliminate the illicit market is just not happening, he said. ""All levels of government need to take a serious look at what policy levers can be deployed to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens so that licensed retailers and producers can effectively compete against those who chose to operate outside of the law.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cannabis-price-gap-illegal-legal-1.5438899,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/hexo-launches-low-cost-cannabis-product-1.5322504 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/pot-black-market-1.5363874 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/cannabis-finances-stocks-bankruptcy-2020-1.5434151,N/A

For several years, the CEGEP has been undergoing renovations of its older buildings. There are about 1,000 employees working in older buildings at the college. About 10 of them have complained about symptoms, according to the union representing professors. Union president Alexandre Lahaie said that since work began to renovate and remove asbestos, ""the air quality has improved."" ""We are hoping to turn the page, that we'll get to a place where confidence is restored and people are satisfied with the air quality,"" he said. An $11-million project to renovate the college's B wing is expected to be finished this summer. Despite the improvements, the college received an investigation report from Montreal Public Health this week, following an complaint from an employee in October. The report advises that the college's current efforts ""cannot guarantee a complete elimination"" of the issue, and recommends that any water leakage be addressed within 24 to 48 hours. The report notes that the college administration has plans to create a ""prevention brigade"" made up of security agents who will be charged with monitoring water infiltration. Public Health also recommended the school offer flexibility to staff experiencing health issues related to the air quality, by relocating their work stations or allowing them to telecommute.

213,Yvonne Colbert,2019-11-20T19:47:55.495Z,N.S. man takes one of world's biggest automakers to court — and wins,"Most people might be hesitant to take one of the world's biggest automakers to court. But not Nine Mile River, N.S., resident Ranulph Hudston, who persisted in his battle to have Volkswagen honour its 12-year corrosion warranty. The retired educator wouldn't take no for an answer when his 2007 Jetta started rusting and the company denied his warranty claim. He decided to take Volkswagen to Nova Scotia small claims court, and earlier this month won a judgment of $7,886.40 to pay for the repair costs. ""I was very surprised and very pleased,"" Hudston said of the court's Nov. 7 ruling. ""As I read the decision, I saw a lot of what I put into the case coming back to me as the truth, and the truth coming through felt really good."" His win came despite a list from Volkswagen of possible causes for the corrosion on the Jetta's door sills and rocker panels, including tree sap, bird droppings, shoe buckles and an improperly stored seatbelt. In her ruling, small claims adjudicator Shelly Martin didn't buy any of the excuses, saying she failed ""to see how a seatbelt or footwear could affect the areas in question, as the site of corrosion is not easily in contact with footwear or a seatbelt."" The 12-year corrosion warranty was provided to Hudston when he bought the vehicle brand new in 2007. He first noticed rust on the left front fender when his Jetta was almost seven years old. He went back to Hillcrest Volkswagen in Halifax, where he purchased the vehicle. He was then sent to a Volkswagen-authorized repair shop, which fixed most of the rusted areas and replaced the right quarter panel. But three years later, in 2017, he noticed blistering paint and a small strip of paint peeling on the rocker panels, as well as blistering paint on the front door sills. He took the Jetta to a body shop for repairs and was told the body work under the paint was rusting. He was advised the repairs should be covered under Volkswagen's warranty. Hudston went back to Hillcrest, where he was told to fill out an online inspection request that included acceptance of additional terms and conditions that were not in the original warranty. One new clause said any decisions by Volkswagen were final, while another said repairs must be made ""promptly."" Hudston was subsequently sent for a repair estimate where a technician told him any attempt to clean the rust on the door sill would likely ""blow a hole right through it."" More than a month later, Hillcrest Volkswagen told him the repair would not be covered, saying the corrosion was not the type covered by his warranty. It also refused to cover the rocker panels. Hudston continued to push Volkswagen to pay for the repairs, but the company responded in an email: ""We are unable to base our decisions on information received from independent shops and our decision remains unchanged."" It cited a number of reasons why the corrosion might have occurred — ranging from bird droppings, to rocks, to lack of rust proofing — and also suggested the problem was due to a general lack of maintenance. But in her decision, Martin noted photos of the vehicle showed ""an older but well cared for Jetta, stored in an impeccable clean garage."" The adjudicator said she was not convinced that any of the reasons provided by Volkswagen ""were of sufficient magnitude in the location of the corrosion to be its cause."" She also noted that three technicians that inspected the vehicle suggested it was corrosion covered under the warranty. George Iny, with the consumer advocacy group Automobile Protection Association, said he's not surprised by the potential causes cited by Volkswagen. He said automakers have a template for rust cases that includes 18 reasons why corrosion might have occurred. ""In many cases, they would just throw as many as they can and hope that one or two will stick. They really need only one for the judge to be convinced they are not responsible,"" he said. He calls it ""laughable"" that Volkswagen would say bird droppings are responsible for the rust on vertical surfaces on the lower part of the car. Iny said his organization has heard from dozens of Volkswagen owners who have had difficulty getting their corrosion warranties honoured. As a result, his group has posted tips on its website. Iny noted Volkswagen last year reduced its warranty from 12 to seven years, which he said is still good coverage by industry standards.  ""The impression we have is that they're applying that reduction retroactively and they're not supposed to do that,"" he said. A spokesperson for Volkswagen Canada, Thomas Tetzlaff, said the automaker takes all matters of quality very seriously and always honours the full terms of its warranties. He said while the company respects the court's decision, it is now considering whether to appeal. Iny said Hudston's case is a template for other Volkswagen owners facing rust problems. He said people can't go to court and simply say, ""I have a warranty and my vehicle is rusting."" He said vehicle owners need an expert or, at the very least, a report from an expert. Hudston, who has owned numerous Volkswagens and thinks they're excellent cars, said it was the company's own actions that led him to continue his fight. ""They didn't seem to want to hear me. They, in fact, seemed to be stonewalling me and I guess that insulted me. I expect to be respected by the companies I buy products from,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/warranty-corrosion-volkswagen-group-canada-small-claims-court-1.5363613,[],N/A
214,Liz James,2019-12-23T12:00:00.423Z,Giving up store-bought gifts reconnected my family to the true spirit of Christmas,"Ten years ago, I threw up my hands in despair at the whole Christmas ""thing."" I'd spent a particularly stressful season buying, wrapping and bookkeeping. I realized that I'd lost touch with the holiday I loved so much.  There was a time when I eagerly bounded out of bed on Nov. 1 to see if the stores had put up decorations yet. I belted out Christmas music all season. Now the sight of a twinkling tree just made me feel tired.  I realized my kids were still of that tender age where I hadn't yet defined how Christmas ""should"" be. I had a unique opportunity. I explained, a la Whoville, that Christmas doesn't come from a store. I quickly learned that ""handmade Christmas"" could be even more exhausting than ""bought Christmas."" After the first year I learned to streamline. Each person picked a type of gift  and made a ton of them. You get what you get.  I learned to have a strong idea of the season I loved and wanted — beautiful decorations, nice smells in the kitchen, tons of time with my family — and to keep adjusting until I got there. My kids bought into the idea with remarkable enthusiasm. The toddler declared excitedly ""I get to BE Santa"" (in our household, we treat Santa as a metaphor more than a literal truth). Both boys spent all of November and December rescuing egg cartons from the trash, colouring them with markers and wrapping them to go under the tree. On Dec. 24, we went around to friends and neighbours who were delighted to receive partially wrapped bits of trash from exuberant three- and five-year-olds wearing Santa hats. It was all the cuteness of regular Christmas, with far less guilt for getting rid of everything the minute the season has passed. A couple of years in, I found a five-year-old sitting beside the tree surrounded by piles of gifts. He declared, ""Mom, I have more presents than ANYBODY,""  Looking at the piles he'd sorted, I saw that he meant he'd made more presents than anybody.  I was sold. I figured it would end when they went to school, but it didn't. They'd return each January to join in the chorus of ""what'd you get?"" with their heartfelt speeches about creating the Christmas that matters to you. I thought this would get them ostracized for sure, but it gave them a kind of celebrity. The boys' sense of fairness was helped by the fact that we do presents at other times of the year. I'd see something perfect for them in a store in May and bring it home as a spontaneous gift, especially when travel was imminent. I once overheard one of the boys saying ""we don't do bought Christmas, we do airplane Presents."" Last year, it changed. My 13-year-old asked if we could have a bought Christmas, so that he could find out what ""normal Christmas"" was like. His dad and I had a decision to make. Was handmade Christmas really about no-buying, or was it about intentionality?   We agreed to give bought Christmas a try. By mid-morning on Dec. 25, it appeared we'd never go back. The 13-year-old stood in piles of crumpled paper and declared, ""What have I been missing?"" To my surprise, this year he asked if we could go ""50-50"" between the two.  He told me that bought Christmas was ""fun, but obviously not for every year,"" and that it ""lacked a personal touch.""  His older brother would have skipped bought Christmas completely, because he thought it was ""exhausting"" and that ""making a gift means you're giving someone a part of you."" I have no idea what Christmas will look like for my boys when they're adults.  Or even next year. What I hope is that it will be a conscious choice. I also hope that if — or when — they feel like they've lost the season they love, they'll have the tools they need to find it again.

215,Kendall Latimer,2020-01-23T23:37:58.697Z,Jason McKay testifies he heard strange voice say 'kill her' before stabbing his wife twice,"Jason McKay testified that he heard instructions from a growly voice before he stabbed his wife twice with a jagged dagger. ""Kill her, she has no heart,'"" he heard, according to his testimony.  Jason, 47, spoke in his own defence on Thursday at Regina's Court of Queen's bench. McKay is on trial for second-degree murder for the 2017 death of his wife, Jenny. He said that on Sept.5, 2017, Jenny was upset after being fired, so they drank Twisted Teas together at home before grabbing two bottles of wine.  Jason testified his memory becomes unclear after the point he was sipping on the first glass of wine with Jenny at their kitchen table. ""I don't know if I blacked out or... it's just the last thing I remember,"" he said.  Then he began to describe a series of blackouts. It began with Jenny on top of him, with a 20 inch dagger in her hand, dressed in a black cloak.  He told court that his next memory is of Jenny on the floor — in her pink shirt.  ""I heard voices telling me to 'kill her, she has no heart.'"" He said he watched himself crawl toward her as he then ""grabbed the dagger and stabbed her twice in the neck."" He said the next thing he remembers is being at the kitchen table with Jenny, as a second Jenny lay on the floor. McKay went on to describe two men and one woman in dark clothing entering his home, with the woman saying  ""DOA.""  Crown prosecutor Adam Breker noted McKay's testimony of ""visions"" differed from what he told police officers after his arrest..  Jason said he had no memory of speaking with police after his arrest.  Crown prosecutor Adam Breker questioned why Jason did not mention hallucinations, cloaks, daggers or dark figures in the home over the course of interviews with police.  Breker referred to Jason telling a police officer that he remembered Jenny on top of him wielding a steak knife. Jason had said he grabbed her arms and was able to toss it aside. He asked why his memory had apparently changed.  ""Is it possible that it's just come to you within the last seven days?"" Breker asked.  Throughout examination, Jason maintained that he was plagued by memory gaps after the first sip of wine. Jason had been on anti-depressants for months at the time of Jenny's death. He said he believed the pills had caused hallucinations, delusions and out-of-body experiences. He had previously told police he needed his medication because it made him ""level.""  When asked by Hynes if he thought what happened had been real, Jason said no. ""It was like a dream,""  he said. Jason told Hynes that he did not willingly kill his wife, but that he will be forever remorseful. Pharmacology expert Steven Richardson testified that it was possible McKay had ""islands of memory in the sea of amnesia"" based on the knowledge that he had consumed four cans of Twisted Tea, some red wine and his anti-depressants.  ""In a period of amnesia, he would not be able to appreciate the consequences of his actions,"" Richardson said.  Breker will cross examine the expert on Friday. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/jason-mckay-testifies-second-degree-murder-trial-1.5438479,[],N/A
216,Anonymous,2020-01-23T21:19:25.853Z,New stamp commemorates black hockey league nearly lost to time,"A new stamp highlights black hockey players in the Maritimes whose story was almost buried in history. But those players pioneered elements of the game and persevered despite not being able to play with their white counterparts. Canada Post unveiled an image Thursday in Cherry Brook, N.S., of the 1904 Halifax Eurekas, the winners of the Colored Hockey Championship that year.  Former MLA Wayne Adams's grandfather Augustus (Gus) Adams helped form the hockey league in 1895 and played alongside his brother, George, on the team.  Racism was so entrenched that they couldn't share the ice with white players. ""There's a hunk of history in that stamp,"" Wayne Adams said. ""What's being celebrated is some lost, stolen or denied history. ""And I think research over the past 10, 15 years has proven that this is a significant piece of real Canadian history and you can't have it locked away in security vaults at various universities.""  People flocked to the Colored Hockey Championship in the early 20th century. At its peak, there were seven Nova Scotia teams and one from Prince Edward Island.  Players used wooden pucks cut from birch trees and would practise in the early mornings on the Bedford Basin or at arenas late at night after white players had finished.  The Cornwallis Street Baptist Church organized Halifax's games.   ""They were paid the handsome sum of 50 cents a month,"" said Adams.  Though the league continued into the 1930s, and Adams's father and uncles played, he only learned about the significance of the league in the past decade.  Elizabeth Cooke-Sumbu discovered her grandfather played for the Amherst Royals when the community hosted a black sports award banquet about 10 years ago. She said the players all had descendents in the community, some of whom play hockey.  ""Well, it was pretty exciting,"" she said.  ""It's never too late to recognize history. History will always be here so now it's entrenched in the books, in the stamp, people will be able to see that forever. To Canada Post, I say thank you."" Craig Smith, president of the Black Cultural Society, had also never heard about the Colored Hockey Championship until recent years. But his grandfather and great uncles actually played. ""The league was gone, the history was kind of lost or missed. Wars happened. People went away overseas and the history was lost to a degree,"" he said. Smith said it's important for people know about the league and that black men have contributed to the game for more than 125 years.   ""It shows we were a part of building this country — whether it was in the arena, socially or militarily,"" he said.  He said the league was physical and fast and ""paved the way for modern hockey as we see it today."" Smith said newspaper stories from the time described how players like Eddie Martin pioneered the slapshot. Goalies were ahead of their time. ""It was unknown for goaltenders to drop down to stop a puck and yet Henry Franklin — of one of the players in the coloured league — was able to go down and do that as part of his game,"" he said. ""Those kind of innovations that we see today were perfected in that league."" He said it's important to acknowledge the history of black people in Nova Scotia is ""steeped in racism.""  ""You can't look forward without looking back and if we look back you have to look at the more unsavoury times that existed within our history to really appreciate where we are now and also recognize how much work there is still to be done."" Adams echoed that.  ""The only way to deal with it is to talk about it. The more we talk about it, the more we realize how ugly it is, how wrong it is, hopefully the less it'll be exercised,"" he said.

Anderson and Peters married Monday in a private ceremony in Malibu, Calif., a representative for Anderson said Tuesday. It's the fifth marriage for both the 52-year-old model-actress and the 74-year-old film producer, who recently reunited after first dating more than 30 years ago. Anderson's husbands have included musicians Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, who is the father of her two adult children.

218,Tom Hays and Michael R. Sisak,2020-01-22T22:00:43.144Z,"Harvey Weinstein trial begins, portraying ex-producer as predator","Harvey Weinstein went on trial Wednesday in a landmark moment for the #MeToo movement, with prosecutors painting him as a sexual predator who used his movie-magnate stature to abuse women for decades, while his lawyers sought to discredit his accusers and portray them as willing participants. Prosecutor Meghan Hast told the jury of seven men and five women that the former studio boss was ""not just a titan in Hollywood — he was a rapist"" who screamed at one victim that she ""owed"" him sex, used injections to induce an erection before an assault and pushed his way into the apartment of another woman and assaulted her. ""It is for his complete lack of empathy that he must be held accountable,"" Hast said. Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis countered by laying out plans to use friendly-sounding emails, calendar entries and other evidence to call the accusers' accounts of being attacked into question. The opening of the rape trial more than two years after a barrage of allegations against Weinstein gave rise to #MeToo was seen by activists as a milestone in the global reckoning over sexual misconduct by powerful men. Weinstein's lawyers, though, have portrayed the case as the result of a climate of accusation run amok. Weinstein, 67, said little as he arrived at a Manhattan court Wednesday. Asked whether he believed he would have a fair trial, he said yes: ""I have good lawyers."" Guided by aides and lawyers, he wasn't using the walker he's leaned on lately after a summer car crash and subsequent back surgery. He said he was feeling better. Weinstein has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual. He could get life in prison if convicted. The once-powerful and feared executive brought to the screen such Oscar-winning movies as Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech, Shakespeare in Love and Chicago, and hobnobbed with the elite in Hollywood and beyond, a point prosecutors made by showing jurors a photo of Weinstein with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. A prosecutor also told the judge that Weinstein had taken calls from Clinton while Weinstein was with one of his accusers. Weinstein's lawyers later cited the photo in asking for a mistrial, accusing prosecutors of improperly trying to influence the jury. Judge James Burke denied the request. The prosecution called former board member of The Weinstein Co., Lance Maerov, as its first witness. Maerov described the ex-producer as ""an extremely influential, powerful person"" who could be charming in public and aggressive in private. ""I would say his public personality was diametrically opposed to who he was in private,"" Maerov said. The movie company went bankrupt after Weinstein's fall. At the end of the day's session, Weinstein left the courthouse with the use of his walker. Asked how the day went, he said, ""Good."" Scores of women have accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them over the years. But the New York charges centre on two allegations: that he forcibly performed oral sex on former Project Runway production assistant Mimi Haleyi in his apartment in 2006 and raped an aspiring actress in a New York City hotel room in 2013. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they come forward publicly. The rape accuser found a needle in the hotel room bathroom after the alleged assault and realized Weinstein had injected himself to get an erection, Hast said. Another time, after the woman told him she had a new boyfriend, Weinstein dragged her into a bedroom, ""all the while screaming at her that he owed her one more time,"" Hast said. ""He ripped her jeans off so forcefully that it left scratch marks."" The prosecutor said Weinstein later told the woman, ""I just want to apologize for what happened earlier. I just find you so attractive, I couldn't resist you."" In addition to the two women he is charged with attacking, prosecutors plan to call to the stand four other accusers — including actress Annabella Sciorra — in a bid to portray Weinstein as a monster who lured women with offers of career help, then forced himself on them. ""They will each describe their fear, their shame and their humiliation — the struggle each went through to push their trauma down and show a brave face to the world,"" Hast said. Hast detailed allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted Sciorra around 1993 after giving the Sopranos actress a ride home to her Manhattan apartment and forcing his way inside. ""She told him to get out. She told him no. But Harvey Weinstein was undeterred,"" Hast said. Weinstein's lawyers made it clear they plan to go on the offensive. Cheronis said the 2013 rape accuser sent Weinstein a request that year asking for ""time privately"" with him and another message letting him know, ""I got a new number. I just wanted you to have it. Always good to hear your voice."" ""These aren't our words. They're hers. It is not a relationship based on fear, you are going to see that,"" Cherinos said. Weinstein's trial could take more than a month, Burke said. Judging from an arduous two-week jury selection that netted the panel of seven men and five women, it could be a hotbed of protests and intense media coverage. In a failed last-minute push to get the trial moved, Weinstein's lawyers said a flash mob's chanting ""the rapist is you!"" at street level could be heard in the courtroom, 15 floors above. Adding to the drama, actor Cuba Gooding Jr. was in the same courthouse Wednesday morning for a hearing for a case in which several women have accused him of groping. An April 21 trial date was set for the Oscar winner, who has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. Once the New York trial is over, Weinstein faces additional rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. Those charges were filed this month as jury selection in his New York trial was getting underway.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-opening-statements-1.5435800,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-trial-1.5416035,N/A
219,Holly Conners,2020-01-23T21:40:03.519Z,Rental construction boom helping fuel Cape Breton wallboard plant expansion,"Nova Scotia's only gypsum wallboard plant is expanding. Cabot Manufacturing in Point Tupper is spending about $6.5 million to upgrade its plant and add to its product line. Company president Marcel Girouard said the expansion is being driven in part by the boom in urban condo and high-rise apartment construction, and a trend toward higher ceilings. Girouard anticipates the expansion will create as many as 40 new jobs. The expansion comes on the heels of a rocky period for the industry in recent years, which is a result of the 2008 financial crisis and the corresponding slowdown in housing construction. The previous owner of the Point Tupper plant, Federal Gypsum, went bankrupt in 2008. Girouard said Cabot has benefited from it's affiliation with Acadian Drywall Ltd., which bought the Point Tupper plant in 2011 and has an established distribution network. Cabot currently sells its products across Canada and exports to the United States and other countries. Raw material comes from all over North America, with some coming from Nova Scotia. Girouard sees potential for gypsum mining to return to Cape Breton. ""We've done some drilling on some land not far from the plant, so we'll see what happens,"" he said. George Karaphillis, the dean of the Shannon School of Business at Cape Breton University, said the housing market being on an upswing and a trend toward energy efficient buildings are good news for Cabot. ""The economists are predicting something like an 11 per cent annual increase in the demand for gypsum boards worldwide,"" said Karaphillis. ""It's in demand pretty much everywhere."" He said natural gypsum is a sustainable material and has good insulating properties. Nova Scotia Business Inc. is providing a rebate that will cover 25 per cent of the expansion costs.

221,Anonymous,2020-01-24T14:16:04.207Z,The mummy speaks: Ancient Egyptian priest's voice recreated by scientists,"Researchers say they've mimicked the voice of a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy by recreating much of its vocal tract using medical scanners, 3D printing and an electronic larynx. In a paper published Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports, the authors say the technique allowed them to produce a single sound — somewhere between the vowels in ""bed"" and ""bad."" The eerie tone is unlikely to be a precise reflection of the speech of Egyptian priest Nesyamun, whose mummified body the researchers worked with, because the tongue has lost much of its bulk over three millennia. ""We have made a faithful sound for his tract in its current position, but we would not expect an exact speech match given his tongue state,"" said co-author David M. Howard of London's Royal Holloway college. The model alone also isn't enough to synthesize whole words or sentences, the authors said, noting that this would require the ability to calculate the audio output from the vocal tract as its shape is being changed. ""But this is something that is being worked on, so it will be possible one day,"" said Howard. Rudolf Hagen, an ear, nose and throat expert at the University Hospital in Wuerzburg, Germany, who specializes in thorax reconstruction and wasn't involved in the study, expressed skepticism. Even cutting-edge medicine struggles to give living people without a thorax a ""normal"" voice, he said. Co-author John Schofield, an archaeologist at the University of York, said the technique could be used to help people interpret historical heritage. ""When visitors encounter the past, it is usually a visual encounter,"" said Schofield. ""With this voice we can change that, and make the encounter more multidimensional."" ""There is nothing more personal than someone's voice, so we think that hearing a voice from so long ago will be an unforgettable experience, making heritage places like Karnak, Nesyamun's temple, come alive,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/mummy-voice-1.5438831,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/august-17-2019-the-benefits-of-video-games-composting-corpses-brewing-ancient-beer-and-more-1.5155492/drink-like-an-egyptian-5-000-year-old-yeast-resurrected-to-brew-ancient-beer-1.5155502 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.5240203/what-does-bread-from-4-500-year-old-egyptian-yeast-taste-like-rich-with-overtones-of-brown-sugar-1.5240514,N/A
222,Shaina Luck,2020-01-23T10:00:00.830Z,Burst pipe forces Halifax's winter shelter to scramble for new location,"Halifax's emergency winter shelter is scrambling to find a temporary location just one week after it settled into its new home. Last week, a pipe burst on the upper floor of the College Street shelter while no one was there. ""It ended up leaking for a while and it caused a lot of water damage, so we won't be back in this season,"" said Rebecca Whitzman, co-ordinator for the Out of the Cold Emergency Winter Shelter. The shelter moved to the Needham Community Centre gym for two nights on the weekend and is now in the Brunswick Street Mission for one week. The shelter is serving 15 guests per night and is overcapacity, but Whitzman said no one is being turned away. The shelter's insurance company is assessing the damage and Whitzman said it would likely take months to make repairs. The space may have to be gutted and rebuilt. For the last 10 years, the shelter operated in the basement of St. Matthew's United Church in downtown Halifax. Moving to the new location was a big change. The College Street location has bedrooms, a living room with a television and a kitchen where guests can gather and talk while staff cook meals. ""We were just commenting on how beautiful the space was, how cozy it was,"" said Jeff Karabanow, one of the shelter's founders. ""The guests were really enjoying the space. It was a very different vibe than the shelter in the past."" Karabanow said the shelter can't stay long at the Brunswick Street Mission and is exploring where to go next. One church in Spryfield and one church in Fairview have said they are open to the idea, but Karabanow said no final decisions have been made. ""We're just figuring out the transportation issue and seeing if we could get the funds to support folks coming back and forth,"" he said. Karabanow said staff are exploring with the province and the city to see if a downtown location close to their regular clients is available, but he's doubtful one can be found on short notice.

The city will shut down the popular Ottawa River swimming spot in July, and it will be off-limits until the fall, Bay ward Coun. Theresa Kavanagh said Thursday. ""We all share the disappointment,"" Kavanagh said. While inconvenient, the work is necessary, Kavanagh said. It's been about 30 years since the city closed the artificial beach for dredging, and she said the work will make the swimming area deeper and cleaner. Majd Samrout, owner of the Baja Burger Shack — the only business at Britannia Beach — expects a significant hit to sales this summer, and may even close for part of the season. ""Generally for us, our busiest time is July,"" Samrout said. ""I look at what the businesses went through on Elgin and everything they've endured in the last couple years — I guess it's just my turn now."" Samrout said city employees told him earlier this month the beach would be closed from July 1 until October or possibly November, and the city would construct a two-and-a-half-metre mesh fence to try and block sand and dust from infiltrating his patio. He said he's noticed the swimming area has gradually become more and more shallow, and he's received complaints from customers that they ""can't even swim in there."" ""From a business point of view it's horrible. I'm petrified. But as a private citizen, you need to do it,"" he said of the dredging work. Britannia Park will remain open this summer, which gives Samrout some hope the area will continue to attract hungry people, even if the beach is closed. As of Friday morning, no one from the city had provided CBC News with information about the beach closure.

Supreme Court on Jan. 20, the first day of the Huawei CFO's extradition hearing.  CBC spoke to two women who said they were offered money to show up at the courthouse and hold signs with slogans like ""Free Ms. Meng,"" and ""Equal Justice.""  One of the women said she was paid $150. The other, actor Julia Hackstaff, said she and others in the local film community were led to believe they were working as extras on a movie shoot in exchange for $100. Meng is in court for hearings over a U.S. request to extradite the Chinese telecom executive on fraud charges She was arrested at Vancouver Airport in December 2018 and has been out on $10-million bail, living in one of her two multi-million dollar Vancouver mansions.

She was in complete shock but still in the middle of traffic. She realized she needed to think fast. ""I tried to get off the highway. It's a bit of a blur,"" said Cliffe.  ""I remember looking to the right, making sure there was nothing beside me and then veering as fast as I could to get off the road.""  After stopping her car, Cliffe sat there in shock. She remembers crying and hyperventilating, unsure what to do next. She eventually called for an ambulance.  Along with her damaged car, she was left with several scratches and bruises across her face and a minor concussion. ""The good thing is it was probably the flat part [that hit me]. The doctor was saying that if it had been jagged, it could've gone right through my head,"" Cliffe said.  Pierre-Olivier Fortin, a spokesperson for CAA-Quebec, said this isn't an isolated incident.  This month alone, there have been several similar incidents across the country.  Earlier this week, a man driving west of Ottawa was injured after a chunk of ice flew off a nearby car and went through his windshield. On Tuesday, a thick chunk of ice flew off a transport truck and slammed into a double-decker bus in Mississauga, Ont. No one was injured in that incident but the vehicle's windshield was damaged.  ""You would think that it's common sense to remove snow and ice from your car, but we see now and then people forgetting that and it's unfortunate because really it's a road safety issue,"" said Fortin.  In 2018, the provincial government updated Quebec's Highway Safety Code to include a section on snow removal.  According to that new regulation, ""no person may drive a vehicle covered with snow, ice or any other matter that may detach from the vehicle.""  Should the driver fail to clear their car of snow or ice, they can be fined. When it comes to trucks, the responsibility to clean the vehicle is split between the client, the company and the driver.  There are several ways drivers can remove ice from heavy trucks, according to Transports Québec's website: mechanical stations, special stations equipped with ladders or staircases, as well as brooms made specifically to reach the roof of the vehicle. As for regular cars, Fortin recommends patience when it comes to removing thick layers of ice.  ""If you have a very thick layer of ice covering your car, it may be a good idea to heat up your car before starting to remove it,"" said Fortin.  ""A strong arm and a scraper is going to do the job."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/highway-40-ice-flies-through-windshield-1.5436475,[],N/A

The book is then delivered in a new backpack with a pair of pyjamas.    The program is run by the Restorative Ministry Office at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Saskatoon and the Saskatoon Correctional Centre.  Diann Block, cultural co-ordinator at the jail, said she was inspired by a similar program in the UK.  Block reached out to the Diocese and was introduced to Tim Yaworski, a volunteer who films the storytelling. Any inmate at the jail can apply for the program. The team will vet and decide who can participate.  Yaworski said he was hesitant at first, as entering the jail was outside his comfort zone.  ""I realised I've got a specific skill set that they needed and it was a way to force me out of that comfort zone,"" he said.  Literacy is important to keep families connected, Block said. ""When they come out, the kids will have an experience with their dad that they wouldn't have had before,"" Block said. ""For a lot of the men, it's a very moving experience."" If a man isn't able to read, Yaworski works with them to take their time and begin again, Block said.  Yaworski said it's moving to spend time with the men.  ""To see them reaching out to their children is really priceless,"" he said. ""One father, he came to me and he said 'My daughter watches the video every day. She thinks I'm a movie star now.'""  The jail also has an Inspired Minds program where dads could write their own stories just for their child, Block said. They've put it on twice since their All Nations Creative Writing Program started in 2011.  The Storytime Dads program does more than give children a new memory, it helps with rehabilitation, Block said.  ""It's been proven that if the men while they're inside can maintain contact with their families there's less chance of recidivism,"" she said. ""Any program like this, if it helps them not to come back that's a bonus.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/storybook-dad-program-prison-father-reads-1.5438956,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/alicia-mora-queens-volunteer-award-1.5135232,N/A
228,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-24T17:04:04.837Z,Trudeau appoints constitutional lawyer Marc Gold as government leader in the Senate,"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tapped Quebec Sen. Marc Gold for the position of government representative in the upper house — the top job in the Senate. Gold will be the government's point-person in an increasingly independent upper house — tasked with ushering government legislation through a fractured chamber that is no longer defined by a Liberal and Conservative duopoly. Gold, appointed by Trudeau as an Independent senator in 2016, was a well-regarded constitutional lawyer and scholar before he was named to the upper house. Early in his career, he trained federally appointed judges on constitutional law and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Gold replaces Ontario Sen. Peter Harder in the top job. Since his appointment, Gold has voted in lockstep with the Liberal government. A CBC News analysis found his votes in the chamber aligned with the government position 100 per cent of the time. Gold also sponsored key pieces of government legislation, including Bill C-59, a bill that overhauled the national security regime. He also served as the Independent Senators Group's (ISG) liaison or whip, the group's vote-counter. ""Sen. Gold's long record of personal and professional achievement, together with his commitment to promoting human rights and Canada's regional diversity, will help us find common ground in the Senate as we invest in and protect our communities, create good middle class jobs and fight climate change,"" Trudeau said in a statement. ""I look forward to working with him to build a better Canada for all Canadians."" The role of Senate government leader — or, as the Trudeau government has styled the position, ""government representative"" — is a difficult one. In years' past, the government leader was selected from the benches of the party in power. The leader could rely on his or her caucus colleagues to pass government legislation in the Senate. Since the introduction of an independent Senate, passage of government bills has been less certain because the government representative no longer sits as part of the government caucus. Gold will have to negotiate with five separate caucuses and leaders to see that government bills are passed in a timely manner. In addition to his legislative priorities, Gold will pick up where Harder left off on further reforms to the Senate. Harder had pushed for the creation of a ""business committee"" to schedule debates on bills and also advocated for an independent, outside audit committee to keep tabs on Senate spending — measures that failed to materialize in the face of opposition from Conservative senators.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-picks-marc-gold-1.5439110,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-senate-point-man-ethics-code-don-meredith-1.5404104 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/peter-harder-senate-point-man-political-appointees-1.5403028 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/senate-strip-don-meredith-honourable-title-1.5391315,N/A

That's when her boyfriend, Newfoundland Growlers captain James Melindy, fired up his snowmobile. ""She's a good person that wanted to help out on her day off,"" he said. ""Newfoundlanders find a way."" The St. John's area was ravaged Friday by a blizzard that brought hurricane-force winds and record snowfall. On Wednesday, the city was entering its sixth day of a state of emergency. Churchill and Melindy managed to make it off their road and she got into a waiting car, which drove her to the hospital, where she works as a registered nurse on the intensive-care unit. Melindy said he knew exactly what to do when Churchill wanted to get to work. He grew up in the Goulds, where his mother was a nurse and his father often used a snowmobile to get her to work during snow storms. This storm, however, was unlike anything they've seen before. ""I'm in the Goulds so to have a Ski-Doo isn't too far out of the norm,"" Melindy said. ""We have a field so we get a lot of drifting as well. Just down the road from me was 10-, 15-foot drifts. It was crazy."" As of Tuesday, essential workers could drive to and from work in their own vehicles. Most roads have had at least one cut through with a snow plow. Churchill can probably get to work without a snowmobile now, but she'll always have a story to tell. And Melindy has a renewed appreciation for the work she does. ""Our nurses and first responders, and people out taking care of this storm and snow, have done a tremendous job,"" he said. As the city gets closer to lifting the state of emergency, the Growlers get ready to hit the road.  The team hasn't missed any games due to the storm, and are supposed to fly to Pennsylvania on Thursday.

According to a city spokesman, a five metre by 20 metre section of the wall came down at around 9 a.m., damaging a garage on the property below. No one was hurt. ""As a precautionary measure we emptied the houses in case of any further sliding of the slope or the remainder of the wall coming down,"" said Burnaby public works manager Brian Carter. Carter says BC Hydro has disconnected a line feeding electricity to the hydro poles in the area. The neighbourhood where the slide happened is on the northwest side of Burnaby Mountain. ""Some of the slide material has come to the bottom of one of the poles and we want to make sure that we protect the public by making sure that they are de-energized,"" he said. City engineering staff and the Burnaby Fire Department are on the scene. A geotechnical engineer has been called in to assess if there is further risk to the area. Residents were told it was safe to return to their homes later Thursday after the assessment was complete, said city spokesman Chris Bryan. Power remains disconnected from several homes. The city will begin removing soil from the lane and some sections of the retaining wall on Friday, he added.  The cause of the wall failure has not yet been determined.  Burnaby, like most of the South Coast, has been under a rainfall warning since Wednesday that has only recently been lifted.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mudslide-forces-evacuation-of-6-homes-in-burnaby-s-westridge-neighbourhood-1.5438386,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/rainfall-warning-jan-22-2020-1.5435878,N/A

On an abandoned section of tarmac, the military members are creating craters in the concrete and filling them in with whatever they have on hand.  ""The idea is to be able to do these repairs in the extreme cold,"" Lt.-Col. Simon Comtois said. ""If you use concrete, it takes a lot more time to cure and it's more resource-intensive,"" he said. ""Here, what we're doing is using ambient materials such as snow, water and the debris from the crater."" The fix was strong enough for an aircraft to roll over it, but is a temporary repair for the colder months. Once warmer conditions arrive, Comtois said, they would put in a permanent fix using concrete.  Last year the federal government said it would spend about $2.3 million to repair one of the air base's crumbling runways in the short term, with a full repaving project and airfield lighting upgrades set for the next few years. The aging runway was experiencing issues like asphalt stripping, debris and potholes. In 2017, the airport was shut down for four days after issues with a sealant that was applied to cracks in the runways during annual maintenance. Crumbling runway at Goose Bay airport getting major repair, overhaul Goose Bay airfield shut down due to runway issue This joint experiment is happening independently of repairs, and will see about 40 people — evenly split between Canadians and Americans —  testing eight different methods of making repairs in the cold climate of central Labrador. ""This is a great example of co-operation between Canada and the United States,"" U.S. air force Brig.-Gen. Edward Vaughn said. ""It's industry and military. It's really a great coming-together.""  Many of the methods being tested are not new, but the exercise gives the forces a chance to examine them and come up with more effective techniques. ""What we're doing now is actually documenting and getting the data,"" Vaughn said. Some new techniques will also be introduced by scientists from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in New Hampshire. ""There's a lot of innovation going on here,"" Vaughn said. ""Things as simple as, when you're operating the heavy equipment, what kind of gloves do you want to wear? What kind of hat? What kind of communication equipment do you need with all the noise?"" While the fixes will come in handy for Canadian Forces in the North, the Americans expect to use the knowledge in Alaska and some of the colder states, as well as their cold-weather ally countries.  ""We've got plenty of partners around the world in cold regions,"" Vaughn said. ""Think about it. There are even times when even parts of the United states get to be extreme cold."" Five different locations were considered to host the tests, but in the end it was decided 5 Wing was the most suitable. ""We wanted to make sure that we had enough snowfall, so enough material to fix the craters,"" Comtois said.  ""We needed enough cold.… We needed to have access to heavy equipment, enough space on the tarmac and the ramp to be able to create a hole and not impede with operations.""

For decades, Ten Thousand Villages pop-up markets have been part of Christmas on P.E.I., connecting Islanders with thousands of artisans from more than 30 countries. The markets sold food products, home decor, jewelry and many other items. Shelley MacEwen, organizer of the market at Park Royal Church, volunteered for decades at the markets, and would often offer this advice to people. ""I said 'Come to the sale,'"" MacEwen told CBC Radio: Island Morning Friday. ""Don't buy, just come in and absorb all those countries that are represented in one room, and you get quite a feel for what you see and how other people live in the world."" This week, Ten Thousand Villages announced this week poor sales are forcing the closure of its Canadian distribution centre, bringing to an end the holiday tradition of pop-up markets around the country. It was just too difficult to compete with online retailers, MacEwen said, adding that online shopping will still be an option for Canadian Ten Thousand Villages customers. ""I'm extremely sad for what I will miss,"" she said. ""On the bigger picture you have to look at all the artisans that that potentially can lose their market for selling their product. So I think that's where my heart mostly lies."" Ten Thousand Villages is one of the oldest fair-trade organizations in North America, operating for almost 75 years. A fair deal for the artisans is what came first, said MacEwen, not profit. Apart from international connections, MacEwen said Ten Thousand Villages brought together people on the Island.

City crews will later come to do a proper cleanup, he said. Montreal police will also be following the route the truck took to see if there are spills on the way that need addressing. The leak was contained and the company that owns the truck transferred the fuel into another vehicle.

The facility, to be located at the edge of LeBreton Flats, is a partnership between the Ottawa Public Library (OPL) and Library and Archives Canada. It's being jointly designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects from Toronto and Ottawa's KWC Architects. Diamond Schmitt Architects is the firm that reimagined the National Arts Centre on Elgin Street. Those architects held public consultations throughout 2019 to get a sense of what Ottawans wanted in the new library. ""Design doesn't happen in a vacuum,"" architect Don Schmitt said in 2018 before consultations got underway. ""It happens in a place, in a culture, in a context and that's what we really want to hear about.""

It would include an area devoted to Indigenous people and the study of their culture, as well as an open ""town square"" on the ground floor and a rooftop café with views of Parliament Hill and the Ottawa River.   The space would be split 60-40 between the OPL and Library and Archives Canada, the report said.  While that report had suggested the library's opening date had been moved back until 2025, both Watson and OPL board chair Coun.

235,"Erica Johnson, Enza Uda",2019-11-28T19:42:49.629Z,Customers file record number of complaints about Canadian telcos,"David Marco has no shortage of unflattering adjectives for Bell Canada — a telecom service provider he says convinced him to sign on as a customer by misrepresenting the true cost of a two-year deal for internet, TV and home phone. ""It's outrageous. It's patently wrong. It's deceptive,"" Marco, 65, told Go Public from his home in Vaughan, Ont., north of Toronto. In October, he filed a complaint with the Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services (CCTS) — and he's got company. According to the industry mediator's annual report, consumers filed a record-breaking number of complaints against Canada's telecom companies in 2018-19 — nearly 19,300.  The CCTS says that figure is a 35 per cent increase over 2017-18 and an all-time high in the organization's 12-year history.  ""It's disappointing to see … issues that customers shouldn't have to deal with,"" said CCTS Commissioner Howard Maker. ""It tells us that there's still room for improvement."" The report, released Thursday, tracks complaints received between Aug. 1, 2018 and July 31, 2019, of which the greatest share (over 40 per cent) were billing errors, followed by contract disputes (over 30 per cent) and dissatisfaction with service delivery (over 20 per cent).  CCTS says it ""successfully resolved"" 91 per cent of all concluded complaints. Bell Canada, the country's largest telecom, with 22 million subscriptions, received the most complaints — almost 5,900. (A customer with multiple services from the same provider can be associated with several subscriptions.) Complaints against Bell about incorrect charges and ""disclosure of important information"" were ""disproportionately high,"" according to the report.  A Bell spokesperson notes the company's share of total complaints declined slightly over the previous year, and that it is reviewing the report to ""ensure that they continue to provide customers with the best experience.""  Rogers, which has about 16 million subscriptions, received just over 1,800 complaints. Its share of complaints also slightly decreased over the previous year.  Rogers had a ""disproportionately high percentage"" of complaints about incorrect charges on wireless accounts, but received a slightly lower proportion of complaints about credits and refunds that weren't received on internet services.  A Rogers spokesperson said the company had the fewest complaints per subscriber among the national carriers and has ""started to see progress"" in improving its customer service. Telus, with 14.5 million subscribers, received just over 1,600 complaints — up 71 per cent.  Most of those were about either changes to wireless contracts (28 per cent) or wireless price increases (30 per cent), according to the report. It received a lower proportion of complaints about incorrect wireless charges and contract disputes. ""Shame on us that we had language that was confusing and not transparent,"" Tony Geheren, executive VP at Telus, told Go Public. He says the increase in complaints was a result of a ""poorly executed rate change"" for wireless customers and that Telus has since simplified its contracts.  The report notes 158 violations of the Wireless Code — a 42 per cent increase. Most involved a failure of companies to provide customers with key documents, and not giving proper notice before disconnecting a customer's service. Bell accounted for 29 per cent of all Wireless Code breaches, while Rogers and Telus each accounted for 20 per cent.  Marco's frustration began last March, when he says a Bell sales representative promised him internet, TV and home phone service for $119.90 a month for two years. But in September, the price for his TV service went up by $3.50. When he called Bell, he recorded the conversation, and a second rep told him to look at the contract the company emailed him after he verbally agreed to sign up — it mentions that prices are ""subject to change."" Marco says he didn't scrutinize the contract, because he was going with what the first rep offered him on the phone. He requested a transcript of that conversation but was told that wasn't possible.  ""There will be no way for us, sir, to send you a copy of the transcript,"" the rep said. Marco says that's nonsense. ""The contract was the phone call. They're denying that they have the contract,"" he said.  He says a story reported by Go Public last year supports his argument — a case that went to small claims court determined that a verbal agreement between a customer and Bell trumps any written contract that the telecom giant emails after the fact. CCTS investigated but said it couldn't help, because according to Bell the transcript no longer existed. The company only holds them for six months which, according to a Bell spokesperson, is ""standard practice"" in the industry. ""I think that's problematic,"" said Maker, the head of the CCTS.  ""We've spent a lot of time asking the CRTC … to ensure that service providers are retaining records so that an independent investigation can be obtained and the actual facts can be determined."" ""The ability to … investigate what happened is limited in the absence of that phone call."" Consumer advocate John Lawford says what's really needed is a ban on price increases for internet and TV during the life of a contract — the same way companies aren't permitted to jack up prices during a cellphone contract. ""The Wireless Code doesn't let you change your wireless pricing for two years,"" Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, told Go Public. ""It kind of sets the trap for consumers who are expecting the same protections on internet and TV as they have on their wireless phone."" He says the CRTC missed a ""golden opportunity"" when it created similar rules for internet service, which come into effect on Jan. 31.  ""They allowed the Internet Code to go into effect without the rule that you have to keep the price the same,"" says Lawford. ""It is a very big missed opportunity."" Lawford doesn't think the telco giants will lock in prices for internet and TV contracts unless the regulator demands it. He says people fed up with ""unfair"" contracts should complain to the CRTC, the Competition Bureau and their MP.  ""Put pressure on those powers that be — to make the rules for internet and TV the same as they are for as they are for wireless,"" says Lawford.  Meantime, Marco says he will find another provider when his two-year contract is over. For now, he has advice for anyone calling a telecom.  ""Record the conversation. Record anything — incoming and outgoing,"" he says. ""Because it's the only protection that they'll get.""

Internal documents from the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) — obtained under Access to Information and provided to Go Public — show that some recommendations for action were weakened or removed, including a proposal to require that banks work in the best interest of consumers.  Another key edit was the addition of a line saying the review did not find ""widespread mis-selling"" by the banks. It all paints a picture of the ""cosy"" relationship between the country's six big banks, the agency that's supposed to regulate them and the federal government, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus of political studies at the University of Manitoba. ""[The banks] have disproportionate access and perhaps disproportionate influence."" The report was prompted in part by months of reporting by Go Public, in which hundreds of current and former bank employees said they were pushed to upsell customers to try to meet sales targets. Some described feeling pressured to do such things as mislead customers about credit card fees and mortgage rates, forge signatures on credit card and loan insurance products and secretly increase lines of credit. At the time, the banks told Go Public that they act in the best interests of their clients, and that employees are expected to follow various codes of conduct. The documents were obtained through Access to Information by public policy researcher Ken Rubin, who asked for draft copies of FCAC's report on sales practices at the big banks, and related correspondence. The regulator's review focused on BMO, CIBC, RBC, Scotiabank, TD and National Bank. It found that banks encourage employees to sell products and services and reward them for sales success. But FCAC also said it did not find evidence of widespread harm to consumers. Although FCAC staff interviewed 600 bank employees, and reviewed more than 100,000 pages of documents and 4,500 customer complaints, the report did not name a single bank or quote from any of the interviews. ""When I saw the March [2018] report, I said, 'There's more to it than meets the eye,'"" said Rubin, one of Canada's most prolific practitioners of federal Access to Information requests. Thomas found it particularly interesting that the regulator sent a draft of its report to the very banks at the centre of its eight-month review. ""[The banks] have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking,"" he said. ""It's a fact of life."" Sending the banks a draft copy is a big concern for consumer advocate Duff Conacher. ""You don't share … the evidence you gathered,"" said the co-founder of Democracy Watch and adjunct professor of law at the University of Ottawa. ""That evidence is the basis of your conclusions as to whether the law has been violated."" The banking regulator told Go Public it sent the banks a draft report so the financial institutions could ""identify factual errors."" ""If the agency wanted to check the facts in the report … they could have just sent them those facts,"" Conacher said.  In a subsequent draft, a line was added pointing out that banks are ""in the process of enhancing their oversight and management of sales practices risk."" It's not known who proposed adding that line. Go Public asked the Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) whether it requested a draft copy of the report.  CBA spokesperson Mathieu Labreche sent an email that did not respond to that question, writing, ""The Canadian Bankers Association and its member banks regularly communicate and meet with supervisory bodies, including the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, as part of the normal course of the oversight process."" The internal documents also include dozens of pages from the big banks, which appear to be responses to the regulator's draft report.  Go Public is not able to know their contents — including the date they were written, or who wrote them — because entire pages were redacted under an Access to Information exemption that protects commercial interests. The documents also reveal that the banking regulator supplied a draft to Finance Minister Bill Morneau and his department three months before publicly releasing it last year. Conacher says the regulator, purportedly an independent agency, should not have given the minister and his department a chance to vet and comment on its report. ""It's inappropriate and improper for a minister to be looking at the draft conclusions of a law enforcement agency,"" he told Go Public. ""That means decisions could be made on the basis of politics, not on the basis of the facts and the law."" One of the most significant edits to the initial draft that was sent to the finance minister was the addition of a finding on Page 1 that says, ""FCAC did not find widespread mis-selling during its review."" ""It's hard to say … exactly what happened,"" said John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, a consumer organization based in Ottawa. ""The language seems to belie the rest of the report, which goes into some detail about how sales practices — which are a little unseemly — can be performed."" Go Public requested an interview with Morneau, but his spokesperson, Pierre-Olivier Herbert, said the minister was unavailable. In a statement, Herbert did not respond to Conacher's criticism that it ought to be considered inappropriate for the minister to receive a draft report from the banking regulator. A Finance Department spokesperson said it is routine for financial sector agencies to share documents for comment and to confirm facts. Go Public received various versions of the banking regulator's report, including several versions of the original draft, a revised copy after it went to the finance minister, and the final report.  Sentences, recommendations or conclusions are redacted in several drafts, based on an exemption in Canada's Access to Information Act that allows the head of a government institution to refuse to disclose any advice involving the institution or a federal cabinet minister. The exemption applies to advice or recommendations that occur at a ministerial level, essentially to allow confidentiality in the policy-making process. Go Public asked the minister about additions made after he had received a copy. In an email, Morneau's spokesperson wrote, ""the Minister's office did not provide comments or request any edits to the FCAC's report. The findings in the FCAC's report are entirely their own."" However, the documents indicate that Morneau's department made at least six comments on the first draft of the report, including about changing parts that say the regulator will introduce certain reforms to the regulator ""proposes"" them. Most of the comments from the department are redacted. ""The biggest thing is there were three recommendations saying banks should be 'required' to make changes,"" Conacher said. ""And those were all changed to 'suggestions' that the banks should do some things. ""Suggestions are meaningless, if you're actually trying to solve a problem. The banks don't have to do anything."" The draft sent to the minister's office included a line saying, ""Require banks to work in the best interests of their customers."" The line didn't make the final version of the report. Some other language that was critical of the banks — such as a line saying that banks ""lean disproportionately in favour of a sales driven culture"" — was also dropped before the report was published. Go Public checked the lobbyist registry to see how many times the banks or their umbrella group, the CBA, lobbied government officials, senators, MPs — including Morneau — the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and FCAC during the 12-month period between when the regulator announced it was conducting a bank review and the date it released its report. Between March 15, 2017, and March 20, 2018, the big banks and the CBA lobbied a total of 165 times. In the month leading up to the release of FCAC's report, the CBA met with the regulator's deputy commissioner, Brigitte Goulard, four times — including the day before the report was published. Lobbying is legal, but those who do significant amounts of it are required to file a record with the lobbying commissioner, who then makes the information public online. ""The banks — because they're an important economic asset to the country — have to be listened to,"" said the University of Manitoba's Paul Thomas. ""They have greater power, more influence than other actors in the policy field of banking. It's a fact of life."" As a comparison, Go Public asked four consumer advocacy organizations how many times they had the ear of lawmakers and banking watchdogs during the same period. In total, they had fewer than 10 meetings with policy-makers and FCAC to discuss the sales practices of banks, they said. ""It's extremely concerning to us, of course, that consumer groups are not more meaningfully supported to participate in these important conversations,"" wrote Ken Whitehurst, executive director of the Consumers Council of Canada. ""The council continues to have serious concerns about the resources available to facilitate meaningful consumer representation at not only FCAC but across government concerning consumer protection."" Thomas says after combing through the various versions of the bank regulator's report, the relationship between the banks, the government and the banking regulator can be difficult to figure out. ""The whole process is submerged. It's not transparent,"" he said.  ""If it hadn't been for Access to Information requests, we wouldn't know the extent to which the banks were given a certain privileged status in this process.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/fcac-bank-report-on-sales-tactics-weakened-1.5091115,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/banks-upselling-go-public-1.4023575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/td-tellers-desperate-to-meet-increasing-sales-goals-1.4006743 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/banks-consumers-sales-violations-1.4681705 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cibc-financial-advisor-reacts-to-fcac-report-bank-sales-culture-1.4625096,N/A
237,Anonymous,2020-01-24T12:44:56.522Z,Critics lambaste PCs for 'politicizing' SEED program,"Critics admonished the New Brunswick government for giving politicians more say in its provincial student employment program — influence, they say, that opens the door for abuse.  The Progressive Conservatives announced changes to the Student Employment Experience Development, or SEED, program that scrap the lottery for placement vouchers in favour of students applying directly to approved employers, which have been limited to non-profit organizations, First Nations and municipalities. Employers can apply for SEED funding, and each MLA, regardless of party affiliation, will be allowed to recommend 22 placements in their riding. Labour Minister Trevor Holder said earlier this week the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour will have the final say over employers, but critics believe putting politicians back in the process is wrong. Green Party Leader David Coon said he's ""very unhappy"" with the decision. ""It's patently unacceptable to involve MLAs in making decisions about summer student job funding,"" he told CBC News.  ""I fought hard in 2014 and early 2015 to convince the government of the day to replace that process and I was successful. They agreed with me that it had no place in modern day New Brunswick and now the [PC] government has brought it back."" Coon said there are no criteria for which employers can be recommended and history shows the program can be abused. ""In the bad old days, some of the worst examples that I heard about where some MLAs told non-profits that, you know, they would get the funding if they hired this person or that person should they get the funding,"" Coon said. He continued: ""I'm not saying the majority of MLAs are going to abuse it that way, but it opens it up to that and we've certainly seen it in the past."" The previous Liberal government installed a system in which high school and post-secondary students entered a draw for placement vouchers and interested employers would then have to find a student with a voucher. Liberal MLA Roger Melanson, a cabinet minister in the previous government, said Thursday it was designed to allow students to work in their field of study. Holder said that system meant some unlucky students never received a placement, and it also created a disadvantage for rural employers and some non-profits that relied on students to run summer programs because there weren't enough nearby students with vouchers. ""In my view we have finally taken the politics out of it and treated every region around the province equal, regardless of how the people in that area voted,"" Holder told reporters on Tuesday. ""And I think this will go a long way to de-politicizing this process."" The New Brunswick Student Alliance, which previously lobbied to have MLAs removed from the program, criticized the changes following the announcement, saying department officials were better suited at identifying job opportunities. In a followup statement, executive director KJ Conyers-Steede said the changes will limit the variety of available placements, especially those interested in the business sector.  He said the alliance was concerned with renewed political involvement and fewer placements overall. ""We view these changes as a step in the wrong direction by politicizing the post-secondary sector,"" the statement said. ""Student issues are being ignored and convoluted in a system that prioritizes political wins over resolving the real concerns of students."" Mario Levesque, a political science professor at Mount Allison University, said giving MLAs a voice in the process is ""simply wrong."" ""It does leave room for politics to enter the decision-making process again, which is unfortunate,"" Levesque said. 'I think that you would want to try to eliminate politics from it altogether.""  The labour minister said he trusts MLAs to understand their district's priorities and that it's part of the government's ""strategy to empower MLAs,"" but Levesque said that's ""silly."" ""MLAs here are having the power to choose the people and what positions [they] get in their own riding. That's political interference in the summer jobs program,"" he said. ""That should not be acceptable and not allowable at all. That's pure partisanship and, in our democratic society, wrong actually."" Both Levesque and Coon said the placements shouldn't be spread evenly throughout the province since there's more need in the cities.  The Green leader said it should be up to the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour to develop criteria for placements.  The PC changes also include fewer job placements — down 200 from the 1,400 jobs last summer. The Tories say that by keeping the budget steady at $5.5 million but focusing on non-profits and First Nations, there are fewer dollars to go around. The government covers 100 per cent of placements in those areas, whereas the private sector received a 50 per cent subsidy. Municipalities also take on half of the cost.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-student-jobs-mlas-political-interference-1.5438493,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/seed-program-changes-student-employment-1.5435534,N/A
238,Anonymous,2020-01-23T23:15:03.067Z,Quebec tightens rules on adventure tourism as search for snowmobilers continues,"Quebec announced stricter rules and mandatory training for tourism operators Thursday, as crews continue to search for five missing French nationals who fell through ice while snowmobiling with a guide on Lac Saint-Jean. Guides who lead excursions in off-road vehicles, including snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, will have to complete a mandatory training course before taking tourists out on an excursion. The tourists themselves will also need to complete a training course before being allowed to handle the vehicle. Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx said the announcement had been planned for several weeks, but she had never imagined it ""would happen in such a tragic context."" The guide, 42-year-old Benoît Lespérance from Montreal, was pulled out of the water by Alma firefighters. He died Wednesday morning. The French nationals were still missing Thursday evening, but police told reporters they would continue their search. The search continued on Friday. On Twitter, provincial police identified the missing French nationals as Yan Thierry, 24; Jean-René Dumoulin, 24; Arnaud Antoine, 25; Julien Benoît, 34; and Gilles Claude, 58.    ""Snowmobile excursions, canoe trips and ocean kayaking are all ways of appreciating Quebec's natural beauty,"" she said. ""But they must be rigorously regulated to ensure the safety of everyone participating, be they from Quebec or abroad."" Nature and adventure tourism operators will also need an accreditation from Aventure Écotourisme Québec if they wish to apply for funding from the Quebec government. Proulx said 135 businesses already have the accreditation, but hundreds of businesses do not. While she said it is impossible to promise that there will ever be ""no risk,"" Proulx said she hopes that accidents such as the one on Lac Saint-Jean ""don't happen again."" Meanwhile, authorities continue to search for the five French tourists who went missing after their snowmobiles fell through the ice of Lac Saint-Jean Tuesday night. Quebec provincial police deployed an additional diving team to the area Thursday, after two of the snowmobiles were found underwater Wednesday evening, at the mouth of La Grande Décharge — an outlet for Lac Saint-Jean. Police found four more snowmobiles underwater in the same area Thursday. Rescuers with specialized training to work on ice, snowmobile units and a drone joined the 30 police officers deployed to the scene. Sûreté du Québec and Canadian Armed Forces helicopters also circled the area. The tourists were part of a group of eight French nationals who, accompanied by their guide, attempted to cross a snow-covered channel between the towns of Saint-Henri-de-Taillon and Alma when the ice gave way beneath them. Three of the tourists were discharged from hospital on Wednesday. The other five are still missing.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/lac-st-jean-snowmobile-french-tourists-search-1.5437306,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/snowmobile-ice-fall-1.5435756,N/A
239,Isabella Zavarise,2020-01-22T22:05:48.609Z,"Charlottetown parkade expanding, but spots already spoken for","A parkade in Charlottetown will be expanding soon, but the company that manages the lot says those new spots are already spoken for. Construction is supposed to finish in June 2020, adding 100 spots to the Fitzroy parkade.  Ron Waite, general manager of the Charlottetown Area Development Corporation, said most of the spots have been reserved for developer Homburg International, which signed a contract with the city to accommodate the company's business tenants.  ""They paid over a million dollars … to build their project to ensure that there would be parking available for them,"" he said. Waite said the expansion at the Fitzroy parkade includes an addition that will extend onto Kent Street and a reconfiguration of the stalls, which he said will allow for more spaces. But Waite said even with the added stalls, many people are still going to be on the wait-list for monthly parking.  Waite said the three parkades the CADC manages downtown all have waiting lists, with some people waiting up to 10 years for a stall.  ""There's very little turnover in the parkade. 60 per cent of the parkade is monthly parkers. The other 40 per cent are for transient or daily — people that come in for short periods of time,"" he said. Waite said some parkades have stopped adding names to their wait-lists.  ""It makes no sense to put somebody on the wait-list in the Queen parkade where people have been on there for years,"" he said.  ""You're providing false hope by just putting them on the list."" Sam MacDonald recently moved into an apartment downtown that didn't come with a parking spot. MacDonald said he and his partner couldn't find anything close by and had to settle on a spot at a bed and breakfast.  ""We contacted everywhere we could think of. Nowhere has any spots. So we ended up having to crowdsource to even find a spot that's still about five, six blocks away,"" he said. He said the lack of available stalls could affect people in other ways as well.  ""I think that this is really going to impact people living in the downtown core moving here if they need to be close to their work, such as myself,"" he said. Steve Bellamy, CEO at the Confederation Centre, said finding parking downtown can be difficult for the hundreds of staff that work at the centre.  ""We employ between 100 and 200 people in the winter and in the summer that number grows to around 400,"" he said. ""So certainly parking for our employees can be challenging. The parkades though provide some relief, but they're even not enough with regular business downtown."" Waite said he regularly hears about these issues, and the CADC is working with the city to come up with long-term solutions. ""It's a huge undertaking because you have to consult so many people and clearly it's a combination of what's the long-term demand and what's the price point people are prepared to pay,"" he said. Charlottetown CAO Peter Kelly said the city is looking at a range of options to create more parking, from building a new parkade, to working with private-sector stakeholders on making other parking spaces available.  The cost of one spot at the Queen, Pownal and Fitzroy parkades is $100 per month before tax — something Waite said is underpriced compared to other municipalities in the region.  ""The city actually subsidizes parking to a certain extent so it's never pleasant to say the parking should cost more,"" he said. ""And that in itself I think would drive down the demand a little bit. But if you want to add capacity, it's a very significant cost."" He said the project will cost just under $3 million, with the city contributing approximately $500,000 to the project. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-fitzroy-parkade-expansion-2020-1.5435145,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-strategic-parking-plan-for-downtown-charlottetown-in-the-works-1.5263391 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-snow-removal-parking-charlottetown-businesses-1.5435063,N/A
240,Kate Porter,2020-01-24T15:38:42.696Z,Ottawa transit boss 'concerned' by frequency of LRT foul-ups,"Ottawa's transit boss has often said he expected the city's four-month-old LRT system to suffer growing pains, but John Manconi admitted Thursday even he's surprised by how frequently serious flaws have been cropping up. ""All these things — door issues, flats, slippage — those are all normal. The issue is the frequency,"" transportation general manager, John Manconi, told an emergency meeting of the transit commission. On Monday, consultants from JBA Corp. will arrive to tackle a long list of problems, and to look at how Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM) has been handling them. Outside experts an 'important step' toward LRT fix, transit GM promises The tipping point for Manconi came New Year's Eve, he said. Following a ""good run"" that lasted several weeks, trains suddenly trains lost power just as the free holiday service was beginning. It turned out the electrical apparatus on the train rooftop was caked in carbon and salt that had dripped from road overpasses. RTM stepped up its cleaning regimen as a result. But it turned out to be just the first of many problems to beset the LRT in the new year. Here's some of what transit commissioners learned Wednesday during a special meeting called to discuss the issues. Transit managers can't remember this ever happening on the north-south Trillium Line, but many new electric Alstom trains on the Confederation Line are suddenly developing flat spots on their steel wheels. ""You would hear an audible noise when you're riding the train. It would be a repetitive thump,"" RTM's Peter Lauch explained. RTM employees are working day and night at the garage to scrape the wheels over lathes and make them round again. At one point, 13 trains had ""wheel flats"", said Lauch. Wheels were the single biggest reason for this week's shortage of trains. Braking hard and skidding even once can cause a wheel to lose its roundness, explained Matthew Slade, who works on Ottawa's LRT for Rideau Transit partner EllisDon. The safety system could be triggering emergency brakes, he posited. ""The likelihood of the wheels locking up is higher in winter. Same with your car, when there's snow on the ground your [anti-lock brakes] will operate when you come to a stop more frequently,"" Slade said. We've had a shortage of working trains in the past week, with the worst day seeing just eight trains carrying passengers during the morning rush hour, instead of the usual 13.  The $2.1 billion contract for Stage 1 included 34 vehicles, coupled into pairs to form a fleet of 17 trains. So where are they? On Thursday, transit staff confirmed that all 17 were ready for service when the city accepted the new train system last August. All have been out on the line at some point. At any given time, however, three trains are being worked on in some way, including one undergoing serious maintenance. ""Right now, the one that's in heavy maintenance is literally up on jacks,"" said Lauch. That leaves 13 usually available for rush-hour service, plus one in reserve. And while the morning and afternoon peak periods have so far operated with 13 trains, the goal is to soon increase that to 14. Five times in January, switches that allow trains to move between tracks had problems, which caused train delays for riders. French train-maker Alstom is responsible for the switches. ""The majority of the issues we've had have been weather-related,"" explained Lauch. When a storm is at its height, ice gets packed between the rail and the moving piece, called a tongue. Manconi expects the external rail experts will look at improving the electric heaters at the switches. Councillors asked about the Trillium Line, which doesn't experience such issues, and learned those switch heaters are powered by natural gas or propane. They may also be of a higher quality. There have been mounting calls for some of those in charge at city hall to lose their jobs over the LRT mess. Earerlis this week, citizen transit commissioner Leah Williams told CBC she thinks it should be Manconi who resigns. But Manconi and his team ""aren't going anywhere,"" according to city manager Steve Kanellakos, Manconi's boss. He praised and defended Manconi and his team, saying ""they're pulling miracles out there."" If councillors someone should take the fall, Kanellakos said it should be him. ""If you're taking out leadership, you take out me. I am ultimately accountable. Look at the [organizational] chart and you'll see my face on it. I'm accountable to council — I'm your only employee.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/reasons-for-problems-ottawa-light-rail-lrt-1.5438541,[],N/A
241,Anna Desmarais,2020-01-23T15:05:15.057Z,Hay River to host N.W.T.'s 1st Arctic Winter Games archery trials,"Twenty archers in the Northwest Territories are set to compete in Hay River this weekend for a spot in the Arctic Winter Games' first archery competition. Archery isn't an official sport of the games, but it could become one. The Arctic Winter Games International Committee is interested in incorporating other events, so for these games, for the first time, they approached a host city about their regionally important sports.  Ian Legaree, the technical director of the Arctic Winter Games' International Committee, said Sport Yukon and members of the Whitehorse Host Society in 2017 recommended adding archery and freestyle skiing to the 2020 sports roster. Legaree said the board chose to add archery because both small and large communities were interested in the sport. No one had recommended archery prior to 2017 because, as Legaree put it, it's still an emerging sport across Canada.  In an email to CBC News, a spokesperson for the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games confirmed that this will be the first time for archery in the games. So far, five regions out of nine have said they will be sending a team of archers to Whitehorse, including Northern Alberta, the N.W.T, and Yukon.  Greenland and the Yamal region of Russia will also send archers to this year's games. The N.W.T.'s team will be decided this weekend, after archers compete for the highest number of points over two rounds. Athletes at the trials will shoot 30 arrows each per round (known as a 300 round). The closer they get to the bull's-eye, the more points they get. Athletes will also be evaluated on their attitude and coachability.  At the Arctic Winter Games, the archers will compete over multiple days in individual and mixed team events, followed by a head-to-head elimination round.  Over the last eight to nine years, archery has been rising in popularity in the N.W.T., said Aaron Wells, executive director of Aboriginal Sports Circle NWT. To boost participation in the sport, the Aboriginal Sports Circle has held archery workshops in partnership with schools and gym teachers in all 33 N.W.T. communities.   This is not the first time the territory has sent archers to important sporting events. N.W.T. archers have participated in the North American Indigenous Games for at least a decade, and last year, four young archery athletes represented the territory for the first time at the Canada Winter Games.  Wells said archery has roots in Indigenous communities in the North — hunters used it to sustain their families.  ""There's always been some sort of interest in … bow hunting for generations in the territory,"" he said. Wells said the expected turnout of 20 athletes for this weekend's trials in Hay River is a good starting point that could show the international community that there's interest in archery.  Archery has been tentatively selected as a sport for the 2022 Arctic Winter Games in Wood Buffalo, Alta.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-archery-trials-nwt-1.5437084,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/n-w-t-archery-tournament-takes-aim-at-growing-the-sport-in-the-north-1.4710270 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/awg-dog-mushing-future-northwest-territories-1.5364048,N/A
242,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-07T18:30:27.851Z,'A slap in the face': Little-known rule says airline can keep your money without delivering what you pay for,"A Calgary-area couple is fuming after paying Air Canada hundreds of dollars for an upgraded flight package, then being told a little-known rule allows the airline to keep their money without delivering on what it advertised. Instead, the airline offered Linda and Rick Borsato 20 per cent off a flight within the next year. ""You're treated like you're an afterthought,"" said Linda. ""'We have your money and sorry you weren't happy. Maybe we'll do better next time. Here's a discount.' That's a slap in the face."" Aviation experts say airlines can upsell passengers without being obligated to deliver or to pay compensation — because the industry's regulator lets them make their own rules outlining their obligations to passengers during a flight. ""It's not really fair,"" says Prof. John Gradek, who lectures about aviation management at McGill University in Montreal.  ""Unfortunately, that's the conditions by which the Canadian Transportation Agency has allowed the airlines to promote their fares."" Go Public found WestJet, and some U.S. airlines like American Airlines and Delta have similar rules as Air Canada. Air Canada and WestJet both say they deal with such situations on a case-by-case basis.  On a trip to Hawaii in April, the Borsatos paid $519 extra to upgrade from the airline's ""basic"" economy fare to ""comfort"" economy, which includes advance seat selection. That was the selling point for Rick, who is six feet, four inches tall and wanted more legroom. Air Canada changed their itinerary three times after the Boeing 737 Max was grounded in March.  But it wasn't until the Borsatos arrived at the airport on April 13, that they discovered they'd be getting fewer than half of the extras they bought. The airline didn't deliver on the advance seating, the early boarding or the complimentary alcoholic beverage — though the couple was able to check their first bag for free and got extra travel points. The Borsatos say an Air Canada agent told them they could get a refund when they returned home. But their refund claim was rejected based on a set of rules that Air Canada wrote itself, and which passengers automatically agree to when they book. The airline's Rule 30 says services that are part of a fare package, like the one the Borsatos purchased, are ""not guaranteed,"" and ""no compensation will be offered for their unavailability."" ""I just can't wrap my head around how that happens,"" Rick said. ""We've paid them for a service and didn't get it, but they've written [this rule] in such a way that they don't owe us anything. What other industry can do that?"" The airline won't disclose how often passengers don't get the services they pay for under the various fare packages. In an email to Go Public, spokesperson Angela Mah says Air Canada ""always makes every effort to ensure that services are provided to the best of its abilities."" She added that the ""no compensation"" clause was included in the rules ""for additional clarity."" Compensation is handled on a ""case-by-case basis,"" she said.  After the couple escalated their complaint to Air Canada management, the airline upped its offer by adding a $200 coupon to the 20 per cent discount. They declined that offer. ""We don't want to travel with Air Canada knowing that we can pay for a service that they don't have to provide us and that they don't have to refund our money,"" Linda said. The Borsatos complained on May 27 to the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA), the industry regulator which decides whether an airline's rules are reasonable, and has the authority to force airlines to drop or amend rules. The Borsatos' complaint is among 33 filed over Air Canada's Rule 30 since the CTA began tracking disputes related to the rule two years ago. In its nine-page response to the Borsatos' complaint, Air Canada says Rule 30 is ""reasonable,"" and that the complaint should be dismissed because the grounding of the 737 Max planes was out of Air Canada's control. The Borsatos say they understand operational issues come up, but say Air Canada shouldn't be able to keep the money if the purchased services can't be provided. After Go Public contacted the airline, it agreed to issue a full refund, but only if the Borsatos signed a confidentiality agreement and drop their complaint with the CTA. The couple refused. Mah, the spokesperson, said ""such agreements are common in business during dispute resolutions.""  It's common for airlines to advertise certain perks but not deliver on some or any of them without compensating passengers, according to Prof. Brent Bowen from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.  ""Most of the travelling public is not aware of it,"" said Bowden, who has been running an online study on airline quality for years.  ""This is how the airlines have gone from rags to riches in the past decade … they unbundle everything and don't really reduce the ticket cost to you."" He says occasional travellers should be wary of booking bundled fares that promise — but don't guarantee — extras, because they'll rarely get their money's worth. Air Canada started offering bundled fare packages in 2003 and it expanded and renamed the packages last year.  Fare packages aren't addressed under Canada's new Air Passenger Protection Regulations, which kicked in July 15. But they should be, according to Ian Jack of the Canadian Automobile Association, who had input into the new regulations through the government's various consultations with stakeholders.  The new regulations are ""not perfect"" and fare packages are ""one area for future improvement"" Jack said.  Officials should improve ""the way that various fare classes are advertised and… [how] carriers to make clear what you're getting."" In the meantime, the Borsatos hope the CTA will force Air Canada to drop or modify Rule 30, and want their refund with no strings attached. Their case is still under review.  ""How many people aren't getting what they're paying for?"" Linda Borsato asks. ""That's why we pursued this and are following through on it… either way we have nothing to lose now."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-rule-30-fare-classes-1.5304450,[],N/A
243,Leah Hendry,2020-01-23T18:33:15.813Z,Montreal woman alleges negligence at group home put her autistic sister in danger,"A Montreal woman said she feels betrayed by health authorities for leaving the recently hired manager of her autistic sister's group home in place despite what she alleges are serious incidents of negligence. The specialized group home, located in Montreal's Saint-Laurent borough, is for people with mental disabilities, autism and complex behavioural issues. Electra Dalamagas's sister has been living there for more than a decade. Last December, a new manager took over the group home and brought in new staff. To help her sister adjust to the change, Dalamagas visited regularly and took her on outings. During those visits, she noticed a growing number of problems.  Dalamagas alleges staff made errors in the administration of medication — both with the timing, frequency and combinations of drugs — as well as with the charting of her sister's other health data, such as bowel movements, nutrition and sleep. When she pointed out the errors to the new staff, she said nothing changed. Her concerns peaked after returning to the home from an outing in late December. Dalamagas said she was helping her sister in the bathroom when she found oven cleaner in an unlocked cabinet. ""You should not have these things lying around because a client could spill it on themselves or decide to drink it,"" said Dalamagas. She questioned the only employee on site, who had been left alone to run the home at that time, but she said the woman appeared to have a cognitive impairment and didn't seem to understand Dalamagas's concern. ""If there's a fire, if somebody bolts — because some of our guys are runners — that woman won't be able to stop them,"" said Dalamagas, an advocate at Autisme Montreal who is also a trained social worker. ""My faith, confidence and trust was completely shattered that night."" The home is part of a network of group homes run by a non-profit agency, Miriam Home and Services. Believing that the health and safety of all the clients at the group home were in jeopardy and u​​​nable to reach a manager at Miriam Home over the Christmas break, Dalamagas went to the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal, the health and social services authority which oversees Miriam. She demanded the contract of the newly hired group home manager be cancelled. ""I'm like, what are you waiting for, a coroner's inquest?"" Dalamagas said she asked the health authority. ""This is folly. Nobody's overseeing anything."" A few days after she lodged her complaint, Dalamagas learned that another group home worker had recorded a cellphone video of her sister, naked on the toilet, and had shown it to other people. With that, Dalamagas had had enough, and she temporarily removed her sister from the home to ensure her safety. ""Why would you film somebody naked — somebody so vulnerable?"" asks a mortified Dalamagas. She said she believes that worker took the video out of spite, because she'd made the complaint. ""It's a breach of trust."" Dalamagas said her sister's group home had been well-run for a decade. The former manager and most of her staff had years of experience working at schools for people with special needs, she said. They all spoke English, which helped them build relationships with the clients, offer structure and diffuse behavioural problems. But last spring that manager gave her notice, leaving Miriam Home and Services seven months to find a replacement for her and her staff. Dalamagas said she helped persuade one of the day staff to stay on for a few months to help ease the transition to a new team. The new manager, James Marcellin, is francophone and speaks English poorly, said Dalamagas. The French-speaking staff he hired to work evenings, nights and weekends also have limited English, she said, making it difficult for them to communicate with the mostly non-verbal clients, who are anglophones. The families were promised the manager would be on site daily, but Dalamagas said he rarely showed up. Occasionally, staff would ask her to pick up items for the home — something that should be the manager's job, she said. Dalamagas said she was worried about the effect all the changes were having on her sister, who is non-verbal but was crying more often and having more frequent staring spells and problems sleeping — and had other ways of signalling her unhappiness. ""My sister was locking her coat and boots in the locker at her day activities and refusing to leave,"" said Dalamagas. ""She did not want to go back to the home."" Dalamagas said she'd expected there would be challenges with the transition to a new group of caregivers, but what she could not tolerate was her sister being left in what she saw as an unsafe environment. After the incident with the oven cleaner, Dalamagas met with the health authority and Miriam staff on Jan. 7. She outlined everything she had witnessed. She blamed Miriam for hiring the manager in the first place and not properly monitoring the transition. Dalamagas suggested to officials the names of two other workers who could take over the group home, who were used to working with a special needs clientele. ""They told me, no, they wanted to continue working with the current manager,"" she said. ""I will never forgive that,"" she said. ""Clients shouldn't be hostages to contracts."" Following her meeting, Dalamagas said she was told Miriam staff did an unannounced spot check. But that happened during the day, on a day that the only worker left from the previous administration was present. Dalamagas said she had been promised her complaint would be kept confidential. But the next time Dalamagas visited her sister's group home, she said the staff member on duty greeted her rudely and spoke to her in an angry, scolding way. She suspected that person knew it was her who had complained. The following day, the same staff member wouldn't let her in the home until she phoned the group home manager. Once she learned about the video that was taken of her sister on Jan. 10, Dalamagas said there was no going back. She alerted the health authority and asked again that the manager's contract be cancelled immediately. She also alerted the provincial Ministry of Health and Social Services. Dalamagas said she was later told by administrators that the employee who took the video had been fired. She said they told her while the incident was ""proof of poor judgment,"" no malice had been intended — that the employee had only wanted to take a picture of the broken toilet. With her sister temporarily under her care, Dalamagas said she didn't hear back from the health authority for a full week. On Jan. 17, she was told there would be a month-long administrative investigation that would either lead to recommendations for improvements at the home or the cancellation of the manager's contract. In the meantime, the manager remains in place. ""The trust is completely broken,"" she said. In a statement, the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal said it followed the rules and regulations when it hired the manager. In an email, CIUSSS spokesperson Barry Morgan said the transition had been quick because the agency wanted a new manager to step in as soon as possible. He said the new manager had only been away for four days during the holiday period and had been covered by a staff member used to working at the group home. Morgan said the reported allegations were taken very seriously and resulted in immediate action. He said there are two separate investigations now underway. He did not provide specific details about what issues are being examined. He said those investigations are expected to be completed by the beginning of February. ""The quality of the services that are provided by CIUSSS West-Central Montreal and the safety and well-being of our users are the focus of our concerns,"" Morgan said. ""Thus, appropriate measures are always implemented to ensure that vulnerable individuals in our facilities receive services of superior quality in a safe and secure environment."" Morgan said no further comments would be made due to confidentiality and to ensure the integrity of the investigations. When CBC called the group home manager, Marcellin, he declined to comment, citing the investigation which is underway. The Quebec Health and Social Services Ministry told CBC in an email it is aware of the situation and is following the investigations closely. ""No situation of mistreatment is tolerated,"" said Marie-Claude Lacasse, a ministry spokesperson. Liberal critic Jennifer Maccarone said Dalamagas's experience shows that instead of protecting the most vulnerable, the government is protecting the people it hires to oversee, staff and run these group homes. Maccarone is the mother of two autistic children, one who just recently celebrated her 18th birthday. She said she is worried about the challenges new adults on the autism spectrum face once they transition from the youth system, into the adult sector, which she says offers a ""desert"" of services. Last fall, she unsuccessfully tried to convince the Legault government to hold a parliamentary commission on services for people with autism, particularly when they reach the age of majority.  ""I am scared because I would not send my children to a place like this where I wouldn't even send my dog,"" said Maccarone. ""It is ridiculous and unconscionable for me to think that we don't have the time to talk about what's happening on the ground and hear from the people who are living these situations like Ms. Dalamagas and her sister."" Dalamagas's sister remains in her care. ""I feel betrayed,"" Dalamagas said. ""Instead of protecting clients, the agency is protecting the caregiver.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-woman-alleges-negligence-at-autistic-sister-s-group-home-1.5435203,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/a-cut-to-the-most-vulnerable-day-program-for-disabled-adults-drops-older-clients-1.4407806 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/outcry-over-service-cuts-for-severely-disabled-unreasonable-says-health-authority-senior-manager-1.4418696,N/A
244,Jacques Poitras,2020-01-24T09:00:00.517Z,Maritime Iron proposes others claw back emissions to offset its high-pollution plant,"The company pitching a high-pollution iron plant in northern New Brunswick says the provincial government should get other industries and emitters to cut their emissions to accommodate the new facility. Maritime Iron acknowledges in its environmental impact assessment document that ""implementing the project will make it difficult for New Brunswick to achieve its current aspirational climate change goal"" once the plant begins operating in 2022.  But the company boldly proposes that the province simply encourage other emitters to scale back their emissions enough to stay on target. ""Before 2030, New Brunswick would need to identify opportunities to meet this target through reductions across all sectors, including continued efforts and cooperation by the industrial sector as well as reductions in the transportation and electricity sectors,"" the document says. The document says the proposed plant, which would process iron ore into pig iron, would create a net increase of 2.3 million tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions, which is partly funded by large energy producers and users.  How the province would find corresponding reductions elsewhere isn't clear. ""Will it need to reach down into the refinery and reduce greenhouse gases there? Will it have to reach down into the forest sector and reduce emissions there?"" asked Lois Corbett of the Conservation Council of New Brunswick. ""Where will those other tonnes, millions of tonnes, come from?""  The province's legislated emissions goal for this year is 14.8 million tonnes, and for 2030 it's 10.7 million tonnes. It also has a second, less stringent 2030 goal, 14.1 million tonnes, tied to Canada's Paris climate plan objectives.  New Brunswick's emissions in 2017 were 14.3 million tonnes, below the legislated 2020 target and close to the 2030 Paris target. To stay close to those targets would require offsetting Maritime Iron's 2.3 million tonnes of net emissions increases. To put that in perspective, the required offset represents three-quarters of what the Irving Oil refinery emits in greenhouse gases annually, about three million tonnes. The offset would be nine times what J.D. Irving's four biggest polluting plants put out. Three JDI mills and its Atlantic Wallboard plant emitted 259,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2017. Maritime Iron did not respond to a request for comment. While the company is calling for reductions in industrial, transportation and electricity sectors to make room for its increased emissions, the head of a Saint John energy think-tank says industry has already done its part. ""To date, from 2005 to 2020, most of the heavy lifting, the reductions, have been on the backs of oil refining and electricity generation,"" said Colleen d'Entremont, president of the Atlantica Energy Centre, which is funded by large energy producers and users. ""Now is the time, from 2020 to 2030, for the rest of the sectors to try and make the same gains,"" she said. Most of New Brunswick's emissions reductions since 2005 have been attributed to the closures of large forestry mills and power plants. D'Entremont said there have been ""very, very few gains"" reducing emissions from transportation, including cars and buses, during the same period. Those emissions were four million tonnes in 2017. Last year, Irving Oil's director of growth and strategy Andy Carson told a Senate committee there was ""a role for us to play"" in reducing emissions and fighting climate change. He called it ""a very, very significant and important issue"" for the province's only oil refiner. But in December 2019 Reuters news agency reported that the company had quietly dropped its goal of reducing carbon emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by this year. The company did not respond to a request for comment on Maritime Iron's suggestion about reduced emissions among industrial plants.  JDI vice-president Mary Keith said in an email the company's mills have already exceeded both 2030 reduction targets and the company's forestry operations are a carbon sink, with trees absorbing more carbon dioxide than mills emit.  She said the company would not comment on Maritime Iron's proposal other than to suggest that a federal plan to plant more than two million trees could help offset the iron plant's emissions. D'Entremont said Maritime Iron represents ""a really good test case"" of whether the province can increase economic activity and create jobs while also hitting emissions targets. ""How are we as a collective going to address the fact that carbon emissions are going to go up?"" she said. ""What other activities do we have going on that are going to reduce them in other ways?"" She called for the province to fund more technology that would allow ""all of us"" to reduce emissions and said small nuclear reactors and NB Power's proposed smart meters could play a role. This week, MLAs on a legislative committee voted to amend the government's carbon-pricing bill for large industry to tie it to the more stringent legislated targets. The amended bill now says explicitly the pricing system's goal is to regulate emissions ""in order to facilitate the achievement"" of the targets. Maritime Iron proposes to link its iron plant to NB Power's generating station so it can sell gas byproduct to the generating station, allowing it to cut its use of coal. The two facilities combined would emit 4.9 million tonnes of greenhouse gases, or 2.3 million more than what Belledune now emits on its own.  The company argues that Maritime Iron's location will reduce shipping distances for both raw iron ore and finished pig iron, lowering emissions from ocean-going freighters. That and the company's new processing technology will contribute to global emissions reductions even while increasing emissions in New Brunswick, the company says. The existing federal climate plan doesn't allow provinces to get credit for emissions created outside their boundaries, and no international credit-trading regime exists.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-plant-emissions-proposal-1.5438667,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/maritime-iron-eia-carbon-emissions-nb-power-belledune-1.5433510 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-oil-carbo-pledge-1.5405518,N/A
245,Tony Seskus,2020-01-22T04:02:22.991Z,"Cash-strapped rural Alberta 'can't wring money' from struggling oil and gas firms, premier says","Premier Jason Kenney urged rural municipalities to work with the province to help struggling oil and gas companies Tuesday, adding they can't get ""money from a stone."" He made the comments following a survey that said the oil and gas sector owes $173 million in unpaid taxes to rural municipalities — more than double since a similar report was done last spring. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Kenney said the sector has seen a few bankruptcies in the past year while other companies are barely hanging on. ""You can't wring money from a stone,"" Kenney said, suggesting that could be the case for a number of smaller natural gas producers who are having trouble right now. ""The best solution, in our view, is to create a future for those companies that are struggling."" Rural Municipalities Alberta (RMA) distributed a survey of its members Monday that showed the amount of unpaid taxes from oil and gas companies had grown by 114 per cent since a similar survey last March. Years of low oil prices have left many small producers in dire straits but rural communities say those unpaid taxes are leaving significant holes in their budgets. The RMA said legislative gaps make it difficult to recover lost taxes from energy companies. When an oil and gas company goes bust, municipalities rank below regulators as creditors, the association said. Al Kemmere, president of the RMA, told CBC News Tuesday he will meet with the provincial minister of municipal affairs next month to discuss the situation. Asked about the premier's comments, Kemmere agreed there needs to be discussion about solutions, but cautioned rural municipalities only have so much flexibility under the Municipal Government Act. ""We are also in a very limited scope of what we can do, too, because [while] other levels of government can … build a deficit into their budget, we cannot,"" Kemmere said. ""That limits us again on what we can do and how we can find solutions. We either balance a budget every year or we are in contempt of our own act."" Kenney said rural municipalities have the legal ability to take action when taxes go unpaid. But Kemmere maintained they don't have that authority other than through the civil courts — something he said could be ""really messy"" and puts risk on taxpayers. On Tuesday, Kenney was asked how the province would find a balance between the rural municipalities and the industry. He said he didn't view them as competing priorities but competing realities.  ""On the one part, the municipalities need the revenue and they have every right to assess it and and to seek to collect it — they have the legal right to collect it,"" Kenney said.  ""But for companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, they have no cash and very little in the way of assets. There's not a lot to go after. ""So I would just say with the municipalities, you know, work with us to try to create the best conditions to turn that economic situation around."" The industry is seeking reforms to how taxes are assessed on oil and gas companies. Properties are assessed by the provincial government, which evaluates them on replacement cost and not on market value, Ben Brunnen, vice president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said Monday. ""What we're seeing is a need to update the way our assets are valued inside municipalities,"" he told CBC News. ""If we do that, we'll find a way for companies to then … perhaps invest more because the economics are better over the long term and our industry will come out stronger."" On Monday, Ponoka County Reeve Paul McLauchlin said about 40 per cent of unpaid taxes are from severely distressed companies in an industry hard and widely hit by lower resource prices. The rest of the shortfall is from companies that continue to operate but don't pay. ""My personal opinion is that this is a tax revolt,"" McLauchlin told Canadian Press. ""They are using this as a lever to decrease their assessment and change those costs."" A group concerned about the unpaid taxes, the Alberta Liabilities Disclosure Project, is planning a protest outside the McDougall Centre in downtown Calgary on Wednesday.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/kenney-oil-and-gas-taxes-1.5435254,[],N/A
246,Jason Warick,2020-01-22T12:00:00.202Z,Proposed oil project in northwest Saskatchewan generates controversy,"A proposed oil project in northwest Saskatchewan is fueling controversy. Calgary-based Serafina Energy plans to extract 8,000 barrels of oil per day near Glenbogie, which is near the town of St. Walburg about 250 kilometres northwest of Saskatoon. The Serafina Glenbogie SAGD project will require nearly five million litres of water per day from the North Saskatchewan River. The provincial government said the project does not require an environmental impact assessment, according to a Ministry of Environment document. That's not sitting well with Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation Chief Ron Mitsuing. He said the project must not go ahead until their questions are answered around water use, waste water and other issues. ""Not right now, until all the concerns are met. For sure, the water and how it's going to affect our lakes. Everything that happens there is going to flow directly to our lakes,"" Mitsuing said. Grant Ferguson, an associate professor at the University of Saskatchewan's Global Institute for Water Security, said more testing should be done before resource projects such as Serafina's are approved. He said there also needs to be a broader public debate over the best uses for Saskatchewan's finite fresh water supplies. The government document said the water taken represents 0.03 per cent of the river's total flow. Ferguson noted that amount will be taken out of the water cycle daily for 20 years and that while the Serafina project is large, it's one of many oil and gas projects removing fresh water from the system. ""At the end of the day, that water is not going back into the hydrological cycle,"" he said. The proposed project will extract oil through a relatively new but increasingly popular method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). It's used for solid bitumen deposits which can't easily be pumped to the surface through previous cold water methods. With SAGD, steam is injected hundreds of metres underground and let out through pipes running horizontally through the desired layer of bitumen rock. The bitumen melts and seeps into another pipe, and is then pumped to the surface for processing. The waste water will be injected into the ground. That's a common method, but in the Estevan region and other jurisdictions the water is released much deeper. Many of the regulations are federal and provincial, but some of the approvals were granted at the local level. The rural municipality of Frenchman Butte approved Serafina's water intake proposal and its plan to construct a thermal plant, subject to a number of conditions. When asked if the RM supports the overall project, RM Reeve Bonnie Mills Midgley said the approval process ""speaks for itself."" Mills Midgley said she and her council may have more detailed comments following a meeting later this week. Serafina spokesman Chris Bartole said a small initial drill is underway and will be reclaimed immediately afteward. Bartole said the regulatory process is continuing and they continue to engage with Indigenous communities. ""Our objective has always been to respond meaningfully to any concerns brought to Serafina's attention by First Nation and Métis communities. He said there's no set date for construction of the main project. The work done on the Glenbogie project is ""the most comprehensive assessment ever conducted for this type of development in Saskatchewan."" He said much of the land selected has been recently harvested by the forestry industry or approved for future harvest, and they've taken special precautions to protect groundwater. CBC News also requested interviews with officials from the provincial government and the town of St. Walburg. Neither request was granted. Ferguson said the oil and gas industry has a long history in the province and has provided many jobs. That's made government regulators comfortable, even ""complacent,"" about the environmental effects, he said. ""We've gone forward with these things without ever really going through the rigorous environmental assessments done in other places,"" he said. ""We do need better baseline information."" The drilling area includes several plant species deemed ""extremely rare,"" such as Michigan moonwort, white bog adder's mouth and smooth wild rose, according to the Ministry of Environment document. To minimize impact, Serafina is promising to start construction outside of growing season and to preserve topsoil for replanting. Part of the project is located on pasture or crop land, and the rest is within the Bronson Provincial Forest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/oil-project-generates-controverst-1.5434928,[],N/A
247,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:39:43.999Z,Milos Raonic scores straight-sets victory over Tsitsipas at Australian Open ,"On a day of upsets at the Australian Open, Canada's Milos Raonic did his part to keep the storyline going. The No. 32 seed from Thornhill, Ont., beat No. 6 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (2) in a third-round match on Friday at the season's first Grand Slam. Tsitsipas was one of several big names to be eliminated Friday. Serena Williams' bid to win a record 24th Grand Slam was halted with a loss to Wang Qiang of China and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka of Japan fell short against 15-year-old American Coco Gauff. Swiss legend Roger Federer barely survived, winning a fifth-set tiebreak against Australian John Millman. Raonic, 29, has been plagued by injuries in recent years, missing large portions of the second half of last season with a back issue. Prior to his victories this week, Raonic hadn't won a match since October. ""I think I have had a sense that tennis could come together if I could put the work in behind it, and I think all those pieces today came together,"" said Raonic, who hasn't dropped a set this week. WATCH | 'Milos masterclass': Raonic advances to 4th round: ""I was very happy with the outcome on court."" Raonic was excellent with his hard serve, the biggest strength of his game. He had 19 aces and just one double fault while not facing a single break point. When he got his first serve in (65 per cent), Raonic won 89 per cent of points. A career-best world No. 3 in 2016, Raonic has slipped to 35th while battling injuries and inconsistent results. He said it took time to heal his ailing back, including a period of about a month where he didn't serve. ""It allowed me to focus on other things and put other things together and get stronger, get fitter,"" Raonic said. WATCH | Federer survives 5-setter: Tsitsipas, 21, is considered one of the rising stars of the game, but has struggled at recent Grand Slams. He lost in the first round at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year before his third-round exit this week. Tsitsipas' best showing at a Grand Slam was a semifinal appearance at last year's Australian Open. Raonic, who hadn't faced Tsitsipas before Friday, compared his play to his effort in a three-set loss against then-No. 5 Dominic Thiem late last year at the Paris Masters. ""I created so many opportunities for myself (against Thiem), but I didn't have the chance to prepare like I did here,"" he said. Raonic has played some of the best tennis of his career at the Melbourne major. This marks the fifth time in the past six years Raonic has advanced to at least the fourth round. He has had three quarter-final appearances and one semifinal showing since 2015. ""I have always somehow figured out how to put it together here, especially if I have had the freedom to train well,"" Raonic said. Raonic is the only Canadian remaining in the singles draw after Denis Shapovalov, Felix Auger-Aliassime, Vasek Pospisil and Leylah Annie Fernandez all lost in the first round. Raonic will next play Marin Cilic of Croatia, who upset No. 9 seed Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in a tight five-set match. The 39th-ranked Cilic is 3-1 against Raonic lifetime, but the Canadian won the only meeting on an outdoor hardcourt. Raonic said he expects a tough match. ""I think we're both going to be trying to move the other guy around, be the one dictating,"" Raonic said. ""It's going to be important for me to get ahead early in the points, take care of my serve, and be the aggressor."" Meanwhile, Ottawa's Gabriela Dabrowski and Finland's Henri Kontinen advanced to the second round of mixed doubles. The No. 3 seeds beat Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic and Kevin Krawietz of Germany 6-2, 6-4. Dabrowski is back on the court for a women's doubles second-round match with Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia on Saturday. Vancouver's Vasek Pospisil and Hubert Hurkracz of Poland lost 6-4, 6-4 to the British men's doubles team of Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski, the No. 14 seeds, in a first-round match. Serena Williams' bid to win a 24th Grand Slam title has been falling short with losses in finals. At this Australian Open, she didn't make it nearly that far. Serving only so-so, failing to convert all but one of her break chances and missing groundstrokes with alarming regularity, Williams stunningly exited in the third round at Melbourne Park, beaten 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 by 27th-seeded Wang Qiang of China on Friday. Williams was broken in the final game, fittingly ending things with a backhand into the net. That was her 27th unforced error on the backhand side, part of a total of 56 miscues. Wang made only 20. Williams owns seven trophies from the year's first major championship and this was her earliest defeat there since also bowing out in the third round all the way back in 2006. WATCH | Wang Qiang upsets Serena Williams on Day 5: Here is just one measure of how unexpected this result was: The only other time these two women faced each other came at the U.S. Open last September — the only Slam quarterfinal appearance of Wang's career — and Williams needed all of 44 minutes to dominate her way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory. The total points were 50 to 15. Wang quickly surpassed those game and point totals Friday, thanks in large part to nearly flawless play in the first set. After a third-round loss, former No. 1 and 2018 Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki is headed into retirement.  Wozniacki lost her match 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 to Tunisia's Ons Jabeur.  The 29-year-old from Denmark previously said that this year's Australian Open would be her last tournament before focusing on life off the court.  In October 2018, she announced that she has rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition that can cause pain and swelling in the wrist and other joints. Wozniacki said she isn't retiring for health reasons, but to start a family with her husband and raise awareness about rheumatoid arthritis. WATCH | Wozniacki heads into retirement after 3rd-round loss:  The top-ranked Aussie, Ash Barty, was the first player to secure a spot in the fourth round of the Australian Open, and thinks she's starting to regain the momentum that helped get her to the top of the rankings and a first major title in 2019. Barty fended off eight break-point chances before beating 29th-seeded Elena Rybakina 6-3, 6-2 in the opening match Friday on Rod Laver Arena. WATCH | No. 1 seed Barty earns another straight set victory: The 20-year-old Rybakina had won 11 of her first 12 matches of the season, winning the title in the tuneup tournament in Hobart after reaching the final in Shenzhen. Barty, the French Open champion, won her first title on home soil in Adelaide last week and, after dropping the first set she played at Melbourne Park, has advanced through three rounds without losing another set. She had a tough start against Rybakina, having her serve broken in the opening game, but otherwise felt good about her latest win. It's been more than four decades since an Australian lifted the trophy. She'll next meet either No. 18 Alison Riske, or her doubles partner Julia Goerges on Sunday for a spot in the quarterfinals. No. 14 Diego Schwartzman was the first of the men through the fourth round, beating No. 24 Dusan Lajovic 6-2, 6-3, 7-6 (7) and could meet seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Second-ranked Djokovic had the third match on Rod Laver against Yoshihito Nishioka.

The decision by Judge Brent Klause followed a two-week preliminary hearing held at the Saskatoon Provincial Court to determine if the Crown has enough evidence to take the case to trial. The evidence presented at the preliminary hearing cannot be reported on. Sheree Fertuck's family members exchanged hugs and shed tears outside the courtroom after the decision was made. Her sister, Teaka White, said she is happy and relieved with the outcome. ""It's another step forward, I suppose, for hopefully getting closure for our family,"" said White. White said she feels confident about the Crown's case against Greg Fertuck. Sheree Fertuck has been missing since the semi-truck she used for gravel-hauling was found abandoned at a gravel pit near Kenaston, Sask. in December 2015.   Her body was never found. RCMP previously described it as unusual to lay charges without a body. Greg Fertuck was charged in June 2019 after an undercover police operation known as a ""Mr. Big"" sting.  He confessed to the undercover officers that he killed Sheree but later told CBC the confession was a lie. He said he made it up because he was afraid of the undercover police, who were posing as criminals.  Fertuck said he is innocent and denies any involvement in Sheree's death. The case is the focus of the CBC investigative podcast, The Pit. White said she learned new details from the hearing but was not surprised by much of what she heard.  ""I just had my own instincts, which I guess proved to be true,"" she said.  White said it feels surreal to be involved in a murder trial for her sister.  Crown prosecutor Cory Bliss said the trial date will be set in the future at the Court of Queen's Bench.   ""The preliminary hearing, which was some of the evidence, was two weeks so we're looking at a lengthy proceeding,"" said Bliss.

He was 85. Lehrer died ""peacefully in his sleep,"" according to PBS. He had suffered a heart attack in 1983, and more recently had undergone heart valve surgery in April 2008. For Lehrer, and for his friend and longtime partner Robert MacNeil, broadcast journalism was a service, with public understanding of events and issues its primary goal. Lehrer was also a frequent moderator of presidential debates. ""We both believed the American people were not as stupid as some of the folks publishing and programming for them believed,"" Lehrer wrote in his 1992 memoir, A Bus of My Own. ""We were convinced they cared about the significant matters of human events. ... And we were certain they could and would hang in there for more than 35 seconds for information about those subjects if given a chance."" I am devastated to share news that my dear friend and cofounder of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewsHour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NEWSHOUR</a> Jim Lehrer died today at home. Sending love to his Kate and their family. <a href=""https://t.co/ZxNsCcaZBj"">https://t.co/ZxNsCcaZBj</a> In the trenches of electronic journalism over the decades, I met a lot of people. Few approached their work with more equanimity and integrity than Jim Lehrer. He was a gentlemen, and a helluva journalist. He will be missed. Tributes poured in from colleagues and watchers alike, including from Fox News' Bret Baier, who called Lehrer ""an inspiration to a whole generation of political journalists — including this one."" Dan Rather said ""few approached their work with more equanimity and integrity than Jim Lehrer."" And Jake Tapper of CNN called Lehrer ""a wonderful man and a superb journalist."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called him a ""champion for truth and transparency."" Just devastating news about Jim Lehrer passing. Jim was a patriot in every sense of the word. I sat with him at a dinner just before Christmas and he was so full of life, as compassionate as he was wise. He will be deeply missed. <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewsHour?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@NewsHour</a> <a href=""https://t.co/DZHPg1YadI"">https://t.co/DZHPg1YadI</a> The half-hour Robert MacNeil Report began on PBS in 1975 with Lehrer as Washington correspondent. The two had already made names for themselves at the then-fledgling network through their work with the National Public Affairs Center for Television and its coverage of the Watergate hearings in 1973. The nightly news broadcast, later retitled MacNeil-Lehrer Report, became the nation's first one-hour TV news broadcast in 1983 and was then known as MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. After MacNeil bowed out in 1995, it became The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. ""I'm heartbroken at the loss of someone who was central to my professional life, a mentor to me and someone whose friendship I've cherished for decades,"" Judy Woodruff, anchor and managing editor of PBS NewsHour, said in a statement. Politics, international relations, economics, science, even developments in the arts were all given lengthy, detailed coverage in their show. ""When we expanded to the hour, it changed from being a supplement to an alternative,"" Lehrer said in 1990. ""Now we take the position that if you're looking for a place to go every 24 hours and find out what's happened and get some in-depth treatment, we're the place."" Lehrer moderated his first presidential debate in 1988 and was a frequent consensus choice for the task in subsequent presidential contests. ""Anybody who would say it's just another TV show is a liar or a fool,"" he once said. ""I know how important it is, but it's not about me. It's what the candidates say that matters."" He also anchored PBS coverage of inaugurations and conventions, dismissing criticism from other TV news organizations that the latter had become too scripted to yield much in the way of real news. ""I think when the major political parties of this country gather together their people and resources in one place to nominate their candidates, that's important,"" he told The Associated Press in 2000. ""To me, it's a non-argument. I don't see why someone would argue that it wasn't important."" Naturally, Lehrer came in for some knocks for being so low-key in the big televised events. After a matchup between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000, David Letterman cracked, ""Last night was probably the first and only that time Jim Lehrer [was] the most exciting person in the room."" But the real-life Lehrer — who had a tradition of buying a new tie for good luck before each debate — was more colourful than he might have seemed on PBS. On the side, he was also a novelist and sometime playwright. His debut novel Viva Max! was made into a movie starring Peter Ustinov. He did a whole series of novels about the adventures of an Oklahoma politician known as The One-Eyed Mack. Jim Lehrer was a legendary journalist and anchor. May he rest in peace.❤️ <a href=""https://t.co/9ddgNlPkEG"">https://t.co/9ddgNlPkEG</a> ""Hemingway said this, too: If you paid attention as a reporter, then when the time came to write fiction you'd have something to write about,"" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 1991. ""And it turned out I did. And I've got all these stories stored up after 30 years in the news business. And they're just flowing out of me."" As Lehrer turned 75 in spring 2009, PBS announced that the show would be retitled as PBS NewsHour later in the year, with Lehrer pairing up on anchor duties with other show regulars. He said he approved of the changes, telling The New York Times that having a pair of anchors would ""shake things up a bit,"" even as all sectors of the news business struggled to meet changing reader and viewer demands. Lehrer was born in Wichita, Kansas, in 1934, the son of parents who ran a bus line. In addition to titling his memoir A Bus of My Own, he collected bus memorabilia — from station signs to a real 1946 Flxible Clipper bus. Loved, of all things, buses. I did a piece for CNN in 1983 about a stunt driver who jumped and crashed old school buses. Phone rings. “Is this Keith? My name is Jim Lehrer...” Asked for a VHS copy of the story. A week later it’s him calling again “can’t thank you enough!” Jim Lehrer followed in his father's footsteps by serving in the Marines in the 1950s; he later claimed his and his brother's ""first foreign words were 'semper fidelis' and the first song we knew was the 'Marine Corps Hymn.' "" <a href=""https://t.co/BXEPtfuPIJ"">pic.twitter.com/BXEPtfuPIJ</a> After graduation from college in 1956, he served three years in the Marines, later calling the experience so valuable that he thought all young people should take part in national service. ""I had no close calls, no rendezvous with danger, no skirted destinies with death,"" he wrote. ""What I had was a chance to discover and test myself, physically and emotionally and spiritually, in important, lasting ways."" He went to work from 1959 to 1970 at The Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct Dallas Times-Herald. Lehrer jumped to television for a Dallas nightly newscast. Lehrer wrote that it was ironic that the Watergate hearings helped establish the importance of public TV, since former U.S. president Richard Nixon hated public broadcasting. He also recalled that the lengthy hearings gave him the chance to practice his new craft, and MacNeil, already a veteran, gave him valuable pointers on how to speak on camera clearly and conversationally.

256,Anonymous,2020-01-22T15:41:49.657Z,"Netflix snags 125,000 new Canadian subscribers as streaming competition heats up","Netflix recruited more Canadian subscribers in the final months of last year as it responded to an onslaught of new competition from Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus with an array of buzzworthy TV series and Oscar-calibre movies. The global streaming company attracted 125,000 paid sign-ups in Canada during the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 2019, helped by popular TV series The Witcher and acclaimed films Marriage Story and The Irishman. Yet, while the results were an improvement over the 96,000 Canadian subscribers who joined in the third quarter, the company's subscriber growth was down from the 218,000 new members who joined during the last three months a year prior. Part of that slowdown could be attributed to the arrival of both Apple and Disney which launched their hyped streaming services within days of each other. Disney Plus, in particular, left a solid impact on pop culture when its Star Wars spinoff The Mandalorian sparked an obsession with viewers over the so-called Baby Yoda character on social media. Netflix says despite the widespread attention both new streaming platforms attracted, there was a ""more muted impact from competitive launches"" outside the U.S., including in Canada. Reed Hastings, the company's chief executive, downplayed the arrival of Apple and Disney, saying in a call with investors that before they showed up a formidable competitor for viewership already existed in global powerhouse YouTube. Spencer Wang, the company's vice-president of finance, suggested the notion of the streaming wars is overplayed by outsiders. ""I know it's exciting for folks to talk about — you know the clash of the titans and all that kind of stuff — but really the big thing that's going on is a transition from linear entertainment to streaming on demand entertainment, which is really, really big,"" he said. ""It's very similar to the transition the industry went through from broadcast to cable."" The latest Canadian figures were outlined as part of a broader commitment to provide its investors with a more extensive quarterly report that fleshed out data on growth in key countries. More detailed breakdowns of its regional membership numbers and revenue cover four regions — Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East & Africa; and U.S. and Canada. The North American region was the lowest membership growth area for the streaming company, which it attributed in its financial report to ""recent price changes and to U.S. competitive launches."" Canadian revenues were higher at $241 million US in the three months that ended Dec. 31, 2019, marking an increase from nearly $164.9 million in the same period a year earlier when the company was phasing in a price increase with users across the country. Overall, Netflix added 8.8 million worldwide subscribers during its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations. Netflix had said it expected to add 7.6 million subscribers, and analysts thought the service would fare even better. The increase pales slightly next to the 8.9 million subscribers the service added in the fourth quarter of 2018. A report released Tuesday by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on the state of the country's communications industry offered further insight into the popularity of Netflix in Canada. The 2019 Communications Monitoring Report outlines that subscription-based video-on-demand services — which include Netflix, Crave and Quebec-based Club Illico — generated $2.5 billion Cdn of revenue for the entirety of 2018. Netflix was by far the largest chunk of those revenues, representing 65 per cent, while Amazon Prime Video came in a distant second with an eight-per cent share of total revenues.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-canadian-subscribers-streaming-1.5435972,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/disney-plus-subscribers-1.5358047 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/netflix-subscriber-growth-slowing-1.5323517,N/A

From the first night home from the hospital when I held my breath as she slept, to letting her eat grapes, to watching her climb precariously on every piece of furniture we own — it's been a daily practice of managing my own discomfort so that she can live her own risk-filled life.  It can be hard to remember in these moments, but I do truly value risk-taking. As a counsellor and coach, my career is built around helping others take meaningful risks, and in my own life I can easily connect the dots from ""risks I took"" to ""most meaningful experiences I've had.""  Now, as a new parent, I have been reflecting on how I came to appreciate taking meaningful risks. I grew up in Charlottetown, and in this small town where everyone knows what everyone else is up to, my parents weren't afraid to be different. I watched them start new businesses and figure out the challenges as they went. They took on new hobbies and set personal goals. They experimented with recipes, planned unusual vacations, and encouraged us to make our ideas real. Even when my brother wanted to start a wrestling federation in our basement, my dad got out the ropes and mats and helped him build a ring. Their mottos were ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and ""If it were easy, everybody would be doing it."" In that, they modelled meaningful risk-taking and normalized it. When I graduated high school I received a Loran Award, a scholarship and leadership program valued up to $100,000 over four years of undergraduate study in Canada, awarded to only three dozen Canadian graduating students annually. This award has been one of the most enormous privileges of my life. It allowed me to move off-Island to complete my undergraduate degree; without the support of Loran, I never would have moved away. Loran took a risk on me and their choice to do so completely changed the course of my life. That initial move for university was such a stretch for me that I've compared all subsequent risks to it, and something inside me always says, ""Well if you could do that, you can do this."" The more of these stretching experiences I've accumulated, the more enticing new growth opportunities have felt and the more open I've become to seek them out. I believe there is a strong link between taking meaningful risks and how much we trust ourselves. In other words, we take risks if we believe we can handle the outcomes, regardless of what they may be. The Loran foundation trusted me — they believed in my leadership potential and ability to effect positive change in my community, and that helped me trust myself.  This was also the way my parents parented — they always led me to believe that I could handle hard things. Growing up there was no asking if I did my homework, or whether I practiced the piano. My dad is a professional musician and when I wanted to take piano lessons he said, ""OK, but I won't ever push you — it has to be your own choice.""  When I left for university, my parents did not pack up my belongings or shop for my dorm room, they did not oversee my course selection, edit my assignments, or monitor my grades. When I moved to the U.S., there were no questions about my visa, health insurance, or taxes — it was simply assumed that I could and would figure it out. This may seem radical: some might say, ""Well, you were a conscientious kid so your parents could get away with that, but if I didn't remind my kid to do those things, they would just never get done!"" Possibly. But it's also possible that intrinsic motivation and self-accountability can't bloom without space. They trusted me so much that I intuited I was someone to be trusted. That said, I also always felt safe to ask my parents for help. I think their approach made me more transparent with my struggles because I knew they would listen and encourage me, but also that they wouldn't jump in unless I asked them to. Had they tried to solve my problems for me it would have undermined my confidence; it would have implicitly said ""You do not have this."" In learning to trust myself, I felt empowered to gradually stretch my self-imposed limits.  Even though growth can be painful, the feeling of expansion has always made me hungry for more.  As an adult, I intentionally seek out meaningful risks, whether it's sharing something I've created, taking an improv class, asking someone I've just met on a ""friend date,"" or simply trying a new recipe for a dinner party — the discomfort has proven worth it.  But as a child, growth meant my parents had to intentionally let me hurt and struggle. As a new mom, I've never appreciated more what that must have involved. To develop a practice of taking meaningful risks, you also have to be willing to regularly experience vulnerability, discomfort and pain. My baby is only one-year-old, and seeing her struggling is the absolute worst; nonetheless, how am I helping her if she doesn't learn it is safe to do so? I know the qualities I value most in people — empathy, compassion, depth, insight and the ability to see things from a nuanced perspective — are born from painful experiences. Reframing my daughter's pain as ""stretching for her emotional expansion"" and her struggles as ""grit-building opportunities"" won't help very much when those moments come up, but perhaps it will help me see where her struggle ends and my tolerance of her discomfort begins. I work with many university students. I love this age group because their experience with taking meaningful risks has often been limited, and watching them take the reigns of their own lives is exciting. We examine their relationship with trying and their willingness to allow others to see them in the process of learning. For those who were high achievers in high school, this can be especially challenging. Asking questions in class, going to office hours, getting help from the writing resource centre, hiring a tutor or simply getting feedback on an assignment can be extremely difficult for students as they feel they ""aren't the kind of student who does those things.""  I try to increase their comfort with not knowing, gradually help them equate the feeling of struggle with growth, and ideally stretch their capacity for meaningful risk-taking in ways that will continue throughout their lives.  When I work with adults, often the barriers to meaningful risk-taking are increasingly dense. People will tell me they are struggling to find meaning in their life, or say that they feel stuck or bored. I'll respond by asking, ""How often do you really put yourself out there?"" and ""When was the last time you genuinely acted vulnerably?"" All meaningful risks require us to be vulnerable with ourselves and others, and most significantly they require us to be willing to change what we believe about ourselves.  If you had told me when I graduated high school what my next 10 years would look like — that I would attend Harvard University, move to Los Angeles, and leave my stable and rewarding career to start a business — I would never have believed you.  So when people ask ""Where do you see yourself in 10 years?"" I say ""I can't wait to find out!"" because I have grown to love and appreciate that feeling of unknown possibility. The emotional exposure I feel when taking a meaningful risk is also what makes me feel alive and most ""in"" my own life. The practice of meaningful risk-taking has taught me that I'm always only one experience away from a new understanding of myself and the world. It has allowed me to expand and broaden my self-definition. So how can I use my experiences and the lessons I've learned to now help my daughter pursue meaningful risks?  I need to model risk-taking and show that while no true risk lacks vulnerability, the emotional exposure is worth it. I also need to show her that asking for help requires strength, so she will know it is safe to do so.  I need to get out of her way and give her space to struggle. My hope is that in doing so, she will prove to herself that she can handle hard things and she will come to deeply trust herself.  Lastly, through her own ongoing practice of meaningful risk-taking, I hope she will delight in the fact that the story of who she will become is always being written.  This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

259,Steve Silva,2020-01-22T19:09:32.574Z,'Kind of surprising': Yukon sisters denied switch to shorter Yukon Quest race,"Two sisters from Mendenhall, Yukon, say they're disappointed they won't be able to compete in the Yukon Quest this year, in part, because it's too late to switch to a shorter sled-dog race. Lori Tweddell, 18, and her twin sister Louve Tweddell planned to compete in the annual 1,609 kilometre sled-dog race between Fairbanks, Alaska, and Whitehorse this winter. Those plans changed after the twins recently failed to finish a qualification race. In order to qualify for the Yukon Quest, racers must have completed a 483-kilometre race and a 322-kilometre race in the previous three and a half years. Last year, the Tweddells successfully completed the Yukon Quest's shorter race, known as the Yukon Quest 300. They set out to complete a 483-kilometre race in Alaska earlier this month, but decided to quit halfway through. ""Sadly, I could not finish the race, and the condition that the trail was [in], and the weather, and I guess bad luck as well played a major role,"" Lori said. While this meant they couldn't compete in the longer Yukon Quest race, the sisters hoped they'd be able to instead run the Yukon Quest 300 again this year. But that's not possible, according to Shayna Hammer, executive director of the Yukon Quest International Association (Canada). The deadline to apply for or switch to either race was Jan. 3. Others have tried to join after that date but were declined, Hammer said. ""I was really upset because we prepared for years,"" said Lori. ""It could be understandable, but we had registered, we paid for everything,"" Louve said. ""It was just kind of surprising not to be accepted."" Frank Turner, a previous Yukon Quest winner, said the Tweddells should be allowed to participate. ""You don't protect the bad rule by saying, 'That's the way it was done in the past.' If it's a bad rule now, then it should be dealt with now,"" he told Radio-Canada. Hammer said the Yukon Quest's board, which consists of representatives from the U.S. and Canada, will make a recommendation to the rules committee to prevent a situation like the Tweddells' from happening again. There is currently an acting rules committee for the event, since the previous six-member committee resigned last summer after reviewing the rules.   Speaking on Tuesday, Hammer referred to ""some differing directions between the [former] rules committee and the organization,"" but said she didn't know the exact reasons for the schism.  The acting rules committee plans to meet this spring.  Fifteen teams are registered for the longer race this year, and 21 teams are set to run the Yukon Quest 300. Both events begin Feb. 1 in Fairbanks. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-sisters-races-1.5435216,https://www.cbc.ca/archives/broken-legs-hypothermia-dogs-the-yukon-quest-1.5004546 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bike-winter-high-school-fat-bike-yukon-year-round-1.5431709,N/A

261,Marilla Steuter-Martin,2020-01-24T15:00:00.697Z,New film traces family's story of survival on an Irish coffin ship that crashed off Gaspé coast,"Of the 173 people who boarded the vessel Carricks of Whitehaven bound from Ireland to Canada in 1847, 48 made it to shore alive. ""It must have been a horrific scene. Bodies were scattered along the beach for about a mile and a half according to the first eyewitnesses,"" said ​Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin, a professor at Concordia University's School of Irish Studies. Just off the coast of the Gaspé Peninsula, the ship was caught up in a nor'easter which froze the sails and sent the mast cracking down through the ship. Among the survivors were married couple Patrick Kaveney and Sarah MacDonald, as well as their teenage son Martin. Their five daughters, all between the age of two and 10, were lost. This family and their descendants are the subject of a new documentary, called Lost Children of the Carricks: Defying the Great Irish Famine to Create a Canadian Legacy. Filmmaker Ó hAllmhuráin first heard the story from Georges Kavanagh, a francophone historian and descendant of Kaveney and MacDonald. ""I was tru​ly astonished when I heard him describe their leaving Ireland, their crossing the Atlantic, the experience of being trapped in this ship which, at the time, wasn't too different from a slave ship, and then arriving on the edge of the New World,"" Ó hAllmhuráin told CBC Montreal's All in a Weekend. Over the course of five generations, the story of Kavanagh's ancestors and their was preserved through the family's oral tradition. ""This is oral storytelling at its richest, at its very best,"" said ​Ó hAllmhuráin.  Thousands of Irish people fled to North America during the potato famine, in ships that weren't built to house human cargo. Canada alone received about 300,000 Irish immigrants, but an estimated 20,000 others died at sea or on shore from disease. ​Ó hAllmhuráin's film is described as a ""70-minute documentary of exodus and reunion,"" beginning with Kavanagh (whose name was changed slightly from the original Kaveney over the years) in the Gaspésie and following his journey back to Ireland.   ""We were able to bring the Kaveney — the Kavanagh family — back into their ancestral village,"" he said. The film crew worked with local historians in County Sligo, Ireland to track down the original walls of the Kaveney home and even some living cousins. ​Ó hAllmhuráin said it was an emotional experience for Kavanagh, now in his 80s, and his daughter. ""He had been waiting his whole life. He told me on the way across the Atlantic that ever since he was a teenager, he dreamed of going to Ireland. And he described it as 'Mon Irlande,' My Ireland. Which was so touching to hear."" The film, Lost Children of the Carricks: Defying the Great Irish Famine to Create a Canadian Legacy, screens Friday Jan. 24 at the J.A.

""It's kind of aiming to be a safe space for LGBTQI2S+-identified athletes, and especially for these Arctic Winter Games we want to focus on making sure that that space really is safe,"" said Mia Val, who works for the AWG host society and sits on its inclusion committee. Val said the first Pride House was at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, and they're now common at major sporting events. It's a first for the Arctic Winter Games, though. The host society partnered with Queer Yukon, a local advocacy group, to organize Pride House. It'll be set up in a semi-private space at Yukon College from March 16 to 20. Sofia Fortin, volunteer coordinator for Pride House, says it'll be a meeting place for young people. She's also hoping to organize some activities, like movie nights, and have other support and resources on hand. ""The main idea is that it's just a safe place for youth to come hang out in their off-time during the games,"" Fortin said. ""They know it's a place where they're not going to face discrimination, they're not going to face any bullying, they're just going to get lots of support and love for who they are."" Fortin says it could be especially great for young people visiting from small communities who don't always get to meet others like them. She also said it's not just for youth who identify as LGBTQI2S+. ""Certainly, allies would be welcome but basically anything that's unfriendly or hostile is not welcome,"" Fortin said. Volunteers for Pride House are still needed, she says. They would work a few hours at a time, either in the early afternoon, or late afternoon and evening.  Anybody interested needs to register as an official Arctic Winter Games volunteer before Jan. 31.

264,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:48:01.672Z,"No hesitation to send ambulance for Cynthia Blackjack, nurses tells inquest","Two nurses testifying at the Cynthia Blackjack inquest in Yukon said there was no hesitation to send an ambulance to pick up the ailing woman, the day she died. Nurse Terry Ogilvie was working at the Carmacks Health Centre on Nov. 7, 2013, when the call came for an ambulance to be sent to the house of Blackjack's grandmother. The coroner's inquest, now underway in Whitehorse, is looking at the circumstances around 29-year-old Cynthia Blackjack's death later that day, during a medevac flight to Whitehorse. One of the central questions raised at the inquest so far is whether Blackjack should have been transported to Whitehorse General Hospital sooner. The Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation, of which Blackjack was a member, has suggested ""systemic racism"" as a potential factor. In 2018, the Yukon Court of Appeal found that in the days before she died, Blackjack had been in frequent contact with the Carmacks Health Centre complaining of severe dental pain. The day before she died, Blackjack was told by the health centre in Carmacks to go to the Whitehorse hospital — a two-hour drive away. Staff at the health centre say they tried to help find Blackjack a ride, but were unsuccessful.  Ogilvie told the inquest that her memory of the day Blackjack died is spotty, but she recalls at least three nurses and two doctors who saw Blackjack in Carmacks on that day. She said that's an unusually high number of staff. Ogilvie also said anyone with symptoms like Blackjack's would get an ambulance or medevac to Whitehorse as soon as possible. Deb Crosby, the former nurse in charge of the Carmacks Health Centre, also testified on Wednesday and supported Ogilvie's claim that there was no hesitation to send an ambulance. She told the inquest jurors that staff at the health centre could almost always arrange rides to Whitehorse for patients. But Crosby said she had to be cautious about sending Carmacks's only ambulance out of the community. ""You're always thinking about the worst-case scenario,"" she said. When Blackjack arrived at the health centre on Nov. 7, staff immediately called Whitehorse for a medevac flight, Crosby said. According to Ogilvie, the Carmacks nurses were devastated when RCMP later told them Blackjack had died on the plane before reaching Whitehorse. The nurses' testimony marked the start of the Whitehorse portion of the inquest, which is expected to continue at the Kwanlin Dün Cultural Centre until Jan. 31. The first two days of testimony were held at the recreation centre in Carmacks. In Carmacks, the inquest heard from some of Blackjack's family and friends. They described her as a kind and loving person with a lively sense of humour.  The inquest jury heard that Blackjack had problems with alcohol, but her cousin, Dacia Tulk, testified that Blackjack was excited to start a new job with the Little Salmon Carmacks First Nation. Blackjack's friend, Vanessa Charlie, said the ambulance she called for Blackjack took more than two hours to arrive. According to logs entered as evidence, it took the ambulance 20 minutes to get to Blackjack and another 20 to get her to the health centre. Witnesses in Carmacks also testified that nurses at the health centre are frequently dismissive of Indigenous patients, especially if those patients have been drinking. ""They [health centre staff] weren't very nice,"" Tulk said. ""Not at all."" Charlie also told jurors that three weeks after Blackjack's death, she called an ambulance for a white man in the community. That time, she said, the ambulance arrived in 10 minutes.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cynthia-blackjack-inquest-whitehorse-1.5436843,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/blackjack-inquest-begins-carmacks-1.5431891,N/A

268,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:58:29.094Z,Crown wants 10 years for man guilty of killing common-law wife,"Crown prosecutors are calling for Irving John Hastey to be sentenced to 10 years in prison for the 2018 killing of his common-law wife in her St. Stephen home. Hastey, 55, pleaded guilty to manslaughter Nov. 29, 2019, about 11 months after Crystal Ann Tracey, 52, died in her apartment on Christmas Eve, which was also her birthday. Police were alerted to a disturbance at Tracey's apartment just before noon. She suffered multiple stab wounds and died at the scene as paramedics tried to revive her. Hastey was also found unresponsive at the scene and was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The Crown is also seeking a lifetime weapons and ammunition ban and that Hastey submit to a DNA order, the prosecution told Saint John Court of Queen's Bench during Wednesday's sentencing hearing. Hastey was charged with second-degree murder two days after Tracey's death. He initially pleaded not guilty, but later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge. Justice Darrell Stephenson will deliver his sentence Monday. Shara Munn and Patrick Wilbur represented the Crown, and Brian Munro served in defence. Dressed in bright orange sweats, Hastey sat in the prisoner's box as Tracey's two sisters told the court he was abusive and they saw this tragedy coming. Valerie Tubbs said in a victim impact statement the couple was together for more than 30 years and have three grown children. ""This is the legacy you have left for [your] children. This will be the burden they will carry,"" Tubbs said, speaking directly to Hastey. ""That makes me angry. How dare you. I don't understand how a father can do this to his children."" Tubbs said she talked to her sister the day before her death about holiday arrangements with plans to see each other on Christmas Eve. It was the last time they spoke. ""Every year at Christmas I will mourn the loss of my sister,"" Tubbs said. Marilyn Little said in her statement to the court she feared for her sister and her children for years. ""For many years when the phone rang and I saw it was Crystal's number, I didn't know what to expect. Was she okay? The kids? Would I hear him yelling in the background?"" Little said. ""I predicted this 20 years ago."" Tubbs said she was hopeful Tracey could lead a happy and productive life after moving into an apartment on her own. ""We will never know,"" she said. We haven't come far enough to curb domestic violence, she said, expressing fear Hastey will hurt her when he's released. Munro, who agreed to the recommendation of 10 years less time served, said it was a dysfunctional family environment. He did mention his client pleaded guilty, saving the court from a trial. Police received a call from Tracey at 11:16 a.m. on the day of her death, according to the statement of facts read by Wilbur. Tracey, who was calling from her apartment at 16 Schoodic St., requested Hastey be removed from her residence. The call was transferred to the local operator, but the line went dead. Police were dispatched from the nearby detachment. The prosecution played a recording of the call. Hastey could be heard in the background, becoming increasingly hostile. An officer arrived on scene at 11:22 a.m. and gained entry into the apartment by kicking down the locked door. Both individuals were found lying on their backs — Hastey unconscious in the bathroom and Tracey in the kitchen with a knife sticking out of her chest. She was alive and moving, Wilbur told the court. The officer spoke to her and she communicated by squeezing her hand.  Paramedics arrived but could not find a heartbeat, and attempts to revive her with chest compressions and a defibrillator were unsuccessful. Paramedics determined she was dead at 11:43 a.m. The post-mortem ruled the cause of death as multiple sharp-force injuries to the chest and abdomen. Tracey suffered seven to eight stab wounds in her chest and back, extending into both lungs and her liver. The knife, which was seized by police, belonged to Hastey — a present from his mother the previous Christmas. After determining Tracey had died, paramedics turned their attention to Hastey. He had an injury to his chest and was later taken to hospital in Moncton, where a stent was removed and he regained consciousness. The court heard the couple had been drinking that morning.  The toxicology report indicated Hastey had a blood-alcohol content of 145 milligrams per decilitre and had consumed methamphetamine and amphetamine.Tracey had a blood-alcohol content of 269 milligrams per decilitre.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-john-hastey-manslaughter-crystal-ann-tracey-1.5436721,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/irving-hastey-crystal-tracey-st-stephen-1.5378833,N/A
269,Shaina Luck,2020-01-22T16:11:38.172Z,'Historic' change allows transgender girls to enter Eskasoni pageant,"For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, the Eskasoni First Nation's annual winter carnival pageant is open to transgender women and girls. The Eskasoni Winter Carnival has been running for decades as a fundraiser for the local Holy Family Parish. The pageant is one of the most popular events of the festival in Cape Breton. ""To have this as one of the biggest symbols of gender affirmation for people who are trans is a total success and a very historic moment, not only for Mi'kmaw people, not only for people in Eskasoni, but for transgender women and girls all across this world,"" said Geordy Marshall, who is with Pride Eskasoni. Marshall is also the communications person for the Eskasoni First Nation and sits on the organizing committee for the winter carnival. He said about two dozen participants spend a month working on things like public speaking and confidence for the pageant. They bond as friends to encourage each other and learn from elders. ""It's an opportunity for young women to learn who they are and learn from the finest women in our community to become women. It's almost like a coming-of-age type of event,"" Marshall said. So far, one transgender participant has signed up, Bella Marie Poulette. She and her sponsors decided she should wait until after the pageant to do interviews to make sure the pageant is fair for all participants and to allow her to have the same kind of experience as everyone else. ""She is excited and she's felt overwhelmed by all of this emotionally,"" Marshall said. ""She's just overfilled with joy. This is something she's dreamed of all her life to do."" The winter carnival will take place Feb. 20-23. Maryanne Junta, 19, won the title of queen in the 2016 pageant. She said she loves that transgender girls are now allowed to enter. ""Trans girls are girls and it shouldn't be any other way,"" she said. ""They should be allowed to join pageants, they should be allowed to go in the girls bathroom, because they're girls. They should be able to experience life as a girl, as they want to.""  Marshall said the community's reaction has been mixed.  ""There were people who celebrated and rejoiced on the wonderful day, but there's also a lot of people who expressed their transphobic beliefs and were totally against it,"" he said. Marshall said many transgender teens struggle with poor self-esteem, which is one reason being able to enter the pageant with other young girls is important. ""It's hard to live in a world where it's full of lateral violence and residual effects from residential schools and Indian day schools and colonization. A lot of these young girls deal with a lot of pressure in their lives,"" he said. ""This is one of the great things we get to celebrate as a community. We see all of their hard work paid off and we truly honour them on that day. Whether they're a crowned winner or not, they're all our princesses.""

271,"Dave Seglins,  Joseph Loiero",2020-01-24T10:48:18.404Z,Police officer suspects internal 'coverup' by CP Rail in fatal B.C. mountain crash,"A police officer probing the death of three Canadian Pacific Railway crewmen killed in a runaway train crash in B.C. last February alleges he was denied access to key evidence and suspects a ""coverup"" by the railway. Mark Tataryn was one of three officers with CP Police Service assigned to investigate the derailment of CP Train 301. CPPS is a fully authorized federal force, bound to uphold Canada's laws, but is employed directly by the company. Tataryn began investigating potential criminal negligence by CP after the parked train suffered air brake failure in the mountains in –28 C temperatures and crashed at the historic Spiral Tunnels near Field, B.C. on Feb. 4, 2019 ""I was ordered to stop investigating,"" Tataryn told CBC's The Fifth Estate, saying his superiors prevented him from obtaining key witness accounts. ""I would say it was some type of coverup."" ""I believe it's an injustice. I do believe that there was corporate influence to sway the aspect of the investigation in some capacity,"" said Tataryn in an interview, though he declined to discuss specific evidence from the case. Tataryn has since quit CPPS and joined the RCMP.  But before he left, he says he shared his concerns — and a copy of CP's police file — with B.C.'s Coroner, Canada's Transportation Safety Board and the RCMP. The Fifth Estate conducted a seven-month investigation, talking with witnesses, railroad workers, families and sources within police and government and uncovered a string of failures in the Train 301 tragedy, to be explored in a documentary ""Runaway Train"" airing Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. As a CP police officer based in Golden, B.C., Tataryn recalls racing to the derailment scene, finding 99 grain cars piled up and bodies of three crew members from the wrecked locomotive, by then overturned in the Kicking Horse River. Two other more senior CPPS officers were also part of CP's investigation.""We did everything we could at the time under those adverse conditions, –35 C in the howling wind … to get to the bottom of why it took place,"" Tataryn said. But Tataryn said that following the crash, he was instructed by supervisors to keep the investigation narrowly focused on the crew. ""I believe that they were looking out for the better interests of the corporation,"" he said. ""I was embarrassed to be a part of this investigation."" Tataryn said he believes they should also have examined potential negligence by the company. ""I originally swore an oath to uphold the law and protect the public, not to support the corporate interests of CP."" Tataryn said he was also denied access to safety records, the maintenance history of the train, as well as recordings of calls between rail traffic control and the crew from the night of the crash. ""I was after the audio recordings … anything they observed, saw, heard, what direction might have come from CP,"" he said. Tataryn said he was told one of his bosses listened to the recordings and ""there was nothing on it that had any evidentiary value."" CPPS declined to answer specific questions about its handling of the investigation. CP Police Chief Al Sauve said in an email the investigation was ""thorough"" and resulted in no charges. Sauve said Tataryn left CP Police under a cloud, and ""it would be misleading to your audience to take this disgruntled employee's comments at face value."" Tataryn said he grew suspicious after records began to disappear from CPPS's computer system. ""Those files were removed. I replaced them on two occasions. On yet the third occasion, I went back to look, they were gone,"" Tataryn said. ""I was suspicious … and sort of took other steps to safeguard information, because I knew that it would likely not be available in the future."" CPPS didn't respond to questions about the allegation of disappearing files. In a letter, Sauve said Tataryn resigned when he became the subject of a misconduct investigation for alleged infractions involving altered reports, investigative files and the storage of firearms. Sauve says their investigation found that Tataryn ""knowingly, negligently or recklessly made false, misleading or inaccurate statements in a CPPS report."" Tataryn dismisses the allegations as an attempt to discredit him, and Sauve wouldn't provide any further details of the internal probe. Disputes over the CPPS probe into the train crash reached a critical point one month after the incident, when Tataryn wrote to supervisors complaining that a lawyer present in employee interviews, paid for by CP, was hampering his investigation. ""They seemed all to be scripted and guarded, and they weren't true witness statements,"" Tataryn said. CP says that the lawyer was not working for CP and was made available to employees so they could obtain independent legal advice, if they wanted it. Tataryn said that ultimately, the CPPS investigation was abruptly shut down. ""We didn't even get to any key witnesses as far as managers or anybody else,"" he said. In his letter, Sauve said: ""The scope of CPPS's investigation was to determine actions of the crew members prior to the event regarding any outside factors that may have led or contributed to the incident itself."" CP's chief executive officer Keith Creel declined CBC's requests for an interview. When approached at a railroad conference in San Diego on Jan. 6, Creel deflected questions about the CPPS criminal probe and said he's waiting for the results of the safety investigation by the TSB. ""We've worked in lockstep with the RCMP from the very beginning,"" Creel told The Fifth Estate. ""They still retain jurisdiction over that investigation. If they want to step in or research or investigate anything that they haven't looked at prior to now, they're certainly welcome to do that."" In a statement, the RCMP said it never had jurisdiction because the crash happened on CP property. RCMP says they've never done their own investigation, adding they ""of course would be willing"" to step in if a request is made. ""As far as some conspiracy theory or the truth not coming out, there's no truth in that concern, that's for certain,"" Creel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/cp-derailment-investigation-coverup-alleged-1.5436018,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/field-train-cp-canadian-pacific-derailment-fatal-1.5011096 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tsb-train-cp-railway-derailment-field-bc-calgary-investigation-1.5006374,N/A
272,Shannon Flaman,2019-12-27T11:00:00.604Z,Don't pity my disability; it's not the same as being kind,"As someone with an external disability, I'd like people to know there's a line between kindness and pity. It's a realization I've come to after a lifetime of struggling with stuttering. Every single time my mouth opens, my disability is announced to the world. I've heard it all: ""spit it out,"" ""slow down,"" ""I can't understand you."" Drive-thrus are a challenge. When I talk on the phone, people think I'm cutting out. On many occasions, I've had people assume I'm drunk or disabled in other ways. These are just a few of the barriers I face every single day. I will continue to face them for the rest of my life. This is my reality. But it's not these barriers that get under my skin. I'm a smart, educated, ambitious woman, yet many people can't see past my disability. Don't get me wrong: I've never been bullied. It's actually the opposite – I'm repeatedly pitied. At least once a day, I can see pity in the eyes of someone I interact with. Take the gas attendant who's used to five-second exchanges. For me, the ""F"" in ""fill her up"" is 20 seconds and the ""R"" in ""regular"" another 20 more. I can see his expression change from confusion to panic to pity. Still, he just rolls with it, fills my tank and sends me on my way. The same can't be said for a woman who insisted on praying (quite loudly) over my head to God. She prayed pretty darn hard that God should take away my speech disability and fix my tongue. That situation was embarrassing and uncalled for. I didn't ask for her pity, nor did I ask for her prayers to ""fix"" me. Stuttering is the brain not connecting at the same pace as my tongue and lips. It also occurs because one side of my brain is stronger than the other. Do either of those sound like the end of the world? I think not. I don't pity myself and neither should you. We all have something ""wrong"" with us, whether it can be noticed by the naked eye or it's hidden inside of us. We all love to be shown kindness, but unless someone asks for pity, don't give it. Pity makes us feel less than or not enough. Over the past few years, social media has helped influence all of us to be kinder, to pay it forward. I love this movement and I think in general we are creating positive change with it. So, the next time you encounter someone different than you, rather than giving them an eye of pity, give them a big ole fist bump. The more characters and harmless differences in our cast on Earth, the better. This column is part of CBC's Opinion section.

273,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:23:55.786Z,UN experts call for investigation after Saudis linked to Jeff Bezos phone hack,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon's billionaire boss Jeff Bezos, United Nations experts said on Wednesday. The UN special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said they had information pointing to the ""possible involvement"" of the prince in the alleged 2018 cyberattack. Saudi officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd. Cybersecurity experts hired by Bezos, the world's richest man, concluded his phone was probably infiltrated by a video file sent from a WhatsApp account purportedly belonging to the prince in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter. They said the device began leaking massive amounts of data about a month afterward, the source said. Callamard, the special rapporteur for extrajudicial killings, and Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said the allegation of Saudi involvement ""demands immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities."" Outside experts consulted by the UN agreed that while the case was not airtight, the evidence was strong enough to warrant a fuller investigation. But the UN said the case illustrated the dangers ""from the unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware."" Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the charges. ""I think 'absurd' is exactly the right word,"" he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. ""The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos's phone is absolutely silly."" The alleged cyberattack is said to have taken place months before the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Bezos-owned Washington Post. ""At a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post,"" Callamard and Kaye said in their statement. The special rapporteurs, who released their findings in a statement, report to the UN Human Rights Council, but they are independent watchdogs and not UN officials. Their recommendations are not binding on countries, though are widely seen as carrying moral weight. They stopped short of identifying which specific technology might have been used in the alleged hack, but said software like that made by Israeli company NSO Group or Italian spyware maker Hacking Team could potentially have been deployed. NSO denied its technology was used in the alleged hack. ""We know this because of how our software works and our technology cannot be used on U.S. phone numbers,"" it said. ""Our products are only used to investigate terror and serious crime."" After a merger last year, Hacking Team is now part of Swiss-Italian cyber intelligence firm Memento Labs. Memento Labs's head, Paolo Lezzi, was not immediately available to comment but has previously said he has no knowledge of Hacking Team's earlier operations. With respect to the Khashoggi killing, the crown prince said last year was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it. Callamard led a UN inquiry into the Khashoggi killing. ""The evidence points overwhelmingly — and, in fact, in only one direction — which is that the killing was the state killing,"" she told CBC News in December. The Guardian newspaper first reported the crown prince's alleged involvement in the Bezos phone incident. Listen: Callamard speaks to CBC about Khashoggi murder investigation The relationship between the Amazon chief executive and the Saudi government had soured since early last year after he alluded to Saudi Arabia's displeasure at the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Khashoggi. In a previous flashpoint, Bezos's security chief said last year that the Saudi government had gained access to the Amazon CEO's phone and leaked messages to U.S. tabloid the National Enquirer between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who the newspaper said he was dating. A month before, Bezos had accused the newspaper's owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to Sanchez. The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirer reporting. Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy dismissed the latest allegations. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" it said in a message posted on Twitter.

274,Ainsley Hawthorn,2020-01-11T11:30:00.842Z,When every January is dry: The surprising appeal of living without alcohol ,"It's January, a month that many people now observe as 'Dry January' — a period to set aside alcohol and focus on health.  It's not something I will be observing as a special occasion, because I don't drink at all. I can't remember when I decided not to drink. It was before I turned 19, because my celebration didn't include the traditional first (legal) bar visit. It was before I started university, because I was able to enjoy being the only sober person at the end-of-orientation-week party, where I banked some wild stories to recount to my friends once they recovered from their hangovers. I had had the occasional sip of alcohol as a teenager, and I thought it tasted terrible. I never enjoyed the astringent kick of wine, the malty foulness of beer. But, honestly, who does? Alcoholic drinks taste objectively bad to most people at first. As the saying goes, you don't drink them for the taste, and it's likely that if alcoholic beverages were uncoupled from their euphoric effects we wouldn't drink them at all. The difference between me and most of my peers, I suppose, is that I wasn't enthusiastic enough about the idea of getting buzzed to push through the nasty flavour. My choice puzzled my friends at the time. After all, in our society we drink alcohol not only for its pleasurable effects but as a rite of passage. Alcohol is a symbol of our transition into adulthood, and most teenagers are anxious to enjoy adult freedoms and to prove themselves worthy of adult responsibilities. We indulge in alcohol furtively when we begin to feel suffocated by the authority of our parents and guardians. We partake in alcohol openly to celebrate when our numerical age makes us legally (if not actually) independent from them. When I declined a glass or bottle, I often found myself in the hot seat, being grilled on my reasons for abstaining. Not drinking, I've discovered, is one of the few purely personal choices that can make even strangers deeply uncomfortable. It's a singular experience to be questioned about why you don't drink alcohol, because there are a limited number of answers people consider legitimate. An illness, a religious doctrine, a family history of alcoholism — these seem to be acceptable explanations for abstaining. My reasons? I don't like the taste, I'm having a good time already, I just don't feel like it? These never seem to be good enough, so much so that I've sometimes fallen back on the excuse that there's been alcoholism in my family (which is true, but not a factor) just to cut these awkward conversations short. Why all this public concern over one aspect of my diet? I don't like spicy food or cilantro either, but no one interrogates me about that. Not drinking, on the other hand, is often taken as an affront. This is probably a legacy of the temperance movement, the organized crusade against alcohol consumption that snowballed during the 19th and early 20th centuries and eventually led to prohibition. The temperance movement took a moral stance against alcohol and portrayed drinkers as reckless libertines or hopeless degenerates. As a result, when you say you don't drink, even today, the people around you begin to wonder if you're looking down your nose at them like the temperance teetotallers of yore. Add to that the fact that our society considers alcohol essential for relaxing, socializing, and partying, and the non-drinker becomes a very suspicious animal indeed. Is she a puritanical square, the sworn enemy of all things fun? This heap of cultural baggage makes it difficult for each of us to untangle how we really feel about alcohol from how we're supposed to feel about it, how alcohol really affects our bodies from our expectations of how it should affect them. I know a number of moderate drinkers who've recently given up alcohol after realizing they don't actually enjoy drinking. Alcohol is a depressant. It can lower your inhibitions and relax you, but it can also dampen your mood and make you feel gloomier than you did before. If you're already prone to depression, drinking alcohol may not be a fantastic experience. Others quit drinking because it's getting in the way of their fitness goals (many alcoholic beverages are high in calories but, because they're liquids, don't fill you up) or because they want to save money. Newfoundlanders and Labradorians spend $1,056 per person on alcohol each year. Each of us deserves to assess for ourselves whether drinking works for us, our bodies, and our pocketbooks. So, I propose a reality-based reset of our society's approach to alcohol: Whether you'll be enjoying the occasional drink this month or having a dry January, just remember that, if you're of legal age, drinking is an option, not a requirement.

275,Mike Crawley,2020-01-24T09:00:00.711Z,How the hospital in Christine Elliott's riding copes with overcrowding,"When Health Minister Christine Elliott needs to see Ontario's hallway medicine problem in action, she doesn't need to travel very far, as one of the province's most overcrowded hospitals is in her riding.  Southlake Regional Health Centre in Newmarket is one of Ontario's largest, with 502 beds. It's also among the hospitals most frequently filled beyond capacity, according to an investigation by CBC News into the hallway healthcare situation province-wide. Data obtained from the Ministry of Health show that Southlake was over capacity for all but seven days in the first half of 2019. In that time period, the hospital's average daily occupancy ran at 110 per cent. That did not improve in the second half of the year, according to figures provided by the hospital, averaging 113 per cent. A visit to Southlake this month reveals patients housed in a range of what are officially called ""unconventional spaces,"" including a former exercise gym. Here the beds are separated by portable surgical screens, the makeshift nursing station is a collection of desks and tables mostly covered with medical supplies, and there's no bathroom, so patients have to walk down the hall.  Patients who spoke to CBC News in the exercise room said it was better than staying in Southlake's crowded emergency room, but less than ideal.  ""The elderly people, it's got to be real tough on them,"" said patient Ron Dane, who spent two days in the ER before getting an overflow spot in the gym. ""Obviously, there's a long way to go to get up to the standard of care that we should really expect.""  The nursing manager who covers the overflow areas at Southlake doesn't disagree with him.  ""This is not the optimal place to be providing care,"" said Tammy Rogers, who also manages the rehab and neurological units' discharge planning group. ""We don't have the same access to the equipment as you would on a set-up acute medical floor.""   Rogers praises her nursing team for their dedication.   ""I am forever thankful to them for the work that they do every day,"" she said during an interview in a kitchenette that's become the latest spot to put patients, a space that staff call the pantry.   ""I know it's not easy for them to come here to work when we're opening up a pantry or putting patients in the hallway, that's not why they became a nurse,"" she said. ""They give it 150 per cent. They still provide excellent care to our patients and I'm sure at the end of the day they're not always happy with what's happening.""  Rogers said there have been patients in the hallway on her floor daily for the previous two weeks.  No one on Southlake's staff is content with the overcrowding, from the nurses to the hospital's chief executive.  ""It's a very difficult situation for patients,"" said Arden Krystal, the hospital's president and CEO.  ""When I see patients in areas such as our gym, I think about how would I feel if that was my Dad in that bed,"" Krystal said in an interview with CBC News.  ""I wouldn't feel that good about it. I would be disappointed.""  The perpetual overcrowding at Southlake means hospital staff are daily putting anywhere from 20 to 50 patients into spaces that were not intended for patient care.  But that's not the only way the hospital tries to cope with the demand for beds.  Like many hospitals in Ontario, Southlake has large numbers of older patients occupying beds who don't actually need acute care, but can't leave the hospital because they need more care than they can receive at home. They're known as ""alternate level of care"" patients (ALC).  Last March saw the launch of a program called Southlake@home, designed to provide enough support to ALC patients outside the hospital walls so that they could be discharged more promptly. The hospital partnered directly with home-care providers, a community support service agency, and family doctors to ensure the necessary services were made available. The program has helped more than 200 patients make the transition out of the hospital, and has reduced their re-admission rates.  ""We've had great success with that,"" said Krystal. ""But no sooner do we get some people home than there's a whole pile more waiting to come in."" The key challenge for Ontario hospitals, said Krystal, has been figuring out how to cope without additional bed capacity. ""No matter how great a job we do in moving people into the community and keeping them healthier, the sheer growth that we've had in Ontario means that we need more hospital beds,"" she said.   The number of acute-care beds in the province has essentially remained the same for 20 years, while the province's population has grown by three million.  Elliott — who is the Progressive Conservative MPP for Newmarket-Aurora as well as Premier Doug Ford's health minister —  says the government would like to see the Southlake@home program replicated in other hospitals around the province. ""We recognize the difficulties that hospitals are experiencing,"" Elliott said in an interview. ""I'm sorry that anybody has to receive health care in a hallway.

Poilievre was expected to announce his candidacy on Sunday in Ottawa, but in a Facebook post late Thursday he said he would not be joining the race to replace outgoing leader Andrew Scheer. ""Over the last several weeks, I have been building a team and support for a possible run for the Conservative leadership. In criss-crossing the country, I have been overwhelmed with the favourable response,"" he wrote on Facebook. ""I knew it would be hard on my family life to do this. But I did not realize how hard. It is harder still because I had just spent the earlier 18 months campaigning furiously to win back my seat in the recent federal election, during which I mostly missed the first year of our baby's life."" ""As such, my heart is not fully engaged in this leadership race. Without being all in, I cannot be in at all. So I have decided not to seek the leadership of the party at this time."" Poilievre said he will continue to serve his Carleton constituents as an MP. He said he is not currently supporting any other candidate, but will look for a ""strong fiscal conservative who will unleash free enterprise so people can achieve their dreams through hard work."" WATCH | Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre won't run for the Conservative leadership: As recently as this week, Poilievre was outlining policy positions in a manner that suggested he was determined to run. He told the Toronto Star that under his leadership, Conservative MPs would be free to bring forward legislation on abortion and vote according to their conscience, but that such legislation would not be adopted under a Conservative government under his leadership. He also lashed out at Richard Décarie, a social conservative who says he intends to join the leadership race, for comments he'd made on CTV's Power Play suggesting that being gay is a ""choice"". ""The comments are as unacceptable as they are ignorant. You do not speak for Conservatives — or for Canadians. Being gay is NOT a choice. Being ignorant is,"" Poilievre wrote on Twitter. The comments are as unacceptable as they are ignorant. You do not speak for Conservatives—or for Canadians. Being gay is NOT a choice. Being ignorant is. <a href=""https://t.co/7zWLwQbQOH"">https://t.co/7zWLwQbQOH</a> Poilievre's wife Anaida also posted about his decision on Facebook, saying it was not taken lightly. ""Our family is young. My husband just wrapped up one full year of campaigning every day ... thus missing most of our daughter's first year of life. We can't have him missing more. Time cannot be bought back, and our baby girl is growing way too fast,"" she wrote. ""While we felt ready to tackle this challenge together as family, logistically it became a challenge bigger than expected,"" she added. ""We wish to be together more, and I hope people can understand that."" Former Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay has announced on Twitter that he intends to join the race. He's expected to formally join the race Saturday. Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu also has said she intends to join the race, and Ontario MP Erin O'Toole is expected to be a candidate. O'Toole's deputy campaign manager Melanie Paradis said Poilievre's decision to opt out means a narrow field of serious candidates. ""It's now a two-way race. We need a leader for 2020, not the 90s. A leader who can unite all parts the Conservative movement. That's Erin O'Toole,"" she said in a statement to CBC. Pierre has been a champion for our party and the conservative movement. I know he will continue to be an important voice. <a href=""https://t.co/ayvlN6XMOV"">https://t.co/ayvlN6XMOV</a> Gladu called the effort to frame the race as a two-person contest ""offensive.""

O'Toole responded to Poilievre's announcement on Twitter. ""Pierre has been a champion for our party and the conservative movement. I know he will continue to be an important voice,"" he wrote. Gladu told The Canadian Press today that the party's rules on fundraising and networking can be major barriers for women in politics.

277,Jason Proctor,2020-01-23T22:43:30.152Z,'Right needs to be done': Meng Wanzhou's lawyers make final pitch to judge,"A lawyer for Meng Wanzhou made a final pitch against extradition Thursday to the B.C. Supreme Court judge tasked with weighing the Huawei executive's fate. But Richard Peck told Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes that Meng's defence team was asking for more than just a legal victory. ""This is the kind of case that tests our system,"" Peck said as he wrapped up his arguments. ""It's not so much for us a matter of standing here and saying we want to see justice done. We say right needs to be done."" Holmes concluded the four-day hearing by thanking both defence and Crown lawyers for their work and reserving her decision for a later date. She gave no indication as to how long it might take. Meng was arrested at Vancouver's airport on Dec. 1, 2018, on a stopover from Hong Kong to a conference in Argentina. The United States wants Meng extradited for allegedly lying to HSBC about Huawei's control of a company accused of attempting to sell computer equipment to an Iranian telecommunications company. American prosecutors argue the bank put itself at risk of fines, prosecution and the loss of reputation by relying on Meng's alleged lie to continue providing finance to the Chinese telecommunications giant. Meng is living under house arrest in one of two multi-million dollar homes she owns in Vancouver. As part of a $10 million bail agreement, she wears a GPS monitoring bracelet on her left ankle and is trailed everywhere by a team of security guards. This week's hearing — which marked the first formal stage of the extradition process — was held to determine if Meng's alleged conduct would amount to a crime if it had happened in Canada at the time the U.S. gave Canada the authority to proceed with the extradition: the principle of so-called ""double criminality."" Meng's lawyers spent the first two days arguing that the whole case comes down to economic sanctions the U.S. reimposed against Iran in 2018 when it left an international deal meant to stall the Islamic republic's nuclear ambitions. Canada doesn't have those same sanctions and so, the defence claims, Meng's alleged lies would be harmless north of the border because a bank in Canada wouldn't risk anything by dealing with a company that did business in Iran. The Crown then spent half a day arguing the case was one of fraud, plain and simple, and that the issue of sanctions was essentially a red herring. Crown lawyer Robert Frater said the central elements of fraud are a misrepresentation resulting in risk of loss. And if the existence of foreign sanctions came into Holmes' decision, he said it should be as a means to understand the context of the risks that HSBC would be taking by providing finance to a company on the wrong side of U.S. law. Peck and co-counsel Scott Fenton provided a brief reply to the Crown's arguments Thursday, taking issue with Frater's contention that fraud and risk of deprivation could still occur ""where there is no possibility of loss."" ""This is an oxymoron,"" Fenton told the judge. ""No possibility of risk means no loss at all."" They also told Holmes that she could consider the value of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in making her decision — a response to the Crown's contention that weighing concerns about values associated with sanctions law was a concern for the minister of justice, not a B.C. Supreme Court judge. Both the Crown and the defence say the case is unique. But as to why, they disagree. ""It's unique because in our submission, it's a pose,"" Peck told Holmes. ""It is a pose or posture where fraud is being tendered as the essence [of the alleged conduct] and, in fact, sanctions busting or sanctions violations is the essence ... It's unique because our standards have changed with respect to this very issue. It's extraordinary in that sense."" Holmes allowed Meng to move out of the prisoner's dock in the high-security courtroom where the hearing was held so that she could sit alongside her counsel and follow the arguments through a translator. If Holmes decides the bar of double-criminality is not met, then the extradition proceedings will come to an end and Meng would be free to return to China, barring an appeal. But if the Crown is successful, further court dates have been set in June for Meng to argue that she is being used as a political pawn and that her rights were violated at the time of her detention and arrest.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/meng-wanzhou-huawei-criminality-1.5437989,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/community/new-episodes-of-sanctioned-the-arrest-of-a-telecom-giant-1.5067697 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/who-paid-for-the-fake-protest-outside-meng-wanzhou-s-hearing-we-still-don-t-know-1.5436448,N/A

First Nation to declare state of emergency","A string of drug and gang-related violence has prompted leaders of Onion Lake Cree Nation (OLCN) to declare a state of emergency. The community has experienced three deaths apparently connected to drug and gang activity in the last two months and there have been several high-speed chases and violent crimes. Officials at a news conference Friday said more needs to be done to address addictions, housing and other issues. But in the short term, the community needs more police to stop the violence. ""Right now, we are trying to deal with the immediate situation, how we can curb the fear among this nation,"" OLCN Okimaw (Chief) Henry Lewis said in a news conference Friday. The community of 4,000 people, which straddles the Saskatchewan-Alberta border just north of Lloydminster, already has 13 RCMP along with band security staff, but they're ""maxed out,"" Lewis said. Lewis said they need more police, especially ones with gang and drug expertise. Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) vice-chief Edward Dutch Lerat agreed safety must come first.. ""Every citizen of the nation deserves to greet each day knowing that their children, their families and their relatives are safe from illegal drug activity and violent crimes,"" Lerat said, pledging the FSIN's support. OLCN leaders say that in the space of a few hours on Tuesday, Jan. 21, RCMP were involved in a high-speed chase, a missing man's body was discovered and a stolen vehicle ran into the side of the OLCN Arena. RCMP are investigating the sudden death that happened in the community on Tuesday. The band held an emergency meeting and says it wants the government to help it create a gang strategy and increase police resources. ""The RCMP are working hard and trying their best but they need more help,"" said OLCN Okimaw (Chief) Henry Lewis in a release earlier Friday. ""Their resources are stretched too thin and our community needs the support of both levels of government before it gets worse.""  Lewis said they need more help to combat the gang activity in the community. ""This problem has been steadily increasing over the last year and it is now to the point that we are having three very serious and scary incidences happening in one day,"" he said. ""Everyone is stretched to their limits. We need the government to come to our tables and help us create a gang strategy and find solutions that will work for our nation. We need to increase policing resources, bring in external gang units or whatever is necessary to help our community members feel safe.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/onion-lake-cree-nation-gangs-violence-rcmp-1.5438817,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/onion-lake-second-degree-murder-charge-1.5334512 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/onion-lake-rcmp-death-in-custody-1.5319893 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/diphtheria-onion-lake-1.5436957,N/A
279,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-23T12:03:59.876Z,Vitalité presses for online help to fill gap in mental health services,"The province desperately needs online support for troubled people waiting months to see mental health professionals, says the vice-president of mental health at Vitalité Health Network. While someone with a severe mental health issue can be seen by a counsellor or therapist right away, Jacques Duclos said there needs to be better access to help those on the waiting list. ""We need to be able to identify services that fit your needs, depending on the severity. And to broaden the type of access to mental health services,"" said Duclos. He said the province is looking at introducing an online tool aimed at reducing wait times for people looking for mental health services in New Brunswick. Bridge the gApp is an online resource designed to support mental wellness. The program was introduced in 2015 and is funded by the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Residents can access important information and resources through technology, such as cell phones, tablets and computers. ""We really need to rethink our access … I think it will be difficult for any service provider to have the capacity to provide the [mental health] services,"" Duclos said. Bruce Macfarlane, a spokesperson for New Brunswick's Department of Health, said it's ""exploring all options"" but wouldn't confirm it's bringing in the app. But Dr. Peter Cornish, an associate professor at Memorial University involved in the development of Newfoundland and Labrador's mental health app, said he's worked on the New Brunswick version. Cornish said New Brunswick could be getting it as early as this year, becoming the second province to use this particular service. ""It expands your options that we wouldn't normally think that will be helpful to your mental health,"" Cornish said. The app connects people to self-help information, tools and local supports through a searchable service directory. Cornish said it also saved one woman's life. ""There's no one-size-fits-all for mental health support,"" Cornish said. According to a report by Stepped Care 2.0, an e-mental health demonstration project, the app attracted 28,000 users in 2018-2019, its fourth year of operation. The report also notes that in 2017-2018 wait times for addictions and mental health services in Newfoundland and Labrador were reduced by 68 per cent due to a combination of factors, one of them being e-mental health services. ""In some places, wait times were completely eliminated,"" Cornish said.  New Brunswick's app will be similar to Bridge the gApp, but it won't be identical. The Newfoundland and Labrador program is offered to both adults and youth and covers issues like depression, anxiety, eating disorders or someone looking for a peer support group. It also provides better access for people living in rural areas. John Abbott, CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association's Newfoundland and Labrador division, said the app isn't for everyone, but it is an advance in mental health services. ""It cannot replace face-to-face counselling and when that is needed,"" said Abbott. ""But it is certainly a very strong direction to support people where they are in their homes when face-to-face services are not readily available."" He said the app is also helpful for teens, who are typically more comfortable using technology.  In the future, there will be an option for people to track their mental health on the app, similar to a Fitbit, which measures a person's physical well-being. ""It will allow people to graph out how their mental wellness is progressing,"" said Cornish.  Depending on the severity of a person's mental health, Duclos said people seeking public mental health services in New Brunswick can wait several months before seeing a mental health professional. But the severity of a mental illness is different for each person.  If a person is suicidal or struggling with their daily routine, Duclos said they would be considered a priority and could be seen by a professional on the same day they reach out. ""For very acute situations, we do have the capacity,"" he said.   But if a person has some kind of ""resiliency,"" they could be a lower priority.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/bridge-the-gap-mental-health-services-1.5436494,[],N/A
280,Andie Bulman,2020-01-23T14:57:11.141Z,Bartering in the blizzard: How a neighbourhood managed before the stores reopened,"We'll always remember this storm.  Stories of how we tunneled through snowdrifts to free our neighbours, and collectively heralded Baby Snow as our once and future king, will be swapped for years. For me, the most significant lesson learned is that bartering and sharing are alive and well.  Like most of us, I barely left my house on Friday. I made one trek outdoors (I live in the Georgestown neighbourhood, not far from the downtown core), but mostly draped myself in blankets, played Scrabble, and prayed to the Netflix gods that we wouldn't lose power. Saturday came and our power flickered back on. I thanked the Netflix gods and the Light and Power B'ys. Then I turned on the radio. The state of emergency was already a day in effect. Roads were carless, stores were closed. The mayor warned that this could continue for at least a few days. My supplies had held up pretty good, but I made a few critical errors — most notably, I was already low on butter. I reached out to the world via Facebook. Beehak (a talented pastry chef) responded! She would be happy to trade a cup of butter for two eggs. We met halfway down Barnes Road and made the swap. It felt like something that would have happened in the 1930s. Later that day, I baked several blueberry crisps and bartered one for ground coffee and buttermilk (I wanted to make waffles). I also gave a blueberry crisp to my next-door neighbours. They had lent me snowshoes, so I could venture downtown into the carless snowglobe world. The trade seemed more than fair. I'm a creature who consumes tons of butter and after an afternoon of baking, I was low again. I emptied out my liquor cabinet and swapped vodka for more butter. Later in the day, I traded tonic water and limes for chips and tea bags.  Each time I left my house, I carried a backpack and shovel.  I stopped at neighbours' houses and pitched in along the way. The neighbourhood was alive. People were trading supplies, digging out fire hydrants, and helping each other out. I passed several bonfires, impromptu snowboarding trails and really gorgeous snow forts. I was constantly offered beer in exchange for my labour, which seemed especially generous considering what a hot commodity beer is in the barter system. I've been trying to do a dry January, so I declined each time. In one neighbourhood, a big Victorian house had set up a hot chocolate booth and from all over weary shovels stopped for a break. The snow was brutal, but compassion and sharing matched it tit for tat. Our own car was buried in a seven-foot drift. Friends, my husband and I tackled it for two hours and took a break. When I returned to my car, someone had blown it out completely. I could have kissed them — or at least given them a high five. By late Saturday, Mark Wilson, organic farmer and man about town, set up a Facebook Group called Stone Soup. It was/is a place where people could swap supplies or ask for help if their food ran out during the state of emergency. Some folks offered to trek across the city in skis to deliver toilet paper. Others baked bread and knocked on doors. I hope Mark keeps the site up, because it almost stands as a monument to both human kindness and the lack of food security we have in this province.  By Sunday, I had settled into my state of emergency routine. Shovel something for someone, catch up on missed work and emails, go for a walk and trade my supplies for other supplies, keep an eye on Stone Soup in case someone needed something that I had, and then read or play video games with my dog and husband.  Monday night, we had a neighbourhood cookout, something we haven't done before. Circular Road was like another world, never seen anything like it. Here's what it was like yesterday when ever a plow couldn't make it through the street <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#nlwx</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#blizzard2020</a> <a href=""https://t.co/nHKZdxnYbf"">pic.twitter.com/nHKZdxnYbf</a> Luke and Nina opened up their home and carved out some snow seats in their front lawn. Others baked treats, emptied out their freezers, and dragged over their barbecues. We had a celeriac, apple and moose sausage dish; carrot ginger soup; leek and potato soup; Jim Lahey's famous no-knead bread, ribs, moose chili, nachos and more blueberry crumble. Everyone brought their babies. The good cheer was palatable. I broke my resolution of having a dry January and had a glass of prosecco. After all of the bartering and kindness, sharing a drink with my neighbours had never seemed so important.

281,Pegah Salari,2020-01-16T18:50:22.772Z,OPINION | Tragedy broke Iranian community's heart. An outpouring of love will help it heal  ,"I was standing on the second floor at the Saville Centre, watching the team of volunteers prepare the stage about three hours before Sunday's memorial.  Baskets of flowers were being moved around and large framed pictures of the victims of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 were being placed in front of the podium.  Even from that distance, I could see the faces of the victims. It was as if they were watching the volunteers work.  Nasim Rahmanifar's picture, with her beautiful smile; I could imagine so vividly how she would be one of the people helping, if her face was not stuck in that frame forever.   How could a smile that beautiful be trapped forever inside a wooden frame? The picture of Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand with their two little girls fit so effortlessly among the flowers. My goodness, if Dorina or Daria were not gone, they would have been too young to attend this memorial! That is a piece of reality I don't have the strength to focus on. A few feet away, in yet another wooden frame, Dr. Shekoufeh Choupannejad and her two daughters Sara and Saba Saadat were standing side by side. On the far left side, Elnaz Nabiyi's photo somehow looked like the only one who was watching me as I looked at them from above. I cried in silence all through Sunday: getting ready as the emcee, in between the speeches, listening to the tributes, walking up and down from the podium. I cried as I watched people coming in, as I hugged friends and families, as I looked at the non-Iranian crowd who showed up to pay their respects even though they likely didn't know anyone.  A green room was assigned to the speakers and dignitaries; again, I cried as soon as I stepped into the room.  Going in, I wondered if my professor from back when I was a student would remember me.  Dr. Joseph Doucet, now dean of the school of business, saw me and came forward. Before I knew it, I was crying in his arms. It was as if I had graduated a week ago. It's amazing how 12 years can feel like a week and a week can feel like months. Sunday's memorial was a beautiful event.  And I'm not thinking that just because everything went well. The presence of people is what touched many grieving hearts.  With a loss this big, there is no relief. Nothing can help but time. And time doesn't always move like a river, especially not now.  Looking down at the main floor, watching the crowd come in, I thought to myself, ""I wish I could tell you, one by one, how much it means to see you here."" Going down the stairs for sound check, I passed by the media in the room. A CBC camera tech waved at me; I went down the stairs in tears.  How supportive everyone has been, every reporter, news anchor, radio host, freelance writer that I met after this tragic event. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did all these people become my friends? And friend is an understatement. What is the word for a person that you just met, who looks you in the eyes and makes you believe that you are not alone? I looked at the people, Iranian and non-Iranian, sitting side by side. It looked like a freshly knitted scarf, meshed like one piece. I thought, did we always feel so connected, so much like we belong?  When I went behind the podium to start, I felt a little tremble inside. I could see the first words that came out of my mouth, floating like snowflakes, dancing so calmly.  I looked at the crowd and at my words floating in front of me, and all of a sudden I felt so strong.  These are my people, all of them, Iranian or not. I knew that in my heart.  As O Canada was being sung, speaking in front of them didn't seem so hard. I only found out on Monday how many of my friends and co-workers had either attended, or watched, the memorial. Now, a week after the crash, our hearts like broken ceramics, we know it's time for us to speak up.  To glue ourselves back together, one piece at a time, with resilience and all this shared love — like kintsugi, the elegant ancient Japanese art of mending pottery.  The Iranian community has formed a new bond with Canada. This tragedy did break us apart but the love and support we received glued us back together, even stronger now. And like kintsugi, we will slowly heal, and with every day that goes by, we will become closer to our hosting country.  Not ashamed of our scars, we understand that our wounds are what makes us, us. It was –35 C on Sunday, and I believe I speak for every Iranian in Edmonton when I say we had never felt so warm. This column is an opinion.

282,Terry Roberts,2020-01-23T10:29:03.089Z,"With St. John's funeral business at a standstill in wake of blizzard, families struggle to say goodbye","Dozens of funerals have been put on hold in St. John's and area because of the extended state of emergency, and that's putting added stress on families trying to say goodbye to loved ones, and those who take care of the dead. ""People are going to have to be patient. Wait their turn, basically, is what it's come down to,"" said John Anderson, who manages Caul's Funeral Homes. ""It's very difficult. I feel for them. But that's the reality of this state of emergency at this time,"" added Father Cecil Critch, a Roman Catholic clergyman at the Basilica of St. John the Baptist. There hasn't been a memorial service at Caul's since Thursday, the day before a record-breaking blizzard delivered a massive amount of snow and punishing winds to much of eastern Newfoundland. St. John's implemented a state of emergency as the storm intensified, forcing businesses to close and vehicles off the streets. While restrictions have slowly been lifted, funeral homes remain closed. Churches are also closed, and most cemeteries — buried in a thick blanket of snow — are not expected to be ready to accept burials until next week. ""It's going to take us two to three days to clear it out,"" said Gordon Holden, who manages five cemeteries on behalf of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's. And when cemeteries are finally reopened, said Holden, it will be difficult to find burial plots because most grave markers are buried under the snow. ""We're going to have to start digging,"" said Holden. There's an unprecedented backlog of funerals at Caul's. Every wake room is filled. Bodies are lined up in the embalming room. ""We have 20 people in the building right now — that could be an urn or a person. That's quite a number of people awaiting services to take place. I've never seen it like this before. Never,"" said Anderson. Anderson knows of at least two cases of people dying during the height of the storm, and not being removed from their homes for up to 48 hours. One way to correct this in the future is to allow funeral homes to collect bodies during a state of emergency, with assistance from the city or other authorities, said Anderson. Some remains have been at the funeral home for a week, and services have been repeatedly rescheduled, only to be cancelled again, he said. So the home has stopped making any plans, until the all-clear comes from the city. Considering the snow-clogged condition of the streets, he agrees, it would not be wise to allow funeral homes to resume normal operations. ""If we had the general public here today, Lemarchant Road would just be filled. It wouldn't be fair to the neighbourhood,"" he said. So while the focus since Friday's storm has been on the living, it clearly hasn't been easy either for those who take care of the dead.

The clock was introduced in 1947 and is a symbolic representation of how close humanity is to destroying civilization. Typically, the hands are moved forward or back depending on how vulnerable the world is. Midnight represents a catastrophe. While the hands of the clock typically move a minute at a time, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved it forward by 30 seconds in 2017 and 2018, stopping at two minutes to midnight. It remained unchanged in 2019. ""It is 100 seconds to midnight. We are now expressing how close the world is to catastrophe in seconds — not hours, or even minutes,"" said Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ""It is the closest to Doomsday we have ever been in the history of the Doomsday Clock. We now face a true emergency — an absolutely unacceptable state of world affairs that has eliminated any margin for error or further delay."" In making the announcement, Bronson said the clock needed to be recalibrated — which is why it was moved 20 seconds — due to new concerns not taken into account in the past, including climate change. The farthest the clock's hands have been from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, at the end of the Cold War.  ""What we called the new abnormal last year … now has become apparently an enduring reality,"" said Robert Rosner, chair of the bulletin's science and security board. In reaching their decision — which was made in November — the scientists said they took into account three concerning issues: nuclear weapons, climate change and cyber-based disinformation. ""As long as nuclear weapons remain in existence, it is inevitable that they will one day be used, whether by accident, miscalculation or design,"" said Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, a group of world leaders working to promote human rights and other important world issues. Sivan Kartha, a member of the bulletin's science and security board and senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute, said the state of the world demands an emergency response, citing the record-breaking heat waves and floods in India, recent hurricanes and the wildfires that raged from the Arctic to Australia in 2019. ""If the Earth warms by what we tend to think of just a few degrees … we have no reason to be confident that such a world will remain hospitable to human civilization,"" said Kartha, who was also the author of the fifth and sixth assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Former California governor Jerry Brown, who is the bulletin's executive chair, gave a fiery speech. He said while he's not a scientist, he recognizes the importance of the symbolic clock and that it's the only way to let the world know the threats to civilization.

284,Anonymous,2020-01-24T19:25:06.821Z,Psychiatrist testifies about 'rape myths' at Harvey Weinstein trial,"A forensic psychiatrist with expertise in rape trauma took the stand as a prosecution witness at former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's Manhattan rape trial on Friday, explaining why some sexual assault victims do not report attacks or avoid their abusers. Barbara Ziv, who also testified for prosecutors at entertainer Bill Cosby's 2018 sexual assault retrial, said popular views of sexual assault were often coloured by ""rape myths,"" including that rape usually occurs between strangers. Ziv said most victims of rapes and sexual assaults know their attackers, do not fight back during the attacks, and maintain contact with their attackers. She also said some resist coming forward promptly because they feel ashamed or fear retribution. ""They're hoping that this was just an aberration,"" said Ziv, who teaches at Temple University in Philadelphia. Ziv's testimony could help prosecutors show jurors why some women who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct might have stayed in contact with him after it occurred. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting two women, Mimi Haleyi and Jessica Mann, and other charges that could put him in prison for life if he were convicted. The trial is expected to last into March. Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, fuelling the #MeToo movement. Weinstein has denied any nonconsensual sex, and his lawyers said in opening statements on Wednesday that emails from his accusers would show they maintained warm relations. The trial is widely seen as a watershed moment for #MeToo, in which women have accused powerful men in business, entertainment, media and politics of sexual misconduct. On cross-examination, Weinstein lawyer Damon Cheronis confronted Ziv with her testimony in a separate case where a student sued her school over an alleged sexual assault. According to Cheronis, Ziv testified for the defence that had the student been conscious she could have spoken up against her attacker. But Ziv said the comment was taken out of context. Cheronis also asked Ziv if a woman could view a consensual encounter years later as nonconsensual because she had come to regret it. ""Anything is possible,"" Ziv answered. ""It's not usual."" On Thursday, actress Annabella Sciorra from The Sopranos testified that Weinstein had violently raped her in her home in the early 1990s, and then harassed her for years. While that alleged conduct occurred too long ago to support a separate rape charge against Weinstein, prosecutors hope it will show that Weinstein is a repeat sexual predator, the charge that could put him in prison for life. Sciorra testified that her encounter with Weinstein left her depressed, causing her to drink heavily and cut herself, and unable to tell her family what had happened. Under questioning from another of Weinstein's lawyers, Donna Rotunno, Sciorra acknowledged that she had not reported the alleged rape to authorities or sought medical help. ""At the time, I didn't understand that it was rape,"" she said.

285,Anonymous,2020-01-23T12:58:26.566Z,From dirty roofs to flat wheels: 8 causes of LRT delays,"Members of Ottawa's transit commission assemble for a special meeting Thursday to discuss what's behind issues on the city's four-month-old Confederation Line.  The light-rail system has been thrown off schedule at least once each of the last eight days, the longest streak of disruptions to its schedule since its launch in late summer. This is the fourth straight day the system doesn't have enough trains to keep its schedule because of the number of trains out of service for repairs. Members of the transit commission plan to question officials with both OC Transpo and Rideau Transit Maintenance, the company contracted to maintain the LRT, about these recent problems. So far, OC Transpo has shared 14 different reasons why the LRT has had trouble running reliably and on time. Here's a look at eight of them: Malfunctioning doors were one of the first major issues. In October, repeated door jams prompted the city to look at how Rideau Transit Group installed the sensors to make sure they were calibrated properly. The city also ramped up communications to passengers not to force open doors. OC Transpo has pointed to door issues 15 times as the cause of LRT delays. A problem with a computer controlling one train caused big crowds to form at stations in October. Computer resets should happen quite quickly, the city said at the time. The delay prompted the city to look into why the on-board computer couldn't be rebooted faster. That's the only time OC Transpo has specifically said a computer failure was to blame. In November, the city cited central computer system problems for delays on the LRT. We don't yet know much about this issue. LRT builder has 'failed' residents, city manager says In the fall, the city said fibreglass covers protecting sensors from snow at track switches were an issue. The covers were then removed and maintenance workers were expected to increase the number of times snow was cleared from the sensors and monitor for build-up. On Saturday the city blamed snow, a lack of maintenance and a heater that was not working properly for switch issues at Blair station that caused a two-and-a-half hour delay.  On Sunday a switch at Blair malfunctioned again but it's not clear whether snow was the culprit.  Switch problems have been singled out as the cause of a Confederation Line issue nine times. Keeping train roofs clear of dirt and debris is proving to be a challenge for Rideau Transit Maintenance. Earlier in January the city blamed a buildup of gunk around the pantograph, the accordion-like apparatus on the roofs of LRT trains that connect to the power source, for two trains stopping on New Year's Eve. We still do not know how a lengthy power cable got pulled at down at St. Laurent station on Jan. 16, causing OC Transpo to stop running trains between Hurdman and Blair stations. Rideau Transit Maintenance has said it appears the wire got snagged on something as the train entered the station but the root cause is still under investigation.  The train affected by the broken cable had to undergo repairs and was pulled out of service, contributing to the train shortage this week.  When LRT train wheels don't turn, they drag. It's an issue known as wheel flats and it's something crews with Rideau Transit Maintenance are supposed to be keeping a close eye on. The city blamed wheel flats as the main reason OC Transpo couldn't run enough trains during rush hour this week. The chair of Ottawa's transit commission, Coun. Allan Hubley, said Tuesday he doesn't believe Rideau Transit Maintenance has been doing a thorough enough job watching for flats. A compressor fault was one of the reasons cited by the city this week for train shortages.  We have yet to receive more details about this problem.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/eight-problems-ottawa-light-rail-lrt-1.5436771,[],N/A

These arts stand to be lost in the age of mass production and planned obsolescence. Photos taken on film are meant to last but when they're forgotten about and sit undeveloped, especially for a long period of time, it gets trickier to recover those memories.  That's where Greg Miller, of Film Rescue International in Indian Head, Sask., steps in. ""It's great work. We've never got rich doing this work, but we've always been highly entertained,"" Miller said.  The stories customers tell him tend to be similar: a family member died, then they go through their belongings and old rolls of undeveloped film are discovered. Sometimes, the photos are ""a bit naughty"" or sexually explicit, but Miller said, for the most part, family members are excited to see them and rarely ask for those to be withheld in their final package of images. He noted the company is intensely private the images they process,  so they can't accidentally be leaked. Because regular film processing labs, which are increasingly rare, don't always have the right chemicals or materials to process those rolls of undeveloped film, this business 70 kilometres east of Regina, fills that niche.  When he started the business in 1999, Miller would get two or three phone calls a week from prospective customers.  That changed when he was put on Kodak's referral list; he then started to receive 20 to 30 calls a day. Miller said the company has worked with film dating as far back as the 1920s, and has done work with various law enforcement agencies, two presidential libraries, the Smithsonian Institution and for customers from around the world. ""It's opening time capsules for a living, basically,"" Miller said.  ""That's fun work. To this day, I love the job. I like getting up in the morning and seeing what we'll discover."" In particular, Miller said he enjoys working with old, high-quality photo negatives. He said they're similar to antiques, and he likes seeing how careful people were about taking photographs because they were expensive and more difficult to make. Miller said the company is working to future-proof his business. The company is relaunching its website soon, and it will be shining a light on the business's film scanning and archive digitization services as well as their film recovery work.  He said it's not always the most exciting work, but it's work that will keep the business alive as there becomes less and less old film to process.  ""We're always trying to innovate and do that type of work better than other people,"" Miller said.  Read other pieces from the Made to Last series:",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-photo-film-recovery-digitization-1.5429355,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-luthier-1.5423298 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-bookbinding-1.5403310 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-venice-tailors-1.5402224 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/made-to-last-franks-shoe-repair-1.5403245,N/A
287,"Rosa Marchitelli, Ana Komnenic",2019-07-08T18:29:27.210Z,"Mother who watched son burn to death in SUV fire joins calls for answers from Kia, Hyundai ","When Carol Nash heard screams for help, she rushed out of her apartment in her nightgown and found her SUV burning in the parking lot — but couldn't get close enough to save her son, sitting in the driver's seat. ""I could not do anything except stand there and watch him die,"" Nash told Go Public. Keith Nash, 48, burned to death on April 19, 2017, in his mother's 2014 Kia Soul while the vehicle was parked outside her low-rise apartment building in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother says Kia has never contacted her to explain what happened. She was devastated when she learned the company issued a recall for the SUV for a potential fire risk in February — two years after her son died. ""I suffer on a daily basis with this because I have no answers,"" she said.  Since 2015, Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia have recalled more than three million vehicles in North America over concerns the engines could fail at high speeds or burst into flames. A Go Public investigation revealed other models weren't on any Canadian recall lists when drivers experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires. After the CBC News investigation, both Kia and Hyundai vastly expanded the number of recalls in Canada. Hyundai is a part-owner of Kia. Automobile safety advocates and vehicle owners accuse the two companies of downplaying fire and engine failure reports and taking too long to roll out recalls, raising questions about when they first knew of the safety issues and whether more vehicles might still pose a risk. ""We now have multiple years of reports of these catastrophic engine failures and the very slow reaction from the companies,"" said Jason Levine, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. The automakers say they are on top of the problems and are working with Transport Canada to address them. The official cause of death for Keith Nash was smoke and gas inhalation. Fire investigators believe the blaze started in the engine area, but weren't able to determine the exact cause.  In an email to Go Public, Kia suggests that fentanyl and heroin found in Nash's system may have rendered him unconscious and unable to get out of the burning car. The auto giant also says Nash may have caused the fire by simultaneously pressing down on the accelerator and brake pedals while the vehicle was in ""drive"" mode, causing the transmission fluid to ignite — an issue unrelated to the recall issued two years later, the company says. Go Public put that to Hamilton mechanic Chris Solodko, who has repaired dozens of Kia and Hyundai vehicles following engine failures. He says it's very rare for transmission fluid to catch fire. According to Solodko, Nash would have had to apply an enormous amount of pressure to the brake while holding the accelerator down to keep the SUV from moving and causing the transmission fluid to heat up to the point of catching fire. Carol Nash isn't the only one who wants answers.  Go Public has heard from dozens of Hyundai and Kia owners who say they've experienced catastrophic engine failure or fires with vehicles that aren't part of any recall.  Robert Mitchell recalled getting a panicked phone call from his 30-year-old son Ryan on Aug. 11. Ryan told him he was driving the family's 2016 Hyundai Elantra down one of the busiest highways in the Toronto area — the 403 — when the engine seized and started to smoke before bursting into flames.  ""I don't think that a car — any car — should blow up and burn like that,"" Robert Mitchell said from the family's home in Mississauga, Ont. Mitchell's insurance company paid for the destroyed car. According to Transport Canada, the fire started in the engine compartment, but the cause is unknown. Another Hyundai Elantra, a 2018 model, is at the centre of a fire investigation in Windsor, N.S. On March 27, an Elantra that had been parked in front of a duplex for hours burst into flames. The fire spread to the building, but the families inside escaped unhurt. Video of overnight fire that destroyed century old home in Windsor but two families escape via dramatic rescue.<a href=""https://twitter.com/CBCNS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@CBCNS</a> <a href=""https://t.co/0Rj84mGTtv"">pic.twitter.com/0Rj84mGTtv</a> Hyundai Canada and Transport Canada didn't confirm the cause of the fire. Transport Canada says the investigation is now in the hands of a private insurance company. Kia and Hyundai are now facing a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and at least two in Canada over the engine breakdowns and fires. The recalls issued so far cover certain Hyundai and Kia models produced after 2011, mostly involving a variety of safety concerns around what are called Theta-II engines. In some cases, the recalls address mechanical issues that could lead to engine failure. In others, software is installed that gives drivers advance warning of an engine problem.  Levine says his organization is seeing other types of engines breaking down or burning. He points out, for example, that Nash's Kia Soul — which was recalled in February — and the Hyundai Elantra don't have Theta engines. ""It's certainly troubling that it's going on at least several years ... these non-crash fires across a variety of makes and models, not only the Theta-II,"" he said. Go Public asked both Kia Canada and Hyundai Canada when they first knew about the engine defects, but neither company answered the question. Hyundai Canada was asked if it had a fix for the engine problems, but again, it didn't respond to the question directly. In an email, Hyundai Canada told Go Public that over the past 10 years, there have been 12 cases of engine fires determined to be a result of an issue with the vehicle itself. ""We stand behind the quality of our products and continuously work to ensure the highest safety standards for our customers,"" spokesperson Bianca Pettinaro wrote. She says the company has issued notices for all the vehicles that could be affected and is keeping an eye on the issues.   In another email, Kia Canada spokesperson Mark James wrote, ""A vehicle engine failure or fire can occur due to any number of complex factors, including inadequate maintenance, arson, or some other non-vehicle source, all cases must be carefully evaluated by trained technicians to determine its cause."" He says Kia has a strong safety record and promptly reports safety-related defects to Transport Canada. Hyundai and Kia are now being investigated by regulators in several countries — including Canada and the U.S. — over safety defects that may have led to engine failures and fires not caused by crashes.  Nearly 540,000 Hyundai and Kia vehicles are now under recall in Canada due to risk of engine failure or fire. Transport Canada is investigating whether more models should be part of the recalls after getting approximately 200 complaints about engines since 2014. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the U.S. is investigating engine failures and fires in certain model years. As of the end of March, the regulator had received more than 3,000 complaints of fires not related to collisions, including 103 injuries and one death. Those are the kind of answers Carol Nash is looking for — and that need to come from the automakers involved, she says.  ""I just don't want this ever for any other parent or any other mother to go through what I went through on that day."" Last November, both Kia and Hyundai refused to testify at a congressional hearing that was scheduled to look into the engine fires. That hearing was cancelled after the automakers declined to attend.  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

In 2005, her 21-year-old sister, Jessica Holman-Price, and 10-year-old brother, Peter Luc, were standing on a corner waiting to cross when a snow removal truck, turning right, nipped the curb. That sent a snow bank falling, knocking the pair under the truck.  ""If it wasn't for the snow bank, if it wasn't for the narrow roads, the chances of her being with us today are strong,"" Hann said 15 years later.  She said with the number of pedestrian-vehicle collisions before the record-breaking snowfall last weekend, she's worried.  ""There's just nowhere right now that's safe for pedestrian or vehicle traffic,"" Hann said from her home in Mount Pearl.  With all municipalities set to terminate the state of emergency by 6 a.m. Saturday, Hann thinks it's too soon.  Between the volume of snow and the number of pedestrians out at night in dark clothing without reflective gear, she said it's dangerous.  ""Operators just can't see them. When you're talking 15-, 20-foot snowbanks, you're not seeing a five- or six-foot person,"" said Hann.  Hann said she doesn't know what will make people listen to the calls for drivers and pedestrians to exercise extreme caution on the roads, but hopes her plea will help.  ""You're not invincible. Your bodies are breakable. You get one chance at this life and it's not worth it to go for a walk.""

289,Anonymous,2020-01-21T17:33:52.163Z,"Boys and young men more likely to die than girls and young women, study finds","A new Canadian study shows boys and young men are more likely to die than girls and young women, and they have a greater chance of dying due to injury, particularly from age 14 onwards. The study, published this month in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at 3.1 million children born in Ontario between 1990 and 2016 and examined who died and from what cause between the ages of one and 24. Researchers excluded those who died in their first year of life, saying those deaths are generally due to congenital anomalies or other causes that are not readily preventable. They found boys and young men had a greater tendency to die, especially starting at age 14, and were three times more likely to do so than young women by age 24. Deaths due to injury also increased after age 14, while intentional causes such as suicide accounted for one in five male deaths from injury between the ages of 15-24, and one in six female deaths from injury in that age group. The study says nearly half of injury deaths were due to accidental poisoning or overdose. Transport accidents were the second leading cause of injury-related death for all sexes from age 15 onwards, accounting for roughly a third. But it notes not all deaths had a documented cause, and it was not known which were confirmed by autopsy or an on scene investigation. Some suicides can be misclassified as accidental poisonings, which could mean more teen deaths were due to suicide than the data reflect, the study says. Lead author Dr. Joel Ray, a clinician-scientist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, said the jump in deaths during adolescence, particularly in boys, is ""likely"" due to an increase in risk-taking behaviours, but said biological factors and changes may play a role in those behaviours as well. In any case, the study shows more mental health supports are needed for teenagers and preteens, he said. ""We have this upswing [in deaths] right around this age in which we would argue strongly that a lot of these deaths are actually preventable and definitely untimely,"" said Ray, who is also affiliated with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences.

290,"Stephanie Hogan, Benjamin Blum",2020-01-24T17:25:36.440Z,What we know (and don't know) about the new coronavirus outbreak,"The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that it's too soon to consider the new coronavirus identified in China as an international health emergency — but it could develop into one, the organization's chief said. On Monday, China confirmed there has been human-to-human transmission of the virus. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the disease from family members. Some medical staff have also been infected, but no number was confirmed.  As of Jan. 24, 830 cases of the newly identified coronavirus have been confirmed in China, most in Wuhan, according to Chinese health authorities. Twenty-five people have died — all in China, including some who had a previous medical condition. The update Friday morning also confirmed the first death outside the central province of Hubei, where Wuhan is located. There have also been cases reported in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and, as of Thursday, Hong Kong and Macau, with most involving people from Wuhan or those who had recently travelled there. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. They cause a range of illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases — such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). SARS was the coronavirus that originated in China in late 2002, and which eventually killed 44 people in Canada and infected more than 400 before the outbreak in China was declared by the WHO to be ""under control"" on Apr. 28, 2004.  The WHO's China office was first informed of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec. 31, 2019. The cases were all detected in Wuhan City. A new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the probable cause by Chinese authorities Jan. 7. The WHO reported the evidence was ""highly suggestive"" that the source was a seafood market that also sells live poultry and meat from exotic animals in Wuhan.  Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they pass from animals to humans. But some, like this newly identified strain, can pass directly between humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., coronaviruses are most commonly spread by coughing or sneezing; close personal contact, such as shaking hands; or touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose.  The initial symptoms of 2019-nCoV are mainly fever, with a few reports of people having difficulty breathing, and chest x-rays showing signs of pneumonia in both lungs. According to the WHO, signs of infection can include respiratory complaints, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.  The only way to confirm 2019-nCoV is with a lab test. The Canadian government urged travellers on Thursday to ""exercise a high degree of caution in China due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws,"" a notice that is one level below an official travel advisory. Watch | Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discusses the virus: The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) deems the risk to Canadians visiting Wuhan as low. But it has updated its travel advisory, urging Canadians to take precautions, such as avoiding large crowds and high-risk areas such as farms and slaughterhouses, and avoiding contact with anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of a coronavirus, such as fever, cough or difficulty breathing. There have been no confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV in Canada, according to Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam. She says three people in Canada who had travelled to Wuhan were investigated for the virus, but results were negative.  PHAC says it will introduce measures in the coming week, including signs at airports in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, advising travellers from affected areas of the world to inform border services staff of any flu-like symptoms.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a Level 3, recommending people avoid all non-essential travel to Wuhan. A CDC spokesperson later said the agency is seeking emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow states to use its diagnostic test for the outbreak. Earlier this week, the agency said it expected to see more cases in the U.S. after a man was found carrying the virus in Seattle on Wednesday. It has announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago after having already started screening people coming on direct flights from Wuhan at New York City's JFK International Airport, San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. WATCH | How Canadian researchers test for coronavirus: The newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are a number of unknowns surrounding it. It is too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people, and there is no vaccine yet for the virus. Analysts predicted cases will continue to multiply, although the jump in numbers is also attributable in part to increased monitoring. Dr. Gauden Galea, the WHO's representative in China, said the number of infected is not an indicator of the outbreak's severity so long as the death rate remains low.  ""Even if [cases] are in the thousands, this would not surprise us,"" Galea said. Chinese authorities on Thursday moved to lock down at least three cities — including Wuhan, where the train station and airport were shut down and ferry, subway and bus service was halted. In Beijing, officials cancelled major events indefinitely, including traditional temple fairs that are a staple of holiday celebrations in the capital. Chinese officials have not said how long the shutdowns will last. While sweeping measures are typical of China's government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world — even in deadly epidemics — because of concerns about infringing on people's liberties. The effectiveness of such measures is also unclear. Make no mistake, though, this is an emergency in China. But it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. - Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. Watch: Tedros explains why the new coronavirus is not a global emergency yet: To my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people [Wuhan] is new to science. - Gauden Galea, WHO representative in China. This outbreak is extremely concerning. Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it is now clear that there is person-to-person transmission.  - Dr. Jeremy Farrar, infectious disease specialist. We don't know enough to know whether we should be worried … If this is a virus that can sustain itself in humans now — is transmitted from person to person and lives in humans — then the Lunar New Year travel will spread it faster in China, no doubt. If this is a virus that is not sustainable in human populations, if it doesn't transmit well enough, then the Lunar New Year means we'll see new cases, it will create a lot of concern, but it won't cause problems.  - Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious disease specialist, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto WATCH: Dr. Allison McGeer of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital speaks to CBC News about the new coronavirus outbreak. The one piece of good news we have here is that this is possibly not as virulent a virus as SARS and won't result in as many deaths, but almost all the other news we have at the moment is unfortunately bad news … Fourteen medical staff infected from the first 200 cases is quite a high number. But on the other hand, the medical staff are in very close contact with the patients there, they're in the hospital wards and so on. And therefore, they're at greater risk than the general public.  - Dr. Derek Gatherer, Lancaster University",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-wuhan-canada-1.5433625,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-expert-panel-coronavirus-emergency-decision-1.5437473 https://www.cbc.ca/news/china-coronavirus-wuhan-public-health-1.5437217 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/coronavirus-timeline-1.5438115,N/A

Go Public has been flooded with messages from some who say when it came time to deliver, the so-called Weight Loss Grants Program wouldn't pay out, or dragged customer claims out for months before cutting a cheque. During our investigation, we heard from dozens of dissatisfied customers unhappy with the program run by a private, for-profit company. Some thought, because of its name, it was a government-run program issuing ""grants."" The Weight Loss Grants Organization now has a notice on its website that the grants program ""has now concluded.""  ""It's good for the consumer,"" said Richel Prevost, of Calgary, who heard about the program on the radio two years ago. At the time, Prevost, 5'6"", was tipping the scales at over 200 pounds and desperate to lose weight.  She thought she'd found the solution — a grant program that would give her access to a high-end diet program then reimburse her for up to 80 per cent of the cost when she lost the weight. She was wrong.  ""I literally worked my butt off and I just don't feel like their end of the bargain is being held up,"" Prevost said. She signed up in September 2017 and paid $2,400 up front to the diet clinic the grants company recommended. She said she was told if she used Dalewood Health Clinic she'd get up to 80 per cent back in a grant, up to 20 per cent if she used a different one.  Prevost said she lost 50 pounds on her own through diet and exercise and reached her weight loss goal five months early. A year later, she is still trying to collect her grant.  ""It felt like they were moving the goalposts,"" Prevost said.""Every time that they asked for something different I complied."" Her grant was recently denied based on a rule that didn't exist when she lost the weight.  The Weight Loss Grants Organization told Go Public Prevost won't be getting her grant because she recorded her final weight five months early instead of on the exact deadline date. That rule was introduced in April, long after Prevost finished the program and submitted her paperwork. ""You can't change the rules like that in the middle and deny me my claim based on something that you implemented after the fact,"" Prevost said.  Jenn Granger from Calgary paid Dalewood $2,100, lost weight, and met all the requirements in October. Her grant was also denied based on the rule that kicked in last month. ""I'm not sure how we would possibly be able to follow such a rule when I submitted [for the grant] six months before they made the change,"" Granger wrote Go Public in an email. The Weight Loss Grants Organization didn't respond when Go Public asked how a new rule can apply to old cases. David Stein, who describes himself as the adjudicator at the Weight Loss Grants Organization, said Granger's grant was denied because the letter she submitted from the medical clinic to prove her weight loss ""does not appear to be legitimate.""  Go Public spoke with some people who say they did get their grants. The Weight Loss Grants Organization's website has a long list of thank-you letters from participants who say the program helped them lose weight.  Those letters are a requirement before the company will even consider paying out a grant.  Larry Smith said he wrote a thank-you letter and last August and received an email saying his $1,920 grant was approved but after months passed with no payout, Smith contacted Go Public. Stein said Smith hasn't received a cheque because he failed to get a required letter from his doctor. No one from the company told Smith. The Better Business Bureau of Central Ontario has given the Weight Loss Grants Organization an ""F"" and Dalewood a ""D"" rating due to the high number of customer complaints. ""Consumers feel like they've achieved the requirements of the grants but for what might be a technical reason, they're not getting the grant at the end,"" said spokesperson Patrick McKeen. Dalewood is now in the process of changing its name to Trillium Weight Loss. It turns out Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are connected. Go Public found the two companies shared an address for years and have a senior manager who works for both companies. In emails and letters to clients, George Scodras refers to himself as the director of operations of Dalewood and of the Weight Loss Grants Program. He was also listed as director of operations for Dalewood on its website, until Go Public started asking questions about his connection to both companies.  All references to Scodras have since been removed from the Dalewood website, while the Trillium website lists him as a ""managing consultant.""  We asked the Weight Loss Grants Organization how much it has paid out in grants since the program started in 2015, and why so many people have complained about not getting money they thought they were due.  ""The total number of grants paid out as of April 30th, 2019, is $733,552.71 (according to info given to me),"" Dalewood spokesperson Marissa Mayles wrote in an email to Go Public. That number can't be verified, but Go Public did speak with other former customers who say they got their full grants after using Dalewood. Clients say they weren't told about any connections between the Weight Loss Grants Program and Dalewood when they signed up. In an email to Go Public, Mayles said, ""we do not feel that there is a conflict of interest … Nobody is obligated to sign up with Dalewood and they can go wherever they like to lose their weight."" Mayles didn't give her exact title, but said she works in the finance and administration departments at Dalewood.  She is also the wife of the company's founder, Darren Morgenstern, who also founded Ashley Madison, the adulterous dating site with the slogan ""Life is short. Have an affair."" Morgenstern sold Ashley Madison in 2007.  Mayles said Dalewood and the Weight Loss Grants Organization are not connected but, ""the owners are all connected and know each other well and the relationships predate either business."" As for Scodras, she said he's not an employee of either Dalewood or the Weight Loss Grants Organization but ""a temporary consultant ... an impartial disinterested party that is acting on behalf of all parties, including grant applicants.""  Stein said the Weight Loss Grants Organization will continue to honour ""legitimate grant requests,"" even though the program has been shut down. ""There have been too many problems which began for us late last year when we had to start enforcing our rules and having zero tolerance for improper documents, but we had no choice as there were far too many bogus grant claims,"" he told Go Public. The grants company has posted a reaction to Go Public's story on its website. The Dalewood and Trillium websites both have postings saying they're no longer accepting new clients affiliated with the Weight Loss Grants Organization. Prevost said she plans to file a fraud report with police and may try to take the company to court. ""I am not in a position to lose $2,000,"" she said, ""The reason I did this is because I thought I was going to get my money back ... this is crazy.""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

293,Elizabeth Fraser,2020-01-23T21:26:05.755Z,Woman pleads guilty to helping cover up Candace Stevens's homicide,"A Moncton woman has confessed she helped cover up the crime of the man who killed Candace Stevens in 2018. Wendy Losier, 42, was charged earlier with comforting or assisting James Curtis, also known as James Knight, on Oct. 26, 2018, for the purpose of enabling him to escape. She was also accused of transporting Stevens's remains on Oct. 27. Court documents show Losier pleaded guilty to the charges before the Court of Queen's Bench on Wednesday. The documents present the first picture of what happened the day Stevens was shot to death at Curtis and Losier's home in Fredericton. Stevens's remains were found inside a hockey bag on Oct. 27, 2018 in Upper Derby, near Miramichi. She was the mother of a young girl and was working at a Fredericton spa at the time of her death. Curtis was the same man who opened fire at a Walmart in 2018, then died at the end of a lengthy police chase. The court documents reveal Stevens showed up at 530 Regent St. in Fredericton on Oct. 26, 2018, looking to speak with someone by the name of ""Nick."" She believed he was responsible for shots fired at her car. Stevens ""physically assaulted"" Curtis and Losier, the documents say. Curtis tried to calm Stevens down and said he was on his way to call ""Nick"" to discuss the damage to Stevens's car. Documents show Stevens tried to push her way up the stairs, shoving Losier against a TV and coffee table. Curtis returned with a gun in one hand and a cellphone in the other. When Losier left the two alone and went back upstairs to her bedroom, she heard between two and five gunshots coming from downstairs. Autopsy results found multiple gunshot wounds to Stevens's chest and abdomen, which caused lethal bleeding. She also had multiple illicit drugs in her system. When Losier came back downstairs to see what happened, she saw Stevens lying on the floor, begging for help. Still holding onto the gun, Curtis ordered Losier to pack a bag. He told her they were going to Miramichi. He then made some phone calls to people saying, ""I need help"" and ""I'm coming to the Miramichi."" Curtis was ""white as a ghost"" and crying when he told Losier he shot and killed Stevens.   But with the help of a friend, whose name was not mentioned in the documents, Curtis moved Stevens's body to the basement, while Losier smoked drugs and packed a bag upstairs. Losier told police they were high on crystal meth and Curtis was snorting pills. The duo slept at a friend's place that night and returned for the body the next morning, although Losier refused to go back inside the building. They also brought an undisclosed number of guns with them.  Curtis packed Stevens's body into a large hockey bag. Her body had been wrapped in hospital blankets with a yellow cord and plastic bags held together with red tuck tape. Her body was placed in the trunk of Losier's Saturn Ion. They were on their way to Miramichi when Curtis stopped the vehicle on a dirt road off Highway 8 near Blackville, where Curtis left the hockey bag on the dirt road. Afterward, they stayed together at Curtis's parents' home in Miramichi. There, Curtis told his mom that he shot someone and that person died. While they were there, the Regent Street apartment where Stevens died was also set on fire.  At the time, Fredericton police said Stevens's death was considered a homicide, and the house fire was connected to her death.  A sentencing hearing for Losier will be held in Fredericton on Feb. 21.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wendy-gail-losier-moncton-homicide-case-1.5437894,[],N/A
294,Kris Rowe,2019-12-27T09:00:00.675Z,The race to exascale is on — while Canada watches from the sidelines,"This column is an opinion by Kris Rowe, a computational scientist working to get science and engineering applications ready for the next generation of exascale supercomputers. Born and educated in Canada, he has worked at major Canadian and American Universities, as well as two U.S. national laboratories. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. Some of the brightest minds from around the globe have been quietly working on technology that promises to turn the world on its head, but so far Canada has been watching from the sidelines. While it is unlikely that people will be huddled around their televisions to watch the power to these incredible machines being switched on, the scientific discoveries that follow the debut of exascale computers will change our daily lives in unimaginable ways. So what exactly is an exascale computer? It's a supercomputer capable of performing more than a billion billion calculations per second — or 1 exaflops. ""Exa"" is the metric system prefix for such grandiose numbers, and ""flops"" is an abbreviation of ""floating-point operations per second."" For comparison, my laptop computer is capable of about 124 gigaflops, or 124 billion calculations per second, which sounds fast. According to the TOP500 list, today's fastest supercomputer is Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Summit, which tops out at a measured 148.6 petaflops — about one million times faster than my laptop. However, Summit is a mere welterweight relative to an exascale supercomputer, which is more than 60 times faster. To put that speed in perspective, if you took all the calculations a modern laptop can perform in a single second, and instead did the arithmetic non-stop with pencil and paper at a rate of one calculation per second, it would take roughly 3,932 years to finish. In a single second, a supercomputer capable of 1 exaflops could do a series of calculations that would take about 31.7 billion years by hand. While colloquially a supercomputer is referred to as a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of servers — or compute nodes — connected by a dedicated high-speed network. You might assume that an exascale supercomputer could be built simply by using 60 times more compute nodes than today's fastest supercomputer; however, the cost, power consumption, and other constraints make this approach nearly impossible. Fortunately, computer scientists have an ace up their sleeves, known as a GPU accelerator. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are the professional-grade cousins of the graphics card in your personal computer and are capable of performing arithmetic at a rate of several teraflops (ie. really, really fast). And a feasible route to exascale can be realized by not only making supercomputers larger but also denser. Sporting six extremely powerful GPUs per compute node, Argonne National Laboratory's Aurora will follow this approach. Scheduled to come online in 2021, Aurora will be the first exascale supercomputer in North America — although the title of first in the world may go to China's Tianhe-3, which is slated to power up sometime in 2020. Several other machines in the U.S., China, Europe and Japan are scheduled to be brought to life soon after Aurora, using similar architectures What exactly does one do with all that computing power? Change the world, of course. Exascale supercomputers will allow researchers to tackle problems which were impossible to simulate using the previous generation of machines, due to the massive amounts of data and calculations involved. Small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) design, wind farm optimization and cancer drug discovery are just a few of the applications that are priorities of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project. The outcomes of this project will have a broad impact and promise to fundamentally change society, both in the U.S. and abroad. So why isn't Canada building one? One reason is that exascale supercomputers come with a pretty steep sticker price. The contracts for the American machines are worth more than $500 million US each. On the other side of the Atlantic, the EU signed off on €1 billion for their own exascale supercomputer. While the U.S. and Europe have much larger populations, the annual per capita spending on large-scale computing projects demonstrates how much Canada is lagging in terms of investment. The U.S. DOE alone will spend close to $1 billion US on its national supercomputing facilities next year, a number which does not take into account spending by other federal organizations, such as the U.S. National Science Foundation. In comparison, Compute Canada — the national advanced research computing consortium providing supercomputing infrastructure to Canadian researchers — has a budget that is closer to $114 million Cdn. In its 2018 budget submission, Compute Canada clearly lays out what it will take to bring our country closer to the forefront of supercomputing on the world stage. Included is the need for increasing the annual national spending on advanced research computing infrastructure to an estimated $151 million — a 32 per cent increase from where it is now. Given cost of the American exascale supercomputers, this is likely a conservative estimate. However, the need for an exascale supercomputer in Canada does not seem to be on the radar of the decision-makers in the federal and provincial governments. Hanlon's razor would suggest that this is not due to some sinister plot by politicians to punish the nation's computer geeks; rather, our politicians likely don't fully understand the benefits of investing in the technology. For example, the recent announcement by the premiers of Ontario, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick to collaborate on aggressively developing Canada's small modular reactor (SMR) technology failed to mention the need for advanced computing resources. In contrast, corresponding U.S. DOE projects explicitly state that they will require exascale computing resources to meet their objectives. Why should the Canadian government — and you — care? For the less altruistic, a benefit of supercomputing research is ""trickle-down electronics."" The quiet but persistent legacy of the space race is technology like the microwave oven found in most kitchens. Similarly, the technological advances necessary to achieve exascale computing will also lead to lower-cost and more energy-efficient laptops, improved high-definition computer graphics, and prevalent AI in our connected devices. But more importantly for Canada, how we invest our federal dollars says a lot about what we value as a nation. It's a statement about how we value the sciences. Do we want to attract world-class researchers to our universities? Do we want Canada to be a leader in climate research, renewable energy and medical advances? It's also a statement about how much we value Canadian businesses and innovation. The user-facility model of the U.S. DOE provides businesses with access to singular resources, which gives American companies a competitive advantage in the world marketplace. Compute Canada has a similar mandate, and given the large number of startup companies and emerging industries in Canada, we leave our economy on an unequal footing without significant investments in advanced computing infrastructure. Ultimately, supercomputers are apolitical: they can just as easily be used for oil exploration as wind farming. Their benefits can be applied across the economy and throughout society to develop new products and solve problems. At a time when Canada seems so divided, building an exascale computer is the kind of project we need to bring the country together.

295,Éric Grenier,2020-01-24T13:17:11.472Z,What Pierre Poilievre's exit means for the Conservative leadership race,"Jean Charest was probably in — and then he was definitely out. Rona Ambrose was thinking about it — then she stopped. Peter MacKay is in and, by all accounts, still is. Pierre Poilievre was going to throw his hat into the ring, too. Until he wasn't. Yes, the Conservative leadership race we all expected has not quite materialized. Poilievre's surprise announcement on Thursday that he would not mount a bid for the leadership leaves the contours of this campaign ill-defined. The Ontario MP was widely considered to be the main competition for MacKay, the former cabinet minister and last leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party. Poilievre did have a path to victory. As the only major candidate with roots in Western Canada — he was born and raised in Alberta — Poilievre had the potential to take the lane as the candidate of the West, where the party's caucus, membership and donor base are disproportionately located. Watch: What high-profile exits mean for the Conservative leadership race  He had the chops to be a player in Quebec. Only a few days ago, he was on Radio-Canada and, by speaking decent French and expressing views on social conservative issues that were in line with mainstream opinion in the province, dispelled the two biggest concerns Quebec Conservatives had with Andrew Scheer's election performance. Combined with his track record as a partisan pitbull for Stephen Harper, he appeared to be the most likely recipient of votes from members opposed to MacKay — and to any swing back to the old PC wing of the party that took a back seat to the Reformers after the 2003 merger. With MacKay and Poilievre on the ballot, there didn't appear to be much room for Ontario MP Erin O'Toole, who finished third in the 2017 leadership race and will be mounting a second attempt. He ran his last campaign as a consensus candidate in the centre of the party, gaining the support of members who voted for moderates like Lisa Raitt and Michael Chong and disproportionately ranked O'Toole as their second choice. MacKay is well-positioned to occupy this lane. He has already received the endorsement of three MPs who backed O'Toole in 2017. Even MacKay's regional base overlaps with O'Toole, who had his best results in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Atlantic Canada is likely to be MacKay's fiefdom: he represented a riding in Nova Scotia for nearly two decades, the same seat his father Elmer occupied for even longer, and he has the backing of Tim Houston, the provincial PC leader in Nova Scotia. But there is now an opportunity for O'Toole to take up the space left vacant by Poilievre. That will be no easy task. But by the process of elimination, O'Toole has the best shot at it. Instead of being squeezed out between MacKay and Poilievre, O'Toole merely has to position himself to the right of MacKay as the only acceptable option for members looking for an alternative. Other names probably will join MacKay and O'Toole on the ballot. Ontario MPs Marilyn Gladu and Derek Sloan have indicated they want to run. The 12th place finisher in 2017, businessman Rick Peterson, says he will take another kick at the can, as have a number of former staffers and failed election candidates. But until these people meet the Conservative Party's demanding qualification requirements, or give some tangible evidence that they are serious contenders, this looks like a two-horse race. It's a race with no frontrunner from Quebec and nobody from Western Canada. Only a single candidate has a name that a majority of Canadians can recognize: Peter MacKay. So, will this be it? Justin Trudeau's Liberals are in their second term and were reduced to a minority government only last fall. The Conservatives continue to run roughly even with the Liberals in national polls. The next leader of the Conservative Party has a good shot of becoming the next prime minister — certainly a better shot than appeared to be the case in 2017. Charest's decision on Tuesday left Quebec up for grabs. On Wednesday, Ambrose left the field wide open in Western Canada. Poilievre relinquished his contender status on Thursday, along with all the organizers and donors his candidacy would have taken off the table for other candidates. This race looks a lot different than it did on Monday. Anyone who had ruled out a bid at the beginning of the week might want to take the weekend to think it over again.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-poilievre-out-1.5438447,[],N/A

Police were called to the centre of the city Wednesday night after receiving several calls about a moose trotting down Cashin Avenue. They followed the moose in a truck with lights flashing, guiding it toward a wooded area as onlookers stared in amazement. ""He looked like he owned the city,"" said Gen Escobar, who managed to snap a few photos as the moose trotted past her. Jason McDonald captured this video Wednesday night: It's not unheard of for moose to come into the city, but Escobar said she was still surprised when she realized the four-legged figure barrelling toward her wasn't a horse. ""There's just like, walls of snow 10 feet high all around us, and then a moose running towards us, and we're like, you know what, that's not the weirdest thing that's happened this week,"" she said. ""It just went with the whole snowpocalypse theme that we've been having."" St. John's has been hit with nearly a metre of snow since Friday, and police said the moose was struggling with high snowbanks, leading it to take main roads into the middle of the city. It was spotted in several locations, including Long's Hill and Empire Avenue. About 40 kilometres away in a more rural setting, Holyrood resident Elizabeth Clairmont found a moose in her backyard, perched high upon a snowbank and chewing on the branches of her apple tree. The curious beast was only a few feet away from walking onto the roof of her house.

298,Karin Larsen,2020-01-24T00:37:32.797Z,"Tofino, Ucluelet cut off after rock-blasting mishap shuts down highway","Tofino, Ucluelet and surrounding communities have been cut off from the rest of Vancouver Island because of what DriveBC is calling a ""major road failure"" caused by a rock blast that damaged Highway 4. The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure says the highway will remain closed all evening and there is no estimated time of reopening. According to Tofino Mayor Josie Osborne, the overnight blasting was part of a major highway improvement project. ""The rock that came down on the road compromised an existing retaining wall along the edge of the highway. Then a section of the road failed, so they've lost the travel lane,"" said Osborne. Crews have started excavating the damaged area and replacing the road surface after a geotechnical assessment determined the area was safe. According to DriveBC, the closure is 14 kilometres east of the southern boundary of Pacific Rim National Park, where the highway runs beside Kennedy Lake. The plan is to fix the highway by excavating the damaged roadbed and replacing it with a new surface, said Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure spokesperson Danielle Pope.  Rock fill for the embankment is being hauled in and placed to build up the damaged road. Crews will work around the clock to reconstruct and stabilize the slope and fix the road as quickly as possible, Pope said.  First responders and emergency vehicles can be accommodated through the area if necessary, she said.  Osborne says it's important to note that air evacuation is an option for residents in the case of a major emergency. ""There are protocols in place between the ambulance service, the ministry and the contractor doing the work, so, in the event of life-threatening emergency, there are ways to get people out of here,"" she said.

Born in Brockville, Ont., DeBlois is the writer, director, and executive producer of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. The third instalment of the trilogy has been nominated for an Oscar for best animated feature. The DreamWorks Animation film stars Montreal's Jay Baruchel as a now grown-up Viking named Hiccup, who embarks on yet another adventure with his dragon, Toothless. The star-studded cast includes the voices of Cate Blanchett, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera and Jonah Hill. The villain Grimmel is voiced by F. Murray Abraham. This isn't DeBlois's first rodeo, nor his first Oscar nod. He was also nominated for each of the first two instalments of How to Train Your Dragon, and he co-wrote and co-directed the Oscar-nominated Disney film Lilo and Stitch in 2002. So far, he hasn't brought home the hardware. ""I kind of know the drill a little bit, and I also know the disappointment of losing, so it's a measured excitement,"" DeBlois told CBC's Ottawa Morning. ""These next couple of weeks will be a lot of fun. For a while, we all get to be winners, and then the inevitable night comes where four out the five of us will go home empty handed."" DeBlois, whose father was a butcher, recalls having a steady supply of paper to doodle on in his childhood in western Gatineau's community of Aylmer. ""He would bring home these rolls of butcher paper which hung in a closet beneath the stairs, and I would just pull out sheets of it and draw all over. I was encouraged from an early start by my parents."" As he developed his skill, DuBlois said his main inspiration was a cartoon barbarian. ""I learned to draw from studying Conan. The anatomy was so ripped."" DeBlois studied animation at a summer program at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ont. During the rest of the year, he worked at Ottawa's now-defunct Hinton Animation Studios, honing his craft on the TV show The Raccoons.  He moved to Ireland in 1990 to work as a story board assistant on A Troll in Central Park and Thumbelina, then got his big break in 1994, when he moved to California for a job with Disney Feature Animation in Burbank. DeBlois said he's taken his mother to every Academy Awards ceremony he's attended. ""She thinks it's just amazing to be walking the red carpet and walking up to people like Meryl Streep and introducing herself. It's a lot of fun to see it through her eyes.""

301,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-05T10:30:00.081Z,NB Power spent more than $178K US on Florida lab this year,"NB Power has spent more than $178,000 US this year to run a lab in Florida at the home of Joi Scientific, a company that claims to have found an efficient way to convert seawater to hydrogen. But the lab may not be open for much longer, as questions swirl about whether Joi Scientific's technology works as previously described. NB Power spent $178,413 US (about $237,325 Cdn) on costs associated with the lab, according to records obtained by CBC through access to information. The records capture costs between February, when NB Power opened the lab, up to Oct. 16, 2019. The biggest expense in running the Florida lab has been the $42,372 US for standard lab equipment, followed by  $38,694 US for support staff. The records don't specify how many people were considered support staff or how many people may have been brought in to work in the lab. Other costs included instrumentation, H2 specific equipment, a work station and rent and utilities at the facility, located at the Space Life Sciences Lab at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Fla., where Joi Scientific is headquartered. Two former Joi Scientific employees interviewed by CBC News have raised questions about Joi's technology, saying it doesn't work as previously described. Natural Resources and Energy Development Minister Mike Holland has also said there's no proof Joi's technology is viable. Earlier this month, Holland said the NB Power lab in Florida will continue to stay open until the end of 2019, as a final test is underway to determine the technology's viability. ""Once [the test is] completed, either you send me somebody from MIT who says, 'Eureka!' or it didn't deliver the results and then we wrap things up,"" Holland said on CBC New Brunswick's Political Panel in November. A spokesperson for Joi Scientific did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday before deadline. Last month, Joi's vice-president of marketing, Vicky Harris, acknowledged the company has ""encountered delays and technical challenges"" but is working through them. Her emailed statement didn't elaborate on those delays or challenges. ""We remain confident that Joi Scientific is on the right path to create a new, cost-effective, and clean energy source in the form of green hydrogen,"" the statement from November said. NB Power spent $13 million Cdn to license Joi's technology, with the help of the Regional Development Corporation. NB Power planned to keep the Florida lab operating ""until we can make a decision whether we can go forward or not,"" NB Power CEO Gaëtan Thomas told CBC News last month. He said the utility was doing that to ensure it could recoup some of the investment it made in Joi's technology. But the utility hasn't budgeted any money for its Florida lab in the 2020-21 fiscal year, according to documents the utility filed with the Energy and Utilities Board on Tuesday. ""NB Power is obligated to make payments related to the lab space and related equipment until the end of January 2020,"" the documents say. ""The payment for January 2020 is US$16,717. There are no other continuing obligations. NB Power will maintain the licensing rights should there be no further testing or funding by NB Power."" After NB Power's latest rate application, New Brunswick's public intervener, Heather Black, asked the utility to provide Joi Scientific's ""most recent evaluation of the technology and its potential economic viability."" But in its response, NB Power said it couldn't answer those questions ""due to strict confidentiality requirements."" In response to a question from Black about whether NB Power has decided to ""pull the plug"" on the initiative, NB Power said Joi's ""technology is producing hydrogen from seawater,"" but the utility didn't provide further details. ""Additional testing is scheduled in the December time frame which will determine future direction,"" NB Power wrote in its filing. In a separate filing, the EUB asked the utility whether outside experts were asked to help evaluate the investment in Joi Scientific. ""With respect to the Joi Scientific initiative, NB Power had access to third party validation testing,"" NB Power wrote in response. ""NB Power also engaged its own third party to conduct testing."" The utility has never identified the third party that may have validated the testing and hasn't released copies of the those tests, citing a confidentiality agreement signed with Joi Scientific. Both the public intervener and NB Power declined requests for interviews about the utility's EUB filings. Do you have a tip about this story?

303,John Peters,2020-01-12T12:00:00.257Z,Mental health advocate wants you to know how to survive suicidal sadness,"Please believe me, I know how it feels to want it all to stop. It wasn't that I even wanted to die. I didn't. I was just so exhausted from feeling the way I was feeling.  And while those moments — when dying feels like your only option — are scary, you feel so frustrated that it makes it so tempting.  But here's what I need you to know! When you hear someone has died by suicide, it's heart-wrenching, it makes you feel sick to your stomach, it brings on a sudden intense feeling of ache in your soul — and always leaves you asking ""Why?""  Too many of us know the sting that suicide brings. Too many of us are scared to talk about suicide, and too many of us perpetuate stigma around suicide.  I don't have every answer. Nor can I speak to every case.  But three things, in my experience, I know are certain. John Peters offers a personal message to anyone in crisis: I've often seen individuals who have been hesitant to talk about suicide, because they believe talking about it causes it to happen more frequently.  But I believe that if you're in pain, then you must talk about it. We need to have more conversations about suicide and life promotion with our families, children and friends, in our workspaces and communities. Through storytelling and education, we can abolish the stigma around suicide and be more compassionate. There is power, growth and a healing impact when we speak the truth.  Ignorance causes us to belittle, gaslight and silence those who are battling this enormous fight.  There is a persistent behaviour of calling people ""too sensitive"" — which is a way to avoid being held accountable and to continue with abusive behaviour.  It can be seen everywhere, when you hear ""it's just a joke"" or ""don't take it so seriously.""  We must remember — we don't know what an individual is experiencing and what a person's thresholds are. Humour that involves someone's identity, religion, sexual orientation, mental health or appearance could be detrimental.  We as a community need to acknowledge the truth: there are many of us who fight silent battles and we urgently need to cultivate safe, shame-free spaces and communities, where an individual feels safe enough to reach out when in crisis.  We as community members are all accountable to our neighbours. Every human being's life is precious.  Today, there is no excuse for saying ""I don't know."" With the amount of information on the internet, public health, and local mental health and suicide prevention initiatives, we can take steps every day to ensure that we are informed and equipped with the right information and tools.  Which brings us to … It is a privilege to have access to resources and efficient care.  Sadly, here in Canada, prejudice and neglect are two major barriers in the system.  Due to the genocidal foundation of our country, colonial systems and policies, a large number of Canadians do not have access to care.  I speak to this as a front-line worker. In my area, for example, we have fewer than 1,500 people, and the number of people who have to tirelessly fight to access care is appalling.  Now, think about that in a lens looking at the entire country.  If any Canadian suffers, if any Canadian dies by suicide, we fail, Canada fails — and continues to fail. Commission your community's leadership and local governments to bring in resources, and do not be gentle or quiet about it. BE LOUD AND ADAMANT! Community is incredible and when we are connected, we can move the earth. Conduct workshops facilitated by health professionals about suicide prevention, so the community can gain knowledge. Provide mental health therapists and programs to respond to our community members who reach out when they are in crisis. This will help us support and care for them in a good way.  Provide spaces where people can pray together, and provide creative outlets for people to nourish their gifts and talents. Each individual has a unique expression form and when it's nourished, it is powerful and healing.  You can also start prevention and life promotion initiatives in your own community to raise awareness. Really, the list could go on and on, because everyone is responsible for actively contributing to the prevention of suicide. There are lives at stake!  Many people, such as your friends, family, even you, may be struggling with suicidal thoughts.  I need you to know, if that's you right now, wherever you are — listen to me: You are loved, you are not a bad person, you are not a bad parent, you are not a bad kid, you are not a screw-up, and you are not worthless. You are beautiful, you are talented, you are gifted, you have purpose, and we need you to stay with us.  If you are struggling today, please reach out to a loved one.  You can also call the Canada Suicide Prevention Service at 1-833-456-4566, Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868, First Nations and Inuit Hope for Wellness Help Line at 1-855-242-3310 or you can visit thelifelinecanada.ca for more information on other crisis help lines.  Also, for young readers, please check out WeMatter campaign on Facebook, Instagram and wemattercampaign.org.  Remember: The world is beautiful with you in it!

304,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-22T23:21:13.084Z,"As U.S. threatens retaliation over digital taxes, Canada waits for OECD talks","As the U.S. continues to threaten other countries with retaliation if they proceed with a digital services tax, Canada's trade minister says the question of how to ensure profitable search engines, social media platforms and online retailers pay their fair share can only be tackled on a multilateral basis. France is preparing to target internet companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook with a three per cent tax on the revenues from their digital business in that country. Canada may eventually follow France's lead — but for now, it's not prepared to go it alone. Speaking while in transit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland Wednesday, Small Business Minister Mary Ng said her government is looking at this issue in terms of what's in the best interests of Canadian businesses. ""I do think it's important to tackle this on a multilateral basis,"" she said. ""You do need to work through those processes."" Taxing multinational tech firms was part of the Liberals' re-election platform, which committed to ""work to achieve the standard set by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to ensure that international digital corporations whose products are consumed in Canada collect and remit the same level of sales taxation as Canadian digital corporations."" The proposal would tax the proceeds of online advertising and user data sales for digital firms with global revenues of more than $1 billion and Canadian revenues of more than $40 million. The Liberal platform projected $540 million in new revenue in 2020-21 from ""making multinational tech giants pay their fair share."" But Canada may not be able to proceed with its plans and start banking that kind of income this spring. Taxing multinational tech firms is easier said than done. Digital businesses models cross borders: a company may be headquartered and taxed in one country while it profits from its business activities in many others. That's why the 36 member countries of the OECD are trying to reach an international agreement on how to tax digital companies by mid-2020. Governments share a common concern: multinationals setting up in low-tax jurisdictions and avoiding taxes in others. Ng told CBC News Wednesday that Canada needs to continue to work though this process. Last fall, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was among American industry groups urging the Trump administration to oppose Canada's adoption of a French-style digital tax. American digital companies believe they could be subject to ""double taxation,"" where they end up paying tax on the same revenue in both countries — something the tax treaty in place between the U.S. and Canada is supposed to prevent. The U.S. groups warned that the Liberal proposal could undermine American investments in the Canadian tech sector and be inconsistent with Canada's international trade commitments. World Trade Organization rules, as well as trade agreements like the recently renegotiated North American free trade deal, are supposed to prevent discrimination between foreign and domestic companies in areas like tax policy. Countries aren't allowed to create arbitrary rules to game the system in favour of their own corporations. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party also proposed taxing digital firms in the last election, said ""it makes no sense at all"" that an international foreign company could make money in Canada and not pay any taxes. Speaking during a break in caucus meetings Wednesday in preparation for the return of the House of Commons next week, Singh said that when working class people are paying their fair share, it's wrong for multinationals to do otherwise. He brushed aside the risk of retaliation. ""I don't think that we should live in fear of Mr. Trump. I don't think we should make decisions based on fear,"" he said. ""Particularly when our decisions are the right thing to do."" Talks Wednesday in Davos brought a temporary truce to a heated trade dispute over France's tax, which targets companies that have global revenues of over 750 million euros ($1.09 billion Canadian) and French revenue of over 25 million euros ($36 million Canadian). The thresholds are meant to offer French start-up companies room to grow. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he'd agreed to postpone collection of the tax until December — after the next U.S. election cycle — in return for a commitment from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold off on the retaliatory sanctions President Donald Trump threatened to impose on French exports like champagne and cheese. Other European countries, including Austria, Italy, Spain and Britain, are considering similar taxes. Sajid Javid, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister), told a panel in Davos Wednesday his country plans to proceed with its two per cent tax in April as a ""temporary tax"" until there is an international agreement on how to proceed. Mnuchin then told the same panel discussion that the pair needed to have ""some private conversations"" about this because such a tax would be discriminatory. ""If people want to just arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies, we will consider arbitrarily putting taxes on their car companies,"" Mnuchin said. More talks between Le Maire, Mnuchin and the head of the OECD, José Ángel Gurría, are expected Thursday. Gurría urged the countries to take the ""time and the space"" necessary to reach a deal and avoid bilateral confrontations.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764,N/A

The Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board is considering the Giant Mine Remediation Team's application for a water licence and land-use permit to begin its 10-year, $1 billion cleanup just a few kilometres from the city's downtown.  The City of Yellowknife recently drafted a 20-year community plan. It describes the entire Giant Mine area as ""undevelopable.""  In a presentation to the board Tuesday, city administrator Sheila Bassi-Kellett made a plea to the project to lay out options for what the Giant Mine site could be used for down the road.  ""This land must provide potential value to our citizens,"" Bassi-Kellett said. ""What that value will be, whether it's recreational or industrial, whatever it may be, this has got to be a collective decision from all our residents.""  Questions have been raised over who exactly is in charge of future land-use planning for the site. On Monday, the remediation team talked about ""constraints"" on land use planning, while saying land-use planning lay outside of its authority. A representative for the territorial government, the land's owner, pointed out that the territorial government doesn't do land-use planning within municipal boundaries.  In 2010, the remediation team proposed cleaning the entire site to an industrial standard for arsenic contamination. The team later promised to restore parts of the site to a residential standard for arsenic. That opens the possibility for a variety of land uses, but the city wants the remediation team to help ""re-establish a concept of what that land use might be,"" said Todd Slack, the city's special advisor on Giant Mine. Slack quoted Jeffrey Humble, a city planner who, at an environmental assessment hearing in 2012, said, ""I've been a land-use planner for more than 10 years and I've never seen a land-use plan come at the tail end of a process."" ""The city can't drive this forward on its own. The range of possible land uses now is unclear,"" he said. After reading a short poem (actually song lyrics, written specifically for the land and water board), Alternatives North also raised concerns over the lack of detail included in the closure and reclamation plan, including how the site will look.  ""The [closure and reclamation plan] thus far does not appear to apply a consistent approach to design of the site's final appearance,"" said Michael Nabert.  ""If the visual appearance of various aspects of the site do not communicate a consistent message to future generations, our capacity to clearly communicate what they need to know will be diminished,"" said Nabert. The board will also hear from two federal government departments, the Giant Mine Oversight Board, the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, the North Slave Métis Alliance and the Yellowknife Historical Society before deciding whether, and on what terms, to issue the remediation team its licence and permit. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-hearings-tuesday-1.5435900,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/giant-mine-remediation-to-do-list-1.5434166 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/public-hearings-giant-mine-begin-1.5432187,N/A

307,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:50:06.497Z,Saskatchewan lab joins global effort to develop coronavirus vaccine,"As Canadian public health agencies prepare to deal with a new viral illness, a specialized lab in Saskatoon is using its research on different strains of the coronavirus to help develop a vaccine. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre, also known as VIDO-InterVac, has received permission from the Public Health Agency of Canada to focus on the threat. ""People need to work together and collaborate and share the information,"" said its executive director, Volker Gerdts. The deadly coronavirus, first linked to a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has been connected to 26 deaths and infections in hundreds of people. South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States have each reported at least one case of the virus. There have been no confirmed cases in Canada and officials say the risk of an outbreak remains low. About five or six people in Canada are being monitored, including those with a travel history to the Wuhan area and with symptoms of the illness. Respiratory samples are being sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. ""Emerging diseases arrive and, because of all the travel we do and the connectiveness we have right now, the world becomes smaller and smaller and there's a better chance for these pathogens to quickly spread around the globe,"" Gerdts said. The Saskatchewan lab was developed in the wake of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, outbreak in 2003 to ensure that Canada could be prepared for emerging disease and illness, he said. Researchers there have spent a significant amount of time focusing on pathogens like coronaviruses. Gerdts said they've successfully developed a vaccine for coronavirus strains in cattle and pigs. ""We have expertise in working with them."" While coronaviruses are relatively small, they are known for mutating and jumping species, which is why they cause so many problems. Gerdts explained the coronavirus strain in pigs had not been seen in North America until two years ago. But within a year it had affected 10 million of the animals. Colleagues in China have made the outbreak-specific coronavirus genome sequence available to researchers around the world, Gerdts said. His lab is now using it to hopefully find a way to help. The lab also has clearance to handle samples of the pathogen and is attempting to get samples from China or the U.S. If that's not possible, it will order synthetic gene fragments. The goal is to have the first vaccine candidates ready for testing in animals within six to eight weeks, Gerdts said. But human trials are at least a year away. Gerdts said Canada has taken a leading role in developing vaccines, including one for the Ebola virus, and there's a need to have more capacity to manufacture them here. If his lab had a manufacturing facility that he's been advocating for, he said production of a coronavirus vaccine for human testing could happen quicker. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said Canadian research is part of a global effort and will be shared with the World Health Organization. ""We currently do not have a specific vaccine against this novel coronavirus,"" she said.

309,Kieron Testart,2020-01-24T13:00:00.851Z,"OPINION | N.W.T. Child and Family Services is broken, will MLAs be able to fix it?","The Northwest Territories government is failing foster parents and children in care — but is anyone surprised?  After two damning auditor general reports, barely four years apart, and no real changes, revelations from the Foster Family Coalition of the Northwest Territories' recent 27-page letter simply constitute the latest chapter in this sad story. For more than eight years, we've heard horror stories of the mistreatment of children. We've also heard first-hand accounts from front-line caregivers about being misled and verbally abused by child protection workers. No wonder so many have lost confidence that the government will meaningfully act to fix Child and Family Services. We've heard these promises again and again. The auditor general's office says it's up to elected representatives to make necessary fixes to the system. It will take determined political will on the part of MLAs to make that happen.  Politicians often treat issues at Child and Family Services as an inconvenience — problems that can be managed with action plans and rosy speeches — rather than as a real crisis. Slap on a few Band-Aid policies, add some funding, and hope the problem goes away. Diane Thom, the minister of health and social services, first refused to meet with the Foster Family Coalition. She changed her mind only after the group's searing letter went public. Premier Caroline Cochrane, apparently, was too busy to speak to the matter, but encouraged foster parents ""not to lose hope."" Most reasonable people would agree that the government leader should respond instantly to alarming issues involving the children of the Northwest Territories. The tone-deaf responses from Thom and Cochrane are frustrating, and echo the same hollow excuses proffered by previous governments. Thom, a political rookie who inherited these problems from the previous minister, can perhaps be forgiven. But the premier should know better. Cochrane knows intimately the problems in Child and Family Services, having served as a minister in the last cabinet when the health minister of the day faced a confidence vote following the second damning auditor general report.  If this was Ottawa or the provinces, the opposition parties of the legislature would pounce on the government over this scandal. There would be weeks of hard questions in the House and motions compelling the government to act. But this isn't Ottawa, and in the N.W.T.'s consensus-style system, I expect things will play out quite differently. Cabinet will close ranks around their colleague Thom, and she will rely on existing action plans and strategies. Thom will say it is too soon to expect results. Cochrane will lean on her bona fides as a social worker to deflect criticisms of how her government is handling the situation.  Regular MLAs, for their part, will offer words of support to foster parents, caregivers and front-line workers. They will try to resolve this crisis through closed-door meetings and hushed chats with their cabinet colleagues. None of this will give the public confidence that our elected leaders are doing what's best for children in care.  Politicians must prioritize protecting children over re-election. Regular MLAs must pressure cabinet to take decisive action, even if it means ruffling a few feathers. Camaraderie among decision-makers is valuable, but good relations alone won't resolve this crisis.  Showing compassion and understanding to long-suffering caregivers, however, is a good place to start.  Thom should immediately meet with the Foster Family Coalition and officials in the Child and Family Services system, including front-line workers. Cabinet must direct the public service to rethink the child welfare system. Incremental changes aren't working. Sporadically hiring new staff isn't working. To see real change, the entire system needs an overhaul, taking into account recommendations of the auditor general, standing committees, the Foster Family Coalition, front-line workers and caregivers. The outcomes from these changes must be measurable and realistic, with clear marching orders to public servants. Additionally, cabinet must make all relevant documents and witnesses available to the Standing Committee on Social Development without political interference, and the committee must ensure its review of Child and Family Services takes place in public, and that those who testify are protected from reprisal.  This is the first real test of the 19th Legislative Assembly and Cochrane's cabinet. We elect leaders to effect change and get better results for our communities. The time for bold action is now. There is nothing more important to Northerners than their children and we cannot afford to fail them again.

310,Graham Thomson,2019-12-30T13:00:00.731Z,OPINION | 'You ain't seen nothing yet': A look at what's ahead in Alberta politics,"Psychics, astrologers and other impeccable internet sources tell us 2020 promises to be an interesting year in which, ""animals tell us what they think,"" the world ""becomes one country,"" and Trump speaks ""only nonsense."" I suppose only two of those are actually predictions while the other one is a sad statement of fact. Making predictions is always a mug's game. And considering how much politics has changed in Alberta the past year, only a fool would attempt to predict what's going to happen in 2020. So, let me try. The year 2020 might look like a new year on paper but in many ways it's going to feel mighty old mighty quick. At least when it comes to Alberta politics. Many of the big issues from the past year will continue to dominate the new. Let's look at a few. Yes, it didn't take a crystal ball to figure this one out. Jason Kenney and the United Conservatives won the election on a promise of a strong economy and more jobs. It didn't work out that way and the NDP has been gleefully rubbing it in Kenney's face every chance they get. And they'll keep it up in 2020 as the UCP government tries to kick-start the economy and create jobs. Economists predict ""modest growth"" in the province's economy for the new year. Kenney will need to do better than that if he hopes to mute the critics — and claim ""promise made, promise kept"" in 2020. If there's one issue that has defined Alberta politics, this is it. Getting a new energy pipeline to tidewater has become an overwrought symbol of Alberta's dreams and frustrations — the dream of another energy boom and the frustration at failing to get a new pipeline built. In fact, a new pipeline will not solve our fiscal problems that are actually caused by a depressed price of oil and a world moving away from fossil fuels. And delays in getting a new pipeline built are not the fault of the federal Liberal government, as Premier Jason Kenney likes to suggest, but the courts. And the courts have delayed projects because of genuine complaints from First Nations. Work has started on twinning the Trans Mountain Pipeline and that work will continue through 2020 (and for two years after that) but the project will still face opposition from some First Nations and environmental groups. This will be a win-win for Kenney. If construction continues on TMX, he can point to it as a ""victory"" for his government; if it doesn't, he can blame the federal Liberals and ""foreign-funded"" environmental organizations for continuing to undermine Alberta's struggling economy. Speaking of blaming others for Alberta's ills, 2020 will see the UCP government maintain its pugilistic approach to issues via its Fight Back Strategy that includes the ""war room"" — officially, the Canadian Energy Centre — the public inquiry into the government's foreign-funded conspiracy theory, and the ""fair deal"" panel that is looking into whether Alberta should have, for example, its own police force and pension plan. Alberta energy 'war room' discovers its logo was lifted from American software company These are all tactics designed to keep Alberta on a war footing and keep Albertans angry, frustrated and easily manipulated by a government that equates legitimate opposition with sedition. The past year ended with some frustrated public sector workers musing about a general strike. That strike never happened and perhaps it never will. But we might see strikes by individual public sector unions in 2020. They are upset by a government that is pressing workers to take wage cuts. The government has made it clear if the unions win wage hikes, they can expect job cuts. Perhaps the government was peering into its own crystal ball this fall when it passed a piece of legislation giving it the right to hire replacement workers in the event of a public sector strike. In 2019, the UCP government commissioned a long list of panels and committees to review everything from the $20-billion Alberta Health Services, to car insurance rates, to safe consumption sites. The granddaddy of them all was the blue ribbon panel that issued a report that formed the basis for the government's cost-cutting budget that rolled out in October. Alberta's 'fair deal' panel begins feedback tour with Edmonton town hall Those panels — with members and mandates carefully chosen by the government — will continue to influence government policy throughout 2020. That includes Budget 2020 coming in late February, which will actually be the first true UCP budget. The 2019 budget, introduced in an election year, was an amalgam of UCP policies and leftovers from the previous NDP budget. There won't be an election in 2020 but you're going to feel like you're trapped in a nasty election campaign anyway. The animosity between the UCP government and NDP opposition isn't just political, it's personal. Kenney has gone to great lengths to dismantle the former NDP government's legacy and the NDP sees Kenney as a right-wing bully. The mutual antagonism will continue as Kenney has already promised even more sweeping legislation in the spring session. Kenney's popularity took a substantial hit late in 2019, according to several public opinion polls, because of a sputtering economy and cuts to government services. But it appears he doesn't plan to stop or change direction. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" he told cheering UCP members at their convention a few weeks ago. ""We're just getting started."" In one of the few times NDP leader Rachel Notley agreed with Kenney in 2019, she told a year-end interview she doesn't think Kenney is about to ease up on the gas pedal in 2020: ""There's nothing that makes me believe that they're going to change course and I think they're going to push harder.""

""Every friend I have came over to help,"" said MacDonald with a laugh, noting this was her fourth move in six years. Her new print shop, Deep Hollow Print, is in her home in North Alton, in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. The letterpress process involves putting movable type on a press bed. You fill the spaces between the type with other material. Once that's locked and ready to go, you put ink on the press. The paper is pressed down onto the letters to create the print. Some presses use electricity, but MacDonald's doesn't. She uses elbow grease and oil. Video produced by Wesley Booth, Hilary Drummond, with help from Kyle Bernard, for CBC. Music: The Basin Brothers. The walls of MacDonald's studio are plastered with letterpress she's made or collected. There's the twinkle of string lights and wooden letters that all could tell a story. This is a place where she creates and hosts house concerts. Some music has been recorded here too. In this digital age, MacDonald said there's a resurgence of people wanting something more tactile and warm, like vinyl records. Her letterpress posters have this feel. ""They're warmer, they're friendly, they're human, "" she said. ""You can tell in all their imperfections that, you know, somebody has touched them to make them."" MacDonald specializes in gig posters, but also creates album covers and concert tickets. She's won two East Coast Music Awards for her work. She also does projects for local businesses, like the bags for North Mountain Coffee, and makes art prints. Some of her work is graphic design. MacDonald was born in Nova Scotia. She moved to the United States when she was young, but came back home about 10 years ago to work at Gaspereau Press. She was interested in book publishing and binding at the time, but developed a love for letterpress. Her letterpress education also took her to Nashville, where she interned at Hatch Show Print, which is famous for it's circus and minstrel show posters. A lot of famous performers had posters printed there, including Elvis Presley and B.B. King. ""Eventually, they sort of become the face of the country music industry down there,"" said MacDonald. She experienced that history first-hand. ""I used an h that was used on an old Hank Williams poster,"" said MacDonald. While at Hatch Show Print, she worked on posters for the likes of Willie Nelson. His manager would even send them Krispy Kreme doughnuts sometimes. ""Love Krispy Kreme donuts,"" said MacDonald. A lot of MacDonald's work is inspired by Nova Scotia. She said the Annapolis Valley is a very supportive community. Most of her clients are local, and the music scene in the valley and the province has been good for her business. A lot of her clients like to come to her shop to see the process, and sometimes they even help her print the work. MacDonald said she would eventually like to hold printing workshops. ""It's hard to get started when you don't have the space, you don't have the equipment, so you kind of rely on kindness of other older printers to help you out,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/letterpress-deep-hollow-print-laura-macdonald-nova-scotia-1.5438285,[],N/A

313,Steven D'Souza,2020-01-21T20:55:22.413Z,'This is going to be very ugly': Weinstein defence may use prevailing myths about rape to his advantage,"This story is part of #MeToo 2020, a CBC News series examining what's changed since the start of the #MeToo movement two years ago and how the trial of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein will affect the future of the movement. When opening arguments begin Wednesday in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, the former Hollywood mogul's behaviour will be put under a microscope. But so, too, will the actions of his accusers, and some psychologists worry that outdated myths about rape will be used to discredit them. ""I think this is going to be very ugly,"" said Louise Fitzgerald, professor emeritus in the women and gender studies department at the University of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and predatory sexual assault against two women. He has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex. Fitzgerald said the defence may employ a tactic commonly used in sex assault cases: turning the focus from the accused to the accuser and playing on misconceptions about victims. One line of defence in such cases is to suggest the rape didn't really happen or that it wasn't really rape. ""They are going to try and capitalize on myths,"" Fitzgerald said. One of the accusers in the trial, who hasn't been identified, alleged Weinstein raped her in a New York hotel room in 2013. On Tuesday, Weinstein's lawyers announced they want to use friendly emails the accuser sent to the former producer after the alleged assault in a bid to convince jurors that any contact was consensual. ""There's direct communications between Harvey and women, always friendly, sometimes romantic, that would lead, I think, any reasonable person to think that the claims are untrue,"" Weinstein's lead defence lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told ABC News. Fitzgerald, who has written about rape myths and workplace sexual harassment, said there are decades of studies detailing how women behave in certain situations after being sexually assaulted, and the reasons behind that. ""Lots of people remain in contact with their abuser for a whole variety of reasons,"" she said. ""In some cases, because he has a lot of power and he can hurt you."" Trauma psychologist Joan Cook said it's disheartening to already see indications from Weinstein's team that it will be relying on an outdated understanding of how victims of sexual assault behave.  ""There's a lot of ways that men and women who have been sexually violated respond, and it's not the way we think,"" Cook said. ""Most don't go to the police; most don't confront their abuser; and many don't disconnect for various reasons.""  Watch: Rose McGowan, who accused Weinstein of sexual assault, talks about the defence's strategy Many survivors are in shock or numb after the assault, so they stay silent, Cook said, because what happened to them may not register right away or because they're afraid of the personal and professional consequences of cutting off contact. ""It's not surprising to me at all that people would have kept in touch with [Weinstein],"" said Cook. ""He owned Hollywood, so if you wanted to function there, weren't you going to still try and maintain a connection?"" That was among the reasons Dominique Huett said she stayed in touch with Weinstein, even after she alleged he sexually assaulted her in a Los Angeles hotel room in 2010. She was the first Weinstein accuser to file a civil claim against him. ""I emailed him after the assault happened, but that doesn't mean the assault didn't happen,"" Huett told CBC News. ""It just means I was trying to regain some sense of control back over what he did."" Huett's allegation falls within the statute of limitations, and she hopes charges can still be filed in California for her case. ""I think the old rhetoric of blaming the victim is very outdated at this stage,"" said Huett. ""I think the #MeToo movement kind of exposed how women are not, you know, liars."" Huett is a member of the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers who have come together to amplify the experiences of sexual assault survivors. In addition to questioning the motivation and actions of the accusers, Weinstein's defence is expected to call two experts to testify about memory. The judge, however, limited the scope of their testimony and denied a defence request to have them testify about a phenomenon called ""unwanted voluntary sex."" Cook said the understanding among researchers used to be that memory was fixed and unchanging, but today, it's recognized that the fact that an assault victim's recollections may change over time isn't necessarily a sign of deceit. ""The truth is, memory is much more fluid, and memories can change, and they can be altered over time,"" Cook said. The prosecution will be calling Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist at Temple University in Philadelphia who is an expert on rape and sexual assault trauma. The Manhattan district attorney's office is hoping Ziv can counter some of the myths around sexual assault, including why victims often wait to disclose their assault. Ziv gave such testimony in the second trial of Bill Cosby, who was convicted on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a Canadian woman who met Cosby while working at his alma mater, Temple University, in the early 2000s. The prosecution also hopes the four additional women who will be allowed to testify even though their allegations against Weinstein haven't resulted in charges will help establish a pattern of behaviour similar to how the testimony of other women did in the Cosby retrial. The question of how deeply the message of the #MeToo movement has permeated society was an undercurrent during the contentious two weeks of jury selection. Judge James M. Burke cautioned jurors that the case was not a referendum on the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment or women's rights. In narrowing down the jury pool, the prosecution accused the defence of ""systematically eliminating"" younger white women, who are more likely to be aware of #MeToo and possibly sympathize with Weinstein's accusers. In the end, seven men and five women were chosen. Six of the men and two of the women are white.  How educated the jury is in rape myths will be crucial in determining the outcome, Fitzgerald said. ""That's always what's critical in rape cases — the jury has to be willing and able to see through these things,"" Fitzgerald said. The flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations against Weinstein, which followed a New York Times exposé in October 2017 that sparked the #MeToo movement, ignited an international conversation about women's experiences. But Fitzgerald says she doesn't think public awareness has progressed as far as people want to believe it has. Fitzgerald worked as a psychological consultant for Anita Hill and her legal team in 1991, when Hill accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. Fitzgerald called that moment the first great awakening for American society in the debate over sexual misconduct. She said after that, however, society forgot the lessons learned about women's experiences, and the issue fell out of the national conversation. But with high-profile stars now speaking out, she hopes there will be a more permanent reckoning with the issue on national scale. ""I think it's going to be more powerful this time, and it's going to be more widespread and more lasting.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/weinstein-trial-rape-myths-1.5432896,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-zelda-perkins-rowena-chiu-nda-1.5373433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/weinstein-jury-selection-completed-1.5431029 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-metoo-trial-sexual-assault-1.5409190 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/harvey-weinstein-trial-monday-1.5415288,N/A
314,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:54:06.649Z,What impact do private jets and celebrity lifestyles have on the fight against climate change?,"Read Story Transcript The CEO of a company that sells private jets to corporations says his clients are concerned about climate change, but ultimately they ""still have to conduct their business.""  ""We are still living in the 21st century and people do have to understand that,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of The Jet Business. ""We're not in the Stone Age, and as much as people want to be able to save the Earth, you still have to survive, you have to live, and you have to produce revenue for your shareholders.""  Despite that, Varsano told The Current's Matt Galloway that the topic of climate change is coming up ""more and more"" in his luxurious showroom in London, U.K. ""People are becoming more conscious of it and they do want to do something about it,"" he said. ""There are some companies and programs that you can easily buy carbon footprint offsets, and it's not that expensive, believe it or not.""  Carbon offsetting works by calculating the emissions generated by a flight you take, for example, then paying someone to plant enough trees to remove that carbon from the atmosphere.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that domestic and international aviation accounts for approximately two per cent of global CO2 emissions produced by people.  Varsano argued that due to the relatively small number of private jets in the world, the carbon emissions involved are quite small. But Stefan Gössling, a professor of tourism, said it could be argued that every individual emission is irrelevant, until they start to add up. ""The question is how does each and every individual in the world contribute to climate change? And that should be the point of measurement,"" said Gössling, who works at Linnaeus University in Sweden. Gössling also questioned the wisdom of carbon offsetting by planting trees, due to widescale wildfires in recent years.  ""Look at Australia, look at California. I think everybody would realize that is not a really safe way of storing carbon,"" he said. Gössling has published research exploring how the lifestyles of the rich and famous affect social attitudes to flight and travel. He tracked the movements of 10 celebrities in 2017, including Bill Gates and Paris Hilton, mining their social media to estimate their travel itineraries and associated carbon emissions. He found their flight-related emissions could be 10,000 times greater than the average person — but he thinks the problem goes further. ""The issue with the celebrities we studied in our paper is that they are obviously famous people who live specific lifestyles that they are admired for,"" he said. Fans and followers may then aspire to, or imitate, their jet-setting lifestyles, he explained. ""That becomes something that is problematic because we need the opposite. ... We need a social norm change towards people being more critical about flying and travel."" Varsano said a pre-owned jet will sell for between $10-$30 million US — depending on size — and is equipped to fly 14 passengers up to 14 hours. A new jet can sell for $100 million US.  One of his famous clients includes motivational speaker Tony Robbins, but he said the worldwide ownership of private jets is split between state-owned planes, and business jets owned by big corporations. While he understands people see private jets as luxury items, Varsano said they're also business tools, describing his product as ""a time machine."" ""You have flexibility in your schedule, you have security, you have confidentiality. So there's a lot of things that you benefit from from being in a corporate jet besides just the pure fact of being in a luxurious atmosphere,"" he said. The time that a frequent-flier executive saves — not lining up at airport security, for example — can be used to grow their business, he said.  ""There's no value you can put that, you know, in a dollar term.""

316,Dan Zakreski,2020-01-23T16:49:13.588Z,Cry Wolf: Author questions whether lessons from fatal 2005 wolf attack in north have been forgotten,"Harold Johnson still remembers the early morning in 1986 when he realized he wasn't at the top of the food chain. It involved a northern Saskatchewan mine site and a very large timber wolf. Now, 34 years later, he's written a book warning that we ignore this apex predator at our peril. Johnson says that on that day decades ago he was walking on a bush road to the job site when suddenly the hair on the back of his neck stood up. Some primitive part of his brain began flashing red alerts. He turned to find a timber wolf about eight to 10 feet away, crouched down and ready to pounce. ""If I close my eyes I can see that wolf. I was in the best shape of my life. I weighed 172 pounds. Better shape than when I finished basic training a decade earlier. And that wolf was the same weight as me, maybe more. He had more strength than I had. He was faster, he was quicker,"" he said. ""He was an athlete's dream, aesthetically beautiful, and scared the pants off me. "" Johnson said he survived the encounter by crawling into a manhole on the road. Fast forward two decades and Johnson once again had a wolf encounter. This time it happened in the ballroom of a Prince Albert hotel in 2007. Johnson represented the family of Ontario engineering student Kenton Carnegie at a coroner's inquest. The 22-year-old had been killed at Points North Landing in 2005, a northern mining supply camp where he worked on a break from his classroom studies. Ontario man killed in wolf attack, coroner's jury finds Wolf attack in northern Saskatchewan 3rd in 12 years Carnegie had gone out for a walk around a nearby lake and didn't return. Searchers later found his body, partially eaten and surrounded by animal tracks. The inquest eventually determined that Carnegie had been killed by wolves. It was the first recorded death by wolf attack in North America in more than a century. In the Points North case, the wolves had been drawn to the camp's unfenced dump and become habituated to humans. Today, 15 years after the inquest, wolves are again on Johnson's mind. He's just published Cry Wolf, a book that takes a deep dive into the circumstances around Carnegie's death. The goal, he says, is to remind people of the animal that we're dealing with. The Carnegie inquest provided a graphic reminder that, given the right environment, wolves will kill people. The prospect of more wolf/human encounters is growing as people encroach on their territory. Johnson says the province needs to start tracking wolf populations and movements. ""Where are they? What are they doing? How are they surviving? What are we doing with the massive clear cuts in northern Saskatchewan destroying their habitat?"" The Ministry of Environment confirms that it does not track wolf populations or movement. ""Wolf populations are generally inferred based on reported problems with livestock predation and from anecdotal information mainly from hunters, trappers and outfitters,"" an official said in an e-mail. ""We have a provincial estimate of 3,500 wolves based on habitat and prey-based models, but these are likely on the low end.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/cry-wolf-new-book-harold-johnson-1.5437525,[],N/A
317,Michael Gorman,2020-01-23T20:19:22.709Z,Northern Pulp seeks judicial review of N.S. environment minister's ruling,"Northern Pulp is asking for a judicial review of the Nova Scotia environment minister's decision to require an environmental assessment report for the company's proposed effluent facility. In documents filed Thursday in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Halifax, the company, which filed the application along with representatives of the forestry industry and the union representing mill workers, said it wants Environment Minister Gordon Wilson's ruling last month to be quashed and for costs to be awarded. In December, Wilson said the company failed to provide sufficient information about its proposal in order for him to make a decision on the application. In providing his ruling, Wilson called for an environmental assessment report to be completed if the company wanted to continue with the process. Later that week, Premier Stephen McNeil rejected a request from the company to extend the deadline in the Boat Harbour Act, which calls for the company's effluent treatment facility to close at the end of this month. Without a place to send and treat its effluent, the mill cannot operate. In court documents, said company says it's seeking the review based on the following grounds: The minister erred in law and in fact and acted unreasonably in preparing and rendering the decision. The minister failed to properly interpret and apply certain provisions of the Environment Act and environmental assessment regulations. The minister based his decision ""on irrelevant and/or improper factors and considerations."" The minister breached the company's procedural fairness entitlements Anything else ""as may appear prior to the hearing of this matter."" The company is in the midst of an orderly shutdown at the Pictou County location, winterizing the mill so it can remain dormant while Northern Pulp works on the environmental assessment report, a process that could take as long as two years. In the meantime, workers at the company are being laid off and the forestry industry as a whole is facing much uncertainty. In a news release Thursday, Brian Baarda, CEO of Northern Pulp parent company Paper Excellence, said he and the other applicants are hoping the review ""will bring transparency to the decision-making process."" ""We're hoping that through this judicial review, Northern Pulp will be provided with clarity about the process and elements required in order to be successful in the [environmental assessment] process that we'll be embarking on later this year."" he said. ""We believe all of the necessary ingredients for a successful pulp industry are here in Nova Scotia including access to fibre, deep sea ports, a talented labour pool and a modern, competitive pulp mill."" As the mill has prepared to shut down, a transition team formed by the provincial government has been meeting weekly and determining what to do with a $50-million assistance fund in an effort to transition the industry to a future without Northern Pulp. Money so far has been allocated for retraining and silviculture work. An announcement from the transition team is expected Friday about a short-term financial support program for some people connected to the forestry industry.

Addressing his Liberal caucus this morning as MPs meet for a two-day strategy session ahead of next week's return to Parliament, Trudeau said the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) — also known as NAFTA 2.0 — will be the Liberal government's top priority. ""I look forward to debate on this in the House, I look forward to committees doing their work. But we need to make sure that we move resolutely and rapidly to put into reality this new NAFTA deal that is so good for Canadians from coast to coast to coast,"" he said. Trudeau said millions of Canadian jobs depend on free trade with the United States, and stressed the need for predictability for Canadian businesses. Government House Leader Pablo Rodriguez said the legislation will go through the normal scrutiny and legislative process, but he also called on MPs not to delay its passage. ""Let's discuss it in the House, let's discuss it in committees, but let's move forward because this is way too important to stall,"" he said. Trudeau just wrapped up a cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, where he announced that a bill to approve the deal will be tabled on Wednesday. Canada's premiers called for the bill's passage ""as quickly as possible."" ""Timely ratification will enable Canadian businesses to benefit from the modernized provisions of the agreement restoring market certainty and contributing to Canada's economic prosperity,"" said a spokesperson for Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, chair of the Council of the Federation, in a statement. ""The ratification of CUSMA will also allow governments, businesses and workers to move forward with implementation, including the commitment by the federal government to provide full and fair compensation for supply managed farmers and processors who are impacted by the agreement."" Other priorities for the Liberal government include introducing legislation to expand medical assistance in dying (MAID), new gun control measures and steps to tackle climate change. After being reduced to a minority, the Liberal government must have support from another party to pass legislation and the federal budget. Trudeau said the takeaway from the election results is that Canadians want the government to work with other parties to ""make it work"" in the minority context. ""Bickering, grandstanding, petty politics — none of these things create jobs. They don't make anyone's retirement safer or our environment cleaner,"" he said.

319,Carolyn Ray,2020-01-22T23:59:26.096Z,"How virtual reality may dramatically change eye tests, research","A team at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax is looking at eye testing in a new way thanks to an experiment with virtual reality. The eye clinic works with patients ranging from infants to adults and depends on the subjective responses from patients to help with a diagnosis. That can make their work tricky, especially when small children are expected to undergo exams that can routinely run an hour long. Dr. Darren Oystreck, an orthopist at the hospital who also works with the health faculty at Dalhousie University, estimated his profession has used the same tests for six decades to check for disorders of binocular vision or eye alignment issues. ""You compare it to other areas of medicine where they've had amazing breakthroughs in technology in some of the things they can imagine now and the data they can collect is mind-boggling,"" he said. Oystreck uses equipment like flashlights, pictures and foggy goggles to conduct his work and keep the kids focused. Last year, his team decided it was time to look for new options. That's when they met Ryan Cameron, the CEO of Electric Puppets, a Halifax-based virtual reality company that specializes in children's programming. ""Everything [Oystreck] needed could be applied to many other areas, like brain injury research,"" he said. Cameron has adapted the old vision tests to a virtual reality program. For the team at the IWK eye clinic, the collaboration allows the eye doctors to alter settings and try a wider range of scenarios, all while recording the reaction of a patient's eyes. The hope is that for children in particular, it will lead to more accurate observations. ""They can calm down and relax and feel familiar with the environment quickly and then we can start to put them through the classic tests,"" said Oystreck. The program is being tested and studied at the hospital. The team needs to prove the results are just as accurate — if not more accurate — as the old tests, and they'll produce a peer-reviewed study. Steve Van Iderstine, a research associate at the IWK, said virtual reality systems weren't designed for medical use, but they have great applications for that. ""I'm hoping in a year from now we'll have good data to demonstrate that the virtual reality version of these tests has strong validity, then we'll be able to look forward to the more exciting environments that we can generate with the virtual reality,"" he said. Cameron said those environments, for example, could be a virtual circus where kids would have the impression they're playing a game, when in fact they're being tested. Van Iderstine said because virtual reality systems are commercially available, they're far cheaper than medical equipment. They also take up less space. He hopes headsets sized for small kids will soon be available. For Cameron and his company, this program is just the beginning. They have a patent pending on their work, and they're hoping that virtual reality could be used in the treatment of everything from physiotherapy to psychology.

320,Anonymous,2020-01-23T12:30:00.602Z,St. John's storm causes empty shelves in grocery stores in central Newfoundland,"If you're noticing slim pickings at stores in central Newfoundland, it's probably because of the blizzard that has shut down St. John's for the past six days. Dominion posted signs around its locations in Grand Falls-Windsor and Gander earlier this week, saying the state of emergency in the capital city was causing product shortages. ""We are doing our very best to deliver the best experience possible given these circumstances,"" the signs read. More than 300 kilometres away, several containers of goods destined for grocery stores are still sitting at the Oceanex dock in St. John's after three cargo ships docks during the state of emergency. It's not necessarily the cause of the shortages in central Newfoundland, since 80 per cent of Oceanex's business is in the St. John's metro region, but it is indicative of the challenges in shipping produce after the storm. Oceanex was given essential service status, and began loading trucks Tuesday afternoon despite the state of emergency prohibiting most vehicles from being on the road. CEO Sid Hynes said the situation is getting better by the day, but the backlog of shipments since Friday has caused delays. ""We have major customers, large customers and until they are able to receive their freight, they're asking us to hold it,"" Hynes told Newfoundland Morning.  In St. John's, food supply was said to be in good shape when stores opened for the first time Tuesday, since most grocery store's distribution centres were well-stocked. They were unable to get trucks out to stores outside the Avalon, however. Erin Higdon of Atlantic Grocery Distributors said her company is used to weather delays, but this was beyond anything they'd faced before. ""There is no doubt with the volume of business that we do that some of those containers [at Oceanex] belong to us, and we're trying to work on the best plan to get them here and out to the customers who need them,"" she said. Higdon said they were working on getting back to normal. Both she and Hynes warned it could take a few days. The storm has been a lesson in food security for the island, said Josh Smee, CEO of the non-profit group Food First NL. It showed the ripple effect when one of the few commercial ports in the province is shut down for days at a time. ""It really does echo through the whole food system on the island,"" Smee said. It's a reality that's not going to change any time soon. Most food enters the province through cargo shipments to St. John's or Port aux Basques and is trucked to stores throughout Newfoundland and Labrador. When Marine Atlantic or Oceanex face lengthy delays, things get sparse. ""That's one inherent kind of weak point in our food system that in some ways is always going to be there,"" Smee said. Another lesson people can take away from the storm is that the way you prepare for an emergency is changing, he said, The typical rule of thumb is to have enough food and supplies on hand for 72 hours. Now into the sixth day, many people have gone well beyond the means they stockpiled before the storm hit. ""We might need to go longer than that [72-hour window],"" he said. ""We're seeing a lot more unstable weather and it's causing disruption to our food systems on a more regular basis."" The province's most recent climate change report, The Way Forward on Climate Change, addressed changes forecast by the middle of this century. One of the predictions is that severe storms could contain at least 20 per cent more precipitation than normal. Smee said people should not just stock up for themselves, but also stock up with others in mind. ""For those of us who are in a position [to stock up], we need to think as a community. How do we support folks who would be really challenged by that level of disruption?"" Hynes, meanwhile, said there are lessons to learn but his company will do its best to get the shipments out whenever they can be received. He said it could be another couple days before all the freight is delivered.

321,Robert Jones,2020-01-22T23:09:23.843Z,NB Power's smart meter plan gets major boost with critical endorsements,"Two key players who helped sink NB Power's application for smart meters two years ago told the Energy and Utilities Board they are satisfied the utility has sufficiently improved its proposal and individually offered critical endorsements of the new plan. ""Our own assessment is that even when tested, the business case advanced remains positive,"" said J.D. Irving Ltd. lawyer Christopher Stewart about NB Power's $92-million application to buy and deploy advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), including 360,000 smart meters. JDI and public intervener Heather Black both opposed a similar NB Power application two years ago and were each cited in the EUB's 2018 decision that rejected the project. But during closing arguments Wednesday wrapping up eight days of hearings into a renewed application, each said the utility had improved the quality of its proposal enough to warrant approval. ""Our criticisms in the last AMI proceeding were primarily centred on our view that the business case lacked detail on the primary benefits and lacked independent expert validation,"" said Stewart. ""NB Power has sufficiently addressed these perceived deficiencies in this application."" Black agreed and said she was satisfied by the entirety of the evidence and expert testimony that supported it. ""NB Power has proven that it has a positive business case,"" Black said. ""In any scenario that the evidence can bear, the business case is positive.""  NB Power considers the adoption of smart meters and the technology that supports them to be critical to its future and during the last two weeks put effort into presenting more convincing evidence for that position than it did in 2018.   The utility built a business case that showed the investment would make, not lose, money and it hired a string of experts to independently test its plans.    In a 94-minute closing address to the Energy and Utilities Board, NB Power lawyer John Furey methodically recapped the costs and benefits detailed in the business case supporting the AMI investment and tried to assure board members the utility would make the project work. ""It is in the best interest of NB Power, its customers and all stakeholders that the deployment of AMI is a success and that costs are contained within approved budgets and all benefits are achieved.""   Smart meters are capable of two-way communication with the utility, allowing them to be read remotely several times an hour rather than in person and manually once a month.    NB Power says that will generate 16 separate financial benefits in the short term that will more than pay for the $92 million upfront investment.    More importantly, it argues the meters will open up a variety of future innovations in pricing and service not possible without the technology, including time-varying rates where electricity can be priced at different amounts during different times of the day. During hearings, various interveners tested NB Power's budgets and projections for the project and although some weaknesses were found, none were large enough to kill the project a second time, according to Stewart. ""Broadly speaking, the quantified benefits asserted are within the realm of reasonableness and sufficiently supported by independent evidence,"" said Stewart. ""Costs are generally supported within a reasonable level of specificity and also supported by acceptable evidentiary foundation. ""The interveners and the utility might debate whether the precise quantification of a particular benefit should be x or y or whether an assumption is conservative as opposed to merely reasonable, but frankly that's the natural consequence of a proposal of this type.""  Endorsements were not unanimous. Individual interveners Gerald Bourque and Roger Richard each urged the EUB to reject the meters as unsafe.    Bourque said he considers the devices to be a fire hazard based on problems experienced in Saskatchewan several years ago.  Richard expressed concern about the long-term health effects of radio frequencies constantly emitted by the meters as they communicate data back to NB Power.   The utility has said consumers concerned about smart meters can refuse to accept them but will be billed for having their meters read manually at a cost estimated to be $4 per month. A decision from the EUB on the application is not expected for several weeks.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meters-eub-hearings-1.5436874,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-smart-meter-eub-hearings-1.5434186 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/nb-power-rate-meters-1.5430140,N/A

A string of break-and-enters in the town over the past three years coincides with the arrival of the man, who most residents of Cottrell's Cove believe is the perpetrator. ""Cabin owners and homeowners have come to our door and said we have to do something,"" said Fran Boone, one of the people behind the petition. The small town of less than 150 permanent residents has experienced more than two dozen break-ins over the past three years.  The nearest police station is in Grand Falls-Windsor, about 1½ hours away. Boone said while the RCMP are doing their job and have investigated the offences, the residents feel the justice system is not following through. ""They can charge him and when it goes to court he just walks away with it,"" Boone said. ""The justice system is failing us. He was in court the last year or so. He has been out and going back and forth. But he broke into four more places since he's been going back and forth to court."" William Smith is a member of the local service district committee that runs the community, and is also helping to organize the petition.  He said while there is no guarantee that a petition can force the man to leave the community, they are willing to try anything.  ""We don't know but we're going to try anyway to see what happens,"" Smith said. ""I mean at least we're going to try and get him out of town if we can."" He and many other residents in Cottrell's Cove are at their wits end with the man.  ""He is no longer welcome at my home. He's not my friend no more. Everybody has had enough of it,"" Smith said. ""I just don't know what to do with the guy anymore."" Boone said the man blames alcohol for his desire to commit the break-ins.  ""He did tell one person here that he breaks in only when he's feeling good — when he's drinking a few drinks."" She said the petition will be available for signatures starting May 23 of this year, since many cabin owners return to their properties after that date.  The RCMP did not comment on the petition, but in a statement to the CBC, did acknowledge they are investigating multiple break-ins in Cottrell's Cove, two of which have occurred since the start of January.   ""Charges can only be laid when there is evidence supporting them,"" the statement reads. ""The investigations are ongoing."" Police urge anyone with information on the crimes to contact the Grand Falls-Windsor RCMP.

The SNC-Lavalin bid failed to include a signalling or train control system, had no plan for snow removal and, at one point, appeared to believe the trains that run on the Trillium Line were electric, not diesel. SNC-Lavalin's winning LRT bid under auditor's microscope today The evaluation team concluded the bid was a ""poor technical submission throughout,"" and that ""resolving all of the major issues identified in the submission would be a lengthy and likely impractical process."" It was also critical of SNC-Lavalin for not being able to provide a plan for using the Trillium Line's existing fleet of Alstom LINT diesel trains in the future — something the other two finalists, Trillium Extension Alliance and Transit Link, were able to provide. The technical team called the omission a ""fatal flaw."" On Oct. 3, the team concluded SNC-Lavalin's proposal ""failed all four technical categories."" CBC Ottawa first reported back in March 2019 that SNC-Lavalin failed to meet the minimum technical score of 70 per cent that appeared to be required for a firm to continue in the competition, but still managed to win it. In August 2019, the city finally admitted it was true. SNC-Lavalin had failed to score 70 per cent not just once, but twice: the company, operating under the name TransitNEXT, scored 63 per cent; the team was directed to rescore the bidders, but SNC-Lavalin still only scored 67 per cent.   A secret clause in the request for proposals (RFP) allowed the city's senior management team to wave a bidder onto the financial round, even if that bidder didn't score 70 per cent in the technical evaluation. The city's senior executive team exercised this discretion — without knowing the identity of the bidder, they say — following the advice of Geoff Gilbert, a Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer hired by the city to oversee the procurement of the contracts for LRT Stage 2. Contrary to the technical evaluation team's advice, SNC-Lavalin's bid was allowed to move to the next phase of the evaluation process: the financial scoring. Because its bid was so much cheaper than its competitors, SNC-Lavalin was the put forward as the preferred proponent, and council approved the contract in March 2019. Ottawa officials say the SNC-Lavalin bid offered taxpayers good value. And last November, the city's auditor-general found that the city had broken no rules in awarding the contract to the Montreal-based engineering giant. Weeks after CBC Ottawa requested the technical evaluation team's presentation on its scoring, the city released them Thursday at 9 p.m., two hours after a marathon emergency meeting of the transit commission. Although the city had already released the scores for SNC-Lavalin, the newly released documents shed light on what led the evaluation team to fail the company in two rounds of scoring. On Oct. 3, the technical team presented its findings to the city's bid steering evaluation committee (BESC), a three-member team that oversaw the procurement for LRT Stage 2. The members of the committee included Gilbert, a Deloitte finance expert Remo Bucci and Simon Dupuis, a procurement officer for the city. On Oct. 10, a different Norton Rose Fulbright lawyer — Martin Masse — called a meeting with the team and told them to review their scores based on numerous written questions from the BESC. The committee was concerned the evaluation team had considered details in its scoring that weren't explicitly asked for in the RFP. After the technical team reviewed its evaluations, the scores of all three finalists rose slightly, but SNC-Lavalin still didn't make 70 per cent. And the evaluation team's responses to some of the BESC questions appear quite damning. For example, BESC questioned the failing score for the systems integration management plan, which only required a ""high-level description.""  The technical team responded: ""A high-level description should not include inaccurate information, such as references to elements that do not form part of the project scope of work, e.g. a catenary system, traction power substations … nor should it omit critical City tasks such as the integration of fare control equipment in the stations."" ""Catenary systems"" and ""traction power substations"" are parts of electric train systems — the Trillium Line is a diesel train system. ""This demonstrates that the proponent lacks understanding of the scope of [the] works,"" according to the evaluation team. Among other glaring problems, according to the technical evaluation team, was SNC-Lavalin's complete lack of a train control system in its bid. The RFP did not demand that bidders provide a specific supplier of a train control system, but it did require ""a narrative"" of a ""signalling and train control solution."" SNC-Lavalin gave no description of any kind of solution and stated only: ""At the time of the technical submission we are still finalizing the option selection process."" The documents also revealed the identities of the five people on the city's technical evaluation team. One familiar name on the team is Michael Morgan. He's currently the city's director of rail construction and often responds to media questions regarding Confederation Line problems. Morgan had a different job when he was on the evaluation team back in the fall of 2018.

Statistics Canada said Wednesday the consumer price index in December was up 2.2 per cent compared with a year ago, matching the year-over-year increase in November. Energy prices in December were up 5.5 per cent compared with a year ago, while gasoline prices were up 7.4 per cent compared with December 2018 when crude oil prices fell amid a global oversupply. Excluding gasoline, the consumer price index was up 2.0 per cent, the smallest increase since November 2018. The year-over-year growth in fresh vegetable prices slowed to 1.5 per cent in December compared with an increase of 7.1 per cent in November. Statistics Canada said lettuce prices were down 5.0 per cent compared with a year ago when prices rose due to an E. coli outbreak, which required the stock of romaine lettuce in the U.S. to be disposed of, limiting the supply and driving up prices for other kinds of lettuce. Prices for passenger vehicles in December also rose at a slower pace, rising 1.4 per cent compared with a year ago, compared with a 2.9 per cent increase in November. The average of Canada's three measures for core inflation, which are considered better gauges of underlying price pressures, was 2.10 per cent compared with a revised figure of 2.13 per cent for November.

Brown said he hopes to have a bylaw on short-term rentals in place by the end of March.  He also noted the city was able to increase use of public transportation, from 567,000 riders in 2018 to nearly 700,000 in 2019. Brown said he wants to see that number grow by another 100,000 in 2020.  ""By increasing public transit we are taking a big shot at bringing down our carbon footprint,"" he said. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-affordable-housing-city-of-charlottetown-1.5436088,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-affordable-housing-1.4770173 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-charlottetown-affordable-housing-1.4818338 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241,N/A
326,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:39:54.065Z,National public health data finds vaccine rates for kids falls short,"New data suggests vaccination rates among Canadian children are falling short. The Public Health Agency of Canada says none of the country's national vaccination goals were met in any of the age groups surveyed in 2017. Dr. Theresa Tam says that means more kids need their shots if we're going to reach sufficient community immunity to prevent disease and outbreaks. While at least 95 per cent of two-year-olds should ideally be covered, researchers found just 75.8 per cent received the multidose vaccine for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. Newfoundland and Labrador and Prince Edward Island were the only provinces to cover more than 80 per cent, while Manitoba and Nunavut were below 70 per cent. Adult immunization: Are you up to date? Download and print this handy record. | <a href=""https://twitter.com/ImmunizedotCa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@ImmunizedotCa</a> | <a href=""https://t.co/khNeBtBL1S"">https://t.co/khNeBtBL1S</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetImmunized?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#GetImmunized</a> <a href=""https://t.co/6TBkkzr6yA"">pic.twitter.com/6TBkkzr6yA</a> The study says 2.4 per cent of two-year-olds are estimated to be unvaccinated, with Atlantic Canada having the lowest unvaccinated rate at 1.3 per cent, while British Columbia had the highest at 3.9 per cent. Among seven-year-olds, only girls vaccinated for rubella met the 95-per cent coverage goal at 95.8 per cent, versus 93.8 per cent for boys. That vaccine only requires one dose, compared to two doses for measles and mumps where the national rate was 87 per cent and 86.4 per cent, respectively. Meanwhile, none of the three routine vaccines for adolescents met the national coverage goal of 90 per cent, although the Tdap booster came close at 89.3 per cent. Kids aged 14 and 17 get up to three routine vaccinations in school-based programs, depending on the jurisdiction, including for hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV). The Public Health Agency of Canada routinely monitors childhood vaccination rates through the childhood National Immunization Coverage Survey, which began in 1994 and has been conducted approximately every two years. Experts set vaccination goals in 2017, with the aim of reaching them by 2025. Although the numbers fall short of ideal, Tuesday's study said vaccination coverage among two- and seven-year-olds have not changed much in recent years. The agency said an upcoming report will look at knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of Canadian parents regarding vaccination. In other data, the survey found polio coverage for two-year-olds higher at 90.7 per cent, but Newfoundland and Labrador was the only province to reach the 95 per cent goal, at 96.9 per cent. Other provinces and territories came close — including P.E.I. at 93.9 per cent, Nova Scotia at 93.5 per cent and the Yukon at 93.7 per cent. Coverage was lowest in British Columbia at 87.5 per cent, Manitoba at 85.6 per cent and Nunavut at 82.1 per cent. Measles coverage for two-year-olds was 90.2 per cent but when doses administered to those under the recommended 12 months were excluded, coverage dropped to 87.6 per cent. The lowest coverage for seven-year-olds involved five doses or more for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, where only 80.5 per cent of kids were covered. In 14-year-olds, HPV coverage in girls increased to 83 per cent from 74.6 per cent, likely due to increased availability and awareness of this relatively new vaccine, said the study.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/health-vaccine-kids-1.5436161,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/measles-infants-study-toronto-1.5367821,N/A
327,Anonymous,2020-01-22T21:06:55.726Z,Duelling demonstrations held for and against Teck's $20B Frontier oilsands mine ,"Duelling rallies held up traffic Wednesday on Ninth Avenue in downtown Calgary as opponents of a proposed oilsands mine faced off with demonstrators who came out to show their support for the $20-billion project. A few dozen activists with Extinction Rebellion stood outside the office building where Teck Resources has an office. They displayed signs calling for Ottawa to reject the company's bid to build the Frontier mine north of Fort McMurray, Alta., which would produce 260,000 barrels of oil a day. ""Just reading the news and headlines that are available to me as a layperson, there are some economic issues, there are Indigenous rights issues, there are environmental issues, habitat issues, and then of course the big one being greenhouse gas emissions, climate emissions,"" said Extinction Rebellion member Sarah Flynn. ""Ultimately, this mine will be so devastating to the climate, and we're in a climate crisis … so the short-term advantages of the jobs and the income that this mine will offer will be far outweighed by the climate devastation that the whole world will experience."" At the same time, a counter-rally organized by Canada Action drew a greater number of people, who came out to voice support for the project. On its Facebook page, the pro-resource sector group said the mine has the potential to boost government coffers by $70 billion over its lifespan and provide thousands of jobs. Canada Action reminded its supporters that its event was intended to be non-partisan, positive and respectful. As members of Extinction Rebellion made speeches opposing the project, some protesters with the other side chanted slogans such as ""approve that mine"" and ""let us build."" That prompted counter-slogans shouted back by the other group. A supporter of Canada Action said oil from Canada's energy industry is more ethically produced and cleaner than that which comes from the Middle East, for example. ""If we don't put Canadian energy out, such as Teck mines, it will be replaced with foreign oil, such as Saudi Arabia, Argentina, other countries that do not live up to the same standards that we have here,"" said Josh Metz. Metz said he thinks the opposing sides need to meet in the middle, acknowledge climate change is real, and take measured steps toward cleaner and renewable energy.  ""But we've got to have a real conversation on how we get there,"" he said.  Teck has projected the open-pit mining operation, covering 292 square kilometres, will emit 4.1 megatonnes of carbon dioxide a year over its four decades in operation. But some environmental groups say that estimate is too low. Frontier got the green light from regulators in July 2019 after a joint panel of officials from both the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency recommended the project receive the final approval from the federal environment minister. The panel concluded that, even if Frontier is built, Alberta would be able to keep emissions from the sector below the 100 megatonnes cap for greenhouse gas emissions that the former provincial NDP government imposed on the industry. Ottawa must make a decision on the project by the end of February under the Environmental Assessment Act. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has called for swift approval of the project, warning that rejection would send a signal that Canada's oil-and-gas sector has no future. Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson says Ottawa must assess how Frontier fits into the government's promise to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Teck Resources Ltd. says it has spent more than a decade on community engagement, including signing agreements with all 14 Indigenous communities in the project area. The agreements set out a framework for co-operation in areas like environmental stewardship and economic opportunities, it says. About 7,000 jobs would be created in building the mine and 2,500 workers would be needed to operate it.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/rival-rallies-teck-frontier-mine-approval-ottawa-oilsands-calgary-protests-1.5436228,[],N/A
328,Paul Palmeter,2020-01-23T12:44:40.090Z,Eagle watch draws birds and tourists to tiny Nova Scotia community,"If the eagles around Sheffield Mills could talk they would likely call Malcolm Lake the chicken man. When Lake pulls into the open Nova Scotia field with several dead chicken carcasses in buckets, dozens of large eagles can be seen in nearby hardwood trees anxiously awaiting his arrival. ""They know my vehicle and as soon as I get up there and open my door I can hear them begin to chatter away in the trees,"" said Lake. Lake collects dead chickens from several nearby poultry farms. After he throws the carcasses into the field the eagles keep their distance until Lake walks away. Then they slowly begin to approach the dead birds in the snow, before long dozens of eagles come out of the trees to feed. ""The most I've ever counted here was 92 eagles the week before last,"" said Lake. ""I've had up to 80 eagles here in the last seven days."" Lake feeds the eagles twice a day from late December to late March. He's excited for the 29th annual Sheffield Mills eagle watch which begins this weekend. ""It actually goes back to the '80s when the eagles were an endangered species in this county,"" said Lake. ""Back then the Nova Scotia government asked the farmers to throw out their dead chickens to give the juvenile eagles a better chance to survive the winter, the rest of the year they fend for themselves."" Last year eagle watch saw more than 5,000 people gather in the area to witness the majestic birds perform their amazing aerial displays as they descend on the field. Many of the visitors are amateur photographers who come from far away to see the eagles. Ron and Jane Todd are from Framingham, Mass. They honeymooned in Nova Scotia 40 years ago and this week they drove 12 hours so they could see the eagles up close. ""You don't often see something like this, so many bald eagles,"" said Jane Todd. ""We know we'll see something different each time."" The Todds are staying at a nearby bed and breakfast. Eagle watch is spread out over the next two weekends and has a big economic spinoff for the area. ""Eagle watch will bring in a lot of different people to the community that we don't normally see,"" said Jason deGraaf, who operates a local gas bar and convenience store in nearby Canning. ""It's going to be quite a busy two weekends for us."" The eagle watch festivities include pancake breakfasts and entertainment at the local community hall. All money raised will stay in the community. ""It's crucial for us, for our community hall, as it's our main fundraiser,"" said Meg Hodges, a member of the Sheffield Mills Community Association. ""It kind of keeps the lights on and the roof on and makes it available to our community, so without eagle watch we probably wouldn't have our hall.""

329,Erica Johnson,2019-05-01T09:00:00.135Z,Bank employees angry regulator's report on sales tactics weakened after banks and government review drafts,"Several bank employees are speaking out, angered by recent revelations that a report on banking sales tactics was weakened after the regulator shared a draft copy with the banks and federal government. They contacted Go Public to reveal why they think upselling wasn't widely detected during a lengthy review of misleading sales tactics by the regulator — slamming the bank review as inaccurate, inappropriate and a PR exercise. The employees provided internal documents disclosing aggressive upselling they said isn't obvious and said they were frustrated by a recent Go Public story that showed a report released by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada last year had key consumer protections eliminated after early drafts were shared with the federal Finance Department and the big banks. ""When I saw the regulator gave the report to the banks, I couldn't believe it,"" a CIBC call centre employee wrote to Go Public. ""I had to reach out to you."" CBC has confirmed the identity of bank employees in this story, but is not revealing them to protect their employment.  The regulator told Go Public it gave banks a draft report so they could identify factual errors. The review was conducted in 2017 and culminated in a report released on March 20, 2018. The FCAC's handling of its bank review is grounds for a public inquiry into the regulator and Canada's financial services, says the Small Investor Protection Association (SIPA), a consumer advocacy organization. ""It's proof that the Department of Finance is complicit with the FCAC and is deceiving the public,"" SIPA president Stan Buell told Go Public. The CIBC call centre employee says she was one of the people interviewed by the FCAC as part of its review.  The regulator interviewed some 200 bank employees at various branches of BMO, CIBC, RBC, TD, Scotia and National Bank as well as 400 more employees — some of whom, worked at banking call centres. ""That whole interview was an exercise in public relations,"" she says. She says during the interview, she wasn't transparent about the pressure to meet sales targets, because she worried the process wasn't confidential.  Been wronged? Contact Erica and Go Public team ""Did I tell them we were pushing sales hard? No way,"" she says. ""How did I know that wouldn't get back to someone?"" She says she has sold things to help the bank's bottom line and meet sales targets, but has made it seem as though it is in the best interest of the client. ""At every telephone banking level, we are trying to sell to the client."" She says she had to vent, after learning the regulator's report was weakened, after early versions were sent to banks and government. ""It just made me really angry, reading what went on behind the scenes,"" she says. In an email to Go Public, CIBC's director of public affairs Trish Tervit says the bank ""supplied complete org charts"" to the FCAC.  ""The bank did not select which employees were interviewed as part of the FCAC's industry-wide review,"" wrote Tervit. ""Putting clients at the centre of all we do is our priority every day. We have a strong, client-focused culture and we continuously review our business to ensure we do what's right for our clients."" A Scotiabank financial adviser says he thought it was inappropriate for the FCAC to let banks see the draft report.  ""The banks shouldn't have had any say in it, in any way,"" he says. ""That's shocking to me."" He says his sales targets have sharply increased since last November. He says employees are upselling customers simply to meet sales targets, but that much of that harm would be impossible for the regulator to detect. He provided a screenshot of an internal website, showing that the higher an interest rate an employee quotes a customer on a mortgage, the more sales units they earn towards their target.  ""They [customers] don't know they could've got a lower mortgage rate,"" says the financial adviser. ""I don't know how upselling would ever be tracked."" Another example of upselling he said the regulator couldn't detect is the way employees are encouraged to move clients away from investing in GICs and steer them into mutual funds, which provide guaranteed annual fees for the bank. To meet sales targets, he says he pushes mutual funds because he gets double the amount of credit. ""That can be harmful to customers,"" he says, ""because a mutual fund might not make sense."" In an email to Go Public, Scotiabank director of Canadian banking communications Patricia Hsiung wrote, ""Any reports that Scotiabank has set aggressive sales targets are inaccurate and misleading. Scotiabank remains committed to delivering an exceptional, transparent and trustworthy experience for our customers that prioritizes our relationships over products."" She also wrote that the bank considers ""customer feedback from more than one million surveys yearly"" and is making, ""great strides in driving towards industry leadership in overall customer satisfaction."" Another Scotiabank financial adviser working in a different city also contacted Go Public to say he was disturbed to see the regulator's report was weakened after it went to government and the banks, and that the regulator's claim that it did not find that bank customers were widely harmed — is not accurate. He provided documents showing his sales targets had significantly increased as of last fall. ""The pressure is enormous,"" he says. ""We're lying to our clients. Upselling all the time. You don't want to do it, but if you don't, you'll lose your job."" He says the regulator wouldn't know his manager tells him to gloss over the fees attached to a mutual fund. ""People will back out if they know there's risk involved, or fees,"" he says. He says he also increases credit card limits because he's under pressure to hit sales targets, but the FCAC wouldn't be able to tell that either, by looking at files. ""If they [bank customer] have an existing card with a $5,000 credit limit, I'll say, 'I see you're pre-approved for $10,000, let's attach that to your file,'"" he says. ""I don't ask the client if that's a good thing for them, in case they say no. I need to make points for my sales target."" News that the banking regulator provided draft copies of its review into aggressive sales tactics to government and the banks has prompted renewed calls for a public inquiry into financial services and the FCAC from the Small Investor Protection Association. ""I really think the government needs to listen to the voices of the people, to understand what their needs are and the impact on their lives, due to the lack of investor protection,"" says Buell. ""The FCAC should be providing that, but is not."" In a statement released earlier this week, Buell said an independent inquiry is necessary because ""Canadians are entrusting their hard-earned money, savings and futures with what should be trusted institutions and individuals."" ""There appears to be a far too cosy relationship between the banking industry, the FCAC and the Finance Department,"" says Buell. Go Public asked Finance Minister Bill Morneau about claims that the report was weakened after he saw it. ""Obviously, it's always important for us to take a look at how the banking sector is working,"" he says.  ""And I'm confident the FCAC did a good job."" Regardless of whether or not a public inquiry is called, one of the Scotiabank financial advisers who reached out says he has a message for banks, and for bank customers.  ""They [the banks] need to stop being so greedy and ripping people off,"" he says. ""And when people go to the bank, they shouldn't trust what we say. We're under pressure to sell, but we can't tell you that."" Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

330,Haydn Watters,2020-01-23T18:23:22.192Z,Here's what the province and teachers get wrong on job action,"Amid the teacher job action, there's been a spate of misleading and false information floating around. And both the provincial government and the unions and its teachers are to blame. It makes an already complex situation — with four teachers unions all in different states of rotating job action — even more complicated to follow. Here are some of the most commons claims that have caused confusion. Education minister Stephen Lecce has often talked about the frequency of teacher union escalation, complaining it happens ""every few years."" He even put out a video on Twitter, showing a timeline of more than 200 strikes in the period from Bob Rae's government in the 1990s to Doug Ford's today. But the strikes shown are misleading, as it includes local school board strikes, rather than just province-wide ones. This means a strike like the one-day event in Sept. 2005 in the Moosonee District School Area Board is included, even though it didn't impact anyone else in the province. Not every union escalates action every few years. And in many cases, it is localized rather than province-wide. The current action is significant, though. It marks the first time since 1997 all four unions are involved in some form of job action. Back then, all unions staged a two week, province-wide strike. With the rolling strikes happening now, many teachers are returning to the picket lines for the first time since then. The province and the unions are also seemingly at odds over what the job action is about. Unions have been focusing on issues like class sizes, e-learning, teacher shortages and school classroom. But the education minister has talked a lot about wages. Most unions have said they want more money than the one per cent increase the province is offering; Premier Doug Ford said he's not willing to consider anything more. ""Make no mistake about it, this is about compensation,"" he said. Lecce echoed Ford's comments Monday, telling reporters compensation is something unions ""choose not to talk about."" But all unions told CBC compensation was on the bargaining table, with the ETFO, OSSTF and AEFO hoping to match inflation — which roughly works out to about a two percent increase. Only OECTA would not specify what it was seeking, saying it would better be discussed while bargaining. It's wrong to say unions aren't talking about it but it's also incorrect to say it's not an issue to unions. As strikes got underway Monday morning, the Kawartha Pine Ridge Elementary Teachers Federation posted a tweet claiming there hasn't been a ""single attempt to bargain."" It was then retweeted by ETFO president Sam Hammond, to his 15,000 followers. Only the French union has future talks planned, set for the end of the month. The province said bargaining with the other three unions is in the ""hands of the mediator."" Unions worry changes to class sizes or the province's plan for mandatory e-learning would cause job losses. Some union members continue to cite 10,000 jobs being lost over five years, a number that was estimated in a September 2019 report by Ontario's financial accountability officer. The FAO said 9,060 fewer high school teachers and 994 fewer elementary teachers would be needed by the 2023-24 school year. The number continues to be shared online but is no longer accurate, given the province has since changed plans after blow back. For example, the province partially backtracked on larger classroom sizes in high school, from the proposed average funded 28 to 25, which means more teachers would be necessary than indicated in the report. However, 22.5 students was the previous funded average and the government hasn't indicated it will go back to that number. That all but guarantees jobs will still be shed.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/teacher-job-action-fact-check-1.5435941,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/catholic-school-strikes-hamilton-1.5434486 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940,N/A
331,Sara Frizzell,2020-01-22T10:00:00.372Z,Nunavut's government and Inuit organization renew promise to work together,"Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI) and the government of Nunavut have renewed their commitment to work together with the signing of the Katujjiqatigiinniq Protocol.  The signing happened Tuesday in the Koojesse room of the Frobisher Inn. The government's cabinet and NTI's board witnessed the signing.  This isn't the first time NTI and Nunavut's government have recommitted to each other. The organizations have reaffirmed their partnership twice since 1999: first in 2004 and again in 2011, with the Clyde River Protocol.  Why now? — NTI's president Aluki Kotierk quipped: ""It's a new decade.""  This time, questions focused on how the two parties are handling what has appeared to be a fraught conversation on the future of education in the territory.  Nunavut's government is in the midst of updating the territory's Education Act and Inuit Languages Protection Act, via Bill 25. NTI had asked to have a larger role in the creation of the bill.  ""Certainly we have a difference of opinion, in terms of how we've worked together and whether or not it's been a partnership approach, in terms of Bill 25 specifically,"" Kotierk said.    One of the Katujjiqatigiinniq Protocol priorites is continuing to implement Article 32 of the Nunavut Agreement, which provides Inuit the right to have a say in the government's social and cultural policies.  ""I think it's very interesting how the public perception might be that there are things that we're not working well on and that's where the interest often lies, but I think we have many examples where we work well together,"" Kotierk said.  She gave examples she was proud of, such as the tripartite agreement on health with the federal government, and issues related to poverty reduction. Nunavut's premier Joe Savikataaq added the agreement-in-principle on devolution to that list.  ""I think the timing is just right,"" Savikataaq said. ""We have ... a new minority government, which seems to be a lot more willing to work with partners. It's just something we felt the timing was appropriate."" If NTI and the territory can be united in their requests to the federal government, Savikataaq says he feels they will be more successful.  The agreement reaffirms structures that are already in place, including quarterly meetings between the premier and the president of NTI, and the goal of biweekly meetings between the CEO of NTI and the deputy minister of Nunavut's Department of Executive and Intergovernmental Affairs.  NTI is the organization responsible for implementing the land claims agreement, now known as the Nunavut Agreement, and for representing Inuit in the territory. As Inuit are the territory's majority population, Kotierk says, it makes sense that the two collaborate on issues.  Savikataaq says the two groups will continue to have disagreements, but will work through them with meaningful consultation.  ""The land claim spells out our obligations and this is just to reinforce our obligations and our commitments to work together for the betterment of Nunavummiut,"" Savikataaq said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nti-government-nunavut-katujjiqatigiinniq-protocol-1.5435310,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/education-act-consultations-nunavut-1.4928172 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/bill-25-nunavut-education-1.5377738 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/look-ahead-north-politics-2020-1.5411682,N/A
332,Ariana Kelland,2019-12-18T10:48:09.612Z,Jennifer Hillier-Penney took estranged husband off life insurance 2 weeks before she disappeared,"Two weeks before Jennifer Hillier-Penney vanished from her estranged husband's house in a remote Newfoundland town, she removed him as a beneficiary on her life insurance policy. For her oldest daughter, Marina Penney, that gesture says a lot about what her mother was thinking in the days leading up to her disappearance in St. Anthony. ""She knew that something was going to happen to her,"" Penney said from her Clarenville home this week. ""She was living in fear."" Hillier-Penney disappeared from Dean Penney's home on Nov. 30, 2016. Documents show the change in her life insurance policy — removing Dean Penney and leaving her two daughters as beneficiaries — was signed and dated on Nov. 16, 2016. ""The 16th of November, as I know it, it was the day her life was threatened. She went back to work that day and she had her friend witness those changes to take my dad off that policy,"" Marina Penney said.  The RCMP have not named any suspects in the suspicious disappearance of Hillier-Penney. Documents, however, indicate the Mounties believe she was kidnapped and killed.  The RCMP are not commenting on the existence of the life insurance policy or what it could mean. ""All tips and any new information received are being pursued,"" RCMP spokesperson Glenda Power said in an email. ""Police do feel there are people who may have information relevant to the investigation who have not come forward."" Marina Penney said she knew about the change in her mother's policy shortly after she went missing. But after three years without answers, she's decided to take it upon herself to reveal details she believes are important in the case. She posted the policy documents on a Facebook page dedicated to finding her mother.  ""There were very few people that knew that had happened, and I'm to the point now where I just need to put her story out there,"" Marina Penney said.  ""People need to know that."" Hillier-Penney went to her estranged husband's home that night to stay with their daughter, Deana.  Dean Penney told The Fifth Estate last year he was going hunting at their cabin in Northwest Arm, 45 minutes away. The next morning, her daughter woke to find her mother's cellphone, purse, jacket and books were still inside the house. Her vehicle was also still outside.   Police believe she disappeared around 8 p.m. Before she disappeared, Hillier-Penney was looking into leaving her estranged husband and her hometown behind, her daughter said. She had a job interview lined up in Glovertown. Friends of Hillier-Penney have said she expressed fear over leaving Penney. ""Jennifer told me … that he said that he would make away with her. And they would never find her. Like she knew that,"" friend Vicki Burden told The Fifth Estate in 2018. ""She had said stuff to me, but not to the extent she told other people,"" Marina Penney said. ""She just didn't want to burden me with it."" Dean Penney did return to his home the night of Hillier-Penney's disappearance, he told The Fifth Estate, to get his duck decoys. Penney said last year he has no knowledge of what happened to Hillier-Penney. Marina Penney is unable to move forward until her mother's body is found. ""I'm in limbo. A lot of anger right now. Coming up on the third year, the weight of all this is heavy,"" she said. For three years, she has racked her brain thinking of where her mother could be. She has no doubt she's dead. Those suspicions have torn Marina Penney's family on both sides apart, she said, ""No one looks at each other the same anymore."" Dean Penney's lawyer, Bob Simmonds, declined comment when reached by phone Tuesday about the change in Hillier-Penney's life insurance policy.  In the years following Hillier-Penney's disappearance, Marina Penney has longed to have her mother near her — especially when she had her first child, who's now 19 months old.  It's not about what Marina has missed, she insists, but about the life her mother never got to live.  ""She was 38 years old. She had plans. She was sick of living a miserable life and she wanted to do more for herself,"" Marina Penney said. ""She wanted to be happy and that was taken from her."" What tears Marina Penney up inside is knowing her grandfather went to his grave in August without knowing what happened to his daughter. ""In the last three years, he spent so much time sat down by himself consumed by his own thoughts,"" she said. ""That killed him. It was too hard on his heart."" The RCMP were granted an extension last Thursday to hold items seized from Dean Penney's home, the family cabin and a vehicle. Some exhibits have been tested at the RCMP's national crime lab in Ottawa, while others may need to be sent for analysis. ""If they had hard evidence, somebody would be in jail,"" Marina Penney said.  Penney said she's not confident in the case that the RCMP is building, and has been disillusioned by the investigation.  ""It's not that [the RCMP] don't want her found. They want her found more than anything but they got to start taking more action. Because people are going to start doing it themselves.""

333,Anonymous,2020-01-22T19:53:14.614Z,Monty Python performer and director Terry Jones dead at 77 ,"Terry Jones, a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, has died at 77. He had been suffering from dementia. Jones's agent said he died Tuesday evening. In a statement, his family said he died ""after a long, extremely brave but always good-humoured battle with a rare form of dementia, FTD."" In 2016 he was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, which gradually robbed him of the ability to write and speak. Jones's wife, Anna Soderstrom, and children Bill, Sally and Siri, said ""we have all lost a kind, funny, warm, creative and truly loving man whose uncompromising individuality, relentless intellect and extraordinary humour has given pleasure to countless millions across six decades."" With fellow Britons Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and American Terry Gilliam, Jones formed Monty Python's Flying Circus, whose anarchic and surreal humour helped revolutionize comedy. Jones wrote and performed for the troupe's TV series, which ran over five years on BBC and was later picked up in the U.S. by PBS, and their films. Jones directed Monty Python's Life of Brian, with a co-director credit with Gilliam on Monty Python and the Holy Grail and The Meaning of Life. He went on to direct the non-Python films Personal Services starring Julie Walters and Erik the Viking starring Cleese and Tim Robbins. He also wrote books on medieval and ancient history, presented documentaries, directed films, wrote poetry and wrote the script for the Jim Henson-directed fantasy film Labyrinth. In 2014, the group reunited for a series of shows at London's O2 Arena, one of which was later filmed, entitled Monty Python Live (Mostly). ""His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programs, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath,"" they said. Chapman died in 1989 of cancer, while Neil Innes, the musician often known as the ""seventh Python"" for his contributions to their songs and sketches, died in December. Palin paid tribute to his longtime colleague in a statement given to Britain's Press Association, while on social media Cleese, Idle, Gilliam and British comedians Stephen Fry and David Walliams were among those remembering Jones fondly. ""He was far more than one of the funniest writer-performers of his generation, he was the complete Renaissance comedian — writer, director, presenter, historian, brilliant children's author, and the warmest, most wonderful company you could wish to have,"" said Palin. You will be very missed old friend. I feel very fortunate to have shared so much of my life with Terry. <a href=""https://t.co/4oNANoIeB2"">pic.twitter.com/4oNANoIeB2</a> ""So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him,"" added Idle. ""Terry was someone totally consumed with life … a brilliant, constantly questioning, iconoclastic, righteously argumentative and angry but outrageously funny and generous and kind human being … and very often a complete pain in the ass,"" said Gilliam. ""One could never hope for a better friend."" ""It feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently away … Two down, four to go,"" said Cleese. Born in Wales in 1942, Jones attended Oxford University, where he began writing and performing with fellow student Palin. After leaving university, he wrote for seminal 1960s comedy series including The Frost Report and Do Not Adjust Your Set before Monty Python's Flying Circus was formed. Jones's roles with the troupe included playing the mother of Brian, a hapless young man who is mistaken for Jesus. He delivered one of the Pythons' most famous lines: ""He's not the Messiah. He's a very naughty boy!"" In Meaning of Life he portrayed Mr. Creosote, the corpulent fine dining patron who at first refuses a ""wafer-thin mint"" after his meal but then consumes it, exploding on his fellow restaurant goers. I loved him the moment I saw him on stage at the Edinburgh Festival in 1963. So many laughs,moments of total hilarity onstage and off we have all shared with him. It’s too sad if you knew him,but if you didn’t you will always smile at the many wonderfully funny moments he gave us Just heard about Terry J<br><br>It feels strange that a man of so many talents and such endless enthusiasm, should have faded so gently away...<br><br>Of his many achievements, for me the greatest gift he gave us all was his direction of 'Life of Brian'. Perfection<br><br>Two down, four to go Farewell, Terry Jones. The great foot has come down to stamp on you. My god what pleasure you gave, what untrammelled joy and delight.

334,Erica Johnson,2019-06-10T20:42:18.198Z,Sunday school teacher says she was strip-searched at Vancouver airport after angry guard failed to find drugs,"A former Sunday school teacher who was falsely accused of being a drug smuggler, detained at Vancouver International Airport and eventually strip searched says she is still traumatized by the treatment and is calling for greater oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency. Jill Knapp's run-in with CBSA agents took place on Jan. 9, 2016, on her way home to Calgary, after visiting her husband in Mexico City. The 39-year-old says she is only now speaking out about her experience because she was diagnosed with anxiety after her airport ordeal. ""It was traumatizing,"" Knapp told Go Public, explaining that no one told her why she was red-flagged as she attempted to make her connecting flight in Vancouver. She said she has no criminal record and had nothing in her luggage that would prompt a closer look. ""Within two minutes he called me a drug smuggler, mentioned a strip search, and even said that he was going to send me to the hospital for an X-ray [to look for drugs],"" says Knapp. ""And that was before he even asked me any questions."" A request under the Access to Information Act by the CBC reveals other airline travellers have officially complained about mistreatment by border agents including screaming, using foul language, belittling them, using racial profiling and physical force. A civil liberties advocate says the complaints point to the need for independent oversight of the CBSA, the only major law enforcement agency in Canada that doesn't have external review of employee conduct. ""When border agents operate — either at land crossings, at airports — there is very little oversight,"" says Tim McSorley, national co-ordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, based in Ottawa. Knapp says she had collected her luggage when she was pulled aside and directed to ""secondary inspection,"" where she says a border guard became instantly aggressive. ""Out of nowhere, he actually raised his voice at me and said, 'I think you're a drug smuggler,'"" says Knapp. ""He said, 'I deal with people like you every day.'"" Knapp says she told him she had been visiting her husband in Mexico and that she had applied for him to live in Canada, but says the agent didn't believe her. She says the agent also didn't believe her when he asked what her job was and Knapp told him she worked with law firms as a software instructor. ""He actually scoffed at me and said, 'You don't do that type of work.' How would he know what kind of work I did? He was getting angrier and angrier."" The agent confiscated her phone and demanded her password. Finding nothing incriminating on her phone or in her luggage, the agent called in a drug-sniffing dog, which also didn't detect anything. Knapp says she was eventually placed in detention, but says she wasn't told why. She requested to speak with a lawyer and was told staff placed a call on her behalf, but she never heard from anyone. She hadn't eaten for 14 hours, but was only offered half a glass of water and no food. She says CBSA staff denied her requests to use the bathroom. Knapp was growing increasingly concerned about her parents, who were picking her up in Calgary. Her father is a heart attack survivor, and she worried about causing him stress. In desperation, she says, she offered to have the strip search the agent had mentioned hours earlier. ""At that point, I was so scared of what they would do if I stayed, it was like … if this is what it takes for me to leave, I'm going to do it.'"" Knapp says two female officers entered the room and told her to strip from the waist up. She told them she was a Sunday School teacher before complying. Finding nothing, they ordered her to remove her clothing from the waist down. ""They actually made me turn around, open up my butt cheeks and squat,"" says Knapp. ""I was just in shock. I didn't quite understand what it involved."" Knapp was finally released, and her phone returned. She found half a dozen texts from her anxious husband wondering where she was. CBC requested an interview with the CBSA, but the agency declined. In a statement, it said it couldn't discuss Knapp's case due to privacy concerns. After Knapp filed a complaint, she obtained internal documents through the Privacy Act, in which CBSA spokesperson Isabel McCusker wrote: ""The review of Ms. Knapp's clearance established that the [border services officers] involved in her examination followed standard procedures and guidelines."" CBC received over 1,700 pages of documents, most of the material heavily censored, after submitting a request under the Access to Information Act to find out how many other travellers have filed complaints about their treatment at the hands of the CBSA. We asked for complaints the agency classified under ""Officer/employee conduct,"" ""Questioning"" and other categories, for Vancouver International Airport, Toronto's Pearson International Airport and Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport between July 1, 2016, and July 1, 2018. The documents contain more than 800 allegations investigated by the CBSA about border agents and inappropriate behaviour, including the following: ""Officer commented, 'People like you who can't afford to travel always traffic drugs.'"" ""Threw me on the ground, yelling 'Don't resist'... [other] agents loved this and were laughing."" ""Hauled into the airport jail and treated like trash."" ""He called me moron more than once ... mocked my ... accent."" ""I was roughly frisked ... detained/held for questioning for seven hours."" ""He attacked me in the baggage claim area ... made anti-Semitic remarks."" ""He was pushing me with his hands ... started using foul language."" ""They broke my iPad."" ""Pulled out a knife in a threatening manner ... stared at me and then thrust the knife into the cardboard box."" The CBSA has a code of conduct, which says officers will act with ""professionalism, integrity and respect."" ""It's completely unacceptable and … kind of repulsive that people go through this when they're simply trying to travel to their destination,"" says McSorley, who reviewed the complaints. ""It's ... just common courtesy and decency that you wouldn't swear, use racist terms, use anti-Semitic terms, use physical force against someone who hasn't broken a law."" A CBSA spokesperson said during the calendar years 2016 to 2018, it investigated 821 allegations of misconduct by agents at all border crossings, of which 615 led to disciplinary action — including termination. McSorley's organization has been pushing for years for external oversight of the CBSA. ""There are millions of people crossing our border, flying into the country,"" says McSorley. ""The public deserves transparency from [the CBSA]."" For three years, the federal government has been promising to bring in oversight, and a bill is currently before the House of Commons. However, it has not yet received royal assent, and time is running out before the House breaks for the Oct. 21 federal election. Harassment, sexual assault among alleged misconduct by border agents investigated by CBSA In another internal CBSA memo Knapp obtained through the Privacy Act, as part of an internal investigation into the complaint she filed, an officer wrote that she was detained because her eyes appeared to be bloodshot — perhaps raising suspicion of drug use. Knapp says her eyes were red due to crying because she missed her husband. The officer also noted she was wearing bulky clothing, which Knapp disputes, saying she was wearing a fitted yoga outfit. Lastly, the officer questioned why she was flying through Vancouver on her way home to Calgary from Mexico. ""That was because I was using Aeroplan and that was the only route I could do,"" says Knapp. ""But the thing is, no one ever raised any of these concerns with me."" Knapp says she is speaking out about what happened to her to try to encourage Ottawa to change how complaints about the CBSA are investigated. ""I'm a safe person to talk about it because I'm a Canadian citizen … and I have no risk of deportation or anything like that,"" she says.

335,Evan Dyer,2020-01-24T16:57:11.226Z,Flames of blame: how climate change could upset the race to lead the Conservative Party,"Former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's tone was measured. But his words were as blistering as an Australian bushfire as he denounced his successor as leader of Australia's main right-centre political party, confusingly named the Liberals. He ""could not explain"" why Prime Minister Scott Morrison refused to meet with experts or take the bushfire threat seriously, despite warnings from scientists. ""It's just not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would or should act in a national crisis like this."" ""How many more coral reefs have to be bleached? How many more million hectares of forest have to be burned? How many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong?"" asked Turnbull. Then he twisted the knife in his colleague —who has already been publicly shamed for taking a family vacation as Australia burned. ""Rather than doing what a leader should do,"" Turnbull said, Morrison ""downplayed it and at times discounted the influence of climate change, which is just nonsense from a scientific point of view. So that's misleading people."" ""When your house is burning around you, that'll change your point of view in a hurry,"" said Marilyn Gladu, the only Canadian Conservative leadership candidate with a background in science (she's a chemical engineer). ""We need to get a sense of urgency without waiting for the house to burn down."" Gladu said the leadership race should be an opportunity for the party to re-think its approach to the climate file. ""I think it needs to be a topic because it's clear that the policy that we brought on climate change didn't resonate with Canadians in the election,"" she said. ""And so, if we're going to win the next election, we've got to come to Canadians with a credible offering."" Gladu said the Conservative Party under Andrew Scheer presented policies that left Canadians wondering ""how is that going to reduce the footprint? And how much is it going to reduce it by? ""People want to see a chart that says, 'Here are the Paris targets, and here are the different contributors that we will eliminate in order to achieve that target.' That's really what we need to do in order to have a credible plan."" Scheer failed to explain during the campaign how a government led by him would meet Canada's Paris targets — and wasn't even able to say what Canada's Paris target is when asked for the number directly at a campaign stop in Quebec that was dedicated to climate policy. That allowed the Liberals to pose as the champions of climate action, although their own plan also falls short of the Paris target — which itself falls short of what scientists say is needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. The Conservatives have seen consensus positions in the party on some issues change rapidly.  When leadership candidate Richard Décarie called homosexuality a ""choice"" on Wednesday, it quickly became clear that opinion was no longer an accepted part of the CPC consensus. From a stance opposing gay marriage — a position once shared by all federal parties — they have moved to acceptance. After the election loss, it was that issue that finally led to the undoing of Andrew Scheer as leader after two party stalwarts called him out for his unwillingness to attend Pride parades, in an op-ed article they wrote for the Globe and Mail.  Jamie Ellerton, who's served the party in various roles including as ""wagonmaster"" of the 2019 Scheer campaign, was one of the authors of that Globe article. He said that the party might find a change of course on climate more difficult than its shift on LGBTQ rights. ""The party at its core continues to be opposed to any new tax, and I think the carbon tax is going to continue to be very unpopular,"" he said. ""What you saw in Ontario was that this was an issue that Patrick Brown wanted to run on, and the party quickly one-eightied [turned around] in the leadership race that replaced him."" Patrick Brown's experience backing a revenue-neutral carbon tax was similar to that of federal Conservative MP Michael Chong, who placed fifth in the 2017 leadership race. Chong described his proposal for a carbon tax, offset by a large cut to income taxes, as a ""credible, market-based, conservative solution to reduce emissions."" Some small-c conservative economists agree with him. But to the party's rank-and-file, any proposal that included the word ""tax"" likely remains anathema, said Ellerton, who shares that view. ""Carbon taxes themselves are probably dead in the water, but electability is going to be a huge part of the conversation as to who the next party leader will be,"" he said. ""And it's clear that Canadians are looking for some kind of action and policy from their government."" Ellerton said the signs of a changing climate are becoming more visible to people, citing the frequent overspilling of the Don River in his own hometown of Toronto. ""This is an issue that Canadians are increasingly concerned about,"" he said. ""This is an issue that came up a lot for Conservatives at the door, that didn't pass muster to earn the confidence and a mandate from Canadians."" One dilemma the party faces is that the last two elections have seen a marked westernization of its caucus and its base. It now draws a disproportionate number of votes from Alberta and Saskatchewan, a region of the country that is an outlier in terms of attitudes to climate change — and where more livelihoods depend on the oil and gas industry than in other parts of Canada. During the federal election campaign, some reporters travelling with Andrew Scheer noticed a difference in tone when he spoke about energy and climate in the Prairie provinces, compared to other parts of Canada. In his public appearances in Ontario or Quebec he sometimes spoke about climate change as at least a problem to be managed. Over the course of two days visiting Edmonton and Regina, Scheer denounced the carbon tax and environmental activists, while never uttering the words ""environment"", ""climate"" or ""emissions"" except in response to media questions. In the 2020 leadership contest, however, so far the party's main candidates are from Ontario and points East, and the rules are designed to avoid giving weight to the Western vote.  At the start of the 2019 campaign, the Conservatives were still unsure of the threat they faced from Maxime Bernier's People's Party of Canada. In 2020, that question has been answered, and a new leader who feels less threatened from the right might feel safer moving towards the centre on climate policy. But such a move might lead to tensions in Alberta, where the provincial government has invested millions in a ""war room""-style Canadian Energy Centre — panned as a ""Twitter troll farm"" by the NDP opposition. (CBC News contacted the CEC for this story but the organization did not choose to comment.) ""Does the party want to win in 2019?"" Michael Chong asked in 2017. ""I think it does. If Conservatives don't have a credible policy on emissions, a credible policy on climate change, we cannot win the 2019 election."" No current CPC leadership candidate is proposing the party flip on carbon taxes, but like all politicians — like their counterparts in Australia — they remain at the mercy of events. The Conservative Party leadership vote on June 27 comes at the height of wildfire season. Gladu said it's getting increasingly difficult to deny the evidence of climate change, although she acknowledges that some in the party might still like to try. ""There are still those who may not appreciate the climate change situation that we have in the world,"" she said. ""But we should be seeing a change in opinion because we're seeing an increase of floods, of wildfires, a lot of extreme weather events. We know the permafrost is melting, we know the ocean's pH is rising. ""Certainly, as we see these undeniable facts come forward, people's views will evolve."" Meanwhile, there's movement at the provincial level — where some Conservatives who had boldly united to fight carbon taxes before the election muted their opposition afterwards. ""People voted for it, so we in New Brunswick have to find a way to make it work,"" said Premier Blaine Higgs as he somewhat sheepishly announced his resignation from ""The Resistance."" In Australia, while the federal government resists even setting a target for after 2030, all six states have already committed to net zero emissions by 2050. Fires and floods have a way of focusing minds —even changing them. In 2018, Malcolm Turnbull announced that his government would not, despite promises, put an emissions target into legislation. Who would have thought then that, 18 months later, the former PM would be calling for a ""Green New Deal""? ""The wicked self-destructive idiocy of climate denialism must stop …. Above all, we have to urgently stop burning coal and other fossil fuels.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-conservative-leadership-1.5438454,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/schweitzer-live-carbon-tax-newser-calgary-1.5411487 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-party-brand-survey-1.5411086 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-canada-2019-federal-election-1.5405360,N/A
336,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-24T14:19:36.134Z,China among WTO members backing Canada's alternate trade dispute scheme,"As the U.S. continues to paralyze the World Trade Organization's system for appealing trade disputes, 17 members of the trade organization announced Friday they will collaborate on an alternative initiated by Canada and the European Union to resolve complaints that emerge between them in the meantime. The announcement was made on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where ministers representing like-minded trading partners have been grappling with how to proceed as a group, unless and until Americans' concerns about the need for WTO reform can be resolved. ""We believe that a functioning dispute settlement system of the WTO is of the utmost importance for a rules-based trading system, and that an independent and impartial appeal stage must continue to be one of its essential features,"" said the joint statement released Friday by the group. The WTO continues to try to resolve disputes at its committees, and panels are still struck to review complaints and report back when member countries are alleged to have broken the rules. But as of December, the WTO's appellate body no longer has enough members to hear new appeals. For the last few years, the United States has refused to agree to the appointment of any new adjudicators until its concerns about the existing process are addressed. Without a consensus among its members on how to proceed, the trade organization is paralyzed. Canada's complaint and request for arbitration with the United States over softwood lumber duties is among the cases now stalled.  Canada and the European Union first announced an interim arrangement for resolving trade disputes with each other last July. Now fifteen more countries have climbed aboard. They are: Many of these countries met in Davos this week as part of the WTO's Cairns group: agricultural exporters who share the  common cause of wanting to liberalize trade barriers. But the most significant player in this new alternative scheme may be China. Many of the American concerns about the WTO centre on complaints about whether the terms of China's membership in the WTO are fair. But China has a reasonable track record of complying with the final decisions of the WTO's now-paralyzed dispute resolution process. Neither China nor the U.S. was part of the Ottawa group, a collection of WTO members that also held a working dinner in Davos hosted by Canada's trade minister, Mary Ng, to continue talks on WTO reform that began under Canada's leadership in 2018. The door was left open to China and anyone else joining the broader conversation around possible solutions at an appropriate time. Friday's agreement now sets these countries on a path to being able to resolve future disputes with China, a dominant player in international trade because of its massive market size, manufacturing capacity and corresponding economic influence. The statement characterizes this interim system as ""contingency measures"" to ""allow for appeals amongst ourselves"" when the findings of those panels are in dispute. It's based on Article 25 of the WTO's dispute settlement rules, which allow for multi-party interim arrangements. The statement says it will be in place ""only and until a reformed WTO Appellate Body becomes fully operational"" and any other WTO members are welcome to join these already signing on. More work remains to determine exactly how the new appeals process will work and what arbitrators will hear its cases. ""We have also taken proper note of the recent engagement of President Trump on WTO reform,"" the group's joint statement said. In his closing news conference before leaving Davos Wednesday, the American president told reporters that a delegation from the WTO's directorate was visiting Washington next week or the week after, and portrayed these talks as a form of negotiation toward reform. Because the organization isn't top-down, but only proceeds based on negotiations between its members, it's unclear any kind of deal could result, although it would allow the White House to communicate its concerns directly. ""We're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" Trump said, without giving any indication what exactly he had in mind.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wto-dispute-alternative-friday-1.5438805,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ministers-thursday-davos-1.5437266 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-urges-u-s-to-save-wto-from-chaos-1.5369843 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-seals-demise-wto-s-appeals-bench-1.5389276 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/u-s-china-modest-trade-pact-1.5427796,N/A
337,Anonymous,2020-01-23T20:55:40.511Z,"City, province vow to find solutions as company threatens to close 4 recycling centres","As a company threatens to close four recycling centres across the province, Quebec Environment Minister Benoit Charette says he wants to prevent recyclable material from going to landfill ""at all costs."" The company, TIRU, says it can't handle the volume of material it has to deal with.  In a release Thursday, Groupe RSC, a subsidiary of TIRU, said it had been steadily losing revenue since Oct. 2019 because of a global paper-recycling crisis, with the closing down of plants in China and India. ""The sale of paper constituted a major part of Groupe RSC's revenue. This drastic shift in the world market of recycled paper was already a considerable expense for Groupe RSC, despite the efforts from some municipalities and public aid,"" the group said.  It sent a letter to the City of Montreal saying it needs more money or will be forced to close. The city has bailed out the company before, and says it can't afford to pay again. Charette said his government wants to find solutions, but he would not commit to contributing money. ""It's a question about organization at this moment. We will have to talk about money later, but at this moment, we just want to make sure this site won't close its doors in the coming days,"" he said. The province, City of Montreal, TIRU and Recyc-Québec, the agency that advises the government on reducing waste, will discuss the situation at a meeting Friday. TIRU has facilities in Lachine and Saint-Michel, as well as centres in Châteauguay and Saguenay. It is threatening to close all four. The City of Saguenay also received a letter, and says it will be reviewing its options in the coming weeks.  The Montreal centres treat about 160,000 tonnes of material per year. ""What I'm hoping for is whatever comes out tomorrow out of this meeting with TIRU is that the government will be by our side to find a solution,"" Montreal Mayor Valérie Plante told reporters Thursday. She said the city will be looking into ways of making sure recyclable matter does not end up in landfills.  ""Let's not forget that our recycling centre supports other cities, not only Montreal, so it helps the entire metropolitan area,"" Plante said.  She called on the parties to use Friday's meeting as a way to develop a long-term vision. Recyc-Québec said it is also preoccupied by the company's demands, but would not comment specifically on the situation. In a statement, it said sorting centres are usually particularly full in January, after the holidays, and acknowledged some have had difficulties trying to get rid of their stock. Karel Ménard, executive director of the Quebec Coalition of Ecological Waste Management, said it's not unusual for a sorting centre to close for a few weeks once or twice a year. But he said what TIRU is doing amounts to an ultimatum to pressure Montreal into paying up. If Montreal does pay, it shouldn't hand over a blank cheque, he said — the conditions should be strict. Should the centres close, Ménard said he expects some of the materials from Montreal will be diverted to other sorting centres in Quebec. He said a big part of the problem is how recyclable materials are collected in Montreal — there should be different collection days for paper fibres versus plastic, glass and other materials. Ménard said what's worrisome about recyclable material going to a landfill is the possibility that people may stop recycling altogether.

338,Malone Mullin,2020-01-24T10:30:00.572Z,"Forced confinement, missed work: Paycheques among casualties of N.L. blizzard","When Lori Bennett left Corner Brook for a routine monthly trip to the Janeway last week, she didn't realize she'd be surrendering nearly a week's worth of income. Bennett ended up taking a forced six-day vacation due to Friday's storm and the ensuing state of emergency ordered by the City of St. John's, which legally prevented her from returning home — and from showing up to her shifts at  Greenwood Inn and Suites hotel, an eight-hour drive from the capital across impassable highways. ""I'm being told that because of the state of emergency, I'm not covered,"" Bennett told CBC on Tuesday. The shifts she missed were given away and she was told she wouldn't be paid for them, she said. As her household's sole earner, who also cares for her ill partner, money is already tight. ""The financial burden on me right now is very difficult,"" Bennett said. ""I figured my workplace would have a little bit of sympathy."" Bennett is one of a multitude of workers who've been stuck in hotels and homes on the Avalon, unable to get to work after the city shut down businesses and streets to clean up after last Friday's blizzard. Some workers contacted by CBC News who weren't being paid for missed shifts did not want to speak publicly, fearing repercussions from their employers. But a number of workplaces having stepped up, offering compensation to affected employees.  Coleman's Grocery was one of the first to announce its workers didn't have to worry about lighter paycheques. ""We recognize that being off work for several days puts financial hardship on everyone,"" said Greg Gill, Coleman's marketing manager. Gill said they told retail staff they'd be paid for the period of time the chain remained shuttered during the state of emergency given their ""integral"" role within the company. ""It was a no-brainer,"" he said. A number of other businesses were reported on social media to have offered payment to employees. CBC confirmed that Telus, Avalon Mall maintenance staff, and at least one metro-area Starbucks location are offering payment for missed work, despite having no legal obligation to do so. A number of other businesses are reportedly offering at least partial compensation. Bennett is frustrated she's not among those employees. ""I've dedicated my work to this place of employment for going on nine years,"" she said. ""And here I am, when I'm in need, just being told 'that's not remunerable.'"" A manager at Greenwood Inn and Suites, when asked about the hotel's policy for workers stranded during a state of emergency, said there was no state of emergency in Corner Brook, adding if any employees were in St. John's then it was on personal time. I'm having trouble keeping up with the employer names being sent my way!

""We've never encountered that situation before,"" Martin said. She added the legal department is working with the union to figure out ""the right thing to do,"" and set a precedent for future cases. Mary Shortall, president of the N.L. Federation of Labour, said there are no universal rules that govern how employers should compensate workers during a state of emergency — it's all left, she said, to happenstance. Overarching federal legislation should probably replace the current legal hodgepodge, Shortall said. This storm could be a catalyst for that conversation. ""Many of the employers are actually paying their workers during this state of emergency,"" Shortall said. ""But for those who don't, there needs to be some way that workers don't pay the price for that."" Shortall said she'd been fielding calls and emails all week from people worried about paying rent and affording food for their kids. ""What we've been hearing is … the fear that they just don't know who to turn to,"" she said. Some kind of emergency relief fund, with dispensation rules built into labour law, could provide reassurance, she said. On Thursday, Premier Dwight Ball said the province has been speaking with the federal government about programs, such as employment insurance, to see what can be done about compensating workers for missed time. And while small businesses have struggled financially in the days following the blizzard, Ball said there need to be discussions about programs that could be set up to help small business owners in the event of another state of emergency. However, Ball said the focus right now is on the province's low-income earners and people who have lost wages. ""With any review we need to make sure the employers and the employees are part of those amendments or reassess what the appropriate legislation will look like,"" he said. ""Right now it's very difficult to know what the magnitude of the requirement will be.""

339,Wendy Martin,2020-01-24T01:03:03.631Z,"Sydney obstetrician accused of sexual misconduct, incompetence","A Cape Breton obstetrician facing dismissal from his job at the regional hospital is being accused of sexual misconduct and professional incompetence by the province's physician regulator. Dr. Manivasan Moodley is scheduled for a formal Nova Scotia College of Physicians and Surgeons disciplinary hearing next month related to allegations surrounding contact he had with two patients in July 2017. The details of the allegations were posted on the college's website Thursday, just hours before a rally in support of Moodley was scheduled to be held in front of the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in Sydney. In the case of a patient referred to only as A.B., the college alleges Moodley commented inappropriately on the patient's appearance, performed a physical exam in an sexualized manner and asked questions of a sexual nature that were not relevant to the medical issues. For patient C.D., the college's allegations include that Moodley unnecessarily requested an internal exam, complimented her on the colour of her underwear and suggested seeing the patient at her home and noted he knew where she lived. The college said Moodley then violated physician-patient boundaries by seeking out the patient at her workplace. About 80 people attended the rally, which took place in front of the hospital Thursday evening. ""Bring Moodley back, bring Moodley back,"" ralliers chanted. Some people carried signs with messages that said ""Stop pushing doctors out,"" ""Stop abusing doctors,"" ""Respect foreign doctors,"" ""Re-instate Dr. Moodley now,"" and ""Name those who want Moodley out."" A petition was passed around and signed at the rally asking for Moodley's medical licence and sponsorship to be reinstated so he can continue practising medicine. Julia Farr, one of the protesters, said Moodley is her sister's doctor. She said she's concerned about what would happen to her sister's care if Moodley is no longer able to practise. ""We don't need to lose anymore doctors, we need to bring them back in,"" Farr said. Dr. Gus Grant, the college's registrar, said the allegations against Moodley are ""extraordinarily serious"" and follow a significant period of investigation. Moodley, who arrived in Cape Breton in March 2017 from South Africa, has been working as an obstetrician and gynecologist on what's known as a ""defined licence"" in Nova Scotia. As a foreign-trained doctor, he is required to work under a supervisor and a sponsor, and pass all Canadian licensing and certification exams before being granted a full licence. Moodley was informed last week his sponsorship is being withdrawn, and his last day of work is Friday. On Wednesday, before the allegations against him were made public, he said he was bewildered by the sudden withdrawal of his sponsorship, and has been given no reason for it. ""I think that doctors who are recruited here should be treated with respect and dignity,"" he said in an interview. He acknowledged he faced two complaints against him, but refused to discuss the details. On Thursday, he refused comment after more information was shared by the college. Since September 2017, Moodley has been working under restrictions imposed by the college that require him to have an attendant present at all times when treating patients and not to contact patients outside a clinical setting. A notice dated Sept. 22, 2017, does not outline why the restrictions were imposed. A letter informing patients of the restrictions is posted in Moodley's office, by order of the college. On Wednesday, Dr. Margaret Fraser, a family and emergency room doctor in Sydney and the head of the Cape Breton Medical Staff Association, said Moodley was being tossed aside like ""a piece of garbage."" She said Moodley is well-liked and highly respected, and acts as a mentor to the other members of the department, most of whom are early in their careers. On Thursday, she said in a Facebook post the rally of his supporters was still on. She said none of the allegations against Moodley had been proven and she suspected they had been ""leaked so people will stay away and they can quietly dispose of him."" But Grant said he worries the ""public attention"" garnered by the withdrawal of Moodley's sponsorship will put extra pressure on the two complainants. ""It's very difficult to summon the courage to bring a complaint against a physician for sexual misconduct,"" he said in an interview. ""And with the public attention being brought to Dr. Moodley's licensure, I think there's an added intimidation that will be felt, perhaps unintentionally, but there will be a certain degree of intimidation felt by these women who are coming forward, to help us regulate the profession."" The Nova Scotia Health Authority said it cannot comment on matters involving staff. Moodley was recruited by the former head of the obstetrics department at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, who has since retired. The disciplinary hearing, which will be open to the public, is scheduled for Feb. 24 at the college's office in Bedford. Additional dates have been set aside for Feb. 25-28, March 31 and April 1.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/dr-manivasan-moodley-professional-misconduct-allegations-sydney-1.5437709,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/forestry-northern-pulp-lahey-report-environment-ecology-1.5436402 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/province-changing-municipal-training-after-cbrm-in-camera-pay-discussions-1.5436718 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/lower-sackville-water-main-break-under-repair-1.5437027 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/eagle-watch-sheffield-mills-1.5437273 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-emergency-winter-shelter-burst-pipe-new-home-1.5436536,N/A
340,Erica Johnson,2019-05-27T19:20:39.139Z,Man with severe asthma says new police powers unfair for people unable to do breath test,"LATEST UPDATE | After this story was published, the RCMP sent another statement to Go Public, saying the force's national impaired driving policy is based on the Criminal Code. The available options to screen for impaired drivers are legislated by Parliament, it said, and police are not permitted to use alternatives. If a driver feels they had a lawful excuse for failing to comply with an impairment-screening test, ""they are encouraged to speak with legal counsel and consider bringing their concerns before the courts,"" the statement said. A B.C. man with severe breathing issues who recently had his car impounded and driver's licence suspended — twice — says new rules that allow police across the country to pull over any vehicle and force the driver to take a breath test are causing undue hardship for people who cannot blow into a breathalyzer. Jimmy Forster, 63, suffers from severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and takes daily medications to help him breathe. He lives in the small village of Chase — population 2,300 — in the B.C. Interior. In recent months, Chase RCMP have pulled Forster over twice and charged him with failing to provide a breath sample, after he was unable to blow hard enough into a breathalyzer device to register a reading. ""I'm just totally stressed right now,"" says Forster, who has an audible wheeze when he speaks and slightly slurred speech due to a childhood brain injury that also left him with a limp. He's on a disability pension, but is now on the hook for hundreds of dollars to get his car out of impound and his driver's licence reinstated, and says he has no idea how he will pay. There are almost 200,000 Canadians living with severe asthma and more than two million people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the Canadian Lung Association. Thousands of others have disabilities — such as Bell's palsy or facial paralysis caused by stroke — that may make them unable to perform a breath test, causing concern for human rights advocates. ""I think it's important that the police consider human rights principles,"" says Dylan Mazur, a lawyer with the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, ""including the duty to accommodate people with disabilities who can't provide a roadside test."" A spokesperson with the RCMP's national headquarters, Sgt. Marie Damian, did not respond when Go Public asked whether a specific policy exists to provide an alternative for people with disabilities who can't do a breathalyzer test. In an email she wrote, ""The determination as to whether the subject was 'able and unwilling' or 'legitimately unable' to provide a sample will be up to the investigating officer."" ""The actual volume and force of breath required for a sample is not significant."" Forster says his first police run-in occurred when he was returning from a trip to the post office on the afternoon of Feb. 14, and an RCMP officer pulled him over and accused him of not wearing a seatbelt. Forster says he was belted in. The officer decided to employ the alcohol screening powers that came into effect on Dec. 18, 2018, granting police the right to demand a breath sample from any driver they pull over. In the past, police couldn't require a roadside breath test unless they had a reasonable suspicion that a driver had consumed alcohol. In B.C., any driver who refuses — or, like Forster, fails to provide a breath sample — faces an immediate roadside prohibition (IRP), where their licence is suspended and their vehicle towed, even though there is no evidence of any alcohol consumption. In other provinces, drivers face a potential criminal charge for refusing to blow. Forster says he blew into the breathalyzer device, but couldn't get a reading. He says he explained that he has severe asthma, but the officer didn't believe him. ""He just said, 'Blow harder! Blow harder!'"" says Forster, who says he tried about a dozen times to breathe deeply into the device, and thought he was going to fall over because he was getting dizzy. The RCMP officer issued an IRP, despite a lack of any evidence that Forster was impaired. ""I just couldn't believe it,"" says Forster, whose doctor told Go Public his patient has no history of a drinking problem.   Forster appealed to an adjudicator, submitting his medical records. The adjudicator dismissed the case and Forster got his licence back and his car out of impound, without financial penalty. A few weeks later, on the morning of March 20, police pulled Forster over again, just after he'd gone for a haircut and filled up his car at a gas station. ""He [the officer] didn't ask me any questions,"" says Forster. ""He just brought the breathalyzer and I blew five to six times and had the same thing happen again."" This time, Forster says, he asked the officer if he could take a blood test instead. ""He totally ignored me,"" says Forster. ""Just in one ear, out the other."" Once again, police impounded Forster's car and suspended his licence for 90 days. When he appealed a second time, an adjudicator said he believed police notes that said Forster was ""putting on a show"" to make it look as though he was unable to provide a breath sample. The notes do not claim that Forster appeared to have been drinking, smelled of alcohol, or was driving poorly. ""I was so choked,"" says Forster, who faces about $1,400 in fees to get his car released from impound and his licence back next month. He has already spent $200 each time he appealed the IRPs. Forster lives with his cousin Sandy Johnston, who relies on him to drive her places since having a stroke 10 years ago. ""I'm totally dependent on Jimmy,"" she says. ""After his car got taken the second time, he was just in tears. And then I broke into tears, too. And we were crying together."" A leading researcher on lung disease says assessing whether or not someone's lung function is adequate to obtain a breathalyzer reading is not something that can be easily done in the field. ""The concern I have is that there likely are people that have lung function that's so low that they can't do the tests,"" says Dr. Christopher Carlsten, division head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia and director of the Occupational Lung Disease Clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. He says viral infections and other stressors, such as being pulled over by police, can affect the breathing capacity of someone with compromised lungs. Go Public has tracked down other cases in B.C. — as well as in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick — in which people with disabilities say they struggled to provide a breathalyzer test. One of the more prominent cases has prompted a charter challenge against mandatory alcohol screening. Norma McLeod, 76, of Victoria, was pulled over on Feb. 14, and says she was unable to provide a breath sample due to a chronic lung condition and an implant in the roof of her mouth that's a result of cancer. Police towed her car and suspended her licence. ""It's happening more frequently now that the federal government has introduced the provision which permits mandatory alcohol screening based on absolutely no suspicion of alcohol consumption,"" says criminal lawyer Jennifer Teryn, part of the legal team representing McLeod. ""If someone's unable to provide a sample upon demand, it's my position that the police should have to get engaged in some minor investigation to find out for themselves whether there's a legitimate reason for that or not,"" says Teryn. Mazur says he also expects police to ask people whether they have a disability preventing them from complying with a roadside breath test demand. ""I've heard this from people with disabilities who have mobility issues or who have speech issues — that they can be perceived as intoxicated,"" says Mazur. ""What the RCMP has to do is look at their policies, and look at whether there are provisions of reasonable accommodation based on disability."" Go Public asked Mike Farnworth, B.C.'s minister of public safety and solicitor general, about the difficulties some people with disabilities have  providing breath tests. In a statement, Farnworth wrote, ""I plan to raise these concerns with my federal counterparts. In addition, I've asked my staff to research whether there are any amendments that could be made to the immediate roadside prohibition appeal process in these situations, including options to reduce any financial barriers for requesting a review."" His ministry said that of 2,558 IRP reviews conducted last year, 491 were dismissed. The office could not determine how many of the cases were dismissed due to disability or medical issues. Jimmy Forster is due to get his driver's licence back on June 20, but says he's anxious police will keep pulling him over. ""I can't afford it, I'm on disability,"" says Forster.

342,Bob Weber,2020-01-24T15:15:00.301Z,Alberta landowners urge farmers to cut power to wells with unpaid debts,"A group of Alberta landowners is asking farmers and ranchers to fight back against unpaid debts and unreclaimed oil and gas wells by closing valves and cutting power to energy company sites. ""The landowners need to safely shut down those surface leases, whether it's safely turning off the power or safely shutting off the valve,"" Daryl Bennett of the Action Surface Rights Association said Thursday. The association represents about 200 landowners in southern Alberta. ""They need to let these companies know that they've defaulted on the leases and there are consequences."" Most of Alberta's roughly 400,000 wells are on private property. Provincial law forbids owners to deny access to energy companies and the industry is required to pay compensation. The deals are regulated by the Alberta Surface Rights Board. But the arrangement may be coming apart. Rural municipalities recently revealed energy companies owe a total of $173 million in unpaid property taxes and many landowners feel they're getting the same short end of the stick. Bennett said oil and gas operators are increasingly reneging on lease agreements that compensate landowners for the presence of wells or other facilities on their property. ""I get calls every day from landowners saying, 'Hey, I got a notice. They're cutting the compensation.' There's thousands of landowners in this situation."" The cuts often come from companies with producing wells. ""It seems like this (United Conservative) government is in industry's back pocket and they'll do whatever they need to do to ensure these companies are allowed to drill,"" Bennett said. ""There's a huge rural backlash coming and it does not appear that the government recognizes this."" The association says the Surface Rights Board has been cutting payments to landowners by as much as half. The landowners group lists problems that include slow action on complaints to poor regulation of well cleanup. It says industry has been exploiting backlogs at the board to ensure problems aren't dealt with for years. It says farmers are colliding with abandoned infrastructure. Wellheads are left unsafe and lease sites unweeded. Crops are reduced because food safety regulations prevent farming near contaminated sites. A government draft report, released to The Narwhal magazine under freedom-of-information legislation, looked at 18 well sites that had received reclamation certificates. Only one met all the guidelines. Industry has said low oil prices and falling profits in Alberta's conventional oilpatch mean companies have to cut costs to keep the lights on and employees on the payroll. Bennett isn't swayed. ""They should have had the foresight to plan. We've warned them for decades that this problem was going to happen."" He said the government should require a performance bond from companies before they're allowed to drill. He also suggests annual compensation has to be paid and wells have to be reclaimed in a timely manner. So, after a board meeting Thursday, the association asked landowners who are feeling short-changed to take direct action. ""Turn off the power and shut off the valves ... just like any landlord would change the locks for a tenant who does not pay."" It also urges landowners to object to any new drilling activity and to use new legal provisions to force industry to ensure all its equipment is free of weeds and disease. ""(Premier Jason Kenney) says that Alberta has the most socially and environmentally responsibly produced oil,"" said association member Ron Huvenaars in a release. ""The premier can't say that anymore.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-landowners-farmers-power-unpaid-debts-1.5438969,[],N/A

Those who are coming to his Water Street practice on Day 7 of a blizzard-caused state of emergency were ""biting at the bit, so to speak, to come in,"" McCarthy told CBC News on Thursday. ""People have been in pain, people with swollen faces."" ""We were able to triage some of the patients by checking the answering machine, phoning in prescriptions when we could."" McCarthy and other dental offices were given word at 5 p.m. Wednesday they'd be allowed to open, as one of several exemptions to the city's state of emergency as crews continue to clean up the snow from Friday's blizzard. ""A lot of dental treatment has to be treated very soon, within the first hours if you have a tooth taken out or wounds in the mouth,"" McCarthy said, ""[You need] to be treated before you end up getting an infection."" His biggest challenge was getting inside the building to open because sidewalks have yet to be plowed. And now that he's back to work, some patients scheduled for routine dental work have been cancelling. However, patients with swollen faces and broken teeth ripping into soft tissue were never so happy to see him. McCarthy commended the city for allowing dental offices to reopen. The Newfoundland and Labrador Dental Association had contacted the city prior to the exemption being made for dentists.

344,Reneltta Arluk,2019-12-28T15:45:52.275Z,Shared Lines: Why one Inuvialuk woman decided to get facial tattoos,"My great-grandmother, Alice Simon, had facial tattoos.  In the pictures we have of her, there are visible markings all up her cheeks but what always struck me was the thick black line that connected her bottom lip to her chin. So when I began to imagine that thick black line on my face, from lip to chin, I had more questions than answers as to why I wanted it. I'm not fully Inuk. My mother is Denesuline and Cree from the Fort Chipewyan region. My father was Inuvialuit but he was also Dene with Gwich'in roots. The woman who gave me this tattoo is a well known tattooer, Maya Sialuk Jacobsen of Greenland. She is an Inuk that studies the historical markings of Inuit women across the circumpolar North.  She said, ""I don't study land, I study patterns."" Her tattoo methods are traditional stick and poke or skin stitching ink with needle and thread. When I first contacted her, I sent an image of my great-grandmother, and Maya knew exactly where Alice Simon was from.  My great-grandmother spoke very little English; she was a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker. I did not get to grow up with her unfortunately. She died when I was just a young one, but when I was born, she came down to Fort Smith, N.W.T., from Inuvik to meet me. I was five months old.  She took care of me one night while my parents went to the movies. It was winter. In what was then an Inuvialuit practice, my great-grandmother took me outside, bare, and put me in the snow. I am not sure how long I was out there for. I am sure I cried. But even now I know her doing that to me was an act of love.  Through this winter custom, I was given the gift of resilience — a teaching that remains with me still.  She lived during a time when survival was the only way. She was a respected elder, cherished for her knowledge of preserving berries in the winter using techniques that are no longer practised.  Today Inuvialuktun is spoken by only a handful of Inuvialuit — mostly my great-grandmother's relatives, and likely because of her.  Alice was a matriarch. She gave the younger generations their Inuit names when they were born. Mine is Akpik.  It is the cloudberry that grows in the barren land — not too sweet but makes the best jam. Often Inuit are named after relatives who have passed or people in the community that have lived good lives. It's a way to instil positive traits in the young ones.  So when I learned my Inuk name was Akpik, I was confused. Why a berry?  I have a wonderful great aunt, Lillian Elias. Alice was her grandmother. Lillian is the matriarch now, and also a fluent Inuvialuktun speaker.  In one of our visits I asked her why great-grandmother Alice named me after a berry and not a relative. Auntie Lillian thought for a moment and said, ""maybe because they were her favourite."" It was clear to me getting tattooed would be a journey of reconnection, not only to my great-grandmother, but to the community of Inuit women wearing their ancestors' lines in celebration of who we are. I asked myself, why get this now? Easy, because it is time.  So much of our cultural teachings have been lost or taken away by colonialism. We know this, but most importantly we still feel this. In recent years there has been a resurgence of facial tattoos among Inuit women across the circumpolar north.  I received my thick black line so recently that in reflection of writing this, I am still unsure of the teachings it will offer me. I am fine with it, though.  This was not done to resolve any doubts or insecurities.  It was done to keep asking myself the questions about who I am at a time when we are needing to know who we are. We need to reconnect to our ancestral truths and I am grateful that my great-grandmother had the courage to wear hers at a time where many had started being denied theirs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-face-tattoo-reneltta-arluk-1.5397755,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/inuit-tattoos-holly-nordlum-1.4915457 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/jordan-konek-grandmother-arviat-photo-1.5118410,N/A

346,Ryan Cooke,2020-01-24T13:01:23.050Z,St. John's has received a full Shaquille O'Neal of snow since Christmas Eve,"As the ongoing state of emergency in St. John's winds down, the city can now boast that it is the snowiest capital city in Atlantic Canada — by a long shot. According to Environment Canada, St. John's has seen 256 centimetres since Oct. 1. The vast majority of that accumulation happened between Christmas Eve and Jan. 19. In that 27-day timeframe, the city saw 221 cm in several significant snowfalls, including an unforgiving blizzard last Friday that has left the city cleaning up ever since, with the help of the Canadian Armed Forces. The average snowfall from the start of October to the end of January is 176 cm — the average height of a North American man — which is about on track if you subtract the major blizzard. ""It's really just one storm that's throwing everything off,"" said Justin Boudreau, a meteorologist with Environment Canada's weather office in Gander. That one storm brought St. John's from snowfalls equalling the average height of a man to beyond the average height of a basketball superstar. It might be hard to visualize these snowfall amounts. Despite the metric system being widely used by our country, the American style of feet and inches is still ingrained in many people's minds. Since Christmas Eve, St. John's has recorded 7'3"" of snow. By comparison, former Los Angeles Lakers centre Shaquille O'Neal is 7'1"" and former St. John's Edge player Satnam Singh is 7'2"". The St. John's snowfall is just one inch short of the late actor and wrestler Andre the Giant. As for the total since the beginning of October, 256 cm stacks up to be about 8'3"", which nearly the exact height of Sultan Kosen, the Kurdish man who holds the current title of the world's tallest person. That's just the snowfall, too. Heavy drifting, much of it caused by hours of hurricane-force winds that continued well into Saturday morning, has left piles of snow that in some cases are higher than houses.  Every day this week, St. John's Mayor Danny Breen has reminded residents of the monumental task the city faces to bring streets to a point where it is safe to drive and walk. It's true — St. John's has a total of 1,400 kilometres of roads running throughout the city. That is equivalent to the driving distance from St. John's to Port aux Basques and back to Grand Falls-Windsor. As the crow flies, it's the same distance from St. John's to Quebec City. Breen told CBC News Friday morning that despite the state of emergency coming to an end on Saturday morning, people should still remain off the road unless they absolutely need to go out. ""There's still a tremendous amount of work to go,"" he said. Businesses are preparing to open after eight days of mandatory shutdown. Employees were allowed to return to their places of work on Friday to prepare for opening on Saturday morning. In true St. John's fashion, people are already talking about the next storm. On Thursday, Premier Dwight Ball stirred the public when he warned about 20 cm of snow coming on Monday, but Boudreau said right now that's not in the forecast. St. John's could see a period of snow on Monday, but Boudreau said it will likely turn to rain. If amounts stay between five and 10 millimetres, it will knock down the snow banks and clean up some of the mess before freezing again. However, Boudreau warned the total rainfall could be between 10 and 15 millimetres, which could result in flooding, especially since many storm drains are covered in snow. Breen said the city is keeping an eye on the forecast, and is worried about the weather. He said staff will analyze their options each day. ""There's going to be a lot of discussion, even as we move towards Monday, about what is going to happen,"" he said.

347,John Last,2020-01-24T14:45:12.215Z,N.W.T. government reps take 4 hours of questions at hearings on Sahtu's caribou herds,"The second day of hearings on how to manage the hunting of caribou in the N.W.T.'s Sahtu region saw an exhaustive four hour questions and answer session with representatives from the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The department is responsible for enforcing quotas on the caribou harvest determined by regional management boards. It's just one participant in the hearings, hosted by Colville Lake and organized by the Sahtu Renewable Resources Board. Heather Sayine-Crawford, the manager of wildlife research and monitoring for Environment and Natural Resources, and Brett Elkin, director of wildlife, answered questions from Indigenous leadership for four hours following a short presentation. Two wildlife biologists were also present. Sayine-Crawford and Elkin frequently consulted a lawyer in answering questions on local enforcement, harvest regulations, and the protected status of many caribou herds. Caribou is a staple food source in the region, but several herds have seen a steep decline in size. A number are considered to be species at risk, though some delegates questioned whether the herds can be treated as distinct The group took more than two minutes to confer before responding to the first question. David Codzi, president of the Ayoni Keh Land Corporation, asked why Deline's local harvest management plan, approved in a similar hearing in 2016, has still not been recognized in law. ""We're continuing to consider this issue,"" Sayine-Crawford eventually answered, echoing language in written submissions sent weeks earlier. Colville Lake Chief Wilbert Kochon followed, contesting the department's low count of caribou, which allows it to implement a limit on the caribou harvests under terms set out in the Sahtu land claim. ""A lot of people are going to be hungry now, because we can't give them any meat,"" he said. ""That kind of hurts me."" ""It's our livelihood. For you it's just a job. It's a big difference."" That elicited a more personal reply from Sayine-Crawford. ""The importance of caribou to people in the N.W.T., to people in the Sahtu, is not lost on me,"" she said. Sayine-Crawford, herself Dene, said she was not ""as immersed"" in her culture as others who spoke, and was still ""re-learning."" But she stood by the department's assessments of the herds. ""I know we get questions sometimes. But I stand by them,"" she said. ""I couldn't stand here and tell you all this without standing behind those numbers."" Toward the end, the panel's voices were breaking as they explained the personal significance of their work. ""It's difficult to hear someone say it's just a job,"" said wildlife biologist Jan Adamczewski, recalling Kochon's comment. ""When we get [caribou survey] numbers back and they're not good ... you feel it here,"" he said, gesturing to his heart. The Environment Department's caribou tags have been rejected once before, at a similar meeting in 2016. Some communities have sent back the tags issued to them ever since. That resulted in some confusion at the hearing over whether untagged hunting is illegal in the Sahtu. Local officers said few Indigenous hunters use the metal tags issued by the department anymore. At the hearing, the government panel acknowledged an interim agreement means the permission of the local band is generally enough.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearing-environment-department-1.5437640,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/caribou-hearings-colville-setup-1.5432768 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/sahtu-caribou-hearings-1.5435406,N/A
348,David Friend,2020-01-21T14:15:00.624Z,Nine times lucky? Alberta's Northern Cree takes another shot at Grammy gold,"Even the biggest pop stars might want to clear the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday when Northern Cree arrive dressed to impress. It's the ninth time Alberta's Indigenous singing group is nominated at music industry's biggest night, and co-founder Steve Wood says he's planning a few surprises. Among them, expect members of the 17-person act to sport traditional Cree designs that could easily overshadow the edgy threads worn by Shawn Mendes and Lil Nas X. ""Even if you're famous, you don't want to be next to us on the red carpet,"" Wood says with a chuckle on the phone from Maskwacis, Alta. ""Taking nothing away from any of the artists, what I'm saying is that people are always looking for something they haven't seen before."" Since the group's first nomination in 2001, the 58-year-old leader of Northern Cree has become somewhat of an expert in grabbing attention on the red carpet. A couple years ago, the act wowed onlookers when they pulled up wearing vibrant beaded vests, a sharp break from the steady flow of black tuxedos and designer looks on the carpet. Northern Cree didn't win the Grammy that year, but they had everyone talking. This year, they're nominated in the best regional roots category with their 40th album, When It's Cold - Cree Round Dance Songs, a collection of tracks that acknowledge the good times (The Hippity Hoppity) and the hardships (To All MMIW) a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women). Their Grammy category is stacked with other favourite contenders, including six-time Hawaiian nominee Amy Hanaiali'i and Rebirth Brass Band, a past winner from New Orleans. Northern Cree carries a longer history with the Recording Academy than the rest of them, but the singing group is running zero for eight on Grammy wins. While leaving empty-handed for so many years would've left many artists feeling slighted, Wood insists his fellow members are nothing less than auspicious winners even without a golden statuette to their name. ""If you look at the positives, it's giving us an opportunity to get recognition for our music,"" he explains. ""We're representing First Nations people across North America, but we are also representing the Canadian public. That's why we're going to do the best that we can, always."" Wood created Northern Cree with his brothers Randy and Earl in 1982. The group originates from the Saddle Lake Cree Nation in northern Alberta, but includes members from the Treaty 6 area, including the Frog Lake Cree Nation, Onion Lake Cree Nation, Samson Cree Nation, Louis Bull Cree Nation and the Poundmaker Cree Nation. They've performed on global stages, which included an opening spot for the Tragically Hip during a Canada Day concert at London's Trafalgar Square. Most of the group's members juggle career jobs outside of music, several of them school teachers. Wood is an education administrator at an Alberta junior and senior high school on top of balancing the group's schedule. That's one of the reasons the Grammy Awards offers Northern Cree a platform they can't find anywhere else. Not only are international audiences watching the big event, but the auditorium is packed with fellow musicians, which can lead to new opportunities. Several years ago, rapper M.I.A. and singer Santigold picked a Northern Cree sample for their own original song, while more recently Sacha Baron Cohen's comedy docuseries Who is America? used a pounding electronic track by producer DJ Shub, featuring Northern Cree, as its title music. And when Northern Cree was nominated in 2017, the Grammy organizers asked the group to play as part of the pre-telecast awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The performance shook the room, even before Mexican singer Carla Morrison joined them on stage. Wood says it's those pure Grammy moments that mean the most. ""I like to get the music out in its original form,"" he says. ""When we hit those mainstream stages, the audience is in a little bit of awe until they can feel it. But when they feel it, it turns into a rock concert.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/maskwacis-northern-cree-band-grammy-awards-1.5434335,[],N/A
349,Ian Froese,2020-01-24T09:00:00.048Z,"Military faced 'some confusion' during hectic Manitoba manhunt, report says","Military personnel involved in last summer's manhunt for two murder suspects in northern Manitoba were sent in without either a top commander directing them from headquarters, or an expert on how to best use the plane deployed to help with the search. Those were among the key findings in a report, prepared by the military, after Kam McLeod, 19, and Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, were found dead after a weeks-long search led by the RCMP.  The report — a routine review of the mission, obtained through an access to information request by CBC News — said the late July deployment was successful, but flagged several communication problems.  There was also ""some confusion"" over who could direct the search planes, because there had been no formal transfer of command, the report said.  And because the air task force was initially without a commander, the RCMP dealt with several military contacts instead of one, it said.  The report does not say when the task force got a commander, and does not comment on whether the problems affected the mission, which it deemed a success.  The air force personnel landed in Gillam, Man., on July 27 — four days after police said McLeod and Schmegelsky were suspects in the killings of three people in B.C. They brought a CP-140 Aurora aircraft with infrared camera and imaging radar surveillance systems, a CC-130H Hercules with trained search and rescue spotters, and various crew members. But without an Aurora expert at the task force headquarters, there were ""some misunderstandings on how to best employ"" that plane, the report said. To a certain degree, personnel delays were unavoidable, according to James McKay, a political science professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. That's because officials were forced to quickly gather aircraft and crews, building a team from Manitoba, B.C. and Quebec.  ""They're trying to build this on the fly,"" McKay said.  Another national security expert says the transfer of command was likely missed because of the mission's urgency and demonstrates the rush in bringing the military on board.  ""I think this mission was building the plane while flying it,"" said Christian Leuprecht, a political studies professor at Royal Military College of Canada and Queen's University.  Leuprecht says the communication problems were minor, though they did complicate a serious public safety effort in unfamiliar territory. He said such reports help the military improve. ""I think this is why the military does this after every mission, and why every government department should do this,"" he said. The four-page report commended the military for completing its task quickly in collaboration with the RCMP. Both the Hercules and Aurora air crews ""accomplished their missions, providing surveillance on specified geographical features, and investigated numerous objects of interest, in a safe, agile, and effective manner,"" the report concluded. The aircraft scoured key points in northern Manitoba, including Gillam, Sundance, York Landing and the Nelson River, farther north to Churchill and east to James Bay. The report says the Hercules was searching for nearly 24 hours, while the Aurora was in the air for more than 17 hours — which McKay says is a significant time investment. Leuprecht wonders, though, whether military help should have been requested during the tense, early days of the search for the suspects, who were considered armed and dangerous. Because the planes arrived within a day of the initial request, Leuprecht said he believes the military was waiting for the call.  Manitoba RCMP declined to comment on the report, but Assistant Commander Jane MacLatchy told CBC earlier this week she thought the police and military were good teammates.  Such reports guide the military going forward, the Department of National Defence said in a statement. ""There was great collaboration between our two organizations and we were able to provide the RCMP with the support requested of us in a timely and efficient manner,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manhunt-manitoba-military-report-confusion-1.5435045,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/northern-bc-killings-manitoba-1.5224278 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/northern-bc-murders-ito-1.5401732 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-rcmp-manhunt-cost-800000-1.5436341,N/A
350,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-10-21T19:56:05.924Z,"'If there's a fire, I'm dead': Quadruple amputee battles condo board for access to her own building","Verna Marzo says she'll never forget the embarrassment of being stuck outside her Calgary condo building — in the cold for almost two hours, waiting for someone to let her in — because as a quadruple amputee she can't open the doors on her own, and her condo board has refused to install automatic doors she can use. ""Someone helped me [get] out, but when I wanted to go back in, there was no one to open the door,"" said Marzo, 46.  ""It was cold. I called my sister but my sister was at work … so I waited until my caregiver arrived."" She says none of the other doors in the building is an option. ""That means I get stuck behind the doors. If there's an emergency … if there's a fire, I'm dead, there's no way I can get outside."" According to an advocate for people with disabilities, situations like Marzo's are ""all too common,"" because weak building codes and a lack of provincial accessibility laws are causing a ""chronic and pervasive shortage"" of accessible housing. ""Imagine that you're in a building where you paid good money to live … and you can't get in or out without having someone there,"" said David Lepofsky, chair of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance. ""Imagine you go to sleep at night knowing — God forbid — if there's a fire, you can't let yourself out. No one would want to live that way and people with disabilities shouldn't have to live that way."" Two years ago, after having emergency abdominal surgery, Marzo contracted sepsis — a reaction to a severe blood infection that leads to organs shutting down. Doctors amputated both legs and arms to save her life. Earlier this year, she started shopping for a condo that would allow her to get around with her wheelchair or prosthetics. She says she knew the place she bought wasn't perfect, but it was one of the few she could afford. She hoped to deal with issues as they came up, but never expected to be fighting for a door.  In May, a few months after she was locked outside in the cold, she asked the building manager if automatic doors could be installed. She was told the condo board decided not at this time. Marzo's social worker tried again, contacting the board on her behalf. She was told the board already had a plan for new doors but there would be no automatic push-button system due to security concerns of the doors being open too long. That explanation is ""a total red herring,"" according to Lepofsky. ""You could design doors with optical sensors to protect against that. But even a manual door, with a lock, there's no guarantee that requires it to be held open only long enough for the person with the key to get through."" Meanwhile, Marzo remains homebound and frustrated. ""I don't want to only benefit me. I want people who have lesser mobility to benefit as well. Because it's not easy to just be staying at home and be depressed,"" she said. The property management company declined to answer Go Public's questions, claiming it was a legal matter and referring us to the condo board. Go Public made repeated requests to board members for comment; all went unanswered. Automatic doors would cost between $2,500 to $7,500, depending on the design, according to Sean Crump from Universal Access, a Calgary company that provides advice to businesses on how to make buildings more accessible. Crump says there is public funding available to qualified candidates to help pay for building modifications, though it's not clear if Marzo's building qualifies.  ""There are a few resources. The federal government has an Enabling Access Fund that allows funds to be put into accessible design for spaces and buildings — and it's done a lot of good.""  More than three million people over the age of 15 have at least one physical disability according to the most recent Statistics Canada numbers from 2017. On July 11, the Accessible Canada Act came into force. Lepofsky says it's a well intentioned effort at mandating barrier-free access, but it, too, falls short by covering only sectors within Ottawa's jurisdiction like banking, telecommunications and the federal government. He says that leaves a mish-mash of accessibility laws — or none at all — at the provincial level. Ontario, Manitoba and Nova Scotia are the only provinces with that kind of legislation. ""We need the seven provinces in Canada that don't have a provincial accessibility law to enact one — to get with the program,"" Lepofsky said. But even in those provinces, Marzo would have little or no recourse. Manitoba and Nova Scotia's legislation don't address the responsibilities of condo boards. Ontario's does, but since it was implemented in 2005, it's done little to help people with disabilities, according to a review released in January by former lieutenant governor David Onley. ""We are almost 14 years later,"" Onley, who was Canada's first lieutenant governor with a physical disability, wrote, ""and the promised accessible Ontario is nowhere in sight."" ""For most disabled persons, Ontario is not a place of opportunity but one of countless, dispiriting, soul-crushing barriers."" Changing the building codes could also help, according to Lepofsky. But, though national and provincial codes cover new buildings and major renovations, older buildings like Marzo's are under no obligation to renovate. All of this, Lepofsky says, leaves people with disabilities to deal with problems ""one battle at a time"" through human rights complaints. The national and provincial human rights codes say buildings used by the public need to be accessible.  Marzo says everywhere she turned no one could — or would — help. She says her call to the Alberta Human Rights Commission wasn't returned and the City of Calgary told her there is nothing it can do. ""They just keep [telling me] call this person or this person and eventually someone from City of Calgary called me and said they cannot force the condo board to put the door in because it's not the law."" Go Public took Marzo's situation to provincial and federal lawmakers. Watch: Verna Marzo says she's determined not to let any barriers stand in her way Jennifer Dagsvik, spokesperson for Alberta's Ministry of Community and Social Service, says the province is ""monitoring"" the new federal and existing provincial laws.  She says while Alberta lacks an accessibility law, people with disabilities can seek help under the Alberta Human Rights Act and the Premier's Council on the Status of Persons with Disabilities. Ottawa's most recent minister of public services and procurement and accessibility didn't answer Go Public's questions directly. Instead Carla Qualtrough sent a general statement, referring to the Accessible Canada Act and the accessibility review board — the Canadian Accessibility Standards Development Organization (CASDO) — it created.  ""While CASDO is still in its early stages of development, it has been made evident by Canadians and members of the disability community that standards in new and existing buildings is a priority,"" Qualtrough said.  Marzo says she won't give up, saying it's ""hideous"" she's had to fight this hard to be able to enter and exit the building she lives in.  She's planning to talk to a lawyer for advice on what to do next. ""They will get old too,"" she says, referring to members of her condo board. ""And they will lose their strength. And they will thank me for that door if they will do it now.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/go-public-disabled-automatic-door-1.5313633,[],N/A

Robinson was in Prince George to make two housing announcements that will benefit Indigenous people in the area. The province has also partnered with the Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George to purchase a six-unit apartment complex. The society will rent the units to Indigenous people at prices below market value. According to Robinson, the two one-bedroom units will rent at about $660 a month and the two four-bedroom units will rent for around $760.   The federal and provincial governments are providing joint funding of approximately $840,000 to finance the purchase and renovation of the building, located at 2541 Oak St. The society has assumed ownership and operations of the residence.

Det'on Cho Nahanni Construction Corporation, owned by the Yellowknives Dene First Nation, will run operations on the Nechalacho rare earth mineral project between the Dene communities of Dettah and Lutselk'e. It was announced at the Annual Mineral Exploration Roundup mining conference this week in Vancouver. Yellowknives Dene Chief Ernest Betsina said the signing marks a transition from the first nation being ""passive witnesses to major projects to being key participants."" Cheetah Resources' Nechalacho project is moving toward small-scale production of rare earths like neodymium-praseodymium, which can be used in wind turbines.  Mining is slated to begin this year at the project, subject to approval at the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board.  Det'on Cho competed for the project, which will create roughly 20 and 25 jobs with six months of employment each year for three years, according to president and CEO Paul Gruner.  Asked how many jobs will directly benefit members of the first nation, Gruner said it will be a ""best effort"" and that the company is already seeking out potential candidates. At the low end, 50 per cent of hires will be Indigenous, but it's more likely to be 75 per cent, said Gruner. The quarry operation needs drill blasters and equipment operators for a crusher. A plant separates waste from rare earths, which are then loaded on to a barge for processing in southern Canada. The project will also have a shoulder season for winter road construction, providing access to the site.  Gruner said Det'on Cho's involvement is an opportunity to increase worker capacity to get into larger scale opportunities in the future. Yellowknives Dene chiefs signed a letter to the Mackenzie Valley Land and Water Board supporting the project. Cheetah Resources adviser David Connelly said in an email that the agreement could be ""the first time in the N.W.T. and Canada that all mining operations will be contracted to an Indigenous firm, enabling them to be a miner on their own lands."" A recent agreement between Canada and the U.S. to reduce their dependence on Chinese-sourced rare earths, factored into Cheetah's investments in the Northwest Territories, said Connelly.  Jason Snaggs, the Chief Executive Officer for the Yellowknives Dene, said there is a desire to achieve similar agreements with other development operations. If there is high enough mineral potential at Nechalacho, the first nation is poised to have an economic role in an expanded mine. The small-scale projects are about finding customers for a rare earth project. Once the material is mined and processed, it would likely be sold to companies like Australia-based Lynas or to Europe and Japan, said Geoff Atkins, managing director of Cheetah Resources Corp. The material could be used in electric vehicles and high strength magnets, said Atkins.  The company will start moving equipment on an ice road in February. The project awaits regulatory approval, but the company is confident enough to start moving equipment, said Atkins. N.W.T. industry minister Katrina Nokleby applauded the agreement. ""I'm really glad to see that we're moving away from Indigenous involvement being cutting a cheque for the use of someone's name to actual ownership and partnership,"" said Nokleby. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/ykdfn-nechalacho-agreement-1.5437975,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/rare-earth-agreement-1.5417128 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/thor-lake-investment-1.5023912,N/A
353,Erica Johnson,2019-11-18T16:14:38.413Z,"Bank wires fraudsters over $800K of retiree's savings, despite red flags","A Calgary retiree says he was ""sick to his stomach"" after learning his bank wired more than $800,000 of his savings to fraudsters despite security red flags. Rod McLeod, 75, was a longtime customer with Cidel Bank — one of dozens of private banks in Canada that handle wealth management for people with high incomes or sizeable assets.  ""It has turned my life upside down,"" says McLeod, a retired lawyer. ""I expected them to protect me."" McLeod is suing, alleging ""negligence, breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"" by Cidel in a statement of claim filed last week. It's one more case of what's become a multibillion-dollar problem in Canada and the U.S., according to authorities.  Wire fraud is a ""huge problem"" and ""so rampant,"" investigator and former FBI agent Don Vilfer told Go Public, that better laws are needed in Canada and the U.S. to protect bank customers.  ""Legislation in both Canada and the U.S. is behind in terms of requiring financial institutions to take certain steps … [to prevent] this kind of thing,"" Vilfer said.  In September 2018, McLeod was excited to make an offer on a condo in Rancho Mirage, Calif. — just north of Palm Desert. He had Cidel wire a deposit to a California bank account and waited for instructions on the outstanding balance of $619,000 US ($820,000 Cdn). A few weeks later, an email supposedly from the realtor handling the sale, said the balance should go to a different bank — Chase Bank in Denver, Colo. Even though his escrow agent had cautioned him, two months earlier, against any sudden changes, McLeod says the warning was forgotten in the push to seal the deal.  The seller, he'd been told, was a billionaire. ""So it made sense that he banked in several places."" McLeod sent the new instructions to his contact at Cidel. But the email wasn't from his realtor, Brady Sandahl. It was from a new email address, created by fraudsters who had transposed the last two letters of Sandahl's name so that, at first glance, it appeared legit. When that email arrived at Cidel, it appears the bank's mail server flagged it, tacking ""SUSPICIOUS MESSAGE"" onto the subject line.  Despite that warning, a bank employee emailed the fraudster, asking for the address of the bank account owner — adding a senior Cidel employee and McLeod to the email thread. McLeod says his excitement about the condo got the better of him. He didn't notice the email had been flagged, and, he says, had no prior experience wiring money to another country. ""I don't do this every day. This is something that's totally new to me,"" he said.  ""My wife said, 'You wanted it too much, you ignored the red flags.'""  McLeod and his wife authorized the wire transfer. The money went to Denver, where fraudsters quickly transferred most of it to the Bank of China in Hong Kong. Days later, when McLeod made inquiries about next steps, it became apparent he was the victim of fraud. ""I thought, this can't be happening,"" he says. ""It just can't be happening."" Chase Bank was able to keep $26,000 US from being transferred, and that money was returned to McLeod. McLeod hired Vilfer to investigate. Since leaving the FBI over a decade ago, Vilfer has testified in over 100 cases, often providing expert testimony on digital forensics in cases involving wire fraud. ""It's very profitable for the fraudsters when they can pull it off,"" he says. ""We had one client that lost $14 million — and they're [fraudsters] doing this all day long."" In his report to McLeod, Vilfer says the realtor's email account may have been compromised and recommended further analysis of the realtor's devices and accounts.  ""With email hijacking scams of this type, in my experience, it is the realtor or mortgage broker who is targeted,"" he wrote. Sandahl did not respond to calls for comment from Go Public.  The case is an example of what investigators call ""business email compromise"" — a type of wire fraud that targets businesses and their customers. Typically, the fraudster hacks into a business's email account and impersonates the sender, instructing the customer to redirect the money.  Go Public recently investigated this type of scam, and spoke to a Toronto-area businessman who lost almost $3,000.  Compromised business emails — particularly in the real estate sector — led to an estimated loss of $12 billion US over the past five years, according to the FBI. Such scams were reported in 150 countries, and all 50 U.S. states. Vilfer says McLeod's bank — Cidel — should have stopped the scam in its tracks. ""You have the flag on the email that it's a suspicious message,"" says Vilfer. ""And with this kind of fraud that's so prevalent … that should certainly cause some sort of alarm, to take an extra look at this and see why is this being flagged?"" ""Good technology ... apparently was ignored,"" he said.  In the statement of claim against Cidel, McLeod's lawyer, Brett Code, alleges the bank's actions ""represent a marked departure from the required standard of care, and constitute gross negligence."" It seeks full compensation for McLeod's loss.  None of the allegations has been proven in court and Cidel has not yet responded to the statement of claim.  In one of two emails to McLeod, Cidel CEO Craig Rimer wrote: ""We are very sorry that you've had to go through this terrible experience and for the financial loss you endured."" However, he wrote, Cidel has no obligation to reimburse McLeod.  In a second, one-line email, Rimer blamed McLeod for the wire fraud, writing, ""The introduction to the email address came from you and you authorized the transaction after much back and forth between them [fraudsters] and you."" Rimer declined to be interviewed but sent Go Public a statement saying, ""We acted in accordance with the express written and signed wire instructions that were delivered to us by our client.""  He would not outline what policies exist at the bank when it comes to conducting wire transfers, but wrote that Cidel acted in full compliance with all industry standards and that the bank will continue to assist its client in recovering the funds from ""an unscrupulous third party."" There is no legislation in Canada or the U.S. that requires a financial institution to confirm the identity of a bank account holder who is receiving a wire transfer to prevent fraud and protect customers.   It's considered a best practice for banks to confirm they are sending a client's money to an appropriate destination, but Vilfer — the former FBI agent — thinks that needs to become law.  ""We're just relying on the banks doing the right thing,"" he says. ""It would be a good idea for both the United States and Canada to stiffen up the statutory requirements; require policies for protecting against this sort of fraud."" The largest insurer of U.S. banks, ABA Insurance Services, said recently it's ""critical"" that banks start making phone calls to authenticate wire transfers, among other procedures.  McLeod knows his lawsuit against Cidel could drag on for years. ""If I don't win this, I'm throwing good money after bad,"" he says. ""And they can outlast me. I'm 75 years old."" He's also moved his remaining assets to another management company.

Last year, Canada Goose launched project Atigi with 14 original parkas. The parkas from Atigi 2.0 were shown publicly for the first time at a media launch in New York Thursday.  ""It's unbelievable,"" said Stephanie Pitseolak, one of the designers who lives in Iqaluit. ""I can't believe my parka is there right now.""  New York isn't the only international city her parka will be on display; next week it will be making its way to France where the collection will be on display at the Canada Goose store in Paris. Pitseolak said the experience was exhausting. Canada Goose sends the seamstresses a box of materials to use for their designs. Things like fur, hollow fill insulation, zippers and Canada Goose commanders and patches with the logo. They had a month to make five identical parkas each in a different size.  Even Pitseolak was struggling. She said she couldn't give up and felt like her late grandmother was guiding her while she sewed.  ""I wanted people to know it's possible, even if you're very busy, even if you have kids, even if you're working,"" said Pitseolak.  ""I'm glad I did it and I'm happy for myself.""  The parkas will be on sale at the Canada Goose website for $2,500 each. The proceeds will go to Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK), a national organization that advocates for the rights and interests of Inuit in Canada.   Canada Goose donated nearly $80,000 to ITK from the sales of last year's Atigi parkas, according to ITK. Inuit land claims organizations for the four Inuit regions — Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, Makivik Corporation, and Nunatsiavut Government each received $20,000.   ""We have big plans and a big vision from project Atigi,"" said Gavin Thompson, vice-president of corporate citizenship for Canada Goose. ""We are literally just getting started.""  Thompson said they want to grow the project but wouldn't reveal details of what that looks like.  ""We are just so proud of this collection,"" said Thompson.

Candice Jahnke was in the Rochdale Boulevard restaurant last Thursday when she caught video of a mouse falling from the ceiling of the business onto another woman. ""I want to clarify that we are clean and we have all the protection in place, but it's an incident, an accident,"" Rahman told CBC.  ""We are very proud of our product and service and whatever incident happened, it's just bad luck for us.""  Rahman said he had pest control inspect his restaurant and that the investigation into the incident is ongoing. As of Wednesday, there are no signs of mice or any other rodents or insects in the restaurant and he was given a certificate proving that, he said. Rahman said he doesn't know how the rodent got into his store. He checked the restaurant's CCTV footage and saw Jahnkhe's video of the mouse as it fell. Jahnke said it was her children who first noticed the animal on the ceiling, and they watched it drop into the hood of a woman's jacket and it was all on video.  ""As soon as I stopped recording, I went to the lady right away, she went to sit down and I said, 'I don't mean to alarm you, but you have a mouse crawling on you,'"" Jahnke recalled. Jahnke said initially the woman was stunned but she slowly took off her jacket and that's when the mouse jumped out of the fabric and scurried toward some nearby garbage cans. Jahnke said restaurant employees appeared to quickly dispatch the rodent. Jahnke shared the video to Facebook where it generated roughly 1,200 shares. She then removed it from public view because she tired of the constant notifications on her phone. A prepared statement from Mary Brown's corporate offices confirmed the store had been checked by pest control professionals and that the restaurant was closed on Wednesday for an inspection and a ""deep clean."" ""We thank all of our Regina customers for their patience as we ensure that our food safety standards are not compromised and necessary steps are taken to ensure this is an isolated incident,"" the statement said. ""We do everything to make sure [the restaurant] is spotless,"" Rahman said. He said there are currently about 25 traps placed around the store in the event another mouse gets inside. Rahman noted the restaurant is not a standalone building. The ceiling is shared with other businesses. He said he contacted the building's landlord in the hopes they check the other businesses under the same roof. When contacted, Wascana Property Management, who oversees the building, did not offer comment for this story.

Me and my brother were really close,"" said Sarah Wall on Friday morning. ""He is my role model. He really is. My parents, they're very upset about it."" Wall said she anticipates they'll find her brother alive, whether it takes another day, or another week. I just spoke with a very poised Sarah Wall about her missing brother, Joshua, who left the family home a week ago in a blizzard. With the formal search ended, a community effort with 40-plus searchers in the woods, is underway today. <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/cbcnl?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#cbcnl</a> <a href=""https://t.co/RNys4HntWR"">pic.twitter.com/RNys4HntWR</a> The family put a call out on Facebook for volunteer searchers, and was met with an overwhelming response. Offers of help came from as far away as the United States. Volunteers met at 379 Roaches Line on Thursday morning, and roughly 40 gathered again at 8:30 a.m. Friday before heading out on snowshoes and snowmobiles. They were given snowshoes, an emergency blanket and a whistle in case Wall is found or an emergency arises. Wayne Wall, father of the 26-year-old man, said his son deals with anxiety and was not feeling well last Friday morning before he ventured out in the blizzard.  The last contact with Josh Wall was a text message to his friend saying he was lost and his phone battery was low.   Searchers are being supported by a family well-versed with searching for a missing loved one.  Lisa Lake, mother of 24-year-old Cortney Lake, was on the ground Friday morning and her sister put out a plea to help the Wall family's search on Thursday night.  Police believe Cortney Lake was killed by her ex-boyfriend in 2017, but her remains have never been found. Her family has led tireless searches in the years since — lending a hand with the search for Trevor Hamlyn as well.

The two have announced an educational initiative designed to get more Métis to speak their traditional tongue. Statistics Canada numbers show that fewer than 650 people living in Canada speak the Michif language — a mix of Cree and French. Canadian Geographic's chief executive officer says the magazine's online reach makes it ideal for raising public awareness about Michif language and culture. Gilles Gagnier, who confirmed a one-hour documentary is also in the works, says the magazine will use its vast education network to create classroom materials for teachers. Métis Nation-Saskatchewan president Glen McCallum says identity, language and culture are important to his people. ""When I go to my hometown, I know I belong because I can hear my own language and I can be me. When we know our language, we shall never forget who we are as Métis,"" he said in a statement Wednesday. At a launch event in Saskatoon, Sherry Soll told a story of growing up learning to trap and skin animals, but without knowing her traditional language.

""I get asked all the time, 'You don't speak the language, so why do you think you're good for this position?' My answer? 'Because I know what it's like not to have it,""' Soll said. Gagnier said one goal is to get Canadians thinking about Michif language and culture every day.

360,Raffy Boudjikanian,2019-12-03T00:32:26.160Z,Some Canadian schools see China's Confucius Institute as a handy teaching tool. Others reject it as propaganda,"After tying his sneaker shoelace, Laur An-Yochim jumps back to his feet.  Gym is his favourite class, and the fifth-grader does not intend to miss a moment of physical literacy consultant Stacey Hannay's instructions. ""What is this in Mandarin?"" Hannay asks, hopping around the basketball court inside Kildare School in Edmonton. The students yell the answer, then move along to a game that involves finding hidden trinkets underneath rows of plastic cups, following directions shouted in English and Mandarin.  Kildare is one of 14 schools in the Edmonton Public School Board's jurisdiction that takes part in programming offered by the Confucius Institute. That includes Mandarin classes but also other subjects taught in Mandarin, ranging from physical education to math. The Institute is partly funded by China's Ministry of Education and offers programming at elementary and high schools, as well as colleges and universities across Canada. China provides annual funding to run the programs as well as Chinese instructors who are are paid by China. In Edmonton's case, they work alongside the school's regular teachers to deliver language immersion programming. Much of Confucius Institute programming consists of classes in language and aspects of Chinese culture, such as calligraphy. China says it helps operate more than 500 of them around the world. In Canada, eight colleges and universities and three school boards have signed agreements with the organization.  Some critics, including the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), accuse the Institute of political interference and censorship in some of its classes, but the EPSB says it hasn't experienced those problems and has had thousands of its students complete the program since it first struck an agreement with Beijing in 2007. For An-Yochim and other students, the immersion program means his Mandarin is as smooth as his English. He switches effortlessly between the two and says knowing one of the world's most widely spoken languages has allowed him to connect with his grandparents when he visits China annually. ""They say every year, 'Wow, how are you this tall? Or, 'Your Chinese is really good this year,'"" he said.  WATCH | Students at Kildare School in Edmonton test out their Mandarin: The Edmonton school board insists it carefully reviews teaching materials and has no concerns about controversial subjects getting suppressed in class. The board receives annual funding from China to run the program, and 10 EPSB delegates flew there to renew the deal last October at Beijing's expense. ""I needed to go to see what it is, what does this look like? Right? What is the value?"" said Trisha Estabrooks, the board's chairperson and a former CBC News journalist, who was part of the delegation, there for six days. ""I learned about the value that some of our principals in Edmonton Public see in having that partnership.""  Estabrooks does not believe her independence as a trustee was compromised by having the trip expenses covered by China.   ""Taxpayer dollars were not used,"" she said.  ""I'd be concerned about the optics if Alberta taxpayer dollars were used to pay for my trip to China. I would not have gone on that trip.""  But Kathleen Lowrey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Alberta, doesn't want her nine-year-old daughter anywhere near Confucius programs. ""We're inviting them into elementary schools that Canadian taxpayers have paid for,"" she said. ""It's important to separate Chinese culture and language and civilization from the Chinese state.""  Lowrey supports student exposure to Chinese culture, but she worries the country's government ""has very different values from Canada."" She cited the example of two Canadian citizens — Fan Wei and Robert Lloyd Schellenberg — who were sentenced to death in China for drug offences. Some schools that originally took on Confucius Institute programs have since severed their ties. In 2013, McMaster University in Hamilton ended its contract with the organization after a teacher, Sonia Zhao, left the Institute, citing discriminatory hiring practices over her membership in the Falun Gong religious group. The Toronto District School Board dropped out of a partnership before it got off the ground five years ago.  At the time, Concordia and McGill universities in Montreal told CBC they were approached by China but never signed up. McGill cited a lack of safeguards to ensure its academic freedoms. New Brunswick's Education Department, meanwhile, is opting out completely by 2022, calling the program ""Chinese propaganda."" A 2013 intelligence report by CSIS warned that Chinese leaders identified Confucius as ""an organization for spreading propaganda and building soft power"" and spoke of a ""perception that CIs do not allow discussion of topics that the Chinese government deems sensitive,"" such as the political situation in Tibet and Taiwan or the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.  Other foreign-government funded institutions promoting culture and education operate in Canada, including Germany's Goethe Institute, Spain's Cervantes Institute and the British Council, but CSIS placed the Confucius Institute in a different category. ""Unlike the British Council, whose charter ensures that it is free from political interference, the CIs are closely linked to the Chinese part state,"" the report said. In 2014, the director of the Confucius Institute in Quebec told CBC she was visited by CSIS agents shortly after setting up shop in Montreal, and they only left her alone after she threatened to file a human-rights complaint. Determining exactly what kind of contracts are in place between Canadian schools and the Confucius Institute can be tricky.  CBC News reached out to eight higher-education institutions to find out about their agreements with China. Four of them didn't respond: The University of Waterloo, the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Regina and Halifax's St. Mary's University disclosed that they renewed their contracts in 2016 but only Waterloo and the Saskatchewan schools provided copies to CBC News. St. Mary's asked CBC to fill out a freedom of information request. The Coquitlam School District in British Columbia and the Edmonton Public School Board provided copies of their agreements.

361,"Vera-Lynn Kubinec, Kristin Annable, Caroline Barghout",2019-12-18T11:00:00.347Z,Suspended Winnipeg truck driver training company failed to act with 'honesty and integrity': MPI,"A Winnipeg truck driving school was given the longest training suspension in Manitoba Public Insurance's recent history, after the Crown corporation found the school was using an unauthorized instructor and an unauthorized truck, and had failed ""to act with honesty and integrity."" Longview Driving School was one of five schools offering training to obtain a Class 1 licence — which allows drivers to operate semi-trailer trucks — that were audited last year. Those audits came as MPI moved toward implementing mandatory truck driver training in response to the 2018 Humboldt Broncos bus crash. Longview was handed a five-year suspension by Manitoba Public Insurance, effective November 2018. ""MPI called me and told me 'your licence is suspended,' and I'm, like — wow,"" said Jitender Singh Dhalan, who was a part owner of Longview and a permitted driving instructor. ""I know I did mistakes,"" he said. ""I do regret these things."" The company has since been dissolved, but Dhalan is now working as an instructor with a different driver training company in Winnipeg, Blue Bird Class 1 Training Centre Ltd.  Manitoba Public Insurance regulates driver training companies under the provincial Drivers and Vehicles Act, said MPI spokesperson Brian Smiley.  He would not specify what prompted the audit specifically of Longview or the other four schools, saying only that a tip came in. Longview was the only school that was sanctioned, while ""conversations"" were had with the other four driving schools, said Smiley. ""Sanction was the last resort,"" he said.  ""There's expectations on these driving schools. They are teaching people how to drive. They're also accepting money. They're a business. So there's expectations for them to be honest and acting with integrity."" MPI found Longview had committed eight violations: Truck driver training courses were not a requirement for getting a Class 1 driver's licence in Manitoba until September 2019. Along with other provinces, Manitoba made the training courses mandatory for new truck drivers in the wake of the April 2018 crash between a semi and the Humboldt Broncos' bus, which killed 16 people and injured 13 others aboard the Saskatchewan hockey team's bus. There are 16 registered driving schools in Manitoba that are authorized by MPI to provide this training — including Blue Bird Training Centre. Smiley said that in the first 11 months of this year, 3,853 drivers in Manitoba took their Class 1 road test. About 36 per cent passed the test. Both Smiley and Dhalan said people began scrambling to get their Class 1 licences before the mandatory training requirement came into effect in Manitoba. ""[We] started getting busier and busier and busier,"" said Dhalan. ""And we got a lot of students.… More busy that I can handle myself."" That led to Longview cutting corners to keep up with the demand, he said.  The company allowed someone without an instructor's permit to help train the students, Dhalan said. It also brought in another truck that wasn't approved to be used for training.  The situation led to a falling out with his business partners, Dhalan said. ""I told them we need to get the permit. And there was no permit."" After the suspension, Dhalan began instructing at Blue Bird Training Centre. Company records show the training centre was incorporated in November 2018 — the same month Longview was suspended.  Dhalan said his brother-in-law owns Blue Bird Training Centre. Company records show Dhalan and that same brother-in-law are listed as directors in two other companies — Blue Bird Transport Holdings and Blue Bird Transport Ltd.  Smiley said an owner of a driving school suspended by MPI would be prohibited from opening up another school.  However, the audit did not give MPI any cause to sanction Dhalan as an instructor, Smiley said.  ""That individual was allowed to keep their driving instructor permit. So that tells me that that individual, by our evaluation, is able to continue on,"" Smiley said. When asked how many students trained at Longview, Dhalan said he wasn't sure, but estimated about 200. He said he's proud of his work as an instructor. ""When you come to me, you're going to learn,"" Dhalan said. ""I want you to learn and to be a good driver."" The Manitoba Trucking Association says there's a need for enforcement of driving school regulations, especially in light of a shortage of truck drivers across North America. ""Regulations are only effective if there's oversight and enforcement,"" said association executive director Terry Shaw. ""So we absolutely encourage oversight and enforcement of any regulation, especially those when it comes to driver licensing or road safety.""

362,Hallie Cotnam,2020-01-22T21:21:32.255Z,"Salty dragonflies mean more mosquitoes, researchers find","Road salt is arguably a life-saving necessity during Canadian winters, but new research shows it may also indirectly boost the mosquito population come summertime. According to a study published recently in the journal Frontiers of Ecology and Evolution, all that salt is leaching into roadside storm ponds, where both mosquito and dragonfly larvae grow. Rosalind Murray, a post-doctoral fellow in biology at the University of Toronto and one of the study's authors, studied storm ponds in the GTA with her research team. These man-made ponds are meant to catch road run-off before it drains into the watershed, but they're also full of tiny life. With no fish or frogs present, the wingless dragonfly larvae, which measure up to three centimetres in length, are the apex predators, and have a voracious appetite: a healthy one consumes an average of 11 mosquito larvae in two hours. ""But the salty dragonflies — the ones that were exposed to the highest level of salt for the longest amount of time — were eating significantly fewer mosquito larvae,"" Murray told the CBC's Ottawa Morning — as few as seven every two hours. ""That might not seem like that big a difference, but if you think about how many ponds and how many dragonflies, this can have a huge impact on ... how many mosquitoes they're actually consuming."" The salt appears to have little effect on the hardy, adaptable mosquito larvae, leaving the population to thrive. ""If you have a very salty environment that has killed off a lot of the potential predators for the mosquitoes, then you might be exposed to even more mosquitoes,"" Murray said. For the good of the planet, can we curb our addiction to road salt? But dragonfly larvae also feed on each other, and salty ones are slower to heal, she said. ""Dragonfly larvae are hugely cannibalistic, so they might pull off a leg. When they're exposed to high levels of salt … they're not as quick at recovering from these wounds."" The researchers followed the salty dragonflies into adulthood, and found they were less healthy. As well as healing more slowly, the insects were also found to be more vulnerable to infection. For humans, this poses a dilemma: using road salt in the wintertime means more mosquitoes in the summertime. Murray said she's not advocating for an end to road salt, but until a healthier alternative is found, she wants municipalities to consider the impact excessive amounts are having on the ecosystem.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/road-salt-environmental-impact-run-off-dragonflies-mosquitoes-1.5435761,[],N/A

364,Alicia Bridges and Victoria Dinh,2019-12-09T11:00:00.517Z,Confessions and controversy: Murder case against husband of Sheree Fertuck latest test of 'Mr. Big' tactic,"There's a big-time crime boss in Canada who treats his loyal followers to expensive dinners, gives them jobs and cleans up their crimes to keep them out of jail.  But the crimes aren't real, nor are the jobs. They're an elaborate ruse set up by the police to gather evidence from people suspected of serious crimes. A Saskatchewan man accused of murdering his estranged wife is the latest Canadian to find himself behind bars at the hands of ""Mr. Big"": the name given to a controversial undercover police tactic that law enforcement agencies across the country have used in efforts to move cold cases forward.  The operations involve police posing as criminals in an attempt to obtain a confession from a suspect. According to police, Greg Fertuck told an undercover officer that he ""got rid of"" his estranged wife, Sheree Fertuck, and threw her in the bush. She has been missing since her semi-truck was found abandoned at a gravel pit near Kenaston, Sask., in December 2015. Although her body has never been found, Greg Fertuck was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in late June 2019. Sheree's disappearance is the focus of a seven-part CBC investigative podcast called The Pit, the culmination of a year-long effort to uncover new information about the case. Now, as he sits behind bars in Saskatoon, charged with first-degree murder, Greg Fertuck is proclaiming his innocence. He said he lied about getting rid of Sheree because he was scared and intimidated by the undercover officers, who he says he believed were criminals. ""I made it up, and we went out supposedly looking for the body. Well, there is no body, so we just drove around to these different places, because it was all BS,"" said Fertuck in an interview with CBC News. ""I didn't kill her and there was no body out there."" Fertuck's claim goes straight to the heart of the controversy over the Mr. Big technique. Critics say it can violate the principles of confession law by creating a culture of fear, and may heighten the risk of false confessions. There have also been accusations it preys on the vulnerabilities of suspects with financial problems or addictions.   But for families of victims whose cases have gone cold, Mr. Big stings can be the only way to see charges laid and justice for their loved ones.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, is happy to see progress on the case.  ""I think because they are controversial I'm really crossing my fingers and hoping that [the RCMP] did it all the right ways, and did it legally … so that it can be admissible in court,"" she said.  ""You get one kick at the cat, right? So I really think that they know what they are doing.""  The playing field for Mr. Big stings is evolving under new guidelines outlined by a Supreme Court decision in 2014.   Still, questions remain about how the courts should balance the rights of the accused with the need for police to have the tools to catch violent criminals. CBC contacted the Saskatchewan RCMP but spokesperson Rob King said the police service will not discuss the technique or address criticisms of the method, because it is still being used.  Mr. Big stings have been carried out hundreds of times in Canada since they were developed by the RCMP in the 1990s, often in elaborate operations — some have cost more than $300,000 to run.  The tactic is not used in the U.S. or Britain, but it has been used to produce charges in Australia. In the stings, officers befriend a suspect while pretending to be members of a fictitious crime organization.  The goal is to build trust with the target and potentially draw out new information to use as evidence. This could include a confession to a crime, a description of how the crime occurred, or the location of the victim's body or the murder weapon.  The method is often used in cold cases, where the police have a suspect but lack the evidence to prosecute.  Saskatoon defence lawyer Brian Pfefferle has represented three people charged with separate serious crimes after a Mr. Big sting.  He said the technique is highly successful in landing convictions.  ""I've never been able to convince a jury that there was a false confession made. And I think my results are consistent with other people's results around the country,"" said Pfefferle.  ""There's a smattering of cases that have led to acquittals or convictions on lower offences but for the most part they're getting convicted of the offence they're facing when they're giving these types of confessions, so it's very significant evidence."" Each of the operations follows a similar script: the undercover agents insert themselves into the target's lives through a ""chance"" meeting, and bring them further into the ""organization"" through a chain of scenarios.  In an interview at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre in July, Fertuck shared details of the operation with CBC.  He said an undercover officer offered him paid jobs transporting vehicles from one town to another. Paid work is regularly offered to Mr. Big suspects during the course of the sting, and Fertuck said he trusted the men. It's common for the suspect to feel a strong kinship with the undercover officers in the stings, says Pfefferle. ""They become real friends,"" he said.  ""I've had situations where the people 'fall in love,' essentially, with the various characters — not in a romantic sense but in a friendship sense, where ... oftentimes the best friends they've ever had in their life are these fictitious friends."" Fertuck also described another hallmark of the Mr. Big method: a scenario known as ""the violent incident.""  He said he met with a man who appeared to have committed a killing — and another man who said he would clean it up. ""This one guy [said he] killed his girlfriend, and I know he had blood all over him, scratches on his face,"" said Fertuck.  ""And this guy from Vancouver ... come in and got rid of everything, sort of the clean-up guy."" Some type of simulated violence is part of most Mr. Big stings. During a 2015 appeal of a first-degree murder conviction, the officer who directed an undercover operation involving murder suspect Jesse West explained the reason for choosing to simulate violence against a woman as part of the sting: ""It was directly to show Mr. West that violence against women was accepted in our organization. The investigation was a homicide on a female and we wanted to show him that women — to conduct violence on women is not a big deal."" In that case, the judge denied the defence claim that the violent incident was an abuse of process, and the appeal of West's conviction was dismissed. In the case of Abiram Subramaniam, who was convicted in 2016 of second-degree murder in Quebec, the ""criminals"" told the suspect they had information that police were coming after him.  The details are part of a written decision by Justice Marc-Andre Blanchard.  ""The Boss was willing to … help him get out of this situation related to the victim,"" Justice Blanchard wrote. ""Without his help, it was made clear that Subramaniam would in all likelihood be going to jail for 25 years."" Pfefferle said he considers confession evidence such as that from Mr. Big stings even more damning for the accused than video evidence. His main concerns about the technique relate to confession law, which states that a confession must be made of free will and without any threats or promises made to the accused.  ""The problem with Mr. Bigs, at their core, is that they are based on exactly those things — not necessarily direct threats, but there is this subtle threat of this organization being pretty bad."" There are also promises, Pfefferle said. ""Oftentimes it's promises for a long-term job with the criminal organization, and many times these particular accused persons will have difficulty with employment."" He said Mr. Big stings are also different from traditional police investigations because most of the interactions are not recorded.  Usually when a person is arrested, all of their interactions with police in the interview room are recorded. In Mr. Big stings, usually only the final interview, or a handful of meetings, are taped. But Pfefferle also sees broader issues with the way the stings operate. Although there is evidence that false confessions have occurred, he said society has a tendency to believe an admission of guilt.  ""If you've confessed to something, especially something that is embarrassing or it's going to get you in trouble, most people believe you did it,"" said Pfefferle.  ""I think that's one of the problems with Mr. Bigs because the evidence at the end of the day is so strong in the minds of the average juror that they're going to say 'he wouldn't have confessed if he didn't do it.'"" People have been cleared of committing crimes they confessed to during a Mr. Big sting.  Kyle Unger spent 14 years in jail for the murder of Brigitte Grenier in Manitoba in 1990.  He was convicted based largely on his confession, testimony from jailhouse informants and a single piece of forensic evidence — a hair found on the victim's clothing.  But DNA testing later proved the hair did not belong to Unger. And although he got key facts wrong about the killing in his confession to undercover officers, it was still used against him.  He later told reporters he'd lied because he was young, naive and desperate for money. Unger was acquitted in 2009.  Al Haslett, a retired RCMP officer and one of the creators of the Mr. Big sting, previously defended the technique in an interview with CBC's The Fifth Estate in 2015. ""[We] seek the truth. We don't go there, we don't wake up in the morning and say 'we're going to get confessions,'"" Haslett said in an interview with Bob McKeown.   ""This is not a bunch of cowboy cops going out and doing this. This is planned, the scenarios are planned, thought out, and we go to seek the truth."" Haslett was not available to be interviewed by CBC for this story. However, ""things can go off the rails and people can, because of fear, say and do things that might not otherwise be true, or that they might not otherwise have done,"" said Neil Boyd, the director of the school of criminology at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C. But he pointed to the case of Doug Holtam as an example of a case where a Mr. Big sting led to a conviction that was warranted.  Holtam was convicted of the 1997 murder of his wife Leonora and six-year-old daughter with a hammer. He was also found guilty of the attempted murder of his son, who survived the attack. Police had DNA evidence of his children's blood on his shirt and shoe before the Mr. Big sting led to a confession.  ""His conviction was entirely warranted, so I don't take the position that just because the police have engaged in this kind of activity that it's necessarily suspect,"" said Boyd.  It is up to the courts to decide if a case has gone ""off the rails"" or not, he said. That's what the Supreme Court did in 2014, when the case of Nelson Hart in Newfoundland led to stricter rules for Mr. Big stings. The court concluded the conduct of police in that case was ""egregious"" and ""troubling."" Justice Michael Moldaver wrote that the law at that time didn't offer enough protection to people who confessed to crimes during Mr. Bigs.  He said while these types of stings can produce valuable evidence and are not necessarily abusive, they can become abusive and produce unreliable confessions. He ruled police should be allowed to keep using the tactic, but under stricter rules.  Mr. Big confessions are now automatically considered inadmissible unless the Crown can prove their value as evidence outweighs their capacity to prejudice the outcome of trial. Prosecutors have successfully done so in several cases since 2014.  The 2014 Supreme Court decision also offered clearer guidelines for judges deciding if Mr. Big evidence should be admissible, and to help them decide what counts as police misconduct.  The Public Prosecution Service of Canada wrote about the impact of the case against Hart in a 2018 report titled Innocence at Stake: The Need for Continued Vigilance to Prevent Wrongful Convictions in Canada. The report predicted the courts will likely be more restrictive about what types of violent incidents can be simulated in Mr. Big stings in the wake of the Supreme Court decision. It offered recommendations for prosecution services, urging them to make sure they do not exploit the target's vulnerabilities, and to take further care to ensure the violent incident does not directly or indirectly threaten the suspect.  Juries at Mr. Big trials are also now instructed that people have falsely confessed in the past.   Brian Pfefferle said the legitimacy of the confession will likely be at the heart of the Crown's case against Greg Fertuck.  ""The strength of that confession is really going to be the focus for the jury, as it always is,"" said Pfefferle.  ""What can be corroborated through the forensic evidence?""  Another factor in the Fertuck case will be the fact that Sheree's body has not been found. It is unusual for police to lay charges without finding the victim.  Greg Fertuck said he led the undercover officers to a country road outside Saskatoon. In the days after his June arrest, police were seen searching an area not far from the gravel pit where Sheree's truck was found, but they did not find her remains.  RCMP Insp. Diane Cockle says searching for human remains that have been left outside for four years is an incredibly difficult task.  ""What happens to the remains is they get weathered, they change colour, they get bleached by the sun or they get stained by the soil,"" said Cockle, who has a PhD in forensic anthropology and worked as a forensic crime scene investigator for 19 years. She now works in major crimes.  ""The vegetation gets deposited on top of the area over time so they end up being buried. And it becomes less and less visible every year."" Scavengers including domestic dogs, coyotes and birds can move parts of a body up to about 400-500 metres from where the body was dumped, she said. ""But if these guys [in Saskatchewan] were searching in a systematic matter looking for things like small bone fragments and they knew what they were looking for, chances are they would have found what they were looking for."" On June 25, the day after Greg Fertuck's arrest, the search for Sheree Fertuck was still ongoing when RCMP Supt. Derek Williams announced the charges.  ""Although it's unusual, there have been successful prosecutions before without a body being found,"" said Williams.  A preliminary hearing will be held in January to decide if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. The hearing is likely to be subject to a publication ban.  To date, Greg Fertuck has been represented by Saskatoon criminal defence lawyer Morris Bodnar.  Sheree Fertuck's sister, Michelle Kish, hopes to attend the upcoming court proceedings, although she fears the evidence will be difficult to hear. Regardless, she is relieved to see the progress from a police perspective. ""I was a little bit afraid that, you know, cases do go cold, right. You hear that all the time. And I just thought, 'Oh God … this can't be one of them. Something's gotta come of it.'""  The preliminary hearing begins on Jan. 13.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/mr-big-sting-saskatchewan-greg-fertuck-rcmp-police-canada-1.5388277,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/greg-fertuck-denies-killing-sheree-fertuck-1.5212297 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/friend-remembers-sheree-fertuck-at-accused-killer-s-court-appearance-in-saskatoon-1.5220735 https://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2014-2015/mrbig https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kyle-unger-lawsuit-settled-1.5115948 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mr-big-ruling-a-game-changer-for-those-convicted-in-sting-operations-1.2724310,N/A

The city created the incentive program in 2012 to help fill lots that were either vacant, underused and perhaps containing only a rundown shack, or being used for parking. Kinden Kosick, senior planner for the city, says since then, the program has helped develop 342 units in Whitehorse — from townhouse condos to commercial developments to rental units. ""We see certain types of housing getting built — for example, there's a lot of townhouses getting built in Whistle Bend and not too many apartments,"" Kosick said. ""So this is trying to target different sectors of the housing market that we don't see being built."" Those who qualify for the incentive wouldn't have to pay certain municipal developer fees (which start at $2,185). If the project is rental or supportive housing, with at least four units, developers could also get a 10-year tax grant for up to $500,000.  Non-profit groups like Habitat for Humanity Yukon, which builds houses and makes them affordable for low-income families to own, would have new benefits catered to them. These include a grant for developing costs for up to $20,000, as well as deferred payment for any lot purchased from the City of Whitehorse. ""The fact is that the city owns very little land,"" said Mike Gau, director of development services for the city. ""It's the Yukon government that owns most of the vacant land in town, along with the First Nations, so they may choose to do different pricing on a lot of land.

367,Tony Davis,2020-01-19T12:00:33.121Z,How 'absolute terror' led this P.E.I. man to start a podcast about mental health,"Feeling alone is a common theme on Matt Burke's podcast about mental health. The 24-year-old started Matty's Mental Health Podcast about 10 months ago and since then has recorded 21 episodes in his Charlottetown home, covering a wide range of topics including his own story. ""The purpose of the podcast is to provide a platform where people can share their stories with mental health."" He said a lot of people feel like they have to fight their mental health battles on their own, and through the podcast, he wants to show them they don't have to.  On the podcast he has spoken to people about things such as depression, anxiety and how concussions can affect a person's mental health. ""I've had counsellors on there. They talked about mental health from their side,"" he said.  ""A lot of interesting people. I've learned a lot from them."" Burke said he is not a mental health professional ""by any stretch of the imagination,"" but he has had his own struggles with mental health and revealed his story on Episode 9. When Burke was 20, his girlfriend took her own life. The couple was having a difficult time and while he was out one night his cellphone died as the two were texting back and forth. The following morning he was cleaning off his car to go check on her when her parents pulled into the driveway and told him his girlfriend had killed herself. ""It was just absolute terror,"" Burke said. He couldn't wrap his head around it. He was a mess and he got sick to his stomach. ""I completely lost it. I went into a rage. I punched the ground. I went into my house and I punched holes in the wall,"" he said. His girlfriend's family insisted he come with them for the day and he went. He said they talked him down from his emotions. ""I was lucky they took me in right away and treated me as family,"" he said. Now, with the podcast he is hoping to provide similar support by discussing mental health with others. ""I just knew right away that I was just looking to make a positive out of it somehow,"" he said.  ""Like 'How can I help? How can I move this forward? Take this experience and help somebody else that was in the same situation she was in,'"" Burke said. He said he wasn't sure what form that help would take until he found podcasting and decided to start inviting Islanders to discuss mental wellness. Mark Burke — no relation to Matt — was on the latest episode of the podcast. He played hockey on P.E.I. for about 16 years, from squirts to junior, he said. In December of 2016 he suffered a concussion and returned to the ice after two weeks. Two-and-a-half months later he suffered another concussion. That's when he realized they were taking a toll on his mental health. ""Anxious, like constantly. I'd go through bouts of depression from it. Just almost felt sort of stuck in a fight or flight state,"" Mark said.  ""Mood swings would randomly happen. I would go from somewhat happy, to mad as crazy over something silly to almost being in tears and that could all happen in a span of 15 minutes."" While he was experiencing this, he was going through changes in his life and had just moved out on his own, so he attributed the mental health issues to that. He said he didn't really think his mental health was impacted by the concussions until he heard former Boston Bruins goalie Tim Thomas talk about how his mental health was affected by concussions. Traumatic brain injuries left undiagnosed &amp; uncared for can rob you of your quality of life<br><br>Isolation, impulse control issues, our sense of self &amp; the way we view the world are just a few of the symptoms<br><br>Thx Tim for speaking ur truth<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bruins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#Bruins</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#NHL</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TBI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TBI</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/concussion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#concussion</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/mentalhealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#mentalhealth</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ItGsDVKE6E"">pic.twitter.com/ItGsDVKE6E</a> Mark only told his parents about a month ago and the family went to see a mental health professional together. ""He referred me to a neurologist, so we are in line for that,"" Mark said.  Mark also struggles with small talk following the concussions and appearing on the podcast was a way of addressing that issue. ""That felt real good, just to kind of air it all out,"" he said. ""I got to keep moving forward and make myself better every day to kind of set a good example — that when you do tell your story it really does help."" Mark said he was able to relate to Matt knowing he also struggled with mental health. The year after his girlfriend died Matt was in shock. He couldn't sleep or focus. ""It is kind of a tornado of emotions,"" he said. ""You know, a big thing for me, I started therapy right away and that was huge for me. That probably saved my life."" Matt said just talking about what was going through his mind helped. One thing he started to do, that he still does, is go on hikes with his dogs for hours at a time. ""I just work through everything that is going on in my mind,"" he said. ""It's kind of like a meditation time, and I always felt a little bit better."" Matt said he hopes his girlfriend would be proud of the work he is doing now. He said if what he's doing helps one person, ""it'll be worth it for me."" Ronnie McPhee, a community liaison for the city of Charlottetown, was a recent guest on the podcast. McPhee said listening to Matt and his guests open up about their mental health troubles inspired him and gave him the confidence to take his turn at the microphone. When McPhee was younger he struggled with his mental health, and at one point, he spent time in the hospital. ""It gave me the opportunity to put myself in a comparable setting to other people who had challenges like this,"" he said. ""It just showed me how I could offer up my advantages to support others."" Being able to talk and help others deal with their mental health struggles has helped him cope with his own, McPhee said. ""That was always a good feeling to me. That's kind of how I found my way of coping with the challenges I kind of grew up with,"" he said. Burke hasn't had to look for guests very often because many people have asked if they can be part of the podcast. ""I'm just like honoured to do it and I am so thankful for all the guests that reach out to me,"" he said. ""I know how hard it is to tell your story."" He said organizing a traumatic story, to ""go back to that point and really dive into it,"" can be difficult. ""The main thing I try to do is get out of the way and let them tell their story and I think by them sharing it'll just benefit anyone who listens who is going through the same thing,"" he said. ""And even people who aren't going through the same thing, just to understand what people go through."" One takeaway he hopes listeners walk away with is that mental health issues are common. Having lost someone very close to suicide, Matt does worry about some of the people he interviews. ""I never try to force anyone to come on,"" Burke said. ""I want to make sure they are in a good enough place to come on."" When referring to his girlfriend's death, Burke said ""mental illness took her life."" He said in the last few years the discussion around mental health has become more compassionate. ""Bringing these things to light and being more compassionate about it is 100 per cent the way to go in the future.""

""You can't think of something like this happening,"" said Sarmen Sinani, of Markham, Ont. ""They [fraudsters] were saying, 'Send me the money. And don't send a cheque. Just e-transfer it.'"" Sinani is one of more than 200 people Go Public has learned were recently targeted by fraudsters who stole tens of thousands of dollars, sent via Interac e-transfers, by breaking into email accounts and redirecting the money.  Been wronged and you're not the only one affected? Contact our Go Public team It has some experts questioning why the popular electronic money transfer system involves email at all, when other jurisdictions have stronger security.  ""Canadian customers deserve the best safety and security for their banking and e-transactions,"" said cybersecurity expert Claudiu Popa, who advises governments and companies. ""Unfortunately, we are far from getting there."" Sinani was working on a customer's order when he emailed her in March, asking for a 50 per cent deposit. By May, he still hadn't received it, so he asked again.  To his surprise, his client said she had e-transferred it on March 15. Sinani searched through deleted emails and discovered a fraudster had impersonated him and told his client to e-transfer $2,775. ""The hacker would alter my conversation to them [his customer] and alter their conversation to me,"" said Sinani. ""Basically they were taking full control of two people, just going back and forth. It's unbelievable."" Posing as Sinani, the fraudster told his client he had an out-of-town family emergency and instructed her not to stop by the store to drop off a cheque.  Instead, the fraudster told her to send an e-transfer to a new email that appeared similar to the actual email for Sinani's family business, Sinco Marble and Granite. Then, the fraudster posed as Sinani's client and altered her emails, telling Sinani that she was dealing with a family emergency and couldn't come to the shop to pay the deposit. ""It was insane,"" said Sinani. ""They played us good."" Sinani says when his customer contacted Interac, the company said its e-transfer system had worked — moving money from point A to point B — and that it was not going to investigate. ""They're just not being co-operative,"" he said. ""I'm sure there's an easy way to see where the money went. But no one wants to work on it, I guess."" Interac declined an interview request with Go Public, but in a statement said each fraud case is ""unique and customers should speak to their bank directly."" Interac would not address Sinani's — or other customers' — concerns. Interac is a private company and Canada's big banks and credit unions are among its shareholders. Sinani's customer lost the money through her account at CIBC. The bank would not tell Go Public what — if anything — it was doing to help trace the money, but in a statement said funds sent ""to an email impersonator are very difficult to recover."" York Regional Police are investigating.  A cybercrime expert who specializes in password cracking says many people aren't aware of the underground community of fraudsters who buy and share email and password information, aimed at draining bank accounts. ""There's people doing offensive research to determine new ways of attacking,"" security systems, said Dustin Heywood, with IBM's X-Force Red.  ""It's turning into an arms race."" Heywood estimates that the average person uses their email and password on about 300 sites — from the local library to pizza delivery — and any one of those databases can get hacked. ""The problem is, not every site has the same level of security around their passwords,"" he said. ""So if a weaker site gets hacked, then all of a sudden your password is being leaked out."" Heywood says hackers then use bots — custom software — that can lurk undetected on hundreds of thousands of computers. ""They could have something sitting there for months and when the right keywords come through"" — such as ""payment"" or ""deposit"" and — ""Bang! We've got ourselves a transfer."" So Interac's e-transfer system, he says, is only as secure as users' email and passwords. On the heels of a Go Public story published last week about e-transfers, we heard from a number of people who have lived in other countries that use systems that allow people to electronically transfer funds directly from bank to bank. ""One does not have to worry about payments being intercepted,"" Andrew Dunning wrote, about e-transfers in the U.K.  ""Everything is practically instantaneous, and it's all traced between the banks. It's shocking to me that the [Canadian] government has not mandated the implementation of this system."" Rajesh Vijayaraghavan, who studies risk management in financial institutions, says Interac's system is ""unique"" because it relies on email, unlike most in other developed countries. Vijayaraghavan, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, says the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, India and other countries have had systems in place for years that allow e-transfers directly from bank to bank — using only a bank code and a person's account number.  ""The rest of the world can't be wrong,"" he said. ""It's the better system."" Two weeks ago, the European Union went a step further, requiring all financial institutions to offer two-factor authentication — a system which only allows a user to log on to an account once they've received a code on a separate device or an email at a different email address. Vijayaraghavan says shifting away from an email-reliant system would require work. ""It's a legacy system,"" he said. ""So this has to be a co-ordinated effort from all banks."" Popa, the cybersecurity expert, says the only way banks will improve security for e-transfers — and the auto-deposit option — is if the government forces them.  He says requirements for strong authentication are needed immediately, instead of the convenient, but less secure, system currently in place. ""No more secrecy and downplaying these issues,"" Popa said. ""Canadians need to demand reform from their politicians."" Sinani the contractor, says he's no longer a fan of e-transfers, since he and his customer are now in a ""stressful"" dispute over who should cover the stolen $2,775.  But he says about 80 per cent of his customers want to pay using e-transfer because it's so convenient. ""Convenient is great, until something like this happens to you,"" he said. ""Improving the system would be better.""

369,Karin Larsen,2020-01-24T19:09:52.947Z,"Lyft, Uber waste little time launching in Vancouver","Ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft launched in Vancouver Friday morning. At a news conference, Lyft general manager Peter Lukomskyj said his company's initial operating area will be restricted to the core of Vancouver, bounded by Dunbar Street to the west, Victoria Drive to the east and 41 Avenue to the south. It will also service the Pacific National Exhibition and Vancouver International Airport.  Lukomskyj said the area would expand as the company attracted more drivers. Uber's operating area includes a much bigger swath of Metro Vancouver, including Coquitlam, Surrey, Delta, West and North Vancouver.  In a news release, Uber said it would expand its operating area ""as soon as more drivers complete the permit requirements. The launch of both companies comes less than 24 hours after the Passenger Transportation Board (PTB) announced it had approved ride-hailing. First Lyft ride in Vancouver <a href=""https://t.co/edh6uWsbnr"">pic.twitter.com/edh6uWsbnr</a> Carolyn Bauer, spokesperson for the Vancouver Taxi Association and general manager of Yellow Cab, said association members are extremely upset with the decision. ""This is going to be financially devastating for the taxi industry and the families that have built their lives around this industry,"" Bauer said Friday on The Early Edition. Bauer said the association is pursuing a judicial review and requesting the PTB put a brief stay on the decision until the injunction application can be heard. She is calling on the board to regulate the amount of ride-hailing vehicles in the same way it restricts the size of taxi fleets. ""If we have 2,500 taxis operating in Vancouver, put out 2,500 ride-share vehicles,"" said Bauer. ""Bring ride-share, but bring it fair.""

370,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-04-15T16:17:03.386Z,Pesticide on planes: Parents call for changes after cabin fumigated with passengers on board,"Rania Khunaysir didn't see it coming when she booked a last-minute Caribbean vacation for her young family. The Toronto parent had no idea the airplane cabin would be fumigated with them on board just before they landed in Jamaica, despite guidelines that say passengers should be clearly and repeatedly informed of the requirement before they fly.  ""Suddenly there was an announcement on the intercom saying that [flight attendants will] be walking down the aisle spraying a non-toxic insecticide ... I thought insecticide doesn't sound non-toxic,"" Khunaysir told Go Public about the family's flight last August. Khunaysir's husband Randy Beharry and their three-year-old daughter are both asthmatic. The couple's son, who was seven months old at the time, was also on the flight. ""I was worried about my kids."" Beharry said. ""My asthma triggered probably within minutes. I had a hard time breathing,"" The experience left the family concerned about potential health impacts of the spray and calling for strict rules that require passengers to be clearly informed before they fly. ""I don't want to be inhaling this pesticide,"" Khunaysir said.  More than two dozen countries, such as Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, require airlines to spray insecticides on flights that arrive from Canada. The process is meant to kill insects that could spread disease. The World Health Organization has said it has found no evidence the sprays used are harmful to human health when they are used as recommended, but also says non-chemical methods need to be found.   The long-standing practice is raising concerns among some health experts. ""There is no such thing as a non-toxic pesticide,"" said researcher Chris van Netten, a professor emeritus with the University of British Columbia's school of population and public health. He calls the widespread system of spraying pesticides ""not acceptable"" and said airline crew members and passengers need to be better informed and protected — especially children, older travellers and those with respiratory problems.  Frequent traveller Josie Ball from Selkirk, Ont., flies to Cuba several times a year with Sunwing and said she was shocked the first time she was on a flight where the cabin was sprayed.  She said people on her flight in April 2018 were coughing and wheezing.  ""I think the public should have been aware ... that there is a spraying in these countries … and [told] a little bit more about the chemical they're spraying,"" she said. She now takes her own mask when she's travelling to hotter countries.  Harlene Hart from Newington, southeast of Ottawa, was on her way to Cuba on another Sunwing flight in February, a birthday present from her boyfriend, when the cabin was sprayed with pesticide about an hour before they landed.  ""Insecticide should be sprayed in a well-ventilated area,"" she told Go Public in an email. ""Not a sardine can with partially reused air."" What upsets her most, she said, is that she wasn't clearly notified before she purchased her ticket. She said she wouldn't have taken the trip if she had known. Canadian airlines are not obligated to let passengers know before they fly that the cabin will be sprayed with insecticide — despite studies cited by health experts Go Public spoke with who say the spraying can cause serious asthma attacks, skin irritations and long-term problems with the nervous system. Transport Canada said there's nothing it can do, but the transportation authority does acknowledge the practice could pose a ""foreseeable hazard.""  The video below was posted by YouTube user ScottTheCoffeeGeek. It is unverified, but appears to show a flight attendant on a China Eastern flight carrying out the ""top-of-descent"" disinsection procedure, which involves spraying while passengers are on board.  Go Public found an advisory issued in 2009 where the department said passengers with respiratory issues need to be clearly informed before they fly so they can get ""advice from their own physician ... on whether they should travel to those destinations."" That advisory sets guidelines — not rules — saying airlines should notify passengers: • Before they purchase their tickets. • On the flight ticket itself. • Before boarding the aircraft. None of the four Canadian airlines that travel to these destinations informs passengers using all three methods.  WestJet points out that disinsection is only required on four of the 20 countries it flies to, and two other airlines that fly to these countries — Sunwing and Air Transat — say they are complying with guidelines by putting the information on their websites and telling passengers who ask. Air Canada also requires passengers booking online to click on a box agreeing to the airline's ""General Conditions of Carriage."" Halfway through that document there is information about the spraying being carried out on certain routes.  The airline also mentions aircraft disinfection on its ""Health Tips"" section of the website and provides a link to that section on the itinerary emailed to passengers who book directly with Air Canada.  However, passengers won't see that link if they book through third party websites like Khunaysir did when she booked her Air Canada flight. Van Netten, who has studied the effects of repeated exposure to pesticides, said the message that insecticide will be used in plane cabins isn't getting through. He said airlines and Transport Canada can do better. ""People have a right to know what they are going to be exposed to.""  The practice of fumigating an airplane's cabin started decades ago. It's mandated by governments outside Canada and considered necessary to control potentially deadly diseases that can be transmitted via insects — such as malaria and yellow fever — before entering certain tropical countries.  Twenty-seven countries require Canadian airlines to spray. Two methods are used, according to the Transport Canada website: spraying aerosol insecticides in the cabin while passengers are onboard and treating the airplane's interior surfaces before passengers board. ""Both of them have their problems,"" van Netten said.  He said the second method leaves toxic residue on surfaces travellers eat and sleep on, noting recent studies have drawn a link between both methods of spraying and effects on the nervous system. ""Tingling in the fingers for instance — that's how it would start. And it can go all the way up to a neurological impairment ... but that takes a lot of exposure to get to that stage."" The spray often contains an insecticide called Permethrin, a pesticide that's been approved by the World Health Organization for what's called ""disinsection"" on flights.  The union representing flight attendants in Canada is also worried about the spraying.  ""We get reports of a sore throat, sore eyes … lots of skin conditions,"" said Troy Winters, senior health and safety officer for the Canadian Union of Public Employees. ""I've got a recent report about skin peeling off of the inside of somebody's hand and we had one fairly serious asthma reaction.""   He's concerned about the long-term effects of repeated exposure on airline staff, saying some can be exposed to the spray more than 100 times during their career. ""Recently I've started to see some reports of potential longer-term results and I'm concerned about potential long-term neurological effects.""  There are no industry-wide rules on what, if any, protective gear flight attendants wear while fumigating.  All the airlines say they provide training and safety equipment to staff. Winters would like to see the Canadian government put pressure on the destination countries to reduce the use, suggesting a review of whether a flight leaving Canada in the dead of winter really needs to be fumigated.  The U.S. has a law that requires airlines to disclose disinsection on their website and refer travellers to the specific section when they buy a ticket.  The Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization Act also recommends the U.S. government work with WHO to find a ""safe, effective, and nontoxic means of preventing the transportation of disease-carrying mosquitoes and other insects on commercial aircraft."" There are non-spraying methods being developed, like a mechanical air curtain that blows everything out in one direction, but they are still in the testing stages.  WHO says the chemicals used pose no risk to human health when used properly, but when it reviewed current disinsection practices in 2018, it said there is a need for new ""nonchemical"" methods. For now, travellers have few options — such as choosing to travel to countries that don't require spraying, travelling with a mask to put on before the spraying starts and being sure to wipe down all surfaces on the plane when passengers settle in. Khunaysir and Beharry say given the age of their children and asthma issues, they would have chosen another destination if they were told ahead of them that they'd be sprayed.  ""I'm really surprised that they allow this to continue,"" Khunaysir said. ""I would've had no problem saying, 'Let's change our destination, let's go somewhere else, where they don't require that.'""  Submit your story ideas Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.

Only three years after Force One closed up shop — meaning no more Yamaha or Polaris snowmobiles for sale —  Aurora Dodge sales manager Dan Ireland has confirmed that his shop will stop selling Arctic Cats to focus on vehicles by the beginning of April. He says people can still bring in their Arctic Cat machines for repair after then. Ireland says in his personal view, ""the recreational dollars in Canada, but Yellowknife especially, have really shrunk ... you only have so much money to spend."" He also says that the company's focus is on vehicles. ""That's what we want to focus on, to give customers the best experience."" Aurora Dodge leaving the market leaves Polar Tech Recreation, which sells Ski-Doo products, as the only place in town to buy new snow machines. For Joey Sutton, Polar Tech's owner and operator, are only increasing. ""We've had kind of record sales for about four years now. It's not much of a record, but it is an increase each and every year, year over year,"" he said.  Sutton says that he thinks Ski-Doo's parent company, Bombardier Recreational Products, is doing a good job capturing market share, and that he doesn't think the closing of other shops implies a lack of interest from people in snowmobiles.  There are other options elsewhere in the territory. Jody Irving works at Diggerz Sports in Hay River. He says that the news is both ""good for us"" and bad. ""It doesn't give people a choice in Yellowknife anymore,"" he says. But Irving adds that people with Yamaha, Polaris or Arctic Cat snowmobiles can also buy parts from him or send their machines down to his shop in Hay River to be fixed. ""We are starting to run a truck back and forth for customers when they need it,"" he adds.   A staff member at Monster Recreational Products, another snowmobile dealer in Hay River, confirmed that their shop also fixes all major brands of snowmobiles.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yellowknife-snowmobile-sellers-1.5423847,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/norman-wells-snowmobile-oudzi-1.5396433 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/dave-england-x-games-snowmobile-1.5430059,N/A

In punishing Howard Wu earlier this month, the discipline committee of Ontario's medical regulator noted the doctor had a history of problems that included previous findings of professional misconduct. ""(Dr. Wu) failed to maintain the standard of practice with multiple patients in varying situations,"" the committee found in ordering his licence revoked. ""He has demonstrated serious clinical deficiencies that put his patients at risk."" Wu, 50, who studied medicine at Queen's University and the University of Toronto, practised in Markham, Ont. According to disciplinary records from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, a mother took her feverish newborn to see him in November 2015. Instead of recommending an immediate hospital visit, the doctor sent them home with instructions to give the baby water and vitamin C-rich juice. He gave the same advice two days later when the infant's condition did not improve. The baby died within days. A college investigator stopped short of blaming Wu directly for the death but said he did not give the child the needed care. The committee also reviewed complaints from an insurance company that Wu was prescribing an inordinate number of medical devices such as braces. Evidence was that the supplier next door paid him $100 a year for each patient he referred. Wu had previously denied any financial interest in the sale of devices sold by the supplier. In addition, the committee found that Wu had done hundreds of eye exams despite having little competency. He was unable to describe the basic steps needed for such exams or the equipment used, according to the committee. Records also indicate Wu was convicted of dangerous driving in 2015 and driving while disqualified in January 2017. However, evidence was that he lied to the college on several occasions when he denied having faced any charges. Despite admitting some allegations and pleading no contest to others, Wu argued he should be allowed to return to a period of supervised practice after a 15-month licence suspension. He admitted not having the knowledge to recognize that a baby with fever could be much sicker than appeared. He also said he no longer performed eye examinations. Overall, he promised to do better but the committee was having none of it. In considering appropriate punishment, the panel noted Wu had been suspended for misconduct in 2009 and again in 2013, and had been through several periods of supervision. The committee also found Wu had been less than truthful on multiple occasions. ""These omissions and misrepresentations extend beyond simple poor judgment and reflect a propensity to mislead the college, which causes the committee significant concern with respect to Dr. Wu's governability,"" the committee said. Ultimately, the panel ordered immediate revocation of Wu's licence along with a reprimand. He must also pay $31,110 in costs.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/doctor-loses-licence-1.5436400,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hospital-hallway-medicine-healthcare-beyond-capacity-1.5420434,N/A

The two entities were in court for an all-day hearing after Manitoba Hydro appealed the regulatory board's order to create an ""on-reserve First Nations"" customer class in 2018. The special rate class exempted those customers from an across-the-board hydro rate increase of 3.6 per cent.  The Crown corporation objected to the order in 2018, but went ahead with its creation. Manitoba Hydro's lawyer, Helga Van Iderstine, told Court of Appeal judges that while the utility accepts that many First Nations people living on reserve live in poverty, it doesn't agree that the board has the authority to create different rate classes to address this issue.  ""They don't have rate-making functions … they have a review and approval authority. It may seem like a subtle difference but it's important,"" she said.  She also argued that under provincial law, rates for Manitoba Hydro customers should be the same throughout the province.  A section of the Manitoba Hydro Act states that ""The rates charged for power supplied to a class of grid customers within the province shall be the same throughout the province."" But Dayna Steinfeld, lawyer for the Public Utilities Board, argued the board ""is not just there to rubber stamp what's put forward by Manitoba Hydro."" She said the board has the authority to consider a variety of options when deciding how the utility's costs should be recovered.  She also stressed that existing legislation leaves it up to the board to decide which factors are relevant when considering rates, such as social issues.  In this case, she said the board heard extensive evidence that on-reserve customers face unique challenges, like inadequate housing. She said that the board heard evidence that in some cases, these customers have to make ""unacceptable"" sacrifices in order to pay their energy bills.  The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs was an intervener in the appeal, and on Wednesday, lawyer Carly Fox backed up the utility board's argument.  She told appeal court judges that customers living on reserves are disproportionately vulnerable to rate increase, and that the rate class eliminates an unjust burden on those customers.  The Consumers' Association of Canada's Manitoba branch is also an intervener in the appeal, with lawyer Byron Williams stating that while the association doesn't agree with the creation of the special rate class, it believes the board had the authority to do so.  Court of Appeal judges Diana Cameron, Janice leMaistre and William Burnett reserved their decision for a later date.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-hydro-appeal-on-reserve-rate-class-1.5436953,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-hydro-rate-class-pub-electricity-court-1.4781082 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/manitoba-hydro-reserves-1.5130303,N/A
375,Anonymous,2020-01-24T16:11:09.909Z,Greta Thunberg brushes off mockery from U.S. finance chief ,"Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has brushed off criticism and mockery from the U.S. Treasury chief, saying Friday his comments have ""of course no effect"" on her and fellow campaigners. The 17-year-old's comments marked a final coda to the four-day World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, where a major theme was tension between environmental activists who want to protect the Earth and Trump administration officials and business titans who want to exploit its resources for jobs, profits and economic growth. Many of the 3,000-odd business leaders, government officials, UN representatives, civil society representatives and other elites on hand have found themselves somewhere along the spectrum between the positions staked out by U.S. President Donald Trump and Thunberg. The Swedish teen sat in on Trump's speech Tuesday to the forum, but that did little to bridge their ideological differences. On Friday, Thunberg, who has been battling the flu this week, apologized for her ""low energy"" — a term Trump has often used to mock rivals — as she spoke out again in favour of science and facts, and set off on yet another ""Fridays for Future"" march through snowy Davos streets. At a news conference before the march, she acknowledged young climate activists ""are being criticized all the time"" in comments like those from U.S. Treasury chief Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin had a day earlier dismissed Thunberg's suggestion that governments and companies cut back dramatically on fossil fuels with a condescending barb. ""Is she the chief economist? Who is she? I'm confused,"" he said. Then, following a brief pause, he said it was ""a joke."" ""After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us."" Thunberg insisted that her priority was drawing attention and action to concerns about global warming. ""We cannot care about those kinds of things,"" said the Swede, who was selected as Time's Person of the Year for 2019. ""The situation is not being treated like the crisis it is,"" she said alongside fellow activists Vanessa Nakate of Uganda, Loukina Tille of Switzerland, Luisa Neubauer of Germany, and Isabelle Axelsson of Sweden. Thunberg and her climate advocates have also faced criticism from some longstanding environmental advocates over their tactics, if not necessarily their ambitions. Famed primatologist Jane Goodall warned about ""gloom and doom"" messages that cause some young people to lose hope. ""It doesn't help when young people stand up and point fingers and blame people. That doesn't work. The only way it works is to tell stories and to get to people's hearts, and some of these young people I know have such amazing stories, and they really are changing the way people think,"" Goodall said in an interview Thursday. ""But not in an aggressive way."" A press handler for Thunberg said she wasn't available to respond to Goodall's comments. Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF, defended Thunberg as the ""biggest catalyst for change"" over the past year. ""You may argue at the way she says it — some people are a bit upset — but fundamentally you need to listen to young people, that we are stealing their futures and their opportunities,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/greta-thunberg-davos-climate-change-us-mockery-1.5438990,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-davos-investment-impeachment-1.5434306 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/autumn-peltier-thunberg-davos-1.5435091 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-conservative-leadership-1.5438454 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wto-dispute-alternative-friday-1.5438805,N/A
376,Anonymous,2020-01-23T21:46:30.419Z,"Province pursuing feds for financial assistance, working to help those who lost wages, says premier","Thursday marks seven days of a state of emergency that shut down St. John's, and while other surrounding communities have lifted their orders, officials are advising things won't be back to normal any time soon. People are still digging out of their homes amid the ongoing state of emergency in the capital following Friday's record-breaking blizzard, and some officials are beginning to estimate the cost of the disaster. St. John's is slowly coming back to life, with the city allowing business owners and community organizations to access their properties Friday at 6 a.m. to begin preparation for reopening Saturday morning, which is when the city expects to lift the state of emergency — though officials will still have to confirm that decision Friday evening. Businesses and community organizations are permitted to call in staff, have suppliers make deliveries and have any technical or supportive services completed that may be required to open. Businesses and organizations — other than ones covered by current exemptions — are still not permitted to open to customers or clients until the state of emergency is lifted.  Mount Pearl, Paradise and Torbay will have their states of emergency lifted completely on Friday. Premier Dwight Ball said Thursday afternoon that the province has asked the federal government for consideration for financial assistance stemming from the ongoing cleanup.  Ball anticipates the cost to municipalities to total in the millions. For those who have lost wages due to lost hours of work from being under various states of emergency, Ball said the province is checking with federal programs, such as employment insurance, to see what can be done. ""There's no requirement for an employer under the existing legislation to pay employees in this situation,"" Ball said. Small businesses have felt the squeeze from not being able to open their doors. Ball said discussions will need to be had once things return to normal regarding programs to help small-business owners, but for now the province's priority is low-income earners and people who have lost wages.  ""With any review we need to make sure the employers and the employees are part of those amendments or reassess what the appropriate legislation will look like,"" he said. ""Right now it's very difficult to know what the magnitude of the requirement will be."" Conception Bay South Mayor Terry French believes that town alone will need tens of millions of dollars to get back up to speed after storm surges pummelled the harbour. ""We have basically a new coastline. A new beach. Our beautiful trail system has been destroyed in many areas,"" French said. ""We have our storm sewers that have been torn up from the ground."" Bonavista took a similar beating. Mayor John Norman says extensive damage to the town's sea wall will require costly repairs. Numerous sections of the levee either failed or completely collapsed and disappeared into the ocean, Norman said, and pounding surf eroded land between the shoreline and oceanfront homes. ""Homes that used to be 30, 40 feet from the water, in some cases, their fence line is now five feet from the water,"" he said. The town is pressing the federal and provincial governments for emergency financial help. St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said he hasn't yet considered how much the storm will cost the capital city, since there are more pressing matters to deal with. ""Cost right now is not a concern. We need to get the snow moved,"" he said. Ball said communication between neighbouring communities has continued daily, and as some have been able to clean their streets quicker than others, it allowed for those resources to be redeployed to the capital city. But as for a regional state of emergency plan — instead of individual municipalities deciding on their own — Ball said it wouldn't be fair to those who can lift the emergency earlier.  ""It would be difficult to hold those communities back. I think everyone understands that,"" he said. ""If you want to make sure that you can actually do a better job the next time, the responsible thing to do is get everyone in the room again, do the debriefs, learn lessons. There's some areas where they've excelled at, and there's no question there's areas where we can potentially improve.""   The City of St. John's announced it's confident the state of emergency order, which was called midday last Friday, will end early Saturday morning. ""We felt it was important that residents have some time frame to work within, where they could have an expectation of when they could start getting out and around,"" Breen said early Thursday. Breen said the city chose a hard date to have an ""orderly transition"" back to normalcy, and to give people and businesses time to prepare. Until then, people continue to emerge from snowed-in houses, and the City of St. John's continues to lift restrictions on what can open. Doctors, dentists and vets are allowed to operate Thursday, and taxis can run as normal. Food stores, pharmacies and gas stations may open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Schools and government offices remain closed, but executive-level officials must report to work. Memorial University announced on Thursday that it will be extending its winter semester to make up for lost time. The semester will end on April 9 instead of the originally slated April 3. The student study break — between the end of classes and the beginning of exams — will be reduced to three days instead of four. There are no changes to the week-long winter break for students.  Eastern Health said it will be back to full services Monday. On Thursday, the health authority said it is still focusing on urgent and emergent services for Friday. Eastern Health said it will be contacting patients directly for rebooking appointments at the Health Sciences Centre, Janeway Children's Health and Rehabilitation, the Dr. H. Bliss Murphy Cancer Centre, St. Clare's Mercy Hospital, Waterford Hospital and Dr. L.A. Miller Centre. On Wednesday afternoon, Brig.-Gen. Roch Pelletier said the Canadian Armed Forces effort in Newfoundland is still receiving an influx of calls from people needing help getting out of their homes. The emergency operations centre has logged more than a thousand calls since opening earlier this week, according to the province. Provincial Municipal Affairs Minister Derrick Bragg said the direct line set up to reach military units has been bogged down by non-priority calls, such as people on vacation asking for their cars to be dug out, making it difficult for military members to reach people who are in need of priority assistance.  ""I'll give you an example: earlier this morning we went and we visited a gentleman 89 years old. He's ex-military, he's got a son with a disability, he was snowed in. He could not get out of his house,"" Bragg said Wednesday. Those in need of help can call 311, 709-754-2489 or 709-729-3703. For the hearing-impaired, text 709-691-9493. The province added another help line, run by the Canadian Red Cross, on Thursday due to the influx of requests. That number is 1-800-863-6582 and will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Army reserve units weren't the only ones landing from afar in order to help the region recover. Jim Roberts, a heavy equipment operator from Forteau, drove to St. John's from Labrador to help clear snow. Roberts and a colleague brought in a front-end loader and snowblower, driving about 1,000 kilometres to help widen streets. He lugged the equipment on a trailer to the ferry crossing. ""We didn't have any issue getting over,"" he said. ""I can see they can use the help.""  Roberts says he's looking at long days. ""We'll run as many hours as we can.""

377,John Paul Tasker,2020-01-24T09:00:00.783Z,"Canada's casinos 'threatened' by Liberal stance on sports betting, proponents warn","The Canadian gaming industry is losing billions of dollars in sports betting revenue to the black market each year due to federal prohibitions — and a recent legalization push in the U.S. could further threaten the viability of casinos in this country, proponents say. Casino boosters in Canada, including NDP MP Brian Masse, are hoping the recent legalization of single-event sports betting in U.S. border states like Michigan and New York will force the Liberal government to act now to save casino jobs — especially at places like Caesars Windsor and the Niagara Falls-based Fallsview, which depend on a steady stream of U.S. gamblers to stay afloat. A years-long effort to legalize single-event sports betting — betting on a single football game, for example — stalled when the federal Liberal government voted against legislation to allow this sort of gambling in Canada. Voting against the legislation in 2016, the government cited major sports leagues' claims that single-event betting might lead to match-fixing. But that opposition has been blunted since sports leagues, including the NBA and NHL, have partnered with U.S.-based casino operators like MGM Resorts to bolster sports betting stateside. Masse, who introduced a private member's bill to dismantle the prohibition, said the Liberal government should take up the issue when the House of Commons returns next week. The government only needs to drop one sentence from the Criminal Code to end the prohibition — a change Masse said could be made through legislation or an order-in-council from cabinet. ""We are in a lose-lose position right now. We would have been ahead of the curve if we had actually defined our own destiny, but instead U.S. courts, as expected, moved ahead and left us behind. The consequences for Canada are very high,"" Masse told CBC News. A recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturned decades-old federal limits on sports betting in states other than Nevada. The result has been a push by state lawmakers — notably in New Jersey, New York and Michigan — to legalize single-game bets at casinos, racetracks and online. Single-event legalization has unleashed a revenue boom for state coffers already; New Jersey casinos collected $4.5 billion in revenue last year alone. Sports bettors in Canada are limited to ""parlay"" bets — meaning they have to place bets on more than one game, and pick the winning team in each contest, to see any sort of windfall. The odds of a winning bet are low. Canadians gamble roughly $500 million a year in parlay bets through lottery games like Pro-Line. ""Capital investments in Canada are being delayed, jobs are being lost, customers are going to be lost for the long-term. We inherit all the problems of sports gambling, but we don't get any of the benefits or the supports to deal with the situation,"" Masse said. Canada's gaming industry employs about 180,000 people — many more than the automotive manufacturing sector. Masse said Windsor-area Liberal candidates in the last election promised voters a re-elected Trudeau government would do away with the Criminal Code prohibition to help those casinos compete, but the Prime Minister's Office has since shied away from the issue. In a statement, Justice Minister David Lametti's spokesperson said gambling reforms are simply not ""immediate priorities.""  ""Minister Lametti was honoured to receive his mandate letter in December, which outlines the immediate priorities he has been tasked with. Reforms to gambling laws are not included as part of these immediate priorities,"" Rachel Rappaport said. ""Our government is aware of the recent changes to the legal frameworks for legalized gambling in the United States, which have produced consequences on both sides of the border. We continue to monitor the situation, as well as meet with and hear from individuals and groups that have been affected."" Masse said the government's stance betrays the voters in places like Windsor and Niagara Falls who trusted the Liberals when they said they'd take action. ""It's very much a paternalistic approach by the federal government, denying Ontario, Quebec and B.C. and others. The message is basically, 'Canadians can go to the internet or the black market, instead of a regulated, open market where provinces can make their own decisions,'"" Masse said. ""It's a bizarre position and I'm quite shocked that they've been able to skate on this so long."" An estimated $14 billion in annual sports betting — $10 billion through the black market through bookies and $4 billion more through off-shore online outlets, according to figures from the Canadian Gaming Association — is wagered by Canadians through illegal channels, beyond the regulatory control of the government. The biggest draw of these other outlets is the fact that they allow bettors to gamble on just one game. Paul Burns is the president and CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association, the lobby group that represents casino interests. Burns said the Liberal government should simply adopt the approach it took to the legalization of cannabis. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau proposed changes to drug laws as a way to take profits out of the hands of criminals and legitimize a practice dominated by illegal sellers. Burns said the same standard should apply to sports betting. ""This would take money out of the hands of bad guys and give real benefit to the hundreds of gaming communities across the country,"" Burns said. ""'This issue isn't going away. It's getting worse. We're saying to the federal government, 'Don't put us in a position where we have one arm tied behind our backs.' These are great, good-paying jobs and they're threatened. And yet, there's a very simple solution."" Federal and provincial governments don't get a cut of revenues from gaming through these illegal channels. For the province of Ontario, for example, that means an estimated $400 million a year in lost profit, said Jim Lawson, head of Woodbine Entertainment, the group that runs the main horse racetrack in Toronto. ""So much money is moving offshore and offshore now includes sports wagering in the U.S. We're really starting to feel the pressure — it's having a dramatic impact,"" Lawson told CBC News. ""There's a huge revenue miss at a time when government is trying to keep up with health care and education costs. And when I say a revenue miss, we're in the hundreds of millions of dollars range."" Lawson said Woodbine Entertainment employs 15,000 people in Ontario directly or indirectly, but the horse racing industry is facing ""extreme challenges"" due to demographic shifts and robust competition from the U.S. He said flowing some of the sports betting through racetracks and off-track betting shops would help stabilize an industry crucial to rural communities. ""We should be allowed to participate rather than it all going into foreign pockets and for-profit offshore operators,"" Lawson said, adding that leaving horse tracks out of the equation would ""decimate"" racing.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tasker-single-event-sports-betting-1.5437725,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/horse-racing-single-sports-betting-mp-windsor-1.5331851 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/single-sports-betting-quashed-1.3773417 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/nhl-s-vegas-expansion-hypocrisy-says-mp-chasing-single-event-betting-1.3649179,N/A
378,Doug Ferguson,2020-01-24T02:01:34.944Z,Tiger Woods keeps momentum in 1st round of Farmers Insurance Open to start new year,"Tiger Woods had his lowest opening round of the year since 2011. It wasn't enough to be among the leaders Thursday at the Farmers Insurance Open, but it was fine with him. Coming off his record-tying 82nd victory in his last PGA Tour start three months ago in Japan, Woods handled the par 5s on the easier North Course at Torrey Pines and limited mistakes for a 3-under 69. Sebastian Cappelen and Keegan Bradley had the low scores of the opening round, which was not the same as sharing the lead. Cappelen had eight birdies for a 66 on the South Course, which played about three shots tougher than the North, where Bradley shot his 66. Rory McIlroy, who played in the group in front of Woods, was among those at 67. Jon Rahm, playing alongside Woods, was in the large group at 68. Woods hasn't broken 70 in his first round of the year since a 69 on the North at Torrey in 2011. His health, his game and even his momentum are in much better shape now. His game wasn't all that far off. ""It was nice to kind of keep the round going a little bit,"" Woods said. ""Overall, pleased to shoot something in the 60s today."" It took a little time to get going. He left himself in a bad shot right of the green on the par-5 10th to start his round and failed to make birdie. His flop shot from 50 yards short of the green on the next hole came up short and into a bunker, leading to a bogey. He was even par at the turn on a course where lower scores are expected. Even so, there was little drama. The best views were of the still waters of the Pacific below on a magnificent day. The biggest roars, as usual, belonged to the Navy jets above. Woods kept it simple, with a nifty wedge to short range on his 10th hole, a two-putt birdie from 18 feet on the par-5 fifth and an easy up-and-down for birdie on the final hole. ""I could probably, maybe could have gotten one or two more out of my round today,"" Woods said. ""But overall, I felt like it was a good start, especially going into the South Course. I don't know what the guys did on the South Course in relation to the North, but I felt like the golf course was certainly gettable today."" Bubba Watson had a 67 on the South, while three other players broke 70 on the South, which hosted the U.S. Open in 2008 and gets another U.S. Open next year. Woods has won this event seven times, not including his 2008 U.S. Open title or the Junior World when he was a teenager. At stake this week is a chance to set the PGA Tour career victories record with No. 83 on the first course where his father took him to watch a PGA Tour event. Rahm, who got married in Spain before Christmas and has another wedding in San Diego next month for his bride's American family and friends, was 4 under through eight holes until he stalled. Along for the ride was Collin Morikawa, who wasn't even born when Woods made his pro debut. The 22-year-old Morikawa shot 70. ""I had to tell myself to just focus on golf after that first hole because I could just focus on Tiger and watch him the entire day and realize I forgot how to play golf,"" Morikawa said. ""And that's what I'm out here to do, I'm out here to win. It's really cool to play with him finally and to get a round in with him because crowds are different. ""There's just nothing like it. You can't describe it."" McIlroy, who has never won in his first event of the year, can return to No. 1 in the world for the first time in more than four years by winning. He also handled the par 5s by making birdie on all of them, along with adding three birdies. McIlroy has a new driver in play, which didn't feel right to him during the pro-am. He spent Wednesday afternoon making some adjustments and seemed to be on track. ""It's funny, you go through that testing process at the start of the year with new equipment. There's things that seem really good on the range, but once you actually play some rounds with them competitively and try to hit certain shots, things sort of appear,"" McIlroy said. ""We seemed to have fixed it."" Cappelen, a rookie from Denmark, was doing his own thing away from the crowd, narrowly dodging the fog that rolled in late in the afternoon, and he was doing it well. ""I never really put me in a terrible spot where I couldn't make par,"" he said. Canadian golfer Graham DeLaet withdrew from the tournament with another back injury. DeLaet returned to the tour in October after a nearly two-year absence following a second back surgery. The native of Weyburn, Sask., turned 38 on Wednesday. The Canadian has played five tournaments since his return from a back problem, missing the cut in three events and posting a top finish of a tie for 58th. DeLaet finished a career-best eighth in the FedEx Cup standings in 2013, a year in which he landed a spot on the international team in the Presidents Cup. DeLaet is playing on a major medical exemption this year. He hasn't won on the PGA Tour and has three career second-place finishes. The highest-scoring Canadian Michael Gligic finished his first round at -1, tied for 50th.",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/pga-farmers-insurance-open-graham-delaet-1.5437769,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/tiger-woods-season-preview-column-golf-1.5435559 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/golf/golf-canada-richard-t-lee-british-open-spot-1.5433441,N/A

Parasite, the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26-year-history of the SAG awards. Parasite lead actor Song Kang Ho said winning on Sunday made him think that ""maybe we haven't created such a bad movie. ""I am so honoured to receive this award. I will never forget such a beautiful night,"" he said through an interpreter. Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies The Irishman and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, which both have A-list stars. The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors  form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in Joker has swept awards season. ""I am standing on the shoulders of my favourite actor — Heath Ledger,"" Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor  who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the  comic book villain. Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic Judy. Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role  as a charming stunt man in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama Marriage Story. ""It was a difficult part,"" quipped Pitt of his role. ""A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,"" he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob. Sexual harassment drama Bombshell went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed. Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangster movie The Irishman had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci. Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on  Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG. Those left out include immersive World War One film 1917,  the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as  well as Joker, Marriage Story, and novel adaptation Little  Women. De Niro, whose lead performance in The Irishman has been  snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech  to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump. In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her  role as a TV anchor in The Morning Show, bringing the second  award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming  service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week. Comedy The Marvelous Mrs Maisel and British royal drama The Crown took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But Mrs Maisel actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should  have gone to quirky British comedy Fleabag. Moments earlier, Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a  year of multiple awards for her and the show.

380,Ariel Fournier,2020-01-23T17:32:00.563Z,"For this Alberta woman, the good news was she had contracted a rare, deadly parasite","Cassidy Armstrong went in for surgery last fall to remove what doctors thought was a tumour on her liver. She had been diagnosed with a suspected rare cancer that, even with the surgery, would probably have left her with only a few years to live. Instead, doctors found something even rarer: a grapefruit-sized mass caused by the eggs of a tapeworm.  Armstrong was still recovering in a Calgary hospital in November when doctors told her she likely had a parasite called Echinococcus multilocularis, previously confirmed in fewer than 20 Canadians, almost all of them in Alberta. ""I was still a little doped up on painkillers,"" she said. ""So I said, 'Is that a good thing?' And they said, 'It's definitely better.'"" It was certainly an improvement on the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma, a rare form of liver cancer that typically attacks otherwise healthy patients under the age of 40. It wasn't until a pathologist analyzed the mass that the parasite was discovered.  But it's still a dangerous infection — without surgery, she would have died.  The parasite lives as a tapeworm in coyotes, foxes and, increasingly, domestic dogs. The tapeworm's eggs are spread to other animals, such as rodents, from the feces of infected animals.  When a person accidentally swallows the microscopic eggs, the infection can lead to cyst-like lesions on the liver. But it will only cause minimal symptoms until the growths reach a significant size.  The tapeworm had likely been growing inside Armstrong, 36, for more than a decade.  ""It was almost a Christmas miracle,"" she said. ""It could have been a lot worse."" Armstrong had worked physically demanding jobs — she'd been a motorcycle mechanic in Edmonton before moving to Banff last year to work as a stage carpenter — and was in good health, though occasionally noticed she was fatigued. About two years ago, she felt tenderness in her ribs. X-rays didn't find anything, she said, and eventually the pain subsided.  While in Banff, the pain in her side returned and became almost constant. It was accompanied by a new pain in her shoulder.   She worried she had gallstones and insisted on an ultrasound. That's when the mass was discovered, she said, leading to the cancer diagnosis and grim news that surgery wouldn't guarantee her more than a few more years. ""I would have lived maybe another two to five years. There were a lot of things going through my mind,"" she said. ""Mainly, what's the point?"" Her cancer surgery was the equivalent of an open-heart operation. Surgeons removed her gallbladder, 65 per cent of her liver and cut several nodes off her lungs, in addition to scraping the cyst off her diaphragm. She has a 14-inch, L-shaped scar on her chest that is still not completely closed, two months after surgery.  Armstrong's parasitic clump is one of the largest physicians have seen in Alberta. And they've seen a few. ""We're definitely the hot spot,"" said Dr. Stan Houston, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta.  To date, there have been 15 cases of Echinococcus multilocularis in Alberta. When Armstrong's case is scientifically confirmed, she will be number 16, he said.  It's believed the strain has been arriving in Canada in dogs brought over from Europe and in foxes imported decades ago for hunting.  It has existed in Europe for around 150 years. There are about 1,800 human cases every year,  the majority of which are found in China and Tibet. A 2012 study found that the parasite was well-established in Alberta's wild animal population, with about one-quarter of the province's coyote population infected with the tapeworm. The first Canadian human case was diagnosed in 2013. ""[Before the last decade] we never had people with this disease in all of North America,"" Houston said. ""In the last six years, we've had 15 definitely proven cases, just in Alberta."" Since 2014, Canadian researchers have warned that the parasite could easily be misdiagnosed by physicians as another liver disease or ailment. ""About half our cases were found by accident,"" Houston said. In those cases, imaging revealed an abnormal growth in the liver.  There's no guaranteed cure for Echinococcus multilocularis. Infected patients must take a parasite medication for the rest of their lives to prevent the tapeworm eggs from causing further growths.  A drug called albendazole, normally used to treat other tropical parasites, can act as a preventive treatment. While it is widely available in Africa, Europe and Asia, the drug company hasn't applied to Health Canada to access the Canadian market.  Houston said he applies for special access to the drug every six months on behalf of his patients.  A spokesperson for Health Canada said there are clinical trials in Canada that may lead to approval in the future.  Armstrong doesn't know how she was infected, but suspects it could have come from her work fixing farm equipment or from produce purchased at farmer's markets. Houston said most patients in Alberta were dog owners, but Armstrong hasn't had pets since she was a kid. Houston's main advice for prevention is meticulous hand-washing, particularly if you have dogs at home. Regularly de-worming your dog can be helpful as well.  ""We're hoping to learn more about the ecology of this disease in Alberta so we can give more precise advice,"" he said.  After Armstrong's cancer diagnosis, she went on sick leave and moved back to Edmonton to be close to family during her recovery. She is still struggling with pain as her incisions heal. Armstrong may never know how she got sick, but she believes it is important to raise awareness about the disease. ""It's a scary thing and there's still so much we don't know,"" she said. ""I would like to see more funding for research so more people don't have to go through what I went through.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/parasite-cassidy-armstrong-tapeworm-alberta-1.5436828,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.5166570/brain-surgeons-went-looking-for-a-tumour-but-found-a-tapeworm-instead-1.5166571 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tapeworm-echinococcus-multilocularis-alberta-klein-calgary-veterinarian-disease-coyotes-dogs-1.5224864,N/A
381,Amina Zafar,2020-01-24T10:00:15.274Z,'Just incredible:' Mass quarantines take China into uncharted territory,"China's move to lock down 10 cities to control the spread of a new coronavirus is unprecedented in modern history and its effectiveness is hard to predict, public health experts say. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, the train station and airport were shut down on Thursday, while ferry, subway and bus service ground to a halt. Trying to contain a city of 11 million people is ""new to science,"" said Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in China. ""We cannot at this stage say it will or it will not work.""  Similar measures were announced in other cities, all in central China's Hubei province. Mass gatherings were forbidden just as hundreds of millions of people prepared to travel and celebrate the Lunar New Year. ""That's just incredible,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician at Toronto General Hospital. ""The equivalent would be shutting down transportation to a comparable sized city like London, United Kingdom on Dec. 23."" But its effectiveness depends in part on how many ""chains of transmission"" have occurred.  Like branches of a tree trunk, each chain of infection represents one person infecting someone else. Many chains of infection usually means more people are infected and an outbreak is widespread, he said. If there have already been secondary chains outside Wuhan, then shutting down the transportation might slow the spread of the virus, but not stop it in its tracks. Bioethicist Kerry Bowman of the University of Toronto says quarantines can be effective in the early stages of an outbreak.  The rub is, in this case, the quarantine pits individual freedoms against an entire city's. ""This may be acceptable to people if it's short term,"" Bowman said. For China, the question becomes who does the quarantine serve, says Ann Carmichael, a professor emerita of history at Indiana University who studies quarantines during the 17th century outbreaks of plague in Europe.  Back then, she says, people would be killed for the tiniest infraction of public health laws, like not burning clothing as ordered. The word ""quarantine"" comes from the Italian quaranta giorni (""40 days""), which referred to a period of isolation placed on ships and people in a bid to control the Black Death.  These days, says Carmichael, ""I think what the Chinese government is always thinking about is — when does panic make it worse, and what is a measured response?"" she said. Panic is a possible side-effect of a quarantine, says Dr. Tom Solomon, who heads the U.K.'s Health Protection Research Unit on emerging infections. He says stopping all public transport from a city can be counterproductive. ""It can increase the level of panic and just cause people to flee by other means,"" Solomon wrote in a recent commentary.  It can also send people into hiding. Solomon gave the example of the village of Eyam in north England where, in the Middle Ages, residents built a wall during an outbreak of plague and didn't leave until it ended. Back then, outbreaks of plague, cholera and yellow fever provided a reason for one country to interfere in another's affairs. It wasn't until the 19th century that countries began to co-operate more officially on global health problems.  And today, says Carmichael, the world needs answers to questions — like whether this new coronavirus is poised to cause a pandemic, like the 1918 influenza.  More recent infections prompted a range of responses. During HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization did not get involved in quarantines or border restrictions, Carmichael said. During the SARS outbreak in Ontario, hospitals and long-term care homes practised a form of quarantine — with daily temperature checks for staff and a ban on visitors. In contrast, after SARS, Canada helped to revise International Health Regulations to avoid unnecessary restrictions on travel and trade. Carmichael said part of the history and practice of quarantine is ""keeping in"" — detention, confinement and isolation. The other is ""keeping out"" — border security, masks on persons and aggressive hand washing. Health officials in Canada and the U.S. continue to emphasize hand hygiene.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/quarantine-coronavirus-1.5438652,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/novel-coronavirus-symptoms-1.5438137 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/new-coronavirus-interactive-map-1.5438155,N/A

Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM), an arm of the consortium that constructed the 12.5-kilometre light rail system, has promised to hire outside experts to identify improvements, commissioners heard at a hastily-called meeting. According to the city's transportation GM, John Manconi, RTM has agreed to hire British firm JBA Corp., experts in rail operations. Manconi said RTM has agreed to implement any recommendations that JBA puts forward. ""This is a major important step forward,"" Manconi said. ""We will see significant service improvements over time. Do we have that timeline? No. I know you're going to ask us that. We do not."" OC Transpo said it will run supplementary buses to offset a shortage of trains on the Confederation Line until the end of next week. The special buses travel between Hurdman or Tunney's Pasture stations and downtown. Thursday's meeting was kicked off by city manager Steve Kanellakos defending embattled OC Transpo boss Manconi. ""Mr. Manconi and his team aren't going anywhere,"" Kanellakos told the commission. ""I dread where we'd be if we didn't have John and his team."" Kanellakos was addressing comments by citizen transit commissioner Leah Williams, who called for Manconi's resignation amid mounting problems that have led to train shortages and system-wide shutdowns. ""I can't say that I feel that strongly that Mr. Manconi is the right person to be leading OC Transpo at this time,"" Williams told CBC on Wednesday. The following day, Kanellakos leapt to Manconi's defence. ""Mr. Manconi could not have done anything more or done anything less than what I've required him to do,"" Kanellakos said. ""I don't blame the house owner when the kitchen is late during the renovation."" At the start of Thursday's meeting, called earlier this week, Coun. Allan Hubley, who chairs the commission, warned members to stick to questions arising directly from the LRT update, and to refrain from raising other subject such as Manconi's resignation or the city's contract with Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM). Kanellakos proved to be an exception from that rule, however. He called Manconi and his team ""remarkable individuals"" who are working hard to provide the most reliable service possible under stressful circumstances. ""No one could anticipate that we would have so many issues so soon, that we would throw our plan into the wastebasket,"" said Kanell​​​​akos. ""They are pulling out miracles out there."" The city manager said if council wants to hold any senior manager accountable, it should be him. ""If you take out the leadership, you take out me,"" Kanellakos said.

384,Catherine Cullen,2020-01-23T09:00:00.573Z,Online government survey on medical aid in dying sees record-breaking response,"The federal government has been flooded with messages from Canadians who want to weigh in on medical aid in dying. As of Wednesday evening, 229,281 Canadians had responded to the government's survey, which has been online for just a week and a half. It's an enormous figure — the largest number of responses the Department of Justice has ever seen for any public consultation. Even hot topics like cannabis and prostitution only netted about 30,000 responses each. CBC News asked Justice Canada whether it was aware of any organized campaign that might be pushing the numbers up. ""We will continue to monitor for any potential evidence of abuse, but to date no major issues have been identified,"" said a ministry spokesperson. One factor that could be driving the numbers is experience: more Canadians may now know someone who obtained a legal doctor-assisted death, said Susan Desjardins of the advocacy group Dying with Dignity. ""I believe that people want to have this choice,"" she said. In her own volunteer work with the group, Desjardins said, she's seen an increase in the number of requests for information about assisted dying. Her group is encouraging its members to participate in the online consultations. ""I would say there aren't very many people who want to die, but they want to die well and they want to die as much as possible on their terms,"" said Desjardins. The federal government said more than 6,700 Canadians have obtained medically-assisted deaths — but that figure only covers the period up to November 2018.  CBC News has requested newer numbers. Leaders in the Catholic Church also have been urging their members to weigh in. The Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops provides a link to the survey on its website. ""We weren't necessarily directing them or telling them how to fill it out,"" said Calgary Bishop William McGrattan. ""But [we're] giving them the proper understanding and context and knowledge so they might express their views with their faith in mind."" Bishop McGrattan said he worries that any expansion of access to medical aid in dying would affect the vulnerable, such as those with dementia or mental illnesses. He said he's also concerned about the tight timeline for public consultations. The survey will close on Jan. 27 at 11:59 PM PST. ""A two-week consultation I don't think gives it the importance that it should,"" he said, adding that a deeper discussion is needed before the law can be changed. The federal government is doing more than just the online survey.  Cabinet ministers have been holding closed-door roundtable meetings across the country on the topic as well. Officials are working quickly to meet a court-imposed timeline. A Quebec judge struck down a portion of the federal law in the fall. The portion of the law requiring that a patient's death be ""reasonably foreseeable"" to qualify for medical assistance will be suspended as of March 11. Justice Minister David Lametti has said he hopes to put forward new legislation next month. In 2016, a poll by the Angus Reid Institute found that 73 per cent of respondents believed it should be easier for Canadians to make their own end-of-life decisions. New data seen by CBC News that will be released by Angus Reid later this week shows that number has risen. It shows a ""hardening"" of opinion on the issue, said the polling firm's executive director Shachi Kurl. ""When you see consensus that is that strong on an issue, you know people are passionately engaged on it. They're paying attention. And in many cases, it's going to be something that has touched their [lives],"" said Kurl. Lametti has said Canadians' views on medically assisted death have evolved since the legislation was passed in 2016. Not everyone agrees. Grace Pastine of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, which advocates for fewer restrictions on medically assisted death, said that Canadian politicians are simply waking up to what the public already believed. ""The federal government has, in some ways, caught up to where the Canadian public is, and really where the courts have been for years now,"" said Pastine. She describes the current laws as providing ""layers and layers of safeguards"" on the procedure. People with diseases such as Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis and Huntington's have a right to a doctor's help to die, she argued, and the new legislation should reflect that. Larry Worthen, executive director of the Christian Medical and Dental Association of Canada, staunchly opposes the 2016 legislation. He said he fears some will choose a medically assisted death because they worry about being a burden to their loved ones, or because they feel lonely or isolated. ""We have to as Canadians come to grips with the fact that once we've opened Pandora's box in this way, there are going to be some unintentional repercussions,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/medical-assistance-dying-survey-response-1.5434832,[],N/A
385,Anonymous,2020-01-23T11:31:37.196Z,"Windsor partnership with Amazon Ring doorbell could do more harm than good, experts say","Privacy experts, including a University of Windsor law professor, say they're concerned about the possibility of Windsor establishing a partnership with U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon and its Ring surveillance doorbell subsidiary.  Amazon's Ring is a video-enabled smart doorbell that allows users to see in real-time anyone who comes to their doorstep. The technology also contains a microphone and speaker that allows users to communicate with anyone on the other side of the door.  When combined with the Neighbors app, Ring doorbells allow users to share video footage with anyone else in their community, while also allowing users to start conversations about what's going on in their neighbourhoods.  Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens previously said that he looked into Ring products as a law enforcement tool, calling them a ""very effective, very smart tool."" He added that should Windsor pursue Ring surveillance, the Rose City would be the first Canadian city to utilize the system.  University of Windsor Faculty of Law assistant professor Kristen Thomasen, however, believes Ring ""raises a number of issues about surveillance in the community."" ""Some of the big concerns are that it's going to increase the amount of surveillance of public spaces,"" she said.  And while Ring products are marketed as providing an additional layer of safety for neighbourhoods and communities, Amazon in the U.S. has also partnered with more than 400 law enforcement agencies to distribute Ring systems as a means of improving community safety.  ""There's an important conversation to be had around whether we want to introduce this kind of surveillance network that also is corporate,"" said Thomasen.  She added that having neighbours or community members easily share security camera footage can also have troubling implications if combined with implicit biases about who is considered suspicious.  ""On top of all of that, the video footage that is recorded by Ring can then be shared with the police,"" she said. ""So this might lead to increasing policing over issues that would be non-issues if there wasn't video footage."" Thomasen also expressed concerns about the fact that Amazon currently develops facial recognition technology.  ""Is this footage going to be used for targeted advertising for tracking people? How is Amazon going to make use of this evidence?"" she said.  Chris Gilliard, an English professor and privacy scholar at Macomb Community College in Michigan, said products like Ring security cameras ""produce sort of a heightened sense of anxiety about people you don't think should be in your community."" ""In many instances of people having these cameras or participating in neighbourhood watch apps … a lot of the incidents that are reported are of people in a community reporting people that they see who they don't think belong in their community,"" he said. ""I don't think it's accidental that oftentimes, these are black and brown folks."" Gilliard said ""I don't think more cameras mean more safety.""

South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. has invested in a medical office in its community centre and is offering a doctor who wants to set up there a year's free rent and all the medical equipment in the centre for free. It's also been advertising independently to recruit a doctor, and that has run it afoul of Health PEI policy. ""Health PEI directed us not to use the word Crapaud. They wanted to do their own advertising and they have the position advertised as all of Queens west, which would include Charlottetown,"" said Lisa Gallant, secretary for South Shore Health and Wellness Inc. ""That concerned us because we don't want to see medical services being moved out of our rural area into an urban center."" In an emailed statement to CBC News, Health PEI said it is its policy not to advertise for individual communities. ""We advertise physician positions based on network or county,"" the statement said. The agency said it has been working with Crapaud to find a doctor, and intends to continue to do so.

388,Fred Youngs,2019-12-21T11:00:00.737Z,Amateur hour LRT announcement shows Tories can't get past blaming Liberals,"This column is an opinion piece by former CBC journalist Fred Youngs. Youngs was a reporter, producer, executive producer and senior manager for CBC News in Winnipeg, Calgary and Toronto and covered politics at newspapers in Ontario and Manitoba. A Hamiltonian by birth, he was the senior project manager for the development of CBC Hamilton.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. If there is a checklist for how to bungle a sensitive and fractious political announcement, Caroline Mulroney's appearance - or non-appearance - in Hamilton this week would tick most of the boxes. Indeed, it might just tick all of them. In just a few hours the minister of transportation for Ontario kiboshed a long-planned light rapid transit project for Hamilton, and blamed ballooning costs on the previous government, but didn't give any details around how or why they rose. On top of that she ducked out of a planned media briefing, and left town, for some reason, with a police escort.  Predictably, this amateur hour approach to political announcements has reignited the long-running debate over the LRT in Hamilton. Opponents are delighted; its proponents dismayed. City councillors — who were and still are pretty much in the dark — are left trying to figure out what to do with the $1 billion Mulroney left on the table for unspecified transit projects in Hamilton. They will have to hurry. Mulroney wants a plan by February — which doesn't leave a lot of time to figure out how to spend a lot of money. All this has served to underline that even though they have been in power for 18 months, the Ford government is still making things up as it goes along. And when it runs into turbulence as it did this week in Hamilton, its favourite response is to pivot quickly to blaming the former Liberal government for its troubles. It was Premier Doug Ford who came up with a plan for a new subway line for Toronto, along with $11.2 billion in funding to build it. It, too, came out of the blue to the city and its citizens, and upended planning and work that had already cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  For her part, Mulroney undid $165 million in work and preparation for the Hamilton line. About half of that sum was used to purchase property along the proposed LRT line — property the province now owns. All of which must make city officials in Mississauga, Ottawa and other Ontario municipalities, where transit projects are or will be in the works, just a tad nervous. Who knows what comes next if the province decides to draw up its own transit plan for one city, and unilaterally decides to kill a project in another?  That explains why Mulroney decided that the real culprit here is the previous Liberal regime.  The Wynne government, Mulroney said in a statement, had not been ""upfront"" about the cost for building and running the LRT. It was really $5.5 billion, according to her. Although Mulroney has yet to reveal the figures and details to show how the PC government came to that conclusion.  ""We cannot afford to continue the Liberals' approach of making empty promises today and accumulating a massive legacy of debt for our children and grandchildren,"" she said. Slagging the Liberals for ""empty promises"" on the LRT is a bit tricky, given that Ford declared a little over a year ago that if Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger ""wants an LRT, he'll get an LRT."" That was then, it seems, and this is now. Voters decided more than 560 days ago that they had had enough of Wynne and her party. The Liberal party is now just a beleaguered rump, huddled in a corner at Queen's Park trying to figure out how to claw its way out of a hole. The Liberals may have started this project, but the responsibility for it now lies with the PCs. Voters in Hamilton and across Ontario deserve a better explanation of how and why the cost skyrocketed, how the province plans to deal with all the property it owns in Hamilton, and what comes next for transit in Hamilton, and in other cities.  What they don't need is yet another helping of partisanship, finger-pointing and blaming someone else.  For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/amateur-hour-lrt-announcement-shows-tories-can-t-get-past-blaming-liberals-1.5403214,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/hamilton-lrt-cancelled-1.5397519 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/lrt-costs-1.5401095 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/liuna-lrt-1.5402413,N/A

""I think LGBTQ is a Liberal term. I don't talk about people that way,"" the former Conservative staffer told CTV's Power Play Wednesday night. ""Do you think that's a choice or do you think it's biological?"" asked host Evan Solomon.  ""I think it's a choice,"" responded Décarie. ""How people are behaving, it's one thing. I think government has [the] responsibility to encourage the traditional value that we have had for the past years."" I vehemently reject this message. I will not serve under someone whose leadership pitch is that someone's sexuality is something to be ""fixed"". I am full on tired of this type of shit defining the conservative movement in Canada. Giddyup, you're going to have to go through me. <a href=""https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc"">https://t.co/mHvlGfFWQc</a> A number of Conservatives who are expected to run for the leadership were quick to distance themselves — and the party — from Décarie's stance. The Conservative Party voted to end its official opposition to gay marriage in 2016, more than a decade after it was legalized. ""Being gay is not a choice and nobody should be running for office on a platform to roll back hard-won rights,"" tweeted former cabinet minister Peter MacKay after a clip of the interview began racking up thousands of views online.  Erin O'Toole, another former cabinet minister who is musing a bid, called Décarie's statement ""ridiculous,"" and Sarnia MP Marilyn Gladu, who like MacKay has publicly signalled a leadership run, said it was ""unacceptable."" Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre, who had been expected to make a run for the top job until today, said Décarie does not speak for Conservatives. ""Being gay is not a choice. Being ignorant is,"" he tweeted.  In a followup interview with CBC on Thursday, Décarie apologized for offending people and said he didn't understand the visceral reaction to his comments. ""I was told that I was offensive, and if I've been offensive in the eye of some people I'm sorry about that,"" said the the former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper. ""Those who are very liberal should be joining Mr. Trudeau."" Décarie said that, if he's elected prime minister, he'd work to ""clarify"" same-sex marriage in Canada. ""I think it's important that marriage should be exclusive to men and women and all other unions are civil unions,"" he said. Décarie said that while he's received a lot of backlash over the past day, a number of social conservatives have reached out in support. ""There are many social conservatives in our party and many Canadians want [a] true conservative voice to speak and stand up for them. So I feel I am their voice and we'll see who will be elected,"" he said. ""The so-cons are mobilized and they feel that I could be representing them."" It remains to be seen how much sway the social conservative wing will have on picking a leader to replace Andrew Scheer, who had his own socially conservative leanings. Both Décarie and Ontario MP Derek Sloan, who announced his intentions to run on Wednesday, are pitching themselves to the social conservatives in the party. In the 2017 leadership race, with the help of groups like Campaign Life Coalition, former MP Brad Trost came in fourth place in a field of 14 candidates.

392,Michael Gorman,2020-01-23T13:18:23.983Z,N.S. remains committed to Lahey Report as province's forestry industry is in limbo,"Nova Scotia's forestry minister says he remains committed to implementing the Lahey Report on forestry practices, even as the industry is in the midst of significant challenges. Iain Rankin had previously said he hoped a new forest management guide, a key part of the report by University of King's College president Bill Lahey, would be ready by the end of last December. But that process was delayed when it was announced Northern Pulp would be shutting down its Pictou County, N.S., operation after failing to secure approval to build a new effluent treatment facility. On Thursday, the company announced in a news release it had begun issuing lay-off notices to 90 non-union salaried employees at the pulp mill. The earliest layoffs will take effect on Jan. 31. Rankin said he expects the advisory committee working on the new guide to meet by the end of February. He said he wanted to give the industry time to focus right now on the necessary transition efforts as a result of the pending closure at Northern Pulp. ""We wanted to put a high priority on that, making sure people were taken care of working in the forestry industry, but we are absolutely committed to adopting the Lahey Report and ecological forestry,"" he said. The minister said he remains optimistic the new guide can be completed early this year. Work on other aspects of the report's recommendations, which call for a more ecological approach to forestry and a reduction in clear cutting on Crown land, remains on track, said Rankin. ""I know a lot of people are waiting for the guide, but in fairness to industry, there has been some significant change in their lives,"" he said. ""I still believe that we can have significant progress by the end of this fiscal year when we'll be evaluated [by Lahey on our progress on achieving the recommendations]."" Rankin is also keeping tabs on efforts to transition an industry that's about to lose its most important player. Part of that process is finding new markets for low-grade wood chips and finding them soon, as rumours swirl about the viability of some sawmills in the province. The minister said time is the biggest challenge right now. Port Hawkesbury Paper has agreed to take more chips and Rankin said Nova Scotia Power could also take more for biomass energy. Still, finding a home for the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chips Northern Pulp used to purchase each year won't be easy. Although some industry members are pushing for an expanded use of chips at Brooklyn Energy near Liverpool, Rankin said there are a variety of considerations for such a move. ""We want to make sure that we're doing what's right for [power] ratepayers, what's right for the environment, what's right for all involved, but specific to that piece, that's owned by Nova Scotia Power and they'll make that determination,"" he said. Access to fibre is also an important consideration for sawmills and Rankin said he's heard from some outfits that want access to some of Northern Pulp's Crown land allocations once the company stops operating. ""I think quite rightly they're looking out to make sure that they have at least the amount of fibre allocation that they had through the Northern Pulp licensing,"" he said. ""So we're considering all options when it comes to the sawmills that had those exchange agreements in the central region."" As efforts continue to try to cushion the blow of Northern Pulp's closure to the industry, Rankin promised ""a number of initiatives"" that would be announced soon to help people in the industry and ensure that a workforce remains in the province for whenever new options and opportunities become available.

393,Shawn Jeffords,2020-01-21T23:57:56.001Z,"Public health restructuring should be negotiated, not forced, report states","Any merger of health units must be negotiated and not forced, public health officials in Peterborough, Ont., said Tuesday as they urged Premier Doug Ford's government to let communities drive service amalgamations. The recommendation is one of a series included in a discussion paper released Tuesday by the city's board of health at a rural municipalities' conference in Toronto. The board chairman of Peterborough Public Health said the agency wrote the report as the province conducts consultations on its plan to reduce the number of provincial health units from 34. ""As they try to determine the right number, that needs to come through conversation,"" Andy Mitchell said. ""It needs to come from the bottom up, from the communities."" Premier Doug Ford's government announced in the 2019 budget that it planned to begin a sweeping merger of public health units by 2020-2021, saying at the time it would strengthen the system. The government said it had conducted a review of the province's public health units and believed their structure did not allow for consistent service delivery. Ontario's public health units co-ordinate services including vaccination programs, infectious disease outbreak investigations, and restaurant inspections. The consolidation would mean that health units would serve larger geographic regions, which include communities with different needs. But Health Minister Christine Elliott appointed special adviser Jim Pine last fall to conduct consultations with municipalities who had warned that the amalgamation, coupled with changes to public health cost-sharing with the province, could jeopardize services and result in frontline staff layoffs. A spokeswoman for Elliott said Tuesday that consultations continue but the government intends to move forward with its plan to ""amalgamate certain units."" ""This work will be directly informed by feedback from Mr. Pine's consultations and, as such, it is too early to say how many units the province will establish or when amalgamation will start,"" Hayley Chazan said in a statement. Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, Peterborough's medical officer of health, said the local health board is encouraging the minister to build on established strengths of many public health units, including those in rural Ontario. ""Amalgamations of boards, particularly into regional, rather than local structures, threatens both the accountability and the responsiveness of public health governance,"" she said. The report does not oppose merging health units, but said that based on studies, the agencies should not serve populations greater than 500,000. Any new model must also take into account rural communities' ability to pay, it adds. ""Funding should be predictable and consider factors such as equity, population demographics and density, rural/urban mix,"" the report said, adding it should also ""increase to meet new demands."" Dr. Joyce Lock, the chief medical officer for Southwestern Public Health, said that agency was created in May 2018 as a result of a voluntary merger between two health units near London, Ont. The former Elgin-St. Thomas Public Health Unit and Oxford County Public Health Unit separately served 205,000 rural and small city residents. The agencies joined together to ensure they could continue to provide programing after multi-year funding increases below the rate of inflation, she said. ""Without longer-term efficiencies we would need to shutter some programs,"" she said. ""Our amalgamation has allowed us to pool our resources, become a stronger voice for rural public health and blend the best of our skills, talent, and knowledge."" Lock said their merger will save money over the long-term, but urged the province to take a ""thoughtfully planned, strategic, and well-funded"" view of the process. ""It takes dollars and time up-front to save dollars and time down the road,"" she said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ont-public-health-1.5435445,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/reconsider-public-health-restructuring-region-waterloo-1.5245480 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lhin-management-jobs-cuts-1.5055191 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ontario-health-super-agency-private-health-care-funding-1.5039944 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/what-are-ontario-health-teams-doug-ford-government-1.5035750,N/A
394,Ashley Heisler,2019-12-21T09:00:00.675Z,Canada should be going for gold-standard when protecting elite athletes from abuse,"This column is an opinion by Ashley Heisler, a second-year law student at the University of Ottawa and a former NCCA Division I athlete in women's lacrosse. For more information about CBC's Opinion section, please see the FAQ. The recent New York Times video featuring U.S. long-distance runner Mary Cain shook the track and field community in North America with a heart-wrenching story of physical and emotional abuse, and it has an all too familiar ring for those in sport in Canada. At 17, Cain signed a professional contract with Nike after becoming the youngest American track-and-field athlete to make a world championship team. Filled with potential, Cain says she was the ""fastest girl in America, until I joined Nike."" The seven-minute video provides an unadulterated recount of Cain's tenure training with Alberto Salazar's now dismantled Nike Oregon Project, during which she lost her period for three years, broke five bones and was burdened by suicidal thoughts. In Oregon, Cain says her male coaches insisted that, to be successful, she needed to be ""thinner, and thinner, and thinner,"" to the point where her body screamed for help. In Canada, physical, psychological, sexual and emotional abuses have had severe and lasting effects on our nation's elite athletes, as well. In a federally funded, anonymous survey consisting of 1,000 former national team athletes this past year, for example, ""13 per cent of current and 20 per cent of retired athletes reported they had experienced suicidal thoughts,"" with only 15 per cent saying they had reported their experiences officially. Sandra Kirby, a professor at the University of Winnipeg and former Olympian who completed a study similar to the federally funded report, found that throughout Canada's elite sports management and coaching environments there is a general disrespect of the fact that athletes are people. In other words, viewing athletes as a tool or mechanism for profit, medal count, or reputation often takes precedence over their safety and well-being. Some are no longer staying silent. This past June, former Canadian Olympic skier Allison Forsyth launched a class-action lawsuit against Alpine Canada, claiming that the organization failed to protect its female athletes from sexual assault by former coach Bertrand Charest. When Forsyth initially reported the incidents to Alpine Canada, she says she was told to consider her allegations as she could be responsible for a loss of team sponsorship, and adds there was an implication that there could be effects on her own professional career. Others in sports in Canada have also gone public with accusations of inappropriate treatment of athletes by coaching staff or failure to properly protect athletes. Instances of ""abuse, manipulation and inappropriate behaviour"" have been alleged against a former coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps soccer team, the Under-20 Women's National Team and assistant coach to the 2008 Canadian Women's Olympic Team, Bob Birarda. Among its conclusions, a report commissioned by the Whitecaps and submitted Dec. 13 found that the club failed to ensure Birarda was adhering to a code of conduct designed to protect players, and made 34 recommendations to improve player safety and complaint management.   Athletes in hockey, bobsleigh and rowing have also been coming forward with allegations of inappropriate treatment and behaviour. While formal litigation is an option and Canadian courts have established that coaches and their team staff owe a general duty of care to their athletes, the case law is limited. Many lawsuits are settled before they can be determined by a judge, leaving no room for binding precedent. The decisions that are published primarily deal with male professional athletes, and often fail to consider the additional barriers and vulnerabilities female athletes face, such as less funding, lower representation and gendered stereotypes. Further, they generally fail to address the psychological repercussions of abuse, even in cases stemming from physical acts. But outside the courts, while new policy protecting both female and male athletes pursuing professional and amateur sports careers in Canada is in its early stages, recent reforms suggest that measures safeguarding athletes are starting to change — and for the better.   Kirsty Duncan, the Minister of Science, Sport and Persons With Disabilities prior to the announcement of the new Liberal cabinet on Nov. 20, launched three major developments in order to combat harassment, abuse and discrimination at all levels of sport. First, an Investigation Unit supported by the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada (SDRCC) provides members of national sports teams with a third-party avenue to resolve disputes independent of an athlete's sports organization. Second, the Canadian Support Helpline was established as a neutral ""listening and referral service"" for athletes experiencing or witnessing harassment and discrimination in their sport. Third, Duncan committed to enforce a safety-valve mechanism, wherein federal funding will be withheld from national sports organizations if they fail to report incidents of discrimination and harassment, or don't utilize the SDRCC-supported Investigation Unit. For female athletes, specifically, Duncan took further steps towards ensuring their safety by appointing a federal Gender Equity Secretariat responsible for, ""developing, implementing and monitoring a gender equity in sport strategy."" This position is charged with facilitating initiatives to attract and maintain a greater female presence in sport, including athletes, coaches and officials, and aims to create a safer environment in which to train and compete. Members of national sport organizations will also be forced to undergo mandatory training in national policies around anti-harassment, abuse and discrimination before April 2020. It remains to be seen how the government will expand on these initiatives, as rookie MP Steven Guilbeault takes over the sport portfolio as part of his responsibilities as the new Minister of Canadian Heritage. However, the implementation of these early policies by his predecessor suggests an evolution in the culture of Canadian sport that is refusing to let competition harm athletes, and is helping to end silence around abuse. While the process of ensuring that athletes may pursue their goals without fear of abuse or harassment will hardly be linear, its current direction points to a promising future. As Olympic medallist Forsyth puts it, ""There is a strong sense of urgency to take action. We are not seeking perfection; we are seeking progress to ensure a safe, healthy sport environment for all athletes in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/opinion-sports-abuse-ashley-heisler-1.5363248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/investigates/elite-athletes-abuse-1.5125147 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur-sports-coaches-sexual-offences-minors-1.5006609 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/canadian-athletes-want-the-lip-service-around-safe-sport-to-stop-1.5117345 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes-renewing-call-independent-body-investigate-abuse-1.5378762 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/abuse-sport-summit-1.5126753 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/shoemaker-canadian-olympic-committee-safe-sport-1.5128210,N/A

396,Adam van der Zwan,2020-01-23T23:29:50.395Z,Placer miners on Vancouver Island allege forestry company blocking access to claimed land ,"Jeremy Woolsey moved back to Ladysmith, B.C., last year to continue his family's gold prospecting legacy.  He paid for a 63-hectare claim on designated placer mining land through the B.C government's website and drove over an hour with his expensive equipment to the remote site near Port Alberni. But he found his land locked behind a gate owned by Mosaic Forest Management, a company with rights to much of Vancouver Island's timber.  ""Legally, this is my claim. They own the rights to the timber. I own the rights to the minerals,"" said Woolsey. He recently joined the Vancouver Island Placer Miners Association, a large community of miners which is now embroiled in a dispute with the company for land access. Woolsey said he's contacted the company multiple times but only received an email last September from property assistant Jenna MacDonald. ""Mosaic does not allow prospecting on the lands,"" it said.  She says free miners with a valid certificate are required to submit a Section 19  Notice under the Mineral Tenure Act, which would outline the location and type of work. If approved, they would be granted access on weekends. Woolsey said he's shocked, especially when such a small amount of land on the island is designated for miners. He's submitted his Section 19 four times with no response. MacDonald wrote that miners would only be permitted if ""your claim is accessible without passing through a gate."" Section 14 of the Mineral Tenure Act states that a mining permit holder has the right to ""enter and occupy the surface of a claim or lease for the exploration and development or production of ... placer minerals,"" including ""all operations related to … the business of mining."" To enter private land, miners are required by law to give eight days notice prior to mining activity on their claim. Paul Larouche, a placer miner from Victoria, said Mosaic recently asked all miners who had previously obtained keys to the gates to return them, with ""no legitimate explanation,"" while those who fish and hunt still have access. A statement from Mosaic says ""safety is [its] highest priority,"" and  ""active harvesting and weather and road conditions are important considerations in the timing of gate openings."" ""We are currently working to build agreements with free miner organizations to establish a single safe and co-ordinated approach,"" it said.  Michael Mullen, director of communications for the miners association said members are ""passionate ... because it was something their fathers and grandfathers passed down to them  … Not only are we as responsible as possible, 99 per cent of our members go out armed with only a shovel and a hand pan."" The asociation's executive team would not comment until an agreement is reached with Mosaic, but an email sent to members last week reveals B.C.'s chief gold commissioner was consulted after unsuccessful attempts to contact Mosaic.  ""There is no preemptive process to be undertaken besides efforts to continue negotiations with Mosaic, which we are attempting,"" wrote Mullen. He said Mosaic's lack of engagement could be because the company is waiting for the outcomes of two other land disputes it's involved in at the Surface Rights Board of B.C., which has authority to issue orders on land access.  Mullen wrote that the gold commissioner advised all members to submit their Section 19 notices for 2020 to Mosaic immediately, and if they're denied, the commissioner could inquire with the company. A statement from the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources says that if the two parties cannot agree on terms of access after notice is served, and the commissioner is unable to resolve the dispute, the dispute may be appealed to the Surface Rights Board of B.C. for a final resolution.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/placer-miners-on-vancouver-island-allege-forestry-company-blocking-access-to-claimed-land-1.5438390,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/docproject/heart-of-gold-1.4999397/for-this-prospecting-couple-true-love-is-worth-its-weight-in-gold-1.4999464 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-forest-industry-grasps-for-hope-amid-seven-month-strike-shutdowns-changes-1.5432601 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/2018-promising-year-yukon-mining-1.4964122,N/A

Many people who were involved in the public consultations came out to see the plans for the new building — a joint facility involving the Ottawa Public Library and Library and Archives Canada — at an open house Thursday at the Ottawa Gallery. The $192-million library building will be located at the corner of Albert and Booth Streets at the edge of LeBreton Flats. It's being designed in tandem by Diamond Schmitt Architects from Toronto and Ottawa's KWC Architects. Diamond Schmitt Architects is the firm that reimagined the National Arts Centre on Elgin Street. Wanda Kowalski said she felt like the people who attended the meetings coalesced around a few basic principles. ""Give us a library that is human. Give us a library that is egalitarian. Give us a library that has lots of windows so we can see our beautiful city,"" she said. ""I feel like crying. It's a magnificent building.""

""It's really wide, open concept and it's really high [which] makes it an iconic feature of the building,"" he said. Some people did express reservations about the location of the new building — earlier in the process advocates wanted the library to be closer to the existing main branch or more integrated to the LRT station at Pimisi. ""I just hope the walk from the light rail isn't too cold in the winter,"" Jean Beaudet said. Beaudet said she's pleased with the design overall and how it integrates with the environment.

398,Adam Carter,2020-01-23T16:10:10.093Z,"E-learning is no boogeyman, but would be costly to implement properly, expert says","Online learning isn't the massive problem that Ontario's embattled teachers unions are making it out to be, according to a leading expert in the field — but he says to properly implement it across the province would likely prove very costly. Michael Barbour, associate professor of instructional design at the College of Education and Health Sciences at Touro University California, told CBC News that political rhetoric is masking the possible benefits that e-learning could bring to Ontario. But with few concrete details about how the program would roll out, he says it's difficult for people take an informed stance. One thing is for sure, Barbour says: to do this right wouldn't be cheap. The province would need to hire more teachers to support students, properly outfit classrooms and computer labs, and work with telecom companies to ensure broadband access in rural areas. ""It's going to be a lot of money, a lot of purchasing, [and] a lot of set-up in a very short period of time,"" said Barbour, a Canadian who has been involved with K-12 online learning in countries including Canada and the U.S. for decades as a researcher, teacher, course designer and administrator. ""If the government embarked upon this because they believe it is going to save money, then that was a fool's journey."" E-learning has become a major talking point in the fight between the provincial government and education workers, alongside class sizes and compensation for teachers. The province announced last year that it would require high school students to take four online courses in order to graduate. After considerable blowback, Education Minister Stephen Lecce scaled that number back to two. Students graduating in 2023-2024 would be the first cohort required to complete the two courses, selecting from options like Grade 11 biology, Grade 12 data management, and Grade 10 career studies. Union leaders have repeatedly said that bringing in mandatory e-learning courses would hurt the province's education system. Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation president Harvey Bischof appeared on CBC Radio's Metro Morning Monday, and said the province wants to ""impose mandatory Alabama style e-learning that every piece of evidence says is not constructive for many of our students."" Larry Raines, coordinator of the educational technology section at the Alabama Department of Education, dismisses that idea outright. He told CBC News that since online classes were first offered in 2006, enrolment has ballooned from 300 students to over 27,000, and the results have been largely positive. ""We worked to make sure we were not out there to take the place of teachers,"" Raines said in a phone interview. ""We're actually employing almost 1,000 teachers across the state."" Comparing Ontario to Alabama also doesn't work, because completion of Alabama's online courses isn't mandatory for graduation. Instead, the state has a guideline that dictates every student must have an ""online experience"" to graduate, but an online course is just one way to achieve that. Barbour says he understands why a union that's embroiled in a labour dispute would want to hold up Alabama as an example. ""I did my PhD down in Georgia, and the common saying in Georgia was, 'Thank God for Alabama, because otherwise Georgia would be the worst education system in the U.S.,'"" he said, adding that Alabama historically has had very poor performances on both national and international assessments. ""But that's not because of online learning,"" he said. An examination of Alabama's graduation numbers shows there's not really a difference before or after online learning was implemented, he said. ""Alabama has a bad education system for a variety of reasons."" Part of the problem here, Barbour says, is the province has released very few details about its plans for the program, so people can't really make an informed decision. ""The ministry hasn't done a good job of actually telling us what they mean,"" he said. Ministry of Education spokesperson Alexandra Adamo told CBC News in a statement that that province is ""committed to building a world-leading online learning system to strengthen Ontario students' competencies in the modern economy. ""We are proceeding with developing and implementing a made-in-Ontario program that will ensure student flexibility, technological literacy and a vast selection of courses, through two mandatory courses over the lifetime of a student's high school career."" Adamo could not, however, say how much that program will cost. ""The full financial and policy implications of the online learning strategy are subject to the development of the ministry's final implementation plan. Once these elements are finalized, the ministry will provide more information,"" she said. Some research from the U.S. has lauded e-learning as a viable education option, while other reports are less bullish. A 2014 study based out of Harvard University that examined Florida's online course offerings did not find any evidence of negative effects of virtual education on student learning. But in 2018, The Michigan Virtual Learning Research Institute examined how effective online learning has been in that state, and found that online learning was failing poorer students. Despite the fact that 62 per cent of enrolments in Michigan were students living in poverty, researchers saw a gap of nearly 20 percentage points between the pass rates for those students (48 per cent) and students not in poverty (66 per cent). The institute says that in the last decade, the number of virtual learners in Michigan nearly tripled, but the statewide virtual pass rate did not improve — instead, it has steadily decreased from 66 per cent in 2010-11 to 55 per cent in the 2018 academic year. Still, Barbour maintains that e-learning could work in Ontario if students are properly supported. ""Technology, be it a classroom that's using a traditional chalk board or white board, to a high-tech classroom ... to an online class, it's just a medium,"" he said. ""And what impacts learning is how we design, deliver and support that learning within that medium."" But he says he also understands why unions are pushing back during this round of bargaining, given what he sees as comparisons between the current Ford government and when Mike Harris was in power back in the 1990s. ""The idea that the motivation behind a lot of the measures that they're making is based upon cost saving, that's a real concern for folks that are trying to collective bargain right now,"" Barbour said. ""It's a reasonable position to take."" adam.carter@cbc.ca",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/e-learning-ontario-1.5436788,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strikes-rotating-begin-1.5432940 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/teacher-strike-ontario-back-to-work-legislation-doug-ford-1.5430757 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-teachers-strike-labour-action-1.5425586,N/A
399,Ariana Kelland,2020-01-24T19:22:06.184Z,"After long hours, sleepless nights, Eastern Health back in full operation Monday","After an unprecedented blizzard and lengthy state of emergency, the head of Eastern Health says the health-care system in St. John's will be back in full operation by Monday. ""For us in health care if we can keep people safe during the worst of the blizzard then we can figure out how to catch up,"" CEO David Diamond told CBC on Thursday. ""And that's been the work this week."" Eastern Health made the call Jan. 16, the day before the storm, to close community service offices, but Diamond said he learned pretty quickly last Friday morning as snow began to build that it would be worse than anticipated.  With the city declaring a state of emergency, visitors to the hospital and discharged patients became trapped in the hospital, too. Diamond, himself, stayed three nights in his office at the Health Sciences Centre.  ""I've been in this business about 30 years now and and have been through a number of crisis situations and this is probably as complex as it's been in the 30 years I've been doing this,"" Diamond said.  ""We had to make sure we had the right people in the right skills."" Diamond said they had a few scenarios in which employees leaving or coming to work couldn't be contacted. Posts on social media showed nurses and doctors going to great lengths to make it to work, including by showshoe and snowmobile. ""We put in place some mechanisms to make sure that anybody who was outside, we had a connection with them and we could know that they were safe so we're trying to keep our staff safe as well."" There were 19 babies born at the Health Sciences Centre from midnight Friday to midnight Monday, keeping staff busy with storm newborns. Despite the irregularity of such weather, Diamond said, he can't pinpoint one thing that failed during the trying state of emergency. However, everything will go under the microscope during a debriefing in the weeks to come.  Health Minister John Haggie was watching the aftermath from his district in Gander. Central Health also encountered some issues, like when the power went out at the hospital on Fogo Island. ""It was a challenge for the rigs (ambulances) to get to the street and it was a real challenge for the paramedics to get to the street to the house,"" Haggie said Friday. Transportation will be one of the challenges discussed at the upcoming debriefing.  ""It's not often I'm short of words but really and honestly I can't find enough words to describe how the health-care staff in Eastern Health managed and coped throughout the course of that weekend."" If photos tell the story, it appears as though people working in the health-care system made it work by leaning on one another. That's something they will have to keep doing as appointments get rescheduled and hospitals come back to life. Extra shifts will be added, Diamond said, adding he's confident that by next Friday the system will be like it was before the storm.  ""It's quite amazing when I think of where we started last Friday.""

400,Karissa Donkin,2019-12-08T13:00:00.380Z,The RCMP said it didn't have any records about an investigation. But it had thousands.,"The RCMP is apologizing for saying it didn't have any records about its 11-month investigation into the death of Michel Vienneau, who was shot by a Bathurst Police Force member in 2015. In fact, the police agency had more than 10,000 records about the Nova Scotia RCMP's investigation into Vienneau's death, which led to criminal charges against two Bathurst Police Force officers. The charges were dropped in 2017 after a preliminary inquiry. More than two years after CBC News asked for the records through an access to information request, and more than four years after Vienneau's death, the RCMP disclosed nearly 1,800 pages of documents and more than 1,000 images and videos related to the investigation. That came only after an investigation by the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada. The RCMP blamed human error, saying the search for records wasn't done properly. ""Although in the end it is clear that we did not meet our obligations, this appears to be a process failure, not the result of any ill-intent,"" Dan Brien, the RCMP's director of issues management and media relations, wrote in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""I am not aware of any intent to hide or suppress information on the part of RCMP personnel."" No one from the RCMP was made available for an interview. Minutes after Vienneau was shot outside Bathurst's Via Rail station on the morning of Jan. 12, 2015, Nova Scotia RCMP officers were called in to investigate. New Brunswick doesn't have its own serious incident response team like neighbouring Nova Scotia. Instead, police agencies from other jurisdictions are often tasked with investigating police-involved shootings or deaths. In this case, the two subject officers were employed by the Bathurst Police Force but worked in the now-disbanded Northeast Integrated Intelligence Unit. The unit, made up of officers from several police forces in the area, including RCMP, focused on gathering intelligence about drugs and organized crime. Vienneau appeared on the officers' radar that day when their supervisor, RCMP Sgt. Ron DeSilva, now an inspector, received Crime Stoppers tips that Vienneau was returning from Montreal with a load of drugs. The tips were false. For months, a team of Nova Scotia RCMP officers pieced together what led to the shooting. They interviewed about 100 witnesses. Lead investigator Larry Wilson described the investigation as ""complex"" and ""exhaustive"" in an email he sent to his team after the investigation concluded. ""The fact that the subjects of this case are police officers added another layer of complexity but each and everyone of you brought an unbiased and professional approach to your tasks,"" Wilson wrote. But when CBC News asked for all records about the Nova Scotia RCMP investigation into Vienneau's death, the RCMP had a surprising response. ""Based on the information provided, a search for records was conducted in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"" Insp. Richard Haye of the RCMP's access to information and privacy branch wrote in a May 2017 letter. ""Unfortunately, we were unable to locate records which respond to your request.""  How is it possible that a division of Canada's largest police force could spend months on a complex investigation into a man's death but not have any records about the investigation? It wasn't possible because it wasn't true. The original request, filed in February 2017, also asked for records that detailed the process of sending the file to the Crown, which has to approve criminal charges in New Brunswick, and about the false Crime Stoppers tips that led police to Vienneau on the day of his death. CBC News filed a complaint about the request in June 2017, suggesting it was inconceivable the RCMP wouldn't have records about a lengthy investigation. ""We posed numerous questions regarding the institution's processing of your request and the nature of their search for the records requested,"" the investigation report from the commissioner's office says. ""A second tasking was conducted and the RCMP located relevant records which were then reviewed to determine which documents could be released.""  An investigator with the Office of the Information Commissioner was tasked with reviewing the records, combing through nine CDs. One CD had thousands of written records on 6,645 pages. There were also more than 3,500 photos, videos or audio records that were reviewed, according to correspondence sent to CBC News. Some of those records ultimately weren't disclosed, for a variety of reasons. Some were duplicates. The final package didn't include any video recordings of what unfolded that day outside Bathurst's Via Rail station. According to the Nova Scotia RCMP's report on the shooting, no such video exists. While the commissioner's investigation prompted the RCMP to disclose records it previously said it didn't have, it doesn't explain what went wrong in the first place. That's problematic for Ken Rubin, an Ottawa-based investigator and researcher who has spent decades using Canada's freedom of information system to draw out information that's in the public interest. ""I think they have to be held more accountable,"" Rubin said about the commissioner's office. ""You can't just go from no records to 10,000 and say, 'Oh, aren't we wonderful. We got the records for you.' No, what happened? Come on.""  In its explanation, the RCMP said it relies on people to search its records. ""In addition to our ongoing challenges related to the scope and volume of incoming requests, we occasionally encounter situations where individual searches do not identify all the documents that they should,"" Brien wrote in an email. ""In this case, through the Information Commissioner's investigation, we discovered that, for a variety of reasons, the document search was not executed properly."" He said not all of the units that should have been asked to search were asked to do so. Others who were searching found no records, which wasn't accurate. ""This situation has provided us with valuable insight into gaps in our system and we will continue to take every opportunity to improve our processes."" Rubin sees the case as part of a larger problem with the RCMP's access to information system. Last year, the RCMP was wading through a backlog of unanswered requests, prompting the police force to reverse a policy that forced members to go through access to information to get their own medical or personnel files. RCMP backlogged with access-to-information requests from its own staff Earlier this year, an access to information officer emailed CBC News to ask whether the requester still wanted overdue records from 2017, noting the RCMP is ""experiencing a high volume of requests with limited resources."" ""It's common knowledge that the RCMP, at least in terms of access to information, has not been that well organized or forthcoming in the last few years and has huge delays and some other problems … they are not the top of the transparency bureaucracy,"" Rubin said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/vienneau-rcmp-foi-1.5387196,[],N/A
401,Rosa Marchitelli,2019-11-25T01:00:00.884Z,More surgical items being left inside patients blamed on rushed operations,"Tracy-Ann Wallace says she'll never forget the sharp pain in her stomach and the putrid smell coming from inside her body after a partial hysterectomy. ""I was in constant pain and I had problems going to the bathroom,"" said Wallace, 47 who had the surgery at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in 2014, after developing uterine fibroids. The 47-year-old says her doctors told her the problems were part of routine healing, but as the weeks passed, the pain and smell got worse. Finally, a friend convinced Wallace to show up at her surgeon's waiting room, and just sit there until the doctor agreed to see her. When the surgeon finally examined Wallace, the problem was apparent and ""horrifying.""  ""She put her gloves on and reached in and took a glove and two sponges out of my body,"" said Wallace. As Go Public recently reported, the number of objects being left in patients after surgery in Canada has jumped 14 per cent over the last five years.  That's no accident, but a systemic problem caused by doctors and nurses being pressured to rush through surgeries, according to veteran surgical nurse Bev McLean.  McLean has spent more than half of her 33-year career in operating rooms, as a nurse, among other positions, and, most recently, reviewing operating room mistakes for legal cases. She says Wallace's story reminds her of a case she reviewed in 2010. In a rush to finish an operation, a surgeon grabbed a sponge from the instrument table after a nurse had finished counting medical devices to ensure all were accounted. The sponge was lost in the count and left inside the patient. It was only discovered after he developed a painful infection and required another surgery to be removed, says McLean. In an effort to reduce wait times and cut costs, many provinces cap funding for certain kinds of surgeries, no matter how complicated or what problems arise. At the same time, the provinces require hospitals to balance their budgets, resulting in a crackdown on overtime and adding to the pressure to rush through surgeries. ""There's a big push these days to be fast,"" McLean told Go Public, ""and that's part of the problem. The faster you go in any procedure, no matter how good you are as a team, there's always the risk that you're going to take a shortcut or that you might miss a step, or you're doing two steps at the same time."" The Canadian Nurses Association and the Operating Room Nurses Association of Canada say they too see this as part of the problem. Asked what it's doing about the problem, Health Canada said in an email ""the practice of medicine"" is up to the provinces.  There are oversights and safety measures in place. Accreditation Canada, an independent agency that sets standards for publicly funded hospitals, made it mandatory in 2011 for surgical staff to count the devices — sponges, needles, clamps, scissors, etc. — used after a procedure to ensure nothing is left behind. This kind of medical mistake is considered a ""never event,"" meaning there are enough safety measures in place that it should never happen. But despite that, it does. Alberta and Quebec have the highest rates of leaving foreign objects inside patients, according to a study from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  Both are above the national average of 9.8 such mistakes per 100,000 patients: Alberta at 12 and Quebec at 15 per 100,000 patients. A spokesperson for Quebec's Ministry of Health and Social Services tells Go Public, such ""omissions remain very rare,"" adding operating room staff need to be vigilant and follow best practices. Alberta Health Services recently finished a comprehensive review of what's causing these errors, and found the ""primary factors identified are distractions, incorrect surgical tool counts and challenges with surgical team dynamics,"" according to spokesperson Kerry Williamson. Williamson says there is no single, identifiable reason why Alberta's rates are higher, but that it's likely due to the province's good reporting system. In Ontario, hospitals are required to report to the Ministry of Health on their use of the instrument checklist — which has shown to ""reduce the rates of death and complications,"" according to ministry spokesperson David Jensen. The ministry noted the province's rate of left-behind medical devices is lower than the national average, but would not comment on whether the funding model or the pressure to balance hospital budgets is leading to rushed operations.  In some parts of Canada, including Toronto and Ottawa, evidence about medical errors is being gathered in operating rooms equipped with ""black box"" recorders, similar to those in airplanes, providing a window on what can go wrong. The boxes include cameras and microphones that monitor what's being said and done in operating rooms, analysis of which shows distractions like loud noises, irrelevant conversations and doors opening and closing may be leading to medical mistakes. The Toronto doctor behind the project, Teodor Grantcharov, has been testing the boxes for almost four years.  Noises distracted surgeons a median of 138 times per surgery according to findings released in June 2018.  Misplaced medical devices are part of the broader problem of ""preventable patient harm incidents"" — a category of mishaps that also includes hospital-acquired infections, blood clots and childbirth trauma.  Those mishaps are part of a ""silent epidemic,"" according to advocate Kathleen Finlay, founder of the Center for Patient Protection, an independent,Toronto-based group aimed at improving health care. ""People are being injured, permanently disabled and even dying … so the federal government needs to treat this as the public health-care crisis it is,"" said Finlay. And when it comes to such incidents, Finlay says the future looks grim, based on a 2017 report from the Canadian Patient Safety Institute, a not-for-profit health-care watchdog.  The report found more than 12 million Canadians in hospital and home-care settings will be harmed by the healthcare system over the next 30 years, costing the health-care system an additional $2.75 billion per year. Another 1.2 million people will lose their lives.  So what can be done? Finlay would like to see those black boxes routinely used in operating rooms across the country. She's also calling on the federal government to create an independent organization that would investigate hospital medical errors and wants Canada to implement a national hospital rating system, like those in the United States. She also wants to see provinces standardize what data is collected and reported about medical errors so Canadians have a clear picture of what's happening. ""They're very different from one province to the next,"" she says. ""So they're really not the kind of numbers that give you a full picture."" Tracy-Ann Wallace, the former patient, says she was shocked to learn how many patients have had the same — or similar — experiences to her own. In her case, the surgeon apologized, telling her it shouldn't have happened. Yet, five years later, she's still wondering how it did. ""This doesn't need to be happening and it shouldn't be happening. We need to tend to it,"" she said. St. Michael's Hospital tells Go Public it reviewed what happened in Wallace's case and the results led to changes that strengthened its process for counting equipment at the end of a procedure. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/medical-devices-left-in-patients-1.5364248,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/fetal-monitor-left-inside-surgical-medical-error-1.5349111 https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/medical-errors-deaths-1.3565736,N/A
402,Laura Osman ,2020-01-23T21:21:09.751Z,'Isolated' Sandy Hill development approved with limited parking,"The city's planning committee has approved four new student-focused apartment buildings in an ""isolated"" portion of Sandy Hill, despite significant opposition from the community over a lack of parking. Rideau-Vanier Coun. Mathieu Fleury described the area along Robinson Avenue, cradled between Hwy. 417 and the Rideau River, as a remote single-road neighbourhood with only one street in and out. If council approves the committee's recommendation, the small neighbourhood will see 328 new units on the street, but with fewer parking spaces than the city's rules require.  While each of the six-storey buildings are required to have 17 parking spaces under the city's rules, the project was approved despite having only three each. The nine-storey building the developer proposed that requires 81 spaces was approved with only 53.  Instead, the developer offered one bike parking spot per unit.  Fleury, who represents the area, put forward a motion to hold the developer to the required 132 required parking spaces, but he was voted down seven to one, with only River ward Coun. Riley Brockington supporting him. Community members gathered 92 signatures for a petition against the proposal because of the lack of parking, while also expressing concerns about building rental units geared toward students.  The residents were represented Thursday by lawyer Scott McAnsh, who told planning committee it's not realistic to think people will be able to do without a car in the neighbourhood. For example, the community is a 24-minute walk to the nearest grocery store, he said. ""Being so isolated and removed from services means people who move there are likely to come with a car,"" McAnsh said.  Without adequate parking, those residents will probably park on the already limited spaces on the street — an extra ""pressure that's [been] dumped on the community,"" said McAnsh. A consultant hired by the developer, however, suggested increasing density in the area would attract more amenities, like grocery stores.  ""That synergy will come,"" said Kersten Nitsche with Fotenn Planning and Design.    ""We're providing that density to support those future amenities. Really, we're just looking at parking today."" The developer argued the buildings will be only about an eight-minute walk to the nearby Lees LRT station, but Fleury explained the route is not very walkable, especially in the winter.  In 2014, the city voted to keep the established parking requirements in place, despite the proximity of the LRT line — and even as it waived the requirements on nearby streets. Fleury said that's because city staff at the time recognized the unique nature of the Robinson Village neighbourhood. He can't understand why they've now changed their minds and are recommending the project go ahead with less parking.  ""It's inconsistent,"" Fleury said.  The building will be geared toward students, according to the city's report, and will include studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units.  City council will debate the proposal next week. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/robinson-village-parking-1.5438117,[],N/A

""Look what happened to our caribou ...15 or 10 years ago caribou were thick like mosquitoes."" The Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council is asking the provincial government to put in place a moratorium on the 2020 moose hunt in the réserve faunique La Vérendrye, south of Val-d'Or, saying hunters are seeing steep declines in the population.  Last week, the council issued a press release saying it was disappointed the ministry was refusing to act so far. ""The moose population is going down fairly quickly,"" said Algonquin Anishinabeg Grand Chief Verna Polson. ""We've been talking about this for several years now."" Polson said her nation is co-operating with officials at the province's Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs to carry out a moose population count in the reserve this winter. The nation is continuing to pressure the government for a moratorium.  The Cree Trappers Association is hoping to present its draft moose management plan to members at its annual general assembly this summer. It will include a better population count and draw on traditional Cree and non-Indigenous conservation practices, and could include restrictions on Indigenous hunters, according to association president Tomatuk. He also said hunters need to stop over-harvesting, particularly female moose during the spring calving season. ""In Waswanipi last year, nine moose were killed,"" said Tomatuk, adding all were female and pregnant. That one harvest took a total of 27 moose out of the area, he said.

404,Kazi Stastna,2020-01-24T18:03:06.606Z,"As they head into Day 4 of impeachment trial, Democrats hope to leave senators wanting more","As the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump enters its fourth day in the U.S. Senate, stamina is waning. Among viewers at home, interest has dropped off - from about 11 million viewers to a little less than nine million, or about seven per cent of those expected to vote in the November 2020 election. In the halls of the Senate, the press corps is getting restless, still chasing every media availability but privately cursing the long hours they've put in covering a trial that has stretched beyond nine hours each of the past three days. On the Senate floor, while some senators keenly flip through massive binders of supporting documentation, highlighting relevant sections, others slouch, yawn or slip in and out of the chamber, where strict rules dictate they're only allowed to consume milk or water. Democrats are hoping they can sustain the punishing pace for at least one more day as they wrap up their case against the president Friday and make a final push to convince the Senate and the American people that Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival was a brazen abuse of power intended to give him an advantage in the 2020 election. Hour 23 of redundant impeachment arguments. For those following at home: Drinking game—every time House Dems say “drug deal” or “get over it”...drink a shot of milk! ""It is an unprecedented betrayal of the national interest,"" said Jerrold Nadler, one of seven Democratic legislators, or so-called managers, prosecuting the case, Thursday. ""It is a shocking corruption of the election process. And it is without doubt a crime against the constitution, warranting — demanding — removal from office."" WATCH | Jerrold Nadler lays out the case for abuse of power: The Democrats have been using video clips of testimony from the House impeachment hearings last year and Trump's own statements to methodically weave a director's commentary of sorts, chronicling a by now familiar story: Trump's withholding of $400 million US in military aid and a White House meeting as a means of pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter and revive a discredited theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. ""This is actually a very effective use of the House evidence because it digests the moments that constitute evidence for the Democrats,"" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert in political communication at the University of Pennsylvania who runs FactCheck.org. And while much of the testimony was familiar to anyone who paid attention during the House hearings, several senators from both sides of the aisle admitted they were hearing some of it for the first time. ""This may have been the first time that they have heard the entire case presented sequentially,"" Jamieson said. ""And they are having a very different experience than the public has had, because very few in the public are watching from one o'clock until whenever the proceedings [end]."" Although several of Trump's defenders in and outside the Senate denounced the presentation as same old, same old, Republicans might end up using their own samples of House testimony to rebut the Democrats' case when they begin presenting their defence Saturday.  It would be a mistake for the lawyers representing Trump to discount evidence of misconduct altogether, said Michael Gerhardt, an expert on constitutional law and the legislative process at the North Carolina School of Law.  Instead, they should clearly spell out how the Senate should assess whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offence. ""Merely saying all he did was perfect is shameful. It is false and leads any neutral observers to lose confidence in their case,"" said Gerhardt. Gerhardt was a witness for both sides in the 1999 impeachment trial of Bill Clinton and in the Trump impeachment hearings in the House, and Nadler played some of his testimony at the start of Thursday's session. He says he regrets that there are no joint witnesses in the current impeachment process. ""The breach between the parties is much worse than it was 20 years ago, and it was bad then."" The importance of hearing from additional witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has been a key focus for the Democrats. It will likely come up again in their final day of arguments as they attempt to prove the second article of impeachment and show that Trump obstructed Congress by stymying the inquiry into how he handled the Ukraine matter. They'll need to convince at least two Republicans (along with the two independents, who are expected to vote with Democrats) to get the 51-member majority they need to vote in favour of calling of witnesses once Trump's defence team presents their case. Adam Schiff, the congressman leading the prosecution, has goaded senators over the past two days, hinting at the incriminating details that might be in the diplomatic cables and other subpoenaed documents the White House has thus far refused to release.  ""They're yours for the asking,"" he told senators on the first day of arguments. WATCH | Adam Schiff calls on senators to demand the release of subpoenaed documents: ""As they built the narrative, they would establish what they knew, argue that it was strong enough to impeach based on what they knew and then say, 'But wouldn't you also want to know this?'"" Louis Seidman, a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University Law Center, said of the Democrats' strategy. It's a strategy that seems to be tapping into public sentiment. A Reuters poll taken Jan. 17- 22 found that 72 per cent of Americans, including 69 per cent of Republicans, agreed that ""witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the impeachment charges should be allowed to testify."" ""They have to sustain public support for witnesses. In fact, get it to increase if they can, because that puts pressure on the susceptible Republicans who might be willing to vote that way,"" Seidman said. Rick Scott of Florida is one of those Republicans but told reporters Thursday he considers the interviewing of witnesses ""the House's job."" Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar said she's been doing her part to keep the pressure up, nudging Republican colleagues to at least agree to hear from witnesses even if they don't vote to remove Trump from office.  ""Why are you here if you're not going to stand up?"" she said she told senators. Democrats used strong language in their presentation to the Senate to characterize Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to announce investigations that the House managers said served only his own interests: ""plot,"" ""scheme,"" ""unprecedented coverup."" (He countered with some of his favourite terms: Nadler was a ""sleazebag""; Schiff a ""con job"" and the trial ""a hoax,"" he said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.) They went to great lengths to underscore the gravity of the charges and the historic nature of the process, repeatedly invoking the so-called Framers of the Constitution. ""Impeachment is not for petty offences,"" Nadler said on the second day of arguments. ""It does not apply to acts that are merely unwise or unpopular. "" And if there was any doubt about just how somber of an occasion it was, the opening words of the sergeant at arms at the start of every session were there to remind us: ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."" As were the stern security staff who were quick to reprimand reporters and lookers-on for the smallest infraction, handing them a photocopied list of rules, with the one they've violated emphatically underlined: no cellphones, no talking, no eating, no leaning, no standing. In advance of their final day of arguments, the managers presenting the Democrats' case issued a warning to those who might be convinced Trump abused the power of his office but hesitant to remove him. ""The president's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box,"" Schiff said near the end of another nine-hour-plus session. ""For we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won."" But it will take more than that to convince Trump's most vocal defenders in the Senate that he must go. ""When it comes to replacing this president nine months-plus from the election, you've got an uphill battle with me because I really do believe that the best group people to pick a president are the voters,"" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters. Even Seidman, who supports the impeachment process, thinks a vote to remove Trump would be risky and potentially destabilizing given that a percentage of Americans would find such a process tantamount to a coup d'etat. It's also highly unlikely to happen, contingent as it is on a two-thirds majority in the Republican-controlled chamber, where Democrats hold 47 of 100 seats.  But that doesn't necessarily mean the impeachment process is a futile exercise, says Seidman. ""There is the impact that this has on the American people, on Trump's chances for re-election, on his historical reputation, on how much political power he has going forward,"" he said.

The 15-year old, who hails from Wiikwemkoong First Nation on Manitoulin Island in northern Ontario, shared her dismay at their lack of attention toward the issue while on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday. Peltier has spent her last eight years putting pressure on politicians to take climate change more seriously, while advocating for clean drinking water in Indigenous communities and serving as the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation, a political advocacy group for 40 First Nations across Ontario. She has urged the United Nations General Assembly to ""warrior up"" and take a stand for our planet and confronted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his ""broken promises"" at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations. While sharing the stage in Davos with fellow teen activists Greta Thunberg of Sweden, Natasha Mwansa from Zambia and Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, she heaped more pressure on politicians back home. ""It is almost like they don't believe climate change is real,"" she said. ""Climate change is a real thing and they are not realizing that."" Her remarks come amid warnings that Canada is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world and as youth like Peltier are increasingly calling for the globe to band together and address climate change. Peltier said she has received some support from Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Mike Mantha and Carolyn Bennett, the federal minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, but has found that many of their counterparts are putting their attention elsewhere. ""They are all focused on just money and we need to be more focused on the actual things going on,"" she said. She also revealed that her age plays a role in how seriously she's being taken. ""I personally don't feel that heard from politicians....When it comes to federal government it is really hard to get their attention and be heard by them,"" she said. ""I just feel being a youth we are not as heard as we can be.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/autumn-peltier-thunberg-davos-1.5435091,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/autumn-peltier-un-water-activist-united-nations-1.4584871 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canadian-indigenous-water-activist-autumn-peltier-addresses-un-on-clean-water-1.5301559,N/A

According to Yves Jodoin, a staff member and dog trainer at Au Royaume des Animaux, Vango entered the store Monday with a couple that normally came in to buy cat food. ""The dog was barking, the dog was poking and he really wanted my attention,"" Jodoin said. Jodoin said he immediately became suspicious when the couple didn't seem to know basic information about the dog — his exact age, whether he'd been sterilized, what kind of food he ate and how much they'd paid for him.   ""They were evading the questions,"" Jodoin said. ""I was giving the dog cookies, but the dog was still barking."" Meanwhile, a colleague went to check social media for reports of stolen pets, and quickly pulled up a picture of Vango. The dog had been reported missing from his home in Buckingham, Que., just two and a half hours earlier. That's when Jodoin suddenly realized he already knew the dog — he'd trained Vango as a puppy. ""At that point I said, 'Vango, come!' And the dog was reacting, he was jumping,"" Jodoin said. ""All along he was barking and poking, trying to say, 'Hello, I'm not the dog they say I am.'"" The couple claimed they'd found the dog in the woods. The woman told Jodoin she wanted to keep the dog as a support animal because she had poor health and couldn't afford to buy and train a dog. Surrounded by witnesses in the store, Jodoin convinced the couple to surrender the animal. Then he called Vango's rightful owner, Josée Francoeur. ""I can't talk about it without crying,"" Francoeur said about the moment she received Jodoin's call.  Francoeur said the dog disappeared after she let him out for a pee in her fenced yard around 9 a.m. Monday. When she stuck her head out the door, Vango, who wasn't microchipped was gone. ""Is it possible that someone took him? And I was thinking, 'Who could do that? It's impossible!""     Francoeur immediately posted a notice on the local SPCA site for missing animals, and on other social media pages.

408,Courtney Dickson,2020-01-24T01:24:39.486Z,BC Transit reduces service in Kitimat due to staffing shortages caused by LNG recruitment,"BC Transit announced Wednesday it would be temporarily reducing transit in Kitimat, B.C.,  due to staffing shortages caused by drivers being recruited to work at the LNG plant in Kitimat.  Pacific Western Transit (PWT), the transit operator that serves Kitimat and other northern communities, needs at least 10 drivers in the city to operate at full capacity.  Now, with only seven drivers left in Kitimat, the company says it had to choose between shutting down service entirely or having a ""random"" transit schedule.  ""We felt it was better to be somewhat proactive about it,"" PET director of operations Steve Antil told CBC's Andrew Kurjata.  Kitimat mayor Phil Germuth  said the announcement is a disappointment. ""It definitely has a huge impact,"" he said.  Until now, drivers from Terrace have been working in the district as substitutes and drivers have been working overtime to ensure transit continues. But ongoing issues finding and retaining staff means that just won't work anymore.  Antil links the staffing shortages primarily to professional drivers being recruited to work at the LNG plant in Kitimat. ""It's a very intense recruitment for drivers,"" Antil said.  ""There's certain things that they offer that we just can't compete with,"" he said, noting that LNG is offering accommodation and food to employees, along with a pay increase.  ""We can't do what they're doing with the pay scale at this stage."" It's not just retention of staff that's causing problems for PET —  rising housing prices and housing scarcity in the town is making it difficult for the transit operator to recruit new drivers from outside of Kitimat.   ""We will recruit and train one [driver] and then another one will leave to go to work at the project, driving there,"" Antil said. The solution, according to Antil, would be to increase wages for drivers to make it more appealing for them to continue working for PWT, but a decision like that would have to be approved both by BC Transit and local government.  ""They have their budgetary concerns of course,"" Antil said. ""They have to weigh all of their concerns when they're making a decision like that."" But Germuth doesn't necessarily agree. He said that if it came down to it, the contract for transit in the municipality might be opened up for bidding in hopes of finding another transit provider.  ""This is something that BC Transit and Pacific Western Transit, they've got to figure this out,"" he said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-recruitment-public-transit-reduction-kitimat-1.5438349,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-canada-terrace-kitimat-growth-budget-1.5403351 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/lng-women-kitimat-training-indigenous-pipeline-1.5179261 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/275m-federal-government-lng-canada-kitimat-1.4649654,N/A
409,Hannah Thibedeau,2020-01-23T04:45:12.581Z,Rona Ambrose says she won't run for the Conservative leadership,"Rona Ambrose says she won't run to succeed Andrew Scheer as the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. In a Facebook post this afternoon, the former interim Conservative leader said she ""struggled"" with the decision to stay out. ""It is humbling to be considered at all — because I love our party, I love the people in it and I love our country,"" she said. Thanking her supporters for their ""messages of encouragement,"" she said that she remains focused on her work in the private sector. ""And the truth is, I love being back in Alberta,"" she added in the Facebook post. ""I know we will choose a strong, compassionate person to lead us — who supports ALL families. I know we'll choose a good leader and I'll be there to support HER…or him!"" Ambrose's comment about ""all families"" might be read as a comment on Scheer, who was dogged by questions about his beliefs regarding LGBTQ rights — and his refusal to march in a Pride parade — throughout the fall election campaign. Conservative strategist Tim Powers told CBC News he's not convinced the comment was directed at Scheer, and suggested instead that Ambrose was warning the entire party that it's ""too tribal."" ""This leadership race needs a diversity of voices,"" he said. ""I think what she means is that ... whether you're a heterosexual couple, a gay couple, you're a single parent, you're rich, you're poor, you should feel welcome in the Conservative Party. Watch | Rona Ambrose says she won't run for the Conservative Party leadership ""Andrew Scheer is irrelevant ... I don't mean that unkindly, but he's not part of the equation. He's the interim leader. His time is done."" Ambrose's former chief of staff, Garry Keller, said she probably felt she needed to make her intentions clear to those Conservatives still thinking about their options. ""Obviously she spent a lot of time thinking about it over the Christmas break and early January,"" said Keller, now vice president of the business advisory firm StrategyCorp. ""You know, people are starting to make decisions on who to support for the leadership, including the MPs, and ... now is probably the right time to make that decision once and for all."" A source close to Ambrose tells CBC News she's not ruling out a return to politics at some future point. In the meantime, her announcement may open up the race to prospective candidates who were waiting to see which way she would jump. Widely seen as a polished and effective performer close to the centre of the political spectrum, Ambrose was viewed by some Conservative supporters as the party's best shot to take down the Liberals in the next general election. Her decision is certain to disappoint some. Former Saskatchewan premier Brad Wall personally urged her to run; he told CBC News earlier this month that Ambrose ""checks the boxes, in terms of policy, in terms of electability. ""And then finally, she's from Western Canada,"" Wall said. ""I think she knows where I stand on her potential candidacy. We haven't spoken since, I guess, a week or so just after the federal election. So it's been a long time since we've even chatted, other than me throwing her name around, maybe irresponsibly, in the media and social media.""

411,Anonymous,2020-01-21T00:40:52.742Z,Animator from Calgary opens up about her role on Frozen 2,"For those with children or for the Disney enthusiasts, you may know that the company's popular animated film Frozen came out with a sequel in November.  But what you may not know is that some of the scenes in the movie were created by a Calgarian. Jackie Koehler joined the Calgary Eyeopener on Monday to share how she got involved with the film and what her role was. For her, she said, the journey technically started when she was about 13 years old, when she developed an interest in animation. ""I just kind of pursued it ever since.… Every year, you kind of get a little bit better, a little bit more knowledgeable"" Koehler said. ""Next thing you know, you're working at Disney."" She's since worked on big films including Ralph Breaks the Internet and The Book of Life. When it comes to Frozen 2, her job was to work on the very nitty-gritty details of how the characters move. Each movement is crafted ""from scratch,"" she explained. The animators review the script as voiced by the actors. They also take into consideration what the directors say they want out of each scene. ""Then we kind of take it from there,"" she said. That involves deciding how a character might cross a room, for example, or how they might pick up a glass, or the sorts of facial expressions they might have during various segments of dialogue. She was one of about 80 animators working on the film. When Elsa’s powers are overtaken by another force, Jackie Koehler, who animated the scene, collaborated with our Effects Designer, Dan Lund, to choreograph Elsa’s surprise. To support the story point, we changed the speed, color and direction of her magic as it is taken over. <a href=""https://t.co/RJwn7Jb0aJ"">pic.twitter.com/RJwn7Jb0aJ</a> Koehler said she could spend about two weeks for each four seconds or so of animation. ""Each shot is very personal,"" she said, adding the shot she worked on for the lullaby sequence at the beginning of the film took months. ""It's very labour intensive."" ""(The shots) kind of become your babies … but then you watch it in the movie and it goes by in a blink of an eye."" While the process is similar to older methods of working on an animated film, going frame by frame, as technology advances, it's a little bit easier. ""The computer allows us to do more iterations so we're able to sort of explore a little bit more what different acting choices might look like on screen,"" she said. There's also a dedicated room for animators to act out a scene and film themselves so they can transpose those movements to the character. ""We'll use that as a basis to ground our characters to make sure that they look and feel like they're living in a real world,"" she said. There's also are multiple other departments in other very specialized roles, like lighting, who will work on the same scenes, she said. ""It looks and feels like magic but it's really a lot of hard work and dedication to our craft,"" Koehler said.  Next up for the animator is Disney's Raya and the Last Dragon.

412,Christine Rankin,2020-01-23T12:38:17.095Z,'Alarming' amount of plastic waste found at St. Catharines beach,"A Brock University professor says the amount of plastic waste found by student researchers on a St. Catharines beach is ""alarming.""  Students visited Sunset Beach in St. Catharines in October 2019 as part of a geography and tourism studies class to measure the amount of plastic waste. They sifted through grains of sand along the shoreline of Lake Ontario as if panning for gold ; but instead, they combed the top 5 cm and found bottle caps, lollipop sticks, and a whole lot of Styrofoam. In one instance, one square metre of the beach yielded a whopping 665 pieces of plastic material.  The course's professor Michael Pisaric said the results were ""eye-opening,"" but unfortunately not surprising given the research available about plastics in the environment, let alone bodies of water.  This research, he says, supports discourse that the issue is close to home.   ""A lot of what people have heard about with regards to plastics in the environment has been around the Pacific Ocean garbage patch...and so that's a long ways from where we live here in southern Ontario,"" he said. ""Now there's a growing amount of evidence and studies that have been done to show that the amount of plastics in the Great Lakes is a fairly significant problem as well.""  What did surprise him, Pisaric said, was the sheer amount of ""nurdles"" — tiny plastic pellets a couple of millimetres in diameter, which smaller organisms can mistake for food — and the amount of everyday objects, like pen caps, found in the environment.  He added that having his students collect data first-hand on a ""real-world problem"" was a huge takeaway.  Fourth-year geography student Michelle Pearce — who participated in the field collection — said that when people think of where their waste ends up, they normally envision landfills full of garbage bags — not beaches.  She said it shocked her to think about what she was finding, and how the situation could be much worse depending on where she was looking.  ""You have to think 'this is just one metre squared of the whole entire beach that we're looking at"" she said. ""And that was just our group — there were five other groups going as well. So it was mind-blowing to extrapolate up...I can't even imagine what's two feet to my left or two feet to my right.""  She said her class came across hundreds of bits of material on the beach, especially up shore. One reason for this, she said, is that the wind could be sweeping small pieces up the beach.   And some material found didn't immediately appear to be plastic. Pearce explained that her group kept finding pieces with same consistency of gum, which turned out to be plastic insulation of boats. The waste Pearce and her class collected is only the type they can see with the naked eye. Incredibly small microplastics end up in waterways from all sorts of everyday actions, she said, like washing clothes.  This is the first time Pisaric and his class have done this kind of work. He plans to continue with next year's group of students, potentially comparing the differences between amounts that end up on the shores of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie and exploring how much there is. The goal, he said, is awareness.  ""The biggest message is thinking about our use of plastics and how much plastic do we really need in our daily lives, and are there alternatives to that that we could use that would then eliminate and reduce the amount that gets into the environment."" ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/st-catharines-beach-plastic-brock-university-1.5436377,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/krantzberg-microplastics-1.5374907 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-sea-turtle-photographer-award-image-1.5435786,N/A
413,Anonymous,2020-01-24T01:43:52.993Z,Quebec urged not to rush expansion of medically assisted death to mental health patients,"The Quebec government has promised to hold ""at least one day"" of public consultations about its intention to allow people with mental illness to seek a medically assisted death. Health Minister Danielle McCann was facing outcry after announcing earlier this week that the government would comply with a Superior Court decision that struck down the ""end-of-life"" requirement in Quebec's law on medically assisted death. McCann's announcement meant that as of March 11, medically assisted death would be accessible to people with mental illnesses, as well as others with incurable but not terminal symptoms. That sparked concern the government was pushing ahead with a major change without thinking through the consequences. McCann responded to the pressure on Thursday, saying a public consultation will take place next month. It may include an online component. The minister also sought to reassure those who feared the new policy will make it too easy for people with mental illnesses such as depression to receive a medically assisted death. ""We're talking about exceptional cases,"" McCann said Thursday in an interview with Radio-Canada.  ""We're talking about people with extremely severe, persistent disorders, decades of inefficient treatments — people who are resistant [to treatment]. It's a very small number of people who would be able to receive medical aid in dying in this context."" McCann has asked the Quebec College of Physicians to draft guidelines for determining when a patient with mental illness can qualify for the procedure. These requests will take time in order to be properly evaluated, said Dr. Yves Robert, a representative of the college. ""Several mental disorders involve a wish to die as a symptom,"" he said. The challenge for doctors will be distinguishing between a wish to die that is a symptom, and one that is ""free and informed.""  Robert said it was important to remember that not all requests for a medically assisted death are granted. ""It's a constitutional right to make the request. But it's a conditional right to obtain it."" But even with McCann's promise to hold public consultations, opposition parties remained worried the government was pressing ahead too quickly. ""It's clear more time is needed,"" said Véronique Hivon, the Parti Québécois's critic for end-of-life care, who also played a key role drafting Quebec's assisted dying law. Hivon said the government should have asked the court for an extension. ""You can't just be in a legal bubble and say there's a judgment and it's going to land like that, like magic, without preparing things,"" she said. Hivon's concerns were echoed by a leading expert on the issue. Éric Racine, who heads a health ethics research unit affiliated with the Université de Montréal, said the Superior Court ruling threw Quebec into uncharted territory.  ""We're in grey zones here and we're at the very beginning of what should be a debate, but is going fast, fast, fast at the legislative level,"" said Racine. ""The need for dialogue may be even more crucial, but we haven't really been able to prepare for this."" Racine said the Superior Court decision, which removed the end-of-life requirement, is prompting Quebec to think hard about the ethics of well-being.

414,Anonymous,2020-01-20T17:48:53.470Z,Quebec wants to transfer non-urgent 911 calls to Info-Santé,"It's not unheard of for people to call 911 when they break an ankle or have a bad backache — and while sometimes a trip to the hospital by ambulance is warranted, that isn't always the case. To help ease the load on ambulance technicians, the province has been testing transferring non-urgent calls to 811 instead. It's a second triage, of sorts: if the call meets certain criteria, it's transferred to a nurse, who takes over and conducts a more in-depth evaluation on the patient then decides whether an ambulance is necessary. The main job of an ambulance technician is to save lives, says Dr. Élyse Berger Pelleter, who works for the Health Ministry. But with an aging population and a shortage of ambulance technicians in the province, the situation on the ground is far from ideal — putting a lot of pressure on emergency medical services. ""The objective is that ambulance workers respond to cardiac arrest, heart attacks — people who really need their skills,"" Berger Pelleter said. The Health Ministry wants to have the new system fully established provincewide by 2022. Berger Pelletier said she hopes eventually, people who call with non-urgent problems will get a doctor's appointment, if need be. ""The client is satisfied. It's efficient. Everyone is happy. That's where we're headed."" The pilot project is in its third year in four regions: Montreal, Laval, Chaudière-Appalaches and the Eastern Townships. The transferred calls are being handled by a dedicated team of Info-Santé nurses in Laval. The chief of service, Nancy Vachon, says the team is able to handle about 3,000 calls a month. In Montreal and Laval, 23,000 non-urgent calls were transferred to 811 between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. In 20 per cent of those cases — about 4,800 calls in all — the Info-Santé nurse determined there was no need for an ambulance. Officials expect the results to be less impressive in the two more rural regions, because residents living where there is less access to taxis or public transport are more likely to have an ambulance sent to them, Berger Pelletier said. Urgences-Santé, the emergency medical service that covers Montreal and Laval, gets up to 1,300 calls per day, said the agency's director, Vincent Brouillard. He said the pilot project is allowing the agency to respond to real emergencies, relieving the pressure on paramedics in general. It is having another effect, as well, he said: fewer ambulance transports mean there are fewer people in emergency rooms, so it is also easing overcrowding. Those experiencing non-urgent health issues can call 811 directly instead of 911. For non-urgent situations involving Montreal police, the general number is 514-280-2222, or you can call your local station directly.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/911-811-quebec-emergency-non-urgent-calls-1.5432985,[],N/A
415,Anonymous,2020-01-22T18:06:33.816Z,Bank of Canada holds interest rates steady ,"The Bank of Canada is staying the course on interest rates, holding the overnight rate steady at 1.75 per cent. The bank rate is two per cent and the deposit rate is 1.5 per cent. In a statement about the decision, the bank said ""the global economy is showing signs of stabilization, and some recent trade developments have been positive."" However, it also noted that geo-political issues have emerged ""with tragic consequences,"" referencing the crash of flight PS752 in Iran, which ended the lives of 57 Canadians and many others with ties to Canada. The bank said the Canadian economy has been strong but with mixed indicators since its last major update with October's Monetary Policy Report. ""The Bank now estimates growth of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2020. Exports fell in late 2019, and business investment appears to have weakened after a strong third quarter.""  While some of the slowdown late last year is being chalked up to a strike at CN Rail and an outage at the Keystone pipeline, the central bank says the weaker figures could also signal that global uncertainty is affecting Canada more than previously predicted. The picture the bank painted in its report Wednesday was a sharp contrast from its last look at the economy, when a degree of domestic resilience remained in spite of weaker data points outside Canada's borders. There is ""considerable uncertainty"" about how long household spending may stay soft, the report said, as households are expected to be more cautious with their spending decisions and save more in the face of high levels of debt — all this despite a federal tax cut that kicked in on Jan. 1 and growth in wages. James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics, said in a written statement that the rate decision was expected, but the dovish tone was not, indicating that ""the data could be signaling something more pernicious than its baseline forecasts assume."" Marple's statement said the bank's announcement was consistent with TD's expectations that there will be a 25 basis point cut in the overnight rate later this year.  ""A softening economic outlook alongside tighter financial conditions is a recipe for pushing the Canadian economy further below potential and weakening inflation, conditions the Bank of Canada will not ignore, as it made obvious today."" The report said ratification of the new North American free trade deal — a top priority for the Trudeau Liberals now that the U.S. and Mexico have completed their processes — and a partial trade detente between the United States and China should help stoke economic fires in Canada. Growth for 2021 is forecast at two per cent, up from the bank's October forecast of 1.8 per cent. The outlook for the economy could change if the Trump administration follows through on threats to slap tariffs on France, Brazil and Argentina.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-holds-interest-rates-steady-1.5435927,[],N/A
416,Anonymous,2020-01-23T18:18:49.758Z,Old Montreal residents fail to force referendum on condo tower they say doesn't fit with historic area,"Residents were unable to collect enough signatures to force a referendum on a controversial condominium tower planned for Old Montreal. Opponents of the project say the tower's sleek, modern design won't fit in against the backdrop of historic buildings that line the heritage streets around St-Paul West and McGill Streets. But it's not just the project's facade that bothers neighbours like Alexandre Fainberg. He says it's simply too tall. ""Most of these buildings, they have a limit on the height,"" he said Wednesday. Fainberg lives near the parking lot that's slated to become a nearly 44-metre building at its highest point with 89 units on 13 floors. While the lot is in a zone with a 25-metre height limit, it abuts a zone that allows for buildings that stand 45-metres. The Ville-Marie borough council gave the project a green light late last year. A zoning derogation was approved to allow the building to go beyond the lot's 25-metre limit.  Upset to learn the project — which has been stagnating in the planning stage for a number of years — was approved, residents in the area mobilized and enough petition signatures were collected to open a registry. From there, 179 signatures were needed to force a referendum on the zoning derogation. Only 115 signed. Now the final decision rests in the hands of the province's minister of culture, Nathalie Roy, who could block it for heritage reasons or call for a redesign. Fainberg said he hopes the minister steps in. He would like her to not only stop the project, but also shed light on what he says is a process that lacks transparency.  He's frustrated the condo tower has managed to clear the referendum hurdle unscathed, and he may be faced with years of construction headaches as the unwanted tower is built. He said allowing 13 floors to be built on the narrow strip of undeveloped land will block sunlight. He's also concerned that the project calls for 89 units but only about 45 parking spaces. ""We already have a hard time finding parking,"" he said. ""And we're adding a lot more people than the street can handle."" Amber Lomer, who also lives nearby, said she's mostly concerned about the height derogation and the design of the building as presented. She said it won't look right in the neighbourhood and instead belongs somewhere like downtown Toronto. ""That's not where we choose to live,"" she said. ""Where we choose to live is historic Old Montreal with its distinct style and charm."" Old Montreal has been a designated heritage area since 1964 and that's why the Ministry of Culture has the last word on the project, explained Dinu Bumbaru, the policy director for Héritage Montréal. There have been cases where the minister has rejected projects in the interest of heritage areas, he said. ""The ultimate architecture will have to receive the authorization of the minister because the minister doesn't deal with zoning issues, it deals with the heritage landscape of that place,"" he said. ""It's time for Montreal to rethink the way it plans development in heritage sites like Old Montreal.""

418,Wallis Snowdon,2020-01-23T18:09:26.560Z,"Fracking to blame for earthquakes, seismic 'clusters' in central Alberta","An earthquake that sent tremors through central Alberta last spring — rattling homes in Red Deer and temporarily knocking out power in parts of Sylvan Lake — was caused by fracking, an investigation by provincial regulators concludes. A report by researchers with the Alberta Geological Society and the Alberta Energy Regulator examined two earthquakes near Red Deer, one on March 19, 2018, and another on March 2, 2019. Investigators determined that nearby fracking operations triggered both earthquakes and also induced other ""small clusters"" of seismic events in the area with tremors up to a magnitude of 2.0.  Fracking or hydraulic fracturing is a way of extracting natural gas that involves injecting fluid into a well under high pressure to fracture the gas-bearing rock and release the gas inside. The practice has been linked to most large earthquakes in Alberta and B.C. interior in recent decades.  Some U.S. residents have sued oil and gas companies over injuries and damage to homes caused by fracking-induced earthquakes. Still, such earthquakes are rare and because they're a relatively recent phenomenon, they are little understood, prompting questions about why they arise in some places and not others. The 2018 earthquake was 3.13 in magnitude and the ""shaking from the event was felt by some,"" the study said.  The earthquake in 2019 was significantly stronger with a magnitude of 4.18. There were reports of property damage and the ""shaking from the event was felt by many,"" the report said.  The epicentre was located about 12 kilometres south of Sylvan Lake, where the seismic activity is typically dormant, researchers said.  ""Recent events were large enough to be felt by nearby residents in Red Deer, who were between four to 10 kilometres away,"" reads the report.  ""The observation of these events in a typically seismically quiescent region was suspicious, considering the recent development of the Duvernay East Shale Basin.""  The earthquake was reported to the Alberta Energy Regulator by Calgary-based oil and gas operator Vesta Energy.  At the time, the regulator ordered Vesta Energy Ltd. to suspend hydraulic fracturing operations at the site in order to protect the public and the environment. It also ordered the Calgary-based company to submit a report on recent seismic activity in the area and specific fracturing data for the well site. The regulator has also ordered Vesta to file a plan to eliminate or reduce future seismic activity from fracturing. The report suggests further investigation is needed on the operations causing the increase in seismic activity.  For instance, previous research found that earthquakes in the Cardston region in southern Alberta were related to fluid from nearby operations flowing into fault lines. ""At least 13 new clusters of induced earthquakes are recognized,"" the study said. ""Our next steps were to better understand why this region may be susceptible to these events through comparisons to other regions where geological proxies for seismogenic potential have been identified.""  The company's website said it operates in the Joffre Duvernay shale oil basin in central Alberta and had 84 producing wells on-stream last year. ""Vesta operates in areas with potential for seismicity, and continues to take the necessary precautions to ensure compliance with Alberta Energy Regulator,"" the company said Thursday in an emailed statement to CBC News. ""Vesta has sophisticated monitoring equipment placed throughout its operating perimeter to detect seismic activity, and works with the AER as needed to report any detections of seismic events in the area.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/earthquakes-red-deer-alberta-fracking-1.5437690,[],N/A

The plan builds on an earlier draft released in November after a previous plan by RendezVous LeBreton Group, a partnership between Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk and developer Trinity's John Ruddy, fell through.  The new plan divides the 29-hectare property just west of Ottawa's downtown into four distinct districts: The districts will be developed in phases, the NCC said. ""The plan is very clear,"" NCC board chair Marc Seaman said. ""But we also know as a board, we didn't want to necessarily have all of our eggs in one basket, so that's why we're progressing with this type of plan."" Seaman said a major event centre remains ""a key component"" of the plan. ""We have a perfect location for it,"" he said.  In a news release, NCC CEO Tobi Nussbaum called the master concept plan ""a vision and a guide for a site with a vital role in the future of Ottawa and Canada's Capital Region."" The NCC will soon launch a request for proposals for the Albert District, Nussbaum said Thursday. ""So in some ways you'll start seeing a rolling process with multiple stages of the procurement process being advanced."" More than 5,000 people took part in public consultations that led to the concept plan. In addition to a major entertainment venue, their priorities for the site included affordable housing, a grocery store and a farmers market, board members heard. People also want access to waterways via boardwalks, and possibly a skate park.  Mayor Jim Watson, who sits as a non-voting member on the NCC board, said he's pleased by the prospect of the 6,500 jobs the area is expected to generate once construction is complete.

420,Bryan Eneas,2020-01-23T21:43:52.948Z,Sask. government unveils new long-term waste management strategy,"Reducing organic waste is part of the Saskatchewan government's new strategy around waste management. Statistics Canada data from 2014 included with the plan, released on Thursday, says Saskatchewan generates the second highest amount of waste per capita, with each person creating about 60 regular-sized garbage bags worth of garbage per year. Information handed out at the media event in Regina on Thursday identified the improper disposal of organic waste, which leads to the creation of methane gas, as one of the biggest challenges the province faces.  As part of the new waste management strategy, the province is looking to create a composting guidance document and update all landfill and waste management guidance documents by April 2020.  Education and public buy-in are key parts of the new strategy.  ""In the past we've just kind of thought that in Saskatchewan, we have a large land base and not a lot of people, so you can just throw up a landfill anywhere you want,"" environment minister Dustin Duncan said.  ""Part of it is, in the educational process, just ensuring residents of Saskatchewan are aware that there is a cost to landfilling products that maybe could be diverted to a different route, a different process."" Duncan said the province is still in the research stage, but is looking at how other jurisdictions, like Manitoba, have introduced levies for landfill use. The province is also looking at implementing a landfill operator certification program. Duncan said the program would ensure the people operating landfills are certified to do so. He said the current version is a one day course.   The landfill operator certification program is expected to be implemented by 2025, according to the government's timeline. Duncan said the province is aiming to reduce the amount of solid waste going into landfills by 30 per cent by 2030 and by 50 per cent by 2040 through the new strategy. Richard ""Porky"" Porter, chair of the solid waste advisory committee, said two recurring themes emerged during discussions with stakeholders in the province: the creation of a set of guidelines and standards around waste management and the need for more education. Like Duncan, Porter said municipalities need to consider all costs associated with creating a landfill before doing so.  Porter said it might appear cheap on the surface to make a landfill, but other long term costs like the decommissioning of landfills needs to be considered beforehand.  He said for communities that can't put up the money for waste diversion tactics up front, collaboration becomes essential.  ""There's a shortage of money and there's a lot of landfills to be decommissioned through the province,"" Porter said. ""What I think they need to do is work together, collaborate, and I think there's a way of getting through it but for each community to go alone, it doesn't work.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/government-unveils-new-waste-management-strategy-1.5438205,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/saskatoon-compost-organics-garbage-city-hall-1.5066079 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/garbage-landfill-recycling-saskatoon-city-council-business-1.5425300,N/A

Winning medals in slopestyle and big air Saturday in Aspen, Colo., would push the Canadian snowboarder past American star Shaun White's 18 for the most earned by one athlete. McMorris isn't the only one poised to set a new X Games medal standard during White's hiatus from snowboarding to compete in skateboarding. Snowmobiler Joe Parsons of the U.S. and McMorris are even at 17 career medals. American snowboarder Jamie Anderson has 16. ""The honour of being the most decorated would mean a lot,"" McMorris told The Canadian Press. ""That would be really neat. Definitely a goal, but I'm not trying to lose sleep over it by any means. Still going to approach it the same as usual."" The 26-year-old from Regina traditionally shines in Aspen, which he describes as the Super Bowl of his sport. He's won seven of his eight X Games gold medals on Buttermilk Mountain. On his final run of the 2019 men's slopestyle final, McMorris vaulted from off the podium to gold with a score of 96. He followed that up with a silver medal in big air. WATCH | McMorris wins 2019 slopestyle gold: He'd had screws surgically removed from his leg just weeks earlier — a byproduct of a backcountry crash in 2017 that nearly killed him. ""I would definitely say that the atmosphere in Aspen helps bring out the best,"" McMorris said. ""The course is pretty much well-manicured from the first day you show up. ""There's a lot of things about it that really cater to my riding. Good energy, good vibes, lots of really rad people, only the best guys are here. There's lots of runs in practice. WATCH | McMorris snags big air silver: ""For the last years, I've been lucky enough to be on the podium, so I've always kind of had a bye right into the final. I don't need to stress. I can just kind of practise all week."" The two-time Olympic slopestyle bronze medallist is among 31 Canadians competing Thursday to Sunday in Aspen. Some of McMorris's toughest competition comes from within his own country. Reigning Olympic big air champ Sebastien Toutant of L'Assomption, Que., is hunting for his first X Games gold in the discipline. Toutant won slopestyle in Aspen in 2011. Winner of three straight big air crowns from 2016 to 2018 and slopestyle in 2014, Max Parrot returns to Aspen. The 25-year-old from Bromont, Que., did not compete there in 2019 while he underwent treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma. Canada's freestyle contingent includes reigning Olympic halfpipe champ Cassie Sharpe of Calgary, who competes in the event Saturday. Less than a year after flying into a tree in the B.C. backcountry and sustaining multiple serious injuries, McMorris won Olympic slopestyle bronze in 2018 behind silver medallist Parrot. ""I definitely feel that trauma that did happen in 2017,"" McMorris said. ""I'm probably going to be sore for a lot of my life. ""I've had to have a few different surgeries to take metal out of my knee, take some metal out of my jaw. ""I'm putting my body to the test all the time. I'm doing as much stretching and rehab as I can and trying to be responsible."" McMorris survived a concussion scare in December. He hit his head in a botched landing at a big air event in Atlanta. ""Kind of rocked my dome, but it ended up being a very minor concussion in that my symptoms were quite mild,"" he explained. Slopestyle scoring will be different in Aspen this year, McMorris said. ""It has most of us snowboarders' heads on a spin,"" he said. ""It's more like a flow-state jam format where you'll probably get up to five runs and it's overall impression. ""You definitely want to land two different style of runs, which definitely helps it not just be about the next guy doing some crazy extra flip. It's overall skill and a deep bag of tricks so to speak. ""It seems really hard to judge. I don't know how it's going to go, but I'm sure if I just ride really good, I can win. So that's what I'm going to try and do.""",https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/snowboard/mark-mcmorris-x-games-record-1.5436862,https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/snowboard/mcmorris-slopestyle-gold-x-games-1.4994571 https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/snowboard/mcmorris-slopestyle-silver-world-championships-1.5013575 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/max-parrot-snowboarding-comeback-1.5406244,N/A

Crowds of people swerve around him in the cavernous underground structure that links three metro lines, a university and the Montreal bus station. This is close to the spot where Kellough first arrived in Montreal from Calgary in 1998. He moved to become a poet. ""That was it. That was the plan,"" he says. Berri-UQAM Metro is where Kellough decided to start his walking tour of Montreal. ""Berri might not seem like the most interesting destination, but in fact, it is a fascinating place because it is an incredible nexus in the city,"" he says. When he first moved to Montreal, he learned about his new city by riding the metro and getting off at random stations. Since this station is a transit hub, he would often end up there alone, wandering through the crowds. ""When you move to a new place ... you have to disappear into it before you kind of re-emerge, forged in that new identity."" Kellough has now lived in Montreal for more than two decades. In that time, he's established himself in Montreal as a poet, novelist and musician. He's published three books of poetry and an experimental novel. His most recent collection of poetry, Magnetic Equator, was named one of the best of 2019 by CBC Books. In his novel Accordéon, he describes the experience of being a newcomer in Montreal. ""I see people who I know arrived in this city one month ago. I see them wandering the city that I know. And I know that they will have to try harder if they want to disappear."" For the next stop on his walk, he takes us two stops north to Mont-Royal Metro — ""to a neighborhood where I lived when I first moved to Montreal."" The station is in the Plateau, a neighborhood that's been a home to Montreal artists for over a century. Kellough emerges from the metro and wanders up a nearby residential street. ""It's freezing cold."" On either side of the road are the three-storey apartments with the long outdoor staircases that the neighborhood is known for. This was the type of apartment he was able to rent for a song in the late 1990s, when Montreal's economy was struggling. At the time he could rent a 1,200 square foot apartment for $500 a month — although what he didn't bargain for was how the thin apartment walls would bring him into contact with mundane rhythms of his neighbours. The kind of dense urban living found in the Plateau became an inspiration for his writing. ""You hear people's lives up close. You hear them through the walls of your apartment. It allows you to cultivate an insight and an empathy off the different rhythms of different people's lives."" Kellough walks through the Plateau until he stops at his final destination. In front of him is a poem etched into the side of a Plateau triplex. The poems' four stanzas tower above the street. ""I love it because its language is part of the fabric of the city."" The poem is called Tango de Montréal and it's by Gérald Godin, who was a renowned journalist and politician with the Parti Québécois. It begins by describing immigrants riding the metro early in the morning and how their energy helps keep the almost 400-year-old city of Montreal on its feet — or as the poem says in French, ""If the old heart of the city is still beating, it's thanks to them."" For Kellough, who moved to Montreal from English Canada and comes from a family that immigrated from South America, the poems reveals how newcomers renew the vitality of a city. ""It makes me reflect on what my contribution is ... to the society,"" the poem translates. ""Is it just waking up in the morning and taking the metro to work and labouring or is it writing your own presence into the society?""",https://www.cbc.ca/arts/take-a-walk-through-kaie-kellough-s-montreal-of-poetry-seditious-cafes-and-immigrant-vitality-1.5423277,https://www.cbc.ca/arts/inthemaking/walking-through-vancouver-with-legendary-public-artist-ken-lum-makes-you-see-the-city-with-new-eyes-1.5331138,N/A

Today, Chimiugak lives at an outpost on the Bering Sea called Toksook Bay. At 90, she is considered an elder, and she is about to become the most well-known woman in her tiny town: She will be the first person counted in the 2020 U.S. census, taken every 10 years to apportion representation in Congress and federal money. ""Elders that were before me, if they didn't die too early, I wouldn't have been the first person counted,"" Chimiugak said, speaking Yup'ik language of Yugtun, with family members serving as interpreters. ""Right now, they're considering me as an elder, and they're asking me questions I'm trying my best to give answers to, or to talk about what it means to be an elder."" The decennial U.S. census has started in rural Alaska, out of tradition and necessity, ever since the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867. The ground is still frozen, which allows easier access before the spring melt makes many areas inaccessible to travel and residents scatter to subsistence hunting and fishing grounds. The mail service is spotty in rural Alaska and the internet connectivity unreliable, which makes door-to-door surveying important. The rest of the nation, including more urban areas of Alaska, begin the census in mid-March. On Tuesday, Steven Dillingham, director of the census bureau, will conduct the first interview. Because of federal privacy laws, the bureau won't confirm Chimiugak will be the first person counted, even though it's the worst kept secret in her hometown. After the count, a celebration is planned at Nelson Island School. It will feature local Alaska Native dancers and traditional food, which could include seal, walrus, muskox and moose. Robert Pitka, tribal administrator for Nunakauyak Traditional Council, hopes the takeaway message for the rest of the nation is of Yup'ik pride. ""We are Yup'ik people and that the world will see that we are very strong in our culture and our traditions and that our Yup'ik language is very strong."" For Chimiugak, she has concerns about climate change and what it might do to future generations of subsistence hunters and fishers in the community, as well as the fish and animals. She plans to talk about it with others at the celebration. ""She's sad about the future,"" her eldest son Paul said. Chimiugak was born just after the start of the Great Depression in western Alaska, her daughter Katie Schwartz of Springfield, Missouri, said. Chimiugak was one of 10 siblings born to parents who lived a nomadic lifestyle and traveled with two or three other families that would migrate together, her son said. Chimiugak and her 101-year-old sister from Nightmute, Alaska, are still living. In 1947 Chimiugak married George Chimiugak, and they eventually settled in Toksook Bay after the town was founded in 1964 by residents of nearby Nightmute. There are five surviving children. George worked maintenance at the airport and she did janitorial work at the old medical clinic and babysat. Like other wives, she cleaned fish, tanned hides and rendered seal oil after her husband came home from fishing or hunting. Her husband died about 30 years ago. Chimiugak is also a woman of strong Catholic faith, and told her son that she saved his life by praying over him after he contracted polio. For hobbies, she weaves baskets from grass and remains a member of the Alaska Native dance group, which will perform Tuesday. Chimiugak will be dancing in her wheelchair. She taught children manners and responsibility and continued the oral tradition of telling them stories with a story knife. Chimiugak used a knife in the mud to illustrate her stories to school children. She drew figures for people or homes.

425,Travis Kingdon,2020-01-23T10:00:00.526Z,How P.E.I. could help with an increased demand for beef,"The Maritime Beef Council says demand for beef is going up, and P.E.I. might be able to help meet that demand. ""We're actually seeing increased demand for beef regionally, nationally and internationally as well,"" said Brad McCallum, with the Maritime Beef Council and managing director of the Nova Scotia Cattle Producers. But the number of cattle available in the Atlantic region has fallen from 63,700 in 2007 to 42,300 in 2016.   As far back as 2003, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, had a significant impact on the regional herd, McCallum said, and numbers haven't rebounded.  ""As we went through into the early- to mid-2010s we actually saw historically-high market prices,"" McCallum said. ""A lot of the industry participants at that time actually saw that as an opportunity to liquidate their herds and gain maximum value back out of their animals and their farms.""  Russ Mallard, president of Atlantic Beef Products, said that as producers retire, many haven't had a plan to keep their farm going, adding to the shortage of supply in the region.  Meanwhile, the company is expanding and needs more than 15,000 animals to fill the demand, Mallard said. That's a need of 300 per week. ""We know that we get every animal we can locally from the three Maritime provinces, and we find ourselves going to Quebec quite regularly.""   The cattle industry goes hand in hand with the potato industry on P.E.I., McCallum said.  ""Having a rotation within the potato crop allows for the production of grains and also allows for the production of forage, which can be then used to feed cattle,"" McCallum said, adding cattle also produce manure for farmers.  McCallum also said there is some unused capacity in feedlots. ""There are also some that would be sitting empty ... that could be brought back into production,"" McCallum said. ""There's a lot of infrastructure that already exists, it's about maximizing that infrastructure."" With Atlantic Beef Products — the major processor in the region — on P.E.I., McCallum said it makes logistical and financial sense for the animals to be shipped to feedlots here. In order to address the deficit, the beef council is working on educating producers to make them more efficient.  McCallum said he thinks that producers have a role to play in bringing stability to the market.  ""One of the big things that we want to see is producers being more engaged with themselves ... more engaged with the next person down the production chain and then ultimately with the processor and the consumer,"" he said.  ""It's all about knowing what that consumer wants and producing for their requirements and without knowing that, it's really hard to predict, it's really hard to know if you're going to be profitable."" Mallard said given the volatility of the industry, he thinks more of a guarantee, like those that exist in other markets, could help attract people to the industry. ""Price insurance — and that basically gives the producer an advance knowledge of what they'll get for their beef six months out,"" he said. ""And that involves a contract and securing beef futures and it's available pretty widely in Western Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-cows-needed-atlantic-products-1.5436510,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-dairy-farmers-feed-concerns-1.5353731 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-beef-company-certified-sustainable-1.5238512 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-acorn-sex-charges-1.5436241 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-school-bus-driver-charged-1.5435932,N/A
426,Hannah Thibedeau,2020-01-22T22:06:02.264Z,Businessman Rick Peterson is taking a second run at the Conservative leadership,"The Conservative leadership race is getting its first Western Canadian candidate: Edmonton-based venture capitalist Rick Peterson, who ran and lost to Andrew Scheer in 2017. CBC News has learned Peterson filed his papers with the party on Tuesday. His team is now collecting the 1,000 signatures from Conservative members he needs to enter the race by the Feb. 27 deadline. ""We cannot have a Conservative leadership race without a voice from the West,"" Peterson told CBC News. ""I am an outsider. I am not an MP but, on the other hand, I've got some business experience that we're looking forward to bringing to the table. And it's vital."" Peterson will formally announce his candidacy next week at High Arctic Energy Services, an oilfield services company near Edmonton. The choice of location is symbolic: Peterson is planting his flag as the party's western-based champion of the energy sector. ""The grassroots of the party are in Western Canada,"" he said. ""So the Conservative Party has to take a leadership role. And has to continue taking a leadership role on the resource file. ""And my candidacy from the heart of the resource sector, from Western Canada, will be a strong, bold platform of policy ideas, including the resource sector, in both official languages across the country."" Peterson said he'll also be pitching policies on carbon pricing for large emitters, digital privacy, deregulating the banking and telecom sectors, helping students with their loans and eliminating corporate income taxes. Peterson is fluently bilingual. He has family in Quebec and said that he and his team will devote a ""big part"" of the campaign to building support there. ""I have a grandson, he is Quebecois. Born a year ago and he's giving me one more reason to come back to Quebec on an ongoing basis. I can't wait to see him,"" he said. ""A big part of our campaign is going to be in Quebec. I was lucky to have lived in France for 10 years as a young man so my French is pretty good."" Peterson said he'd hoped to back Rona Ambrose's leadership bid. The former interim Conservative leader confirmed today that she's not running. ""We're in. We're all in. Once you launch, you can't back out,"" Peterson said. Peterson finished at the back of the pack in 2017 — 12th out of fourteen candidates, with just 0.7 per cent of the vote by the time he was eliminated. Peterson said he knows the current race could be a tough one for him as well, with party heavyweights like Peter MacKay, Marilyn Gladu, Pierre Pollievre and Erin O'Toole primed to run. ""They have the advantage of name recognition. They have an advantage of a network, I'm sure, across Canada,"" he said. ""I'm probably going to be the only candidate who has to meet a payroll, who's hiring and firing people, who's working in the private sector. So we all have our strengths, we all have our weaknesses. So I'm going to be highlighting the fact that I can understand the economy and jobs and making sure that the Conservative Party is at the forefront of creating jobs and employment in Canada.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rick-peterson-conservative-leadership-1.5436247,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rona-ambrose-conservative-leader-decision-1.5436775 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/derek-sloan-conservative-leadership-1.5436227 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-leadership-fee-1.5427808,N/A
427,Éric Grenier,2020-01-23T09:00:00.978Z,Quebec is up for grabs in the Conservative leadership race — and it's a prize worth grabbing,"Jean Charest is out — which means Quebec is wide open in the Conservative leadership race. And with every member's vote in the province likely to carry a disproportionate weight, it's a vacant playing field that every candidate will want to occupy. The roster of contestants for the Conservative leadership is far from final. But the list of names it won't include is getting longer. On Wednesday, former Conservative interim leader Rona Ambrose ruled herself out. In an interview with Radio-Canada on Tuesday, Charest — the former Quebec premier and leader of the Progressive Conservatives in the 1990s — said he would not mount a bid for the leadership. Charest likely would have had lots of appeal in Quebec, as well as the ability to sign up a significant number of new members there. But with Charest now ruling out a run, the race could end up with no candidate from Quebec among the top contenders. The two Conservative MPs with the highest profiles in Quebec — Alain Rayes, Andrew Scheer's Quebec lieutenant, and Gérard Deltell, a former journalist and the last leader of the Action Démocratique du Québec (before it dissolved itself into Premier François Legault's Coalition Avenir Québec) — already have ruled themselves out. Richard Décarie, a former deputy chief of staff to Stephen Harper, is working on a leadership bid as a social-conservative candidate. He's from Quebec — but the province's aversion to social conservatism will limit his appeal there. Pierre Lemieux and Brad Trost, two social conservative candidates, together took just nine per cent of the vote on the first ballot in Quebec in 2017's leadership race. So Quebec could be a political vacuum that the other candidates have to fill. They would be wise to try — because Quebec's party members offer a lot of bang for the buck. All 338 ridings across the country carry equal weight in the Conservative leadership vote. Each riding is worth 100 points, and those points are distributed according to each candidate's share of the vote. In other words, the candidate who wins 10 out of 20 votes in one riding ends up with the same amount of points as the candidate who landed 1,000 out of 2,000 votes in another riding. Ridings with lower numbers of party members offer candidates a chance to do a lot with a little. The last leadership race offered a good illustration. Nearly 29,000 Conservative members living in Alberta cast a ballot in 2017 — an average of 848 members in each of Alberta's 34 ridings. In Quebec, meanwhile, there were just 9,669 voting members spread out across the province's 78 ridings — an average of 124 members per district. Every vote in Alberta was worth an average of 0.12 points. Every vote in Quebec was worth 0.81 points — nearly seven times as much. Even these numbers were skewed by the regions of Quebec that had a higher concentration of members, such as the West Island of Montreal or runner-up Maxime Bernier's Beauce riding; Beauce alone was responsible for over 1,000 votes. The 34 ridings in Quebec with the fewest members delivered a total of 1,600 votes in the 2017 leadership race — an average of 48 per riding. Each vote cast in those seats was worth over two points apiece. He may or may not end up being the main beneficiary, but former cabinet minister Peter MacKay can take some credit for this voting system. It was one of the conditions of the merger that created the modern Conservative Party. MacKay, as leader of the Progressive Conservatives at the time, insisted on it — and he's defended it at party conventions ever since. If MacKay does emerge as the winner, strong results in Quebec could prove to be decisive. The former Nova Scotia MP might not have as much support in places like rural Ontario and in Western Canada — where there are lots of Conservative Party members and where the old Reform Party and Canadian Alliance had significant support. But it isn't clear yet which candidate is best positioned to become Quebec's top choice. A recent survey by Abacus Data suggests that every candidate still has some way to go. The poll, conducted Jan. 16-17 with a sample of 302 respondents in Quebec, found that 46 per cent of respondents there did not know enough about MacKay to have an opinion. That figure rose to 63 per cent for Ontario MP Pierre Poilievre and 72 per cent for both 2017's third-place finisher Erin O'Toole and fellow Ontario MP Marilyn Gladu. About 13 per cent of Quebecers said they had a positive impression of MacKay, compared to 11 per cent who had a negative one. That split was six to eight per cent for Poilievre and five to three per cent for O'Toole. Considering the small sample size, this suggests no one is likely to have the inside track in Quebec from the get-go. The endorsement of Quebec's 10 Conservative MPs will be highly coveted. They did appear to make a difference in 2017, with those of Rayes and Deltell being among the most valuable. Winning Quebec won't be important just for the contestants in this leadership race — it also will likely be a major factor in determining the eventual winner's chances of becoming the next prime minister. Conservative support in Quebec collapsed after Scheer's poor performance in the first of two French-language debates in October's federal election campaign, significantly reducing the party's chances of forming government. Conservative members motivated by a desire to avoid a third consecutive loss likely will be asking themselves which of the contenders can make the most gains in Quebec. Charest showed some promise on that score. The candidate Quebecers settle on as their next best option will have a leg-up on the competition.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservatives-quebec-1.5434633,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/jean-charest-bows-out-tory-leadership-1.5434981 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-conservative-paths-1.5433484,N/A
428,Ashley Moliere,2020-01-24T02:53:25.600Z,"ReRyde & Kater denied ride-hailing approval, shutting out some B.C. cities","Residents on Vancouver Island, in the Interior and in northern B.C. have been left in the cold after the Passenger Transportation Board (PTB)  rejected ride-hailing applications from companies wanting to operate in those regions, despite approving Uber and Lyft in the Lower Mainland and Whistler. The board announced its decision in a statement Thursday.  Applications from companies such as Kater Technologies Inc. and ReRyde Technologies Inc. were both turned down.  In its decision for ReRyde, the board said it had concerns with the company's business plan which currently has 3,700 drivers operating outside of the province. It said the company's current proposal for B.C. would ""undoubtedly"" require more drivers and vehicles to operate. It also said driver training consists only of a YouTube video which is customer service oriented. ReRyde's director of operations, Jamil Chaudhry, called the decision disappointing. ""There is so much misinformation,"" said Chaudhry, while adding the company only mentioned how many applications it has received, not the total number of drivers it has in its system. He also said the YouTube video was submitted as an example of how the company communicates and didn't show the whole training process.  Chaudhry said next steps include consulting with their legal department to make sure they have all the appropriate information and documents to reapply.  In a separate decision, the PTB said, based on Kater Technologies business plan and associated financial projections, it didn't believe the company was capable of carrying out the services it proposed.   Kater said in a statement it's very disappointed that a Vancouver company, which was locally developed to provide a much-needed service throughout the province, was not approved.  Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran also expressed disappointment with the decision to reject ride-hailing applications for companies that want to operate there. Basran said it's great news Uber and Lyft have been give the green light to start servicing the Lower Mainland and Whistler, but he's frustrated both companies didn't attempt to operate in other B.C. communities.  ""You don't know until you try and I would encourage those companies to try, because I do believe that the Okanagan would be a viable market,"" Basran said in a phone interview.  Both Uber and Lyft haven't applied to operate in other B.C. regions, saying the province's regulations have made it difficult to find enough qualified drivers.  Mayor Lisa Helps said it makes more sense for Uber and Lyft to explore the Metro Vancouver market before coming to Victoria. Help said the city has been in touch with Lyft and will continue to signal to all companies that ride-hailing is welcome in Victoria.  ""I think ride-sharing is one more option for mobility choice in our city and I think that's a good thing,"" Helps said.  The PTB has received a total of 29 applications to date. It said it's still in the process of reviewing pending applications and is working toward issuing further decisions on ride-hailing as soon as possible. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/reryde-kater-denied-no-ridehailing-in-some-bc-cities-1.5438298,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/uber-lyft-approved-bc-1.5437997 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/horgan-ride-hailing-1.5407556 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-labour-board-agrees-to-hear-local-union-s-challenge-of-uber-and-lyft-1.5399916,N/A
429,Anonymous,2020-01-23T15:21:46.948Z,New virus could trigger travel sector woes akin to damage from SARS in 2003,"A deadly new virus that emerged in China is raising concerns beyond the public health sphere as experts warn about the potential economic cost of a global outbreak that is already drawing comparisons to the deadly SARS epidemic 17 years ago. Transportation and tourism companies have seen declines in share prices amid travel warnings and restrictions from governments around the world hoping to avoid a repeat of the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which cost the Canadian economy an estimated $5.25 billion. At least 17 people have died and more than 500 have been infected by the ailment called novel coronavirus, whose early cases are linked to a market in Wuhan in central China. The World Health Organization postponed until Thursday a decision on whether to declare an international emergency over the outbreak of the flu-like illness, which can cause pneumonia and other severe respiratory symptoms, including one case in the United States. ""The cost to the global economy can be quite staggering, in negative GDP terms, if this outbreak reaches epidemic proportions as until this week, the market was underestimating the potential of the flu spreading,"" Stephen Innes, chief Asian strategist for AxiCorp, said in a report. The travel sector has already started to feel the hit as shares of four North American airlines that fly to China, including Air Canada, fell on Tuesday amid growing anxiety about the viral infection. None of the airlines fly directly to Wuhan, but their Chinese partner airlines do, and some passengers transfer from a Chinese carrier to a Canadian one, offering the potential for the virus to spread here. Shares at the three biggest U.S. cruise lines have also fallen, with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. — which boasts a major Chinese presence — dropping more than four per cent this week. Analyst Chris Murray of AltaCorp Capital pointed to the past for clues on the market volatility, propelled by ""an unknown level of potential disruption."" ""History suggests shares may be in for a rough ride,"" he said of airline and tourism stocks in a research note. He recalled jittery stock movements after the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, as well as with H1N1 influenza in 2009 and the Ebola virus in 2014. ""These larger-scale epidemics can have a more pronounced near-term impact. However, once a better understanding of the magnitude of the spread and severity was understood, stock prices recovered quite sharply in all three cases within months,"" he said. The extent of the epidemic so far still falls well short of the spread of SARS, a virus from the same family as coronavirus that spread from China to more than two dozen countries — including Canada. SARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide, killing close to 800, according to the World Health Organization. The disease sickened about 438 Canadian patients and caused 44 deaths in the Toronto area. SARS cost the country $5.25 billion and about 28,000 jobs, according to a 2014 report by Kai Ostwald, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs. The damage came in large part from fear-based shifts in consumer behaviour rather than higher medical expenditures, Ostwald said. ""Specifically, fear of contagion prompted widespread aversion behaviour, in which people significantly reduced activities that put them in close proximity with others. This included not only things like flying and eating in restaurants, but also activities like workplace and school attendance,"" he wrote. Hotels in the Greater Toronto Area, where the Canadian outbreak was centred, lost out on an estimated $39 million in revenues in April 2003 alone, according to the Canadian Tourism Commission. Less traffic through the city's Pearson airport spawned some $220 million in losses, according to the Conference Board of Canada. More than 800 bus tours were cancelled by the end of April — when the World Health Organization issued a one-week travel advisory for Toronto — with an economic loss of up to $6 million. Air Canada wouldn't speculate on the potential impact from coronavirus. In 2003 financial reports, it said passenger revenues decreased in part due to lower demand for travel resulting from the SARS crisis, particularly in the Pacific market that ""was severely adversely impacted with large reductions in traffic and capacity."" Chang Hoon Oh, a business professor at Simon Fraser University, warned against alarmist reactions to relatively small outbreaks. Canadian authorities are now more prepared for SARS-like viruses, he said. But he also noted that the number of annual visitors to Canada from China has shot up, growing by a factor of 10 since 2000 to 757,000 travellers in 2018, according to Statistics Canada. On Tuesday a U.S. citizen who had recently returned from China was diagnosed in the Seattle area, making the United States the sixth country to report a case, following China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. While the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, uncertainty over how deadly and transmittable the new virus may be has amplified concerns, especially on the cusp of the annual mass travel surrounding lunar New Year, which begins this week. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, says she immediately contacted her counterparts at the provincial level upon hearing of three potential cases of the new virus that were investigated and ruled out. ""They in turn have notified their front line in terms of their health system,"" Tam said on a call with reporters Monday. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer has said hospitals are already employing protocols established during the SARS epidemic in anticipation of possible cases. Canadians are at low risk of contracting the illness, Tam said. Other precautionary measures have been introduced by the Public Health Agency of Canada, including screening processes at airports in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal to identify passengers travelling from Wuhan for assessment by Canada Border Services Agency officers, including a possible temperature check. Tour operators are alert, but aren't battening down the hatches just yet.

He was reported missing to RCMP on Jan. 8. ""He's got a mom, he's got sisters that love him very much,"" Sandra Slater, Adam's mom, said Thursday.   Howard's family travelled to New Brunswick to help search for him. His mother, Sandra Slater, came from Las Vegas, NV; his sister, Amy Howard, came from Michigan; and his other sister, Christine Howard, travelled from London, Ont.    Together, the family drove from Ontario to New Brunswick during a snowstorm to look for Adam. They arrived in Moncton around 3:30 a.m. on Monday. Slater last spoke with him over the phone on Dec. 4, when he had asked for money, which she wired to him. On Dec. 31, the mother and son wished one another a happy New Year through text messages. On Jan. 3, she received a message from him that read, ""love you."" ""That's the last I heard from him."" Slater said her son is charming, polite and has a big heart. He's athletic and played soccer, football, hockey and lacrosse at different times in his life. Adam was working at Strict Union Tattoo and Piercing, a barber shop and tattoo parlour in Moncton, which closed around Christmas. Adam also spoke with his sister Christine over video chat a few days before he went missing. The two siblings talked about the holidays and how he was going to visit her in London this year. ""He seemed himself.""  Christine has been messaging Adam's friends on Facebook to see if they know anything about her brother. She has contacted 84 people since he went missing.  In a Facebook post earlier this month, Christine said her brother is a drug addict and people shouldn't try to scare him if they see him. After this story was published on Thursday, she modified her post to say her brother was a recovering addict, and she described him as ""completely approachable."" Adam's sister Amy is thankful for the support the family has received since arriving in Moncton.

432,Amy Smart,2020-01-22T23:52:17.825Z,B.C. human rights commissioner defends her support of hereditary chiefs who oppose LNG pipeline,"British Columbia's human rights commissioner is defending herself against accusations by Indigenous supporters of the liquefied natural gas industry that she didn't do her research before wading into a pipeline dispute.  Karasi Govender says in a statement that she ""unreservedly'' recognizes that some band councils along the Coastal GasLink pipeline route in northern B.C. have consented to the project.  But she says just as those bands have the right to give their consent, other Indigenous rights holders affected by the project have the right to withhold it.  From a human rights perspective, Govender says it's not a numbers game and each person's rights should be protected even if their position is unpopular. Coastal GasLink has signed agreements with all 20 elected First Nations councils along the 670-kilometre pipeline path, but the hereditary clan chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en Nation say the project has no authority without their consent.  The First Nations LNG Alliance issued an open letter this week to Govender saying she never consulted Indigenous groups that support the pipeline when she called for the free, prior and informed consent of all impacted Indigenous groups before any project impacts the land. CEO Karen Ogen-Toews says in the letter that it was disheartening to see that the Indigenous support, achieved through five years of consultation, was ""so easily dismissed.'' ""Human rights do not exist for the majority, they exist for each individual and in the case of free, prior, and informed consent for each Indigenous rights holding group,'' Govender says in her response. ""Indeed, human rights are the hardest to guarantee for those who find themselves in an unpopular minority, but this is when our commitment to human rights principles are truly tested.'' As commissioner, she says she takes no position on whether major natural resource projects should move forward, except in so far as they are required to uphold domestic and international human rights principles.  She calls for a peaceful resolution to the situation unfolding in Wet'suwet'en territories and says reconciliation and human rights must be the first consideration. The First Nations LNG Alliance also issued an open letter to the United Nations Committee to End Racial Discrimination critical of its calls to stop the pipeline project, the Site C hydroelectric dam construction and Trans Mountain pipeline project until the free, prior and informed consent of affected Indigenous groups is granted. ""The Alliance was shocked to see the committee issue its 'decision statement' concerning the Coastal GasLink pipeline without investigation or research, and without taking into account the extent of existing First Nation support for the pipeline, and without consultation with those Nations,'' the letter says.  No one from the committee was immediately available for comment but a former member said a working group spent several months studying the matter.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/human-rights-commissioner-indigenous-lng-1.5436954,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/12-arrested-in-victoria-during-occupation-of-provincial-government-offices-over-coastal-gaslink-pipeline-1.5436286 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/i-m-not-being-disrespectful-i-m-just-saying-be-realistic-horgan-defends-not-meeting-wet-suwet-en-chiefs-1.5433495,N/A
433,Jordan Gill,2020-01-24T10:48:21.217Z,Eviction notice served to Fredericton's tent city residents,"An eviction notice pinned on the tents of homeless people living behind the lieutenant-governor's home in Fredericton gave the residents until the end of the day Thursday to move out.   Residents in the so-called tent city along the walking trail between the St. John River and Government House were served an eviction notice signed by John Logan, the acting deputy minister of transportation and infrastructure. ""The tents located on this property have become a hazard to public safety,"" said Logan. But Dennis Robertson, who stayed in his tent during recent the recent bitter nights, had one simple question for the province: why now? ""You had a whole year to hand this out, or even start the eviction,"" said Robertson.  ""Why kick us while we're down?"" An emailed statement from the Department of Social Development said the choice to evict the residents from the tent city was made for their own safety. ""There is no heat or running water available at this site and given the extreme cold in recent days, we are encouraging these individuals to take advantage of the beds available at one of the three shelters in the city,"" said the department.  Warren Maddox, the executive director of Fredericton's Homeless Shelters, said both the men's and women's shelters have capacity. Joan Kingston, chair of the city's Community Action Group on Homelessness, said the out-of-the-cold shelter can house 25 people at once, but 40 different individuals have used the shelter at various times. The tents sprang up last May after a winter shelter closed. It has carried on through this winter, despite the creation of an emergency shelter again this year.  At least nine residents spent Thursday morning packing their belongings into totes provided for them. The Social Development Department said it has ""offered to provide storage space to the individuals who had been living in the tents to store their belongings until more permanent accommodations can be found."" Robertson said he has his own storage locker, but other residents aren't so lucky and are concerned they will never see their belongings again if they are given to the province. Residents gave different reasons for why they chose the tent city over shelters, but many, including Robertson, said the vibe of the out-of-the-cold shelter has changed from last year. ""There's been a little bit of favouritism, a lot more stealing, a lot more disrespect,"" said Robertson. Robertson said he plans on trying to set up a tent in another location and said he'll try to help as many people as he can. ""They're like family, better family than my own family,"" said Robertson.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-tent-city-eviction-1.5437699,[],N/A
434,Jorge Barrera,2020-01-23T18:32:00.589Z,"First Nations voices in support of Coastal GasLink project silenced by fear, says LNG Canada official","A senior corporate official with the joint venture behind an LNG terminal project that would eventually ship natural gas from the Coastal GasLink pipeline says First Nations people who support the project are being silenced by ""bullying and intimidation."" Susannah Pierce, director of corporate affairs for LNG Canada, the joint venture behind a planned LNG export terminal in Kitimat, B.C., said fear is keeping many First Nations people who are benefiting from the energy project from voicing their support.  Pierce penned an email to her friends and colleagues last Friday voicing her frustration with the tone of debate around the Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline that is facing opposition from the Wet'suwet'en nation's hereditary leadership. The email was posted on LNG Canada's website on Monday.  In the email, Pierce said she was ""shocked"" by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination's call last month to stop three major projects in Canada, including Coastal GasLink, until they get full buy-in from affected First Nations.  ""At the same time as the comments of the committee chairperson became known, I continued to hear about First Nations' members who fear speaking up in support of CGL as they are concerned about further retribution, bullying and intimidation,"" wrote Pierce. LNG Canada is a $40-billion joint venture to export natural gas from a terminal in Kitimat. Five companies from five countries created LNG Canada: Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi Corp., Petronas. PetroChina Co. and Korean Gas Corp. TC Energy Corp began the $6.2 billion Coastal GasLink pipeline project to connect to the LNG Canada terminal.  Tensions are again rising in northern British Columbia in the face of a court injunction against any continued physical obstruction of work on the Coastal GasLink pipeline. RCMP enforcement of an interim injunction last January at a fortified Wet'suwet'en checkpoint led to 14 arrests and there are growing fears of a repeat police operation.  ""What I am worried about is people being afraid to speak of the things they want because of the bullying and intimidation online,"" said Pierce, in an interview with CBC News.  Pierce said she wrote the email as a way to express personal support for First Nations people who back the project but fear speaking out.   ""There are people on the other side of that Internet and there are people … working in the field and there are people who are trying to make a living,"" said Pierce.  ""I want people to feel I understand that. I know what they are going through. I know that puts me out there. I am also trying to say I will stand there with you .... I am here to support you and you are not alone."" Crystal Smith, the elected chief councillor for the Haisla nation, whose territory includes the site for the LNG Canada terminal, said she's been barraged by personal attacks through social media calling her a ""colonizer"" and for supporting the oppression of her people.  Smith, whose nation has agreements with LNG Canada and Coastal GasLink, said the personal attacks began in force following the RCMP action in neighbouring Wet'suwet'en nation territory last year.  ""I see personal comments directed at myself, referred to as a colonizer and supporting suppressors of our people,"" said Smith.  ""Our nation has received a huge backlash in the last year in terms of our support of the project and being referred to as a sell-out."" Smith said she's also received gutter-level attacks accusing her of ""having affairs with CEO's of companies."" Smith shared one message with CBC News she received over Facebook messenger last January. ""You're an apple and a sellout,"" said the message, referring to the slur where someone is accused of being Indigenous on the outside and white on the inside.  ""This is colonization. You are stepping away from reconciliation and turning it to assimilation."" Smith said her nation struggled with the decision to support the natural gas project and it created tensions within the community and within families. In the end, she said the nation decided that it was in their best interest to support it.  ""I truly feel passionate and I truly feel that what we are doing is the right thing as a nation,"" said Smith.  ""For too many centuries our First Nation communities haven't had a solution as to how we are going to end the poverty and the suicide rates, not having hope for the future and staying with the status quo,"" she said.  ""Whether you are elected or hereditary, we have a responsibility to our people to improve the quality of life for our members, regardless of where they reside...and I believe the solution is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our people."" Karla Tait, who is director of clinical services at a healing centre at the Unist'ot'en camp which is part of the Wet'suwet'en nation opposition to the project, said it's the government that is creating the tensions.  ""It's also evident the province is fuelling and sponsoring what I would call factions to make it seem like there is disagreement among the rightful title holders on these lands,"" said Tait. Tait said the issue is not about economic development. ""This is a rights and title issue and if rights and title are respected here, it's going to benefit all First Nations."" Freda Huson, who is a spokesperson for the Unist'ot'en camp, said the issue is also about the authority of hereditary chiefs.  Huson said the federal and provincial governments, along with the pipeline company, are the ones who have created the divide within the Wet'suwet'en nation by ignoring the authority of hereditary chiefs.  ""Where are the documents that the hereditary chiefs gave up their responsibility for their lands to band councils? Do they have that? Does it show our hereditary chiefs signed a treaty giving that responsibility to the province or the federal government,"" said Huson in an interview with CBC News. ""These are the two entities that created the divide. We are not fighting our own people.""  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-lng-canada-1.5436837,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/wet-suwet-en-coastal-gaslink-bc-supreme-court-1.5414131 https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/gidimten-wetsuweten-unistoten-rcmp-injunction-1.4971999 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/coastal-gaslink-pipeline-indigenous-human-rights-1.5435854 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/human-rights-commissioner-indigenous-lng-1.5436954,N/A

The University of Edinburgh study is called 'VIKING II.'  People with at least two grandparents born in the Orkney or Shetland areas are being asked to join a genetic study. The two are small archipelagos and islands to the far north of Scotland and the United Kingdom.  The study is aimed at improving medical treatments and understanding the causes of some conditions, such as: diabetes, stroke, heart disease and cancer.  ""We hope in the long term, this will bring us a better understanding which is the basis of new approaches to treat or prevent disease,"" lead researcher, Professor Jim Wilson said in a release.  The university is reaching out to people in Saskatchewan because of the number of people with Northern Isles family histories that are living in the province, the release said.  ""The unique genetic identity of those with Northern Isles ancestry offers a rare opportunity to give a detailed picture on how genes are implicated in health,"" the release said.  Researchers are also hoping to talk to people in places like Chicago and Dunedin, N.Z.  The university is hoping about 4,000 people take part in the study. People interested in taking part can go to: www.ed.ac.uk/viking. Anyone taking part will be asked to fill out an online questionnaire about health and lifestyle and complete a saliva sample kit — which will be analyzed by researchers, including genetic sequencing.  The study is a joint project between the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen.  ""Better understanding the genetics of the Northern Isles will lead to better health care in the long run, both directly to the islanders but also worldwide,"" said Professor Zosia Miedzybrodzka with the University of Aberdeen. ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-research-study-scottish-islands-1.5438828,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-friday-edition-1.4852183/scottish-map-law-bans-putting-shetland-in-a-box-to-the-delight-of-fed-up-islanders-1.4852189 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/quirks/quirks-quarks-for-apr-9-2016-1.3526978/stone-age-humans-imported-deer-to-remote-scottish-islands-1.3527177,N/A

Métis Nation president says national council isn't doing enough for provincial groups,"The national council that represents members of the Métis Nation says a resolution signed by three provincial Métis organizations, which calls for changes to the national body, is ignoring the real issue of Métis citizenship. The presidents of the Métis Nation-Saskatchewan, the Métis Nation of Alberta and the Métis Nation of Ontario met earlier this month to sign a resolution that called for more transparency from the national council. The three groups said they planned to establish a working group to discuss possible reforms to the national council or creation of a new structure. The resolution also asks the federal government to negotiate directly with the provincial bodies on issues of self-government, rather than through the national council. Métis Nation-Saskatchewan President Glen McCallum says the national council isn't doing enough for the provincial groups. ""What has [MNC President Clément Chartier] done to be able to engage with the five provinces?"" McCallum said, referring to the five groups that are supposed to give the national council its mandate: the Métis Nations of Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C, and the Manitoba Metis Federation. ""When was the last time you called a meeting to be able to have five governing bodies sit at the table and give you direction as to what you need to do?"" The national council says the presidents of the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario groups signed the resolution without the support of their members, and that the leaders are improperly attempting to give Métis citizenship to people in Ontario. ""In their release they have completely avoided direct discussion of the real issue of Ontario citizenship,"" the national council said in Jan. 20 press release, which it said it was issuing ""to clarify the issues and defend the descendants of the historic Métis Nation."" ""The Métis Nation is a distinct Indigenous people in Western Canada. We have always determined who our citizens are,"" the council says. In 2002, a policy called the Métis National Definition was adopted by national council members ""to ensure the Métis Nation has objectively verifiable standards and processes to identify our citizens,"" the release says.  ""By not following the Métis National Definition, Ontario is, wrongfully, purporting to grant Métis Nation citizenship to people living in eastern Ontario who are not part of the Métis Nation."" McCallum, though, says the provincial resolution is not about the national definition. ""We passed a national resolution to be able to go with what we feel is right in regards to our citizenship,"" he said. ""And that's what we follow.

438,Belle Puri,2020-01-24T11:00:00.268Z,Number of trials postponed in B.C. Supreme Court hit all-time high in 2019,"Romika Reddy​​​​​​'s attempt to get a better settlement from ICBC has hit a snag in B.C. Supreme Court due to too many cases like hers and too few judges to hear them.  Last year, a record 140 B.C. Supreme Court trials across the province were postponed compared to only 33 the year before. The majority of them were ICBC cases.  In October, when Reddy and her lawyer showed up at court — among a horde of others also there to fight ICBC — the 25-year-old's trial was adjourned until June, at the earliest.  ""I'm having a really hard time for a long time and then thinking it's going to be over but then it's not. It's very discouraging,"" said Reddy, who hasn't been able to work since the crash due to lingering pain from soft tissue injuries.  In July 2016, while driving home from work, Reddy's Nissan Sentra was T-boned on the driver's side by a pickup truck near the intersection of 64th Avenue and 120th Street in Surrey.  ICBC, she says, offered her $55,000 to settle the claim but Reddy opted to hire a lawyer and go to court for a better deal. Now she has no idea when her case will be heard or when she might be compensated for her injuries and losses.  In the three and a half years since the crash, Reddy has been forced to live with her mother and a younger sister at her mother's Surrey home.  It's discouraging, she says, because she should be working to become independent and not be a burden on her family.  At most, Reddy says she can manage a couple of hours at a time working as a receptionist at a local seniors home before her back pain becomes too much.  ""It's just not realistic to live off a couple hundred bucks for a month or two,"" Reddy said.  Her mother Anita Reddy says, ""not having judges is a lame excuse.""  The B.C. Supreme Court is currently seven judges short of its legislated complement of 90.  Reddy says her daughter's case wouldn't be tied up in court waiting for a new trial date if ICBC offered fair settlements.  The Trial Lawyers Association of B.C. says the combination of ""unreasonable ICBC settlement offers"" and too few judges to hear cases causes due process to grind to a halt.  Most of the blame for delays though lies with ICBC, says association president John Rice, who maintains that over the past year the insurance corporation has implemented a ""strategy"" to make low offers.   ""It puts injured British Columbians in a really crummy position,"" Rice said. People are forced to decide whether to take the offer because they are financially desperate, or go to trial, he says.  Recent ICBC offers have pushed more cases to trial and put a strain on the legal system, Rice added.  ""We need more judicial appointments, but that won't come close to fixing this problem with the scope of cases being pushed to trial by ICBC,"" he said.  ICBC says last year, 99.4 per cent of all accident claims were settled without going to trial. Spokesperson Brent Shearer says only 0.6 per cent of cases actually went before a judge.  On the other hand, from March 2017 to December 2019, Shearer said the monetary demands made by lawyers increased by nearly 40 per cent.  ""We're paying 25 per cent more in settlements than three years ago and it's still not enough,"" Shearer said.  It's estimated more than half a billion dollars was paid last year in legal fees to plaintiff law firms by ICBC. The cost of injury claims is a primary reason insurance rates increase every year, according to Shearer.  Romika Reddy isn't happy with ICBC or the court system.  ICBC offers, she says, need to be more realistic and the federal government needs to appoint more justices.  ""At the end of the day, it's people's lives they're completely changing over something that's not their fault,"" Reddy said.  CBC Vancouver's Impact Team investigates and reports on stories that impact people in their local community and strives to hold individuals, institutions and organizations to account. If you have a story for us, email impact@cbc.ca.  ",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-supreme-court-postponed-trials-1.5438150,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-judge-shortage-1.4529542 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/trial-lawyers-icbc-constitutional-challenge-1.5079209 https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/icbc-claims-court-dumpster-lawsuits-1.4513217,N/A
439,Jason Vermes,2020-01-22T20:52:11.132Z,"As St. John's area returns to normal, small business owners are feeling the pinch after days of closures","Five days after a blizzard hammered the Northeast Avalon, prompting states of emergency in St. John's and surrounding communities, businesses in the region — and their employees — are starting to feel the pressure of nearly a week without work. Amanda Skinner, owner of Mount Pearl comic book shop Heroes and Hobbies, says she's worried about her future if customers aren't able to start coming into the store. ""Being only open for two years, there is no profit there yet. I mean, I don't get paid. I don't get a paycheque or anything like that,"" she said. ""Not only do I have the bills here for the shop, I have bills at home."" With many businesses still closed under a state of emergency, workers are beginning to feel the pinch. Hourly workers in particular have wondered whether they will be compensated for shifts cancelled as a result of the storm. Despite a hodgepodge of government programs to support workers, Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour president Mary Shortall says there is little available for employees during crises like last week's blizzard. When it comes to a program like employment insurance, ""[workers] apply once they get laid off. There's paperwork, there's waiting lists, they have to have so many hours accumulated,"" Shortall said. ""Something like that probably wouldn't be a very easy fix for someone who's lost four or five days and immediately needs it."" For sole proprietors like Skinner, support can't come soon enough.  ""This is going to affect small businesses all over for much longer than what we anticipated,"" she said. At his Mount Pearl garage, Auto Care owner Jerome Terry says business has been slow to pick up since he reopened yesterday after a two-day closure. On average, the garage takes in 10 to 12 cars each day, he says. On Tuesday, he saw only two. ""I think I gathered an hour's labour out of all,"" he said, adding that Wednesday was much the same. He says it comes down to car owners simply being unable to get to him. With a state of emergency still in effect in St. John's, many of his customers can't drive to the garage. Though he's confident his shop will weather the storm, he's also anticipating a bit of a downturn.  He wants the government to step in and offer financial supports, like tax breaks or subsidies, to help local businesses get back on their feet after the storm. Despite the loss of revenue, however, he says his shop's three employees won't be out of pocket for the work they lost — but Terry will be shouldering the cost from a personal account.  ""I'm going to use a line of credit — take money from my line of credit — and deposit it to the bank and write the boys their cheques,"" he said. Hobby shop owner Skinner says she hopes government relief funds will be made available, but she's hesitant. ""There's not really a whole lot for sole proprietorships,"" Skinner said. ""If we get sick, we don't get sick benefits.… We work around the clock 24/7 and there's no EI there. There's no anything."" In the meantime, she says residents have been encouraging others on social media to visit local businesses hit hard by the storm once roads are clear. Next month, Heroes and Hobbies will be marking its second year in business. Skinner hopes she'll be there celebrating. ""I hope it'll pick up again for the next year,"" she said.

440,Janyce McGregor,2020-01-23T18:45:47.678Z,Economic ministers miss caucus meetings to attend Davos forum,"As the Liberal caucus meets on Parliament Hill Thursday to plot strategy for the return of the House of Commons, three ministers with economic portfolios are attending events at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, instead. Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains paired up with Ajay Banga, the CEO of Mastercard, Thursday morning to announce a new centre focused on global intelligence and cybersecurity in Vancouver. Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Minister Mary Ng are also attending events in Davos through Friday. Bains' office said the government's collaboration with Mastercard started with a conversation at Davos last year.  The federal government's Strategic Innovation Fund, which to date has contributed over $2 billion to companies that line up with government objectives, is contributing $49 million to the Mastercard facility. The new project is expected to support 380 full-time and 100 co-op student jobs and ""raise Canada's stature as a leader in cybersecurity,"" a news release from Bains' department said. The new centre is a ten-year investment that will focus on creating technologies and standards to reduce the risk that personal and financial information could be stolen, the release said. Mastercard's research will be done in collaboration with universities, businesses and the public sector. ""There's no doubt that Mastercard was open to the idea because of the fact that the government was willing to be a partner, but also because of the world-class talent that we have,"" Bains told reporters on a conference call from Davos. ""They're aware of the fact that we have a really strong rule of law and that we're also looking forward to advancing a digital charter. ""That's the pitch that we've been making. That's why I've come here to Davos to meet with ... international companies, to look for global investments that will create more jobs and more opportunities for Canadians."" On Thursday morning, Morneau joined finance ministers from France and Turkey and academics from the London School of Economics and Harvard's Kennedy School for a panel discussion called ""Shaping the Global Growth Agenda."" Morneau told the forum that Canada's ability to manage its debt levels has given the federal government room to invest in public infrastructure and individuals, through things like child benefit payments. ""Our fiscal track is a responsible one, leaving us with significant firepower if those geopolitical risks, these trade tensions that we see, cause problems that might not be evident today but could be evident tomorrow,"" he said. ""We are in a good position to be resilient in Canada."" Morneau said forums like the G20 have a role to play in ensuring that there's fairness in societies. He cited the digital tax his French counterpart on the panel has been trying to implement — in the face of American resistance — to ensure that multinational tech companies that profit from their activities in France are also taxed in France. The Liberal election platform proposed a similar tax. ""If our people don't feel like there's a fairness to the system, then they don't want to be actively engaged in [economic] growth,"" Morneau said. Over 50 heads of state — including U.S. President Donald Trump, who gave a keynote speech Tuesday — business leaders, celebrities, and activists like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg are part of this year's forum in the Swiss resort town, which is inaccessible to the public during the event without an invitation from the WEF. Quebec Premier François Legault is among those in Davos taking meetings this week. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last attended in 2018. The theme of this year's forum is ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World."" Organizers are working toward an updated ""Davos Manifesto 2020"", which is meant to serve as a scorecard for governments and corporations to measure their progress balancing ""inclusive economic growth"" and environmental protection.  One of the issues confronting leaders at this year's gathering was the effective collapse of the World Trade Organization's appellate body last month, thanks to the U.S.'s ongoing refusal to agree to the appointment of any more adjudicators to replace those whose terms have now expired and can no longer hear appeals in international trade disputes.  While other work to mediate disagreements and disputes between countries continues at the WTO, it's now without its final arbitration body, leaving many of the most contentious cases in limbo, including Canada's ongoing dispute with the U.S. over softwood lumber duties. Appearing with the WTO's Director General Roberta Azevedo Wednesday, Trump said talks would be held in Washington ""sometime maybe next week or the week after"" on how to address American concerns that the multilateral trading system isn't working properly, particularly when it comes to China's membership in the organization — concerns which in some cases began even before the Trump administration took office. Trump told a news conference that ""we're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" without making clear what he had in mind. The head of the WTO does not typically negotiate bilaterally with specific members, as it's designed for consensus decision making between members, not top-down direction. Even if the U.S. were to suddenly agree to start appointing members again, the appellate body is now without a budget and it could take a long time to re-establish. It would need a half-dozen adjudicators to return to full bench strength, as only one member's term has not expired. (Cases cannot be heard without at least three adjudicators, hence the system's breakdown.)  Ng's itinerary in Davos is focused on WTO reform, including talks with her ministerial counterparts as other countries figure out how to respond and adapt to the U.S.–China trade war. She's hosting a working dinner for the Ottawa Group, a collection of ministers from a dozen other WTO members representing diverse geographic regions, trade blocs and levels of economic development that first convened in Ottawa in 2018 under her predecessor, Jim Carr. Canada and the European Union have established an alternative way of arbitrating trade disputes between them on an interim basis while the appellate body is paralyzed, something Ng said is important for Canadian businesses engaged in international trade. ""I really think that the EU–Canada agreement serves as a model that other countries might be interested in looking at so I will be I will be doing that work while I'm here at Davos,"" she told CBC News on her way to the forum Wednesday, without being specific about which countries might be interested in signing on. Ng's Davos itinerary also includes a meeting of the Cairns Group — WTO members who are major agricultural exporters and find common cause in breaking down barriers to trade in agricultural products. Canada is hosting a reception in Davos Thursday evening to showcase companies that want to expand in global markets.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ministers-thursday-davos-1.5437266,https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-canada-poloz-1.5436058 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/davos-digital-tax-wednesday-1.5436372 https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-liberal-caucus-retreat-parliament-1.5437299 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bank-of-canada-holds-interest-rates-steady-1.5435927 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/economy-north-america-1.5367819 https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trump-threatens-big-tariffs-car-imports-eu-davos-1.5435764 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/canada-urges-u-s-to-save-wto-from-chaos-1.5369843,N/A

""This is a 'who would've thought it' moment. Here we have a coin of the realm, a five-pound coin in fact, made by The Royal Mint, in the customary fashion,"" said Queen lead guitarist Brian May in a video clip, holding a one ounce silver proof coin. ""On one side we have The Queen [Elizabeth], on the other side we have Queen. This never happened before,"" he said. All British coins and banknotes bear the head of the monarch. The coin, released on Monday, features the band's logo and instruments played by the Queen members: the Bechstein grand piano played by Freddie Mercury for Bohemian Rhapsody, May's Red Special guitar, Roger Taylor's Ludwig bass drum with an early-day Queen crest and John Deacon's Fender Precision Bass. The coin's designer Chris Facey also paid tribute to Bohemian Rhapsody, the band's most celebrated hit, with the keys of the piano on the coin pressed down for the opening notes of the song, The Royal Mint said in a press release. The commemorative coin is available in gold and silver proof, with prices varying from £13 (about $22) for a £5 Brilliant uncirculated coin to £2,020 (about $3,400) for the one-ounce gold proof coin.

442,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:20:36.259Z,"Air bag woes force Honda, Toyota to recall 6M vehicles","Two different air bag glitches have forced Toyota and Honda to recall over six million vehicles worldwide, and both problems present different dangers to motorists. The Toyota recall affects about 3.4 million vehicles globally and is being done because the air bags may not inflate in a crash. The cars have air bag control computers made by ZF-TRW that are vulnerable to electrical interference and may not signal the bags to inflate. The problem could affect as many as 12.3 million vehicles in the U.S. made by six companies. It's possible that as many as eight people were killed when air bags didn't inflate. U.S. safety regulators are investigating. Honda's recall covers about 2.7 million vehicles in the U.S. and Canada with Takata air bag inflators. But they're a different version than the ones blamed for 25 deaths worldwide. Still, it's possible the air bags could blow apart a metal canister and hurl shrapnel at drivers and passengers. Both recalls were announced on Tuesday. In a statement, Toyota said the computer may not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can happen in crashes, such as when the vehicle runs under a different vehicle. The problem can cause incomplete opening of the air bags, or they may not open at all. Devices that prepare seat belts for a collision also may not work. In most cases Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control computer and a wiring harness. But in some vehicles dealers will inspect the computer to determine if it needs the filter. Owners will be notified by mid-March. The recall covers certain 2011-19 Corollas, the 2011 to 2013 Matrix, the 2012 through 2018 Avalon and the 2013 to 2018 Avalon Hybrid in the U.S. Toyota wouldn't say if it will offer loaner cars to people who fear their air bags might not protect them. A spokeswoman suggested that owners call its customer hotline to discuss their issue at (800) 333-4331. In March of 2017, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating problems with ZF-TRW air bag computers. The probe was expanded in April of last year to 12.3 million vehicles made by Toyota, Honda, Kia, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Fiat Chrysler from the 2010 through 2019 model years. Toyota joins Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler in issuing recalls for the problem. Four deaths that may have been caused by the problem were reported in Hyundai-Kia vehicles and three in Fiat Chrysler automobiles. The investigation was upgraded after investigators found two serious crashes involving 2018 and 2019 Toyota Corollas in which the air bags did not inflate. One person was killed. Toyota said it's cooperating in the probe, which is continuing. NHTSA is evaluation how susceptible the air bag control units are to electrical signals as well as other factors that could stop air bags from inflating. In documents, the agency said that it didn't find any other cases of electrical interference in Hyundai, Kia or Fiat Chrysler vehicles that used the ZF-TRW system but were not recalled. The Honda recall, also announced Friday, covers certain Honda and Acura vehicles from the 1996 to 2003 model years. Honda vehicles included are the 1998 to 2000 Accord Coupe and Sedan, the 1996 to 2000 Civic coupe and sedan, the 1997 to 2001 CR-V, the 1998 to 2001 Odyssey and the 1997 and 1998 EV Plus. Acura vehicles covered are the 1997 and 1998 2.2CL, the 1997 to 1999 3.0CL, the 1998 and 1999 2.3CL, the 2001 and 2002 3.2CL, the 2001 and 2002 MDX, the 1998 to 2003 3.5RL, and the 1999 to 2001 3.2TL. The front driver's inflators being recalled are part of a recall announced by Takata in November covering at least 1.4 million vehicles from five automakers. Honda said it's recalling a larger number of vehicles to make sure it gets all of the bad inflators. In this case, the inflators don't contain ammonium nitrate, which is blamed for previous Takata problems that have killed 25 people and injured hundreds worldwide. But three of the newly recalled inflators exploded and hurled shrapnel, two in Japan and one in Texas that injured a driver, Honda said in a statement. The company said in all three cases, the inflators were exposed to excessive moisture. In Texas, the car had a salvage title with a date that coincided with a major flood, while the two cases in Japan were in salvage yards where the windows are typically left open, the company said. ""Honda believes that the risk of improper air bag deployment in its vehicles remains very low at this time, but we cannot absolutely guarantee the performance of any recalled part,"" the company said in a statement. Owners will be notified in mid-March, but replacement parts won't be available for another year, Honda said. Asked about loaner cars, a Honda spokesman said customer concerns will be addressed on a case-by-case basis.

443,Max Fawcett,2020-01-22T12:00:00.485Z,OPINION | Defeating Jason Kenney will require a progressive merger,"This column is an opinion from Max Fawcett, a freelance writer and the former editor of Alberta Oil magazine. Jason Kenney, it turns out, is not invincible.  After two years of bending the political universe to his will, that universe started to fight back in 2019. His much ballyhooed ""war room"" keeps finding new and exciting ways to shoot itself in the foot, small business confidence is faltering, and the cuts to health and education spending (and yes, they are cuts) have yet to really bite. An October poll showed support for the UCP dropping from 56 per cent to 44 per cent, with 21 per cent of the people who voted for the UCP in April expressing dissatisfaction with its performance. ""If this persists and these voters feel as though they were misled, it impacts trust and makes them awfully difficult to win back,"" ThinkHQ Public Affairs president Marc Henry told the Edmonton Journal. ""They thought there'd be a light at the end of the tunnel, but all they're seeing is more tunnel."" But if Mr. Kenney's progressive opponents are going to defeat him at the polls in the next election, they can't sit around and wait for his government to continue making mistakes. Instead, they'll have to do what Kenney did in the run-up to the last election: put aside their partisan differences and unite behind a single banner. That will mean someone putting an end to the Alberta Liberal Party, whose brand is only slightly less toxic in Alberta right now than the Communist Party of Canada's. The party's current leader, David Khan, finished fourth in his own riding of Calgary-Mountainview in 2019 (one that used to be a reliable Liberal stronghold), while the party itself received just 18,546 votes provincewide, less than one per cent of the popular vote. ""I don't know how much lower they could go,"" says Duane Bratt, a political science professor at Mount Royal University. ""Even in the 1980s, when they had zero seats, they didn't get one per cent of the vote."" The Alberta Party, meanwhile, doesn't seem to know what it stands for — or, right now, if anyone's willing to stand for it. And while the brand itself might have once had value, the fact that it's spent two elections trying to find itself has almost surely diminished that value in the minds of voters. With no leader, and no real excitement around finding someone to replace Stephen Mandel, it's fair to assume that 2019's performance could be its high-water mark. ""I actually feel bad for the Alberta Party,"" Bratt says, ""because they made huge strides in 2019. They ran candidates in every riding, they increased their fundraising, they participated in the leaders debate and they took their popular vote from two or three per cent to nine per cent. But the absence of that one seat makes a world of difference."" It's probably tempting to think that the banner progressives should be uniting behind is the orange one, since that's essentially what happened in both 2015 and 2019. But even so, the NDP wouldn't have been able to form government in 2015 without the split on the right between the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta and the Wildrose Party. Without that split in play, and with a four-year track record as a government that happens to coincide with a collapse in oil and gas prices, the NDP brand may not be in much better shape than the Liberal one. The fact that many Albertans blame the NDP for an economic downturn that was driven by huge changes in global oil and gas markets is neither fair nor rational, but nobody ever said politics was either of those things. After all, Donald Trump is president of the United States. That's why Alberta needs a new progressive alliance, one that can offer a home to everyone who doesn't support the current government's policies and personalities. And while a rebrand might seem to some New Democrats like an admission of defeat, it's often the shortest path to power. In addition to the UCP, there's the B.C. Liberal Party, which was effectively taken over by Social Credit members after their government was drubbed by the NDP in the 1991 provincial election. The B.C. Liberals would go on to govern for most of the 21st century before they were defeated in 2017 — and even then, they won the popular vote and the most seats. In Saskatchewan, meanwhile, the Progressive Conservative Party emerged from the ashes of the scandal-ridden Grant Devine era in 1997 as the Saskatchewan Party — and eventually formed government in 2007.  The Alberta NDP was far more scandal-proof in office than either of those two parties, but it still faces the same branding challenge that Alberta Liberals have struggled with for decades. And like those Liberals, that's less a result of anything they've done than the behaviour of their federal cousins. For example, the NDP held its national convention in Edmonton in 2016, and used the opportunity to undercut the only provincial NDP government in the country at the time. In an interview with the CBC's Peter Mansbridge, then-leader Tom Mulcair said he'd support a policy to keep Canada's oil in the ground if members passed it — a statement that only confirmed the suspicions many Albertans still had about the provincial NDP's attitude toward the oil and gas industry. Jagmeet Singh, the leader who replaced Mulcair, has been even more antagonistic toward Alberta's energy sector, pledging repeatedly (and impotently) to block the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline. If the NDP brand and its association with federal leaders and policies is a bit of an albatross, though, its leader surely isn't. Rachel Notley remains a hugely popular politician in Alberta, one whose appeal and reach vastly exceeds that of her party. In the run-up to the last election, Notley consistently polled higher than the NDP itself — often by double-digits. And it's that popularity, particularly within the party, that makes political strategist Stephen Carter think she could be the one to convince them to take the kind of leap they'll almost certainly need in order to win the next election: a full break with the federal party and the birth of a new political vehicle in its place. ""I think the Alberta Democrats could be something that would be phenomenal,"" he says. Carter isn't convinced that there needs to be a formal merger between the various progressive parties in Alberta. ""The population won't split. If the population really wants to defeat Kenney, they will choose one horse and ride it to the finish line."" But, he says, they'll be far more likely to saddle up with a party that doesn't have any pre-existing baggage. And ironically, he thinks part of that baggage is the NDP's conspicuous swing to the centre when it was in government. ""I think they were a very responsible government, in terms of what they actually did. But they didn't give anybody any real reason to love them. You're not going to get anywhere by relaxing the craft brewing laws. They needed to do something more significant — that actually impacted regular human beings."" More importantly, he says, if the Alberta Democratic Party is to succeed, it would need to be willing to allow new voices at the decision-making tables: ""You never grow a political movement without reaching outside."" He remembers being approached to run the leadership campaign of Alison Redford and agreeing, provided a certain individual wasn't involved. That individual had the same condition for their own participation, but eventually the two met and realized they worked well together. ""If I'd been successful in my small-mindedness,"" Carter says, ""I never would have had that power and strength that comes from working with someone who mildly disagrees with you — or in some cases even moderately disagrees with you, and pushes you to a new position that is better and stronger. I would argue that was the problem with the NDP, and that remains the problem with the NDP."" Another problem is the temptation to believe that what happened in 2015 could happen again in 2023 — namely, a split of the conservative vote. But betting on a breakup of Jason Kenney's conservative coalition might be even more foolish than expecting him to lose outright, according to Duane Bratt. ""There are some early indications of splits within the UCP, but he's just such a force of nature, and a force of will, that he's got his hands over that,"" Bratt says. That means that if progressives want to win the next election, they'll have to put aside their misgivings and tribal loyalties and find a way to work together. That will require Alberta Liberals to finally let their beleaguered brand die. It will mean formalizing a divorce between Alberta's New Democrats and their federal cousins. And it will force the Alberta Party's members and donors to give up on their own new brand and endorse an even newer one. The alternative, of course, is a re-elected UCP government. Time will tell which option Alberta's progressives find more unpalatable.  This column is an opinion.

445,Steve Silva,2020-01-24T15:34:55.425Z,Entire Yukon Quest rules committee resigned after disagreement about racer's penalty,"All six people on the Yukon Quest rules committee resigned last year after the event's board decided against their recommendation to disqualify a racer whose dog team tested positive for a drug, CBC News has learned. ""I just felt that they didn't have the respect for the rules committee that they needed to,"" said Karen Ramstead, former chair of the committee, adding that the board didn't communicate its logic well enough. The racer in question was Brian Wilmshurst. ""The drug present was norketamine, a metabolite of ketamine — a schedule III controlled drug,"" reads a four-page letter, dated June 21, that the committee sent to the presidents of the event's Alaska board and Yukon board, which form a joint board. Ramstead said the committee recommended that Wilmshurst be disqualified and not get any prize money. There were no other recommended sanctions, and he would be free to race in the event again, she added. The board fined him $3,262.10 US, which was also the amount he won for finishing the race in 13th place. Wilmshurst was ""abIe to 'buy himself out of' a positive drug test by paying back his winnings,"" reads the letter. John Dixon is the president of the board of Yukon Quest International Limited, based in Alaska. He described its recommendation for disqualification as ""too severe."" He said he believes the drug ended up in the dog's bloodstream unintentionally through tainted meat. ""We looked at, sort of, the commonality in the past of finding these drugs in horse meat. A lot of times these drugs were used to euthanize horses that are then fed to dogs, so we believe that it wound up in the dog's bloodstream that way,"" Dixon said. CBC attempted to contact Wilmhurst for this story, but did not hear back. In the letter, the committee said it was concerned that this situation could happen again — not to any specific racers — and, if the organization allowed it, possibly result in a legal challenge. ""We were also not only dealing with the individual situation before us but having to be aware of the precedent we were setting for the organization as well,"" Ramstead said. The committee's letter referenced part of one of the Yukon Quest's rules: ""Fines or penalties levied for violations of this rule shall be based on the seriousness of the offense and will be assessed after completion of the race. The Rules Committee will be responsible for assessing these penalties."" Dixon said the rules committee has an advisory role. ""Basically, there's some leeway there in what we can do in a situation where we have a positive drug test,"" he said regarding the rules. The board takes a case-by-case approach, Dixon added. Banned substances being found in dogs in sled-dog races in the region is ""rare,"" and he said he could only think of two other incidents, including one in a different race, in recent years. Shayna Hammer, executive director of the Yukon Quest International Association (Canada), said on Tuesday that there's an acting rules committee in place.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-rules-committee-resigned-1.5438687,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-quest-sisters-races-1.5435216,N/A

Food banks were unable to open until they were given the green light on Wednesday. Some people were in dire need, having gone without food for several days. ""Vulnerable people are struggling out there and we just want to be here to meet the needs as they come to us,"" said Maj. Rene Loveless of the Salvation Army. By Thursday afternoon, things were slowing down, which Loveless said was ""good news.""

Loveless said they hope to serve a hot meal to as many people as possible. CBC News also visited Bridges to Hope on Thursday, shortly after manager Jody Williams opened the food bank for the first time since the storm. There had been no access to the building since the day before the storm, making Williams anxious as he sat home during the state of emergency. ""Our clients, generally, their cupboards are never fully stocked so I don't know how they got through,"" he said. Williams said many privileged people around the city lived through what his clients live with permanently — no heat, no internet, and no idea where their next meal would come from. ""A lot of us experienced for the first time what I would call major food insecurity,"" he said. ""That's the norm here at the food bank."" Williams said he expects to go through a few weeks' worth of products in the next few days, as the city returns to normal and people can get out of their houses. The regular Bridges to Hope volunteers weren't able to get to the building on Thursday, so Williams put the call out to anyone who could walk to their Cookstown Road headquarters to help out. He was met with a mix of locals and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary officers who came together to get the food out to people in need. Meanwhile, Facebook groups set up during the storm to help people have led to an influx of donations for Bridges to Hope. People from all over the world have been in touch, prompting Williams to put a button on the website asking people to ""Help us help others during this time of crisis."" Clicking the button provides financial donation options for the centre, which Williams said will be able to food donations next week.

447,Jesse Johnston,2020-01-23T11:00:00.438Z,Former bookkeeper accused of stealing $400K from B.C. company,"The owner of a Surrey, B.C., business who claims he was defrauded of more than $400,000 is suing one of his former employees and his bank, according to a notice of civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court. In the lawsuit, L-M Equipment Co. owner Rick Weihs alleges that Maria Smith made dozens of transfers from the company's Royal Bank of Canada account to her personal account between February 2016 and May 2018. He says the alleged thefts almost sunk the business that he bought from his father in 1996. ""We could have had 27 very well-paying jobs that could have gone down the tubes,"" Weihs said. ""For a little while there, it was pretty tough."" The lawsuit claims that in her position as bookkeeper, Smith had control of the company's bank account, which allowed her to make several transactions — ranging from $824 to $27,800 — without being detected. None of the allegations against Smith or RBC have been proven in court and Smith has yet to file a response. CBC News was unable to contact Smith, who is also facing criminal charges of fraud over $5,000 and theft over $5,000. Weihs first suspected something was wrong in May of 2018 when he noticed a double payment to one of his suppliers. When he looked into the matter, Weihs found the name of the supplier didn't match the bank account the money was transferred to, according to the lawsuit. Instead of going to the supplier, Weihs alleges the funds went to Smith's personal RBC account. ""I just about fell off my chair,"" he said. ""It was shocking."" When Weihs brought in an accountant to investigate, they discovered $410,972.29 in fraudulent transactions, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges Smith would mask the L-M Equipment Co.'s transfers to her personal account by listing the payee on the transaction as a company that Weihs frequently did business with. Smith is also accused of linking her personal account to false company names and previous employees' payroll files that she reactivated. Smith made 96 fraudulent transactions using those methods, according to the lawsuit. Weihs's lawyer argues that RBC should have security measures to ensure the name of the payee matches the payee's account number. He accuses RBC of negligence and breach of contract, which the bank denies. In its response to the claim, RBC says Weihs should have had a procedure in place to detect fraudulent activity within his company. RBC also says that L-M Equipment put Maria Smith in a position of trust without investigating her character. ""The plaintiff failed to have in place any appropriate safeguard policies and procedures within its accounting system to prevent employees including Maria Smith from committing fraud,"" RBC argued. The lawsuit claims that in June of 2018, Smith agreed to pay back all the money that was taken from the company, plus expenses, which added up to $450,000. Weihs says he received two lump sum payments totalling $44,647.98, as outlined in the payment agreement. He alleges, however, that Smith hasn't made any of the monthly payments that were agreed to. Vancouver-based technology writer Graham Williams recommends that companies use financial management computer programs or bring in a third party to review documents. ""Even if you do have a bookkeeper looking over things, having a second set of eyes who may understand how those systems work, would probably be helpful,"" he said. ""It may have caught something like this.""

448,Anonymous,2020-01-22T01:18:38.451Z,Quebec to comply with ruling that struck down assisted death provisions ,"The Quebec government will comply with a court ruling striking down parts of its medical aid in dying legislation, the province's health and justice ministers announced Tuesday. The province will allow a provision stating those seeking a medically assisted death must be ""at the end of life'' to simply disappear from its legislation, the ministers said, without making any further amendments to the proposed law. The decision means more people will qualify for a medically assisted death, Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said, reminding reporters that patients will still have to meet the law's five other criteria to qualify. ""They have a choice,'' McCann said. ""That's the spirit in which we made the decision — the self-determination that a human being who has met all those five criteria ... will have a choice.'' Last September, Quebec Superior Court Justice Christine Baudouin invalidated the ""reasonably foreseeable natural death'' requirement of the Criminal Code and a section the Quebec law that states people must ""be at the end of life,'' which prevented access to medical assistance in dying for some. The case was brought by two Quebec residents — Nicole Gladu and Jean Truchon — who did not meet the criteria and had their requests for assisted death turned down by doctors. Both suffer from incurable degenerative diseases, and lawyers argued the condition that a person's natural death be ''reasonably foreseeable'' before they can receive medical assistance in dying was overly strict. Gladu suffers from post-polio syndrome and medication no longer helps alleviate her pain, the court heard. Doctors gave her about two to three years to live due to her pulmonary condition. Truchon has cerebral palsy. Three of his four limbs were not functional at birth, and he just lost the use of the fourth, but he could continue to live for many more years. The two launched a legal action against the federal and provincial governments, claiming their right to life, liberty and security — guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms — was infringed. Baudouin suspended the application of her judgment until March 11 to give federal and provincial legislators six months to modify the laws, while granting exemptions to Gladu and Truchon to seek medical aid in dying during this period if they satisfied other legal conditions. Neither the federal or provincial governments appealed the decision, although the federal government has not yet announced exactly what it intends to do. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the government accepts the Quebec court's ruling and will amend the federal law accordingly. The government launched public consultations on the issue. Quebec Justice Minister Sonia LeBel said her federal counterpart, David Lametti, is expected to brief provincial ministers this week in Victoria, B.C. ""Theoretically, as long as the federal criteria exists, it applies, so it's in effect until March 12,'' LeBel said, adding it's unclear if the federal government will seek an extension. The chair of the commission that oversees end-of-life care in the province is confident that despite the change in wording, there won't be a flood of people lining up for medical assistance in dying. ""The commission is not afraid that on March 12, the demand will increase tremendously,'' said Dr. Michel Bureau said. ""That's not what we believe.'' But LeBel said the time was right for Quebec to make its announcement, noting the province is about to embark on consultations to broaden the criteria on Jan. 27. ""We've taken our decision so it was the time to announce it,'' LeBel said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-comply-assisted-death-provisions-1.5435567,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/medical-assistance-in-death-report-1.5377890,N/A
449,Zulekha Nathoo,2020-01-18T23:09:29.618Z,"Prince Harry and Meghan will give up royal titles, public funding","Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will no longer be working members of the Royal Family and will, therefore, no longer use their royal titles or taxpayer money, according to a statement from Buckingham Palace released Saturday. ""As agreed in this new arrangement, they understand that they are required to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments,"" the statement reads. ""They will no longer receive public funds for Royal duties."" The changes will take place in the spring. The decision follows weeks of uncertainty and hastily called family meetings after the couple announced they would be stepping back from their senior roles within the Royal Family and spending more time in North America. In a surprising Instagram message posted at the beginning of 2020, the pair called the move ""a progressive new role within this institution"" and expressed a desire to become financially independent. In line with that objective, the Sussexes intend to repay costs for the controversial refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, according to Saturday's palace statement. It will remain the couple's U.K. residence. The historic home, which is located just south of Windsor Castle and offers more privacy, was the subject of scrutiny last year. Media reports revealed renovations to the building — which cost an estimated £2.4 million ($4 million Cdn)  — were coming from the Sovereign Grant, the monarchy's taxpayer-funded account for official expenses. Q&A | Watch as royal commentator Katie Nicholl discusses Harry and Meghan coming to Canada: Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, spent their Christmas holidays in B.C. and are planning to live in Canada part time. The couple has battled intense media attention since their relationship became public in 2016. The coverage has continued after the birth of their son, Archie. In a British documentary released last year after becoming parents, Markle didn't hide the fact that living under a microscope was a struggle and has taken a toll on her mental health. ""It's a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,"" she told ITV reporter Tom Bradby. It remains unclear whether the Canadian government will cover security costs for the couple. Buckingham Palace won't comment on details of those arrangements, but says there are ""well established independent processes to determine the need for publicly-funded security."" In an unusually personal message added to the Palace statement, the Queen said she is ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" ""I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life,"" said the Queen. ""It is my whole family's hope that today's agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.""

450,Anonymous,2020-01-24T00:09:06.971Z,UN court orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya from atrocities,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Thursday ordered Myanmar to take urgent measures to protect its Muslim Rohingya population from persecution and atrocities, and preserve evidence of alleged crimes against them. Mostly Muslim Gambia launched a lawsuit in November at the United Nations' highest body for disputes between states, accusing Myanmar of genocide against Rohingya. Thursday's ruling dealt only with Gambia's request for so-called preliminary measures, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. While the court's final decision could take years to reach, the 17-judge panel made clear in a unanimous ruling that the court believes the Rohingya are in danger now, and steps must be taken to protect them. The Rohingya remain ""at serious risk of genocide,"" presiding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf said, reading a summary the decision. Myanmar shall ""take all measures within its power to prevent all acts"" prohibited under the 1948 Genocide Convention, the ruling said. Myanmar must report back within four months. It ordered the government of Myanmar to exercise influence over its military and other armed groups to prevent ""killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to the members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life intended to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part."" More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017, and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. UN investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent."" Moments before the court in The Hague began reading its ruling, the Financial Times published an article by Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi in which she said war crimes may have been committed against Rohingya Muslims but that refugees had exaggerated the abuses against them. During a week of hearings last month, Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, had asked the judges to drop the case. The court's rulings are final and without appeal, although it has no real way of enforcing them. However, Rohingya activists, who had come from all over the world to the Hague, reacted with joy to the unanimous ruling which also explicitly recognized their ethnic minority as a protected group under the Genocide Convention. WATCH | UN court orders Myanmar to prevent genocide against Rohingya Muslims ""That is something we have been fighting for a long time: to be recognized as humans the same as everyone else,"" said Yasmin Ullah, a Canada-based Rohingya activist. Myanmar's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement late on Thursday it ""takes note"" of the decision. ""The unsubstantiated condemnation of Myanmar by some human rights actors has presented a distorted picture of the situation in Rakhine and affected Myanmar's bilateral relations with several countries,"" it added. ""The court is of the opinion that the Rohingya in Myanmar remain extremely vulnerable,"" said Yusuf, the presiding judge. ""Moreover, the court is of the opinion that the steps which claimed to have taken to facilitate the return of Rohingya refugees present in Bangladesh, to promote ethnic reconciliation, peace and stability in Rakhine State, and to make its military accountable for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, do not appear sufficient."" More than 100 Myanmar civil society groups published a statement saying they hoped international justice efforts would ""bring forth the truth"" and end impunity. ""Political and military policies have always been imposed with violent force and intimidation upon the people of Myanmar, systematically and institutionally, on the basis of their political and religious beliefs and ethnic identities and continue until the present,"" the statement said. ""We understand very clearly that the ICJ case against Myanmar is directed toward those responsible for using political power and military might, and not to the people of Myanmar.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/world-court-myanmar-protect-rohingya-genocide-1.5437258,https://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/myanmar-the-rohingya-people-and-genocide-inside-the-international-court-of-justice-1.5434687 https://www.cbc.ca/radio/frontburner/fall-from-grace-aung-san-suu-kyi-defends-myanmar-against-genocide-charge-1.5390129 https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/schabas-myanmar-hague-1.5395370,N/A
